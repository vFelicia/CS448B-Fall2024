hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our person program using classes now if you don't know what you're looking at right now you may want to move back a couple couple tutorials to um the introduction to classes and that is when we get started on this program uh if you don't want to then uh that's fine you can just go ahead and try to figure out what's going on so if you remember last time we um set the weight money and income label we set that text uh to whatever the person's weight money and income is and then we added the uh button eat click event so they will eat 5 lounds of food and they will gain um 5 lbs and then it updates their current weight so now let's go ahead and do this for each of the uh other um buttons so we'll type my person. work and the arguments of this is hours as double so let's say he just works 8 hours now we need to update the um the label so label weight I mean label um money. text equals current money and we'll go ahead and add my person.get money and we'll convert that to a string and you can see that if we go ahead and run this we get an if we click work our money goes up to $158 because $725 time 8 is $58 and each time we work we get more money and now we can eat and gain five pounds each time so now let's go ahead and do this for the increased income and the exercise so we go ahead and click on exercise and we'll type my person. exercise and the arguments for this is time as double so let's just say exercise uh 1 and 1 half hours and we'll type label weight dot text and we'll set that equal to current weight and we'll go ahead and add my person.get weight and then we'll go ahead and convert that to a string and we'll do that one more time for The increased income so we'll go ahead and type my person do increase income and the arguments for this is amount as double so let's just pay him $25 more per hour and we'll type label income. text equals current income and then we'll go ahead and add my person.get income and then we'll convert that to a string so now if we run this let's go ahead and have our person eat some and get pretty fat let's say uh we want them to be 193 lb now if they exercise an hour and a half it's going to go down to 1928 5 192.5 and if they just keep exercising they're going to lose weight now let's have our person work so they're making $58 um per per8 hour time period now and if we increase their income you can see that their income goes up to $9.75 cents per hour and they're making more money per hour now this may not be noticeable um at first glance but let's say I bump up their current income to $42 an hour you can see their current money will go up all the way up to 768 so we can keep exercising we can keep eating and getting fatter and then exercising trying to get that off um so now now let's come down here and so we don't have to type the um all of this out on one uh line let's go ahead and make a sub that will update the text so we'll just do private sub update income and what I just realized is we don't have to add current income right here we can just add my person.get income so it's not resetting this whole thing each time so we'll just type uh label income. text plus equals my person. get income and then we'll convert that to a string so it takes what's already in there and um it will add their income or wait never mind that's going to add more lines of their income so we'll just set it equal to current income and then we'll add uh my person my person.get income and I'll do this for each one of them so private sub update weight and let's come up here to the weight so label weight. text TT we'll copy that and we'll come down here and paste that in so we'll do it one more time for update um income or not income let's do update money so we'll go ahead and type private sub update money and we'll go ahead and find our money here so label money. text equals current money uh plus my person.get money. twring and we will paste that down in here okay so now let's go ahead we can minimize out of each of these Subs because we're not going to make any changes to them and let's go ahead and just type update money right here and let's do update weight right here and in down here we will update the income and up here we will update the weight okay so now let's go ahead and run this and it should work just the same as it did last time but now we have uh easier to use code and we can just call subs and um which makes it a lot easier to write our code and make it go faster so we can eat and gain weight and then we can exercise and lose that weight we can work to make more money and then we can get promoted to uh make a higher income so go ahead and uh if you haven't typed this code in go ahead and do that you can even add I encourage you to add text Fields so that you can get values to um exercise or to work or to um update the income so that it's not a default value uh and then once you've done that and once you understand what we're doing I'll go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
