the directions say write the equivalent for each measurement well when you say equivalent you mean what does two feet in inches so we're basically converting yards or feet into inches so here we go we have 2 feet here and we know that 1 foot equals 12 in so you just add 12 and 12 together 2 and 2 is 4 1 and one is two so that's easy enough 24 in so we have 5 and 1/2 ft so we're going to have to take five of those 12 1 2 3 4 five and then a half of foot we know is half of 12 which is six adding six so 2 4 6 8 10 + 6 is 16 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 so we know that is 66 in now we're get into 3T and 7 in well 3T is just 12 * 3 so we have 12 12 12 12 12 oh let's actually subtract some of these twelves okay 3 feet so 3 12 plus 7 in so 2 4 6 6 and 7 is 13 and we have 1 2 3 4 that's 43 in now 1 and 1/3 yard so we know that one yard is 36 in that's easy enough so we take the 36 in and we add 1/3 yards it's pretty easy because a whole yard imagine a whole yard divided into three parts and each of these parts is one foot so and each of these foot is 12 in so that's easy enough so we take one yard which is 36 and then 1/3 only one of these so that is 12 in 6 7 8 3 and + 1 is 4 that's 48 in so you have 6 fet simple enough we have 12 12 12 12 12 12 using addition only 3 4 6 8 10 12 carry the one bring down the two 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 that is 72 in so now we have 2 yards 1T and 3 in so we know T yards one yard is 36 so let's put down two of them 36 and 36 one foot we know is 12 in and 3 in using only addition 6 and 6 is 12 13 14 15 16 17 carry the one bring down the seven 3 and 3 is 6 78 and that would be 87 in there you go that's how you convert from yards to feet to inches
