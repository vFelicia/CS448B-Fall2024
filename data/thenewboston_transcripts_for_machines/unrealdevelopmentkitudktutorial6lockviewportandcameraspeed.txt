does anyone actually watch these videos for workout tips I highly doubt it so yeah I'm just going to go ahead all right guys welcome back to your sixth udk tutorial and in this tutorial as promised I'm going to be finishing up these viewport buttons what they do and how we can use them so the first thing I want to talk to you guys about is this lock viewport button now let me go ahead and show you guys this using an example if I switch over to one of these War for otes and select one of these let me go ahead and select this dome right here whenever I select one of these objects in any of viewports and I hit home watch what happens to all these other viewports when I hit home it's going to go ahead and snap to that object this one now shows the Dome this one now shows the Dome this one now shows the Dome so let me go ahead and take one of these and move it around say you know I'm working in this side view which is the top left and I want to you know I want to concentrate on this right here and I'm going to be working with another model down here but I want to keep this side view concentrated on this thing whatever the heck it is I don't even want to say what it looks like but anytime I want to lock this view into place I'm going to go ahead and lock this viewport now check it out anytime uh you know we move around we're working yada yada uh this is nice doing a little bit of this a little bit of that say we want to work on uh this object right here we're going to go ahead and hit home and all those other viewports are going to snap to this object except this one where we locked so basically locking a viewport does exactly like well it's pretty selfexplanatory it takes a view and it locks into place and allows you to work with models in different views while keeping that same view selfexplanatory right so now with that being said let me switch over to LIT mode and let me go ahead and this is kind of a nice view for up here actually now let me talk to you guys about camera speed and that's this button right here again I know I'm skipping these but level streaming and Pro postprocess volume prevus are different topics we're not even anywhere near uh that advanced topic yet so let me talk to you guys about camera speed camera movement speed is this little container I guess it's a container of water again this real time and the icon for camera movement speed I don't know who's designing the icons for these but it's like I think this is their first job and probably their last because they make no sense to me so this jug of water basically goes from empty to all the way full and when it's all the way full your camera is moving fastest so for example you see where my camera is right now say for example I wanted to work on this Dome so I needed to move my camera over there so go ahead hold down your left button and scroll up okay okay scroll up and scroll up you know what it's going to take like an hour and a half for me to get over to this Dome so what I want to do is I want to increase the camera speed now check it out whenever I'm whoa I got over there in like half a second so that's basically what camera speed allows you to do if we go ahead and have our jug of water empty whenever we scroll our Mouse moves really slow and our camera is moving really slow but whenever we have this all the way to the top it moves really fast I usually like to keep it somewhere either there or there like halfway or 3/4 full and by the way answer this is the glass half full or half empty H I'll let you decide but right here it's definitely all the way full so that's what camera movement does and the last thing I want to talk to you guys about is probably the easiest thing and that's Tera floating copy it basically well just click it and you're going to see what happens basically takes this window or View and it tears It Off in the new window again there's nothing else even to explain in that that's all it does and uh you know that's all I have to say about that I guess that's all I have to say about that that's my Force Gump impression pretty bad Forest Gump impression but well there it is so anyways uh there you go that's all I have to cover for this uh whatever the heck it's called Uh viewport toolbar and again these things I didn't cover yet we're going to be covering those just I got to teach you guys some techniques before we you know jump into level streaming and stuff like that so now that we have that covered we're ready to move on to our next topic what it is I don't know yet because I don't have a tutorial outline but trust me whatever it is it's going to be awesome so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys in next video
