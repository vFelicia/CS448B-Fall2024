so let's just run through this to make sure you understand we've got a public function constructs we've got a constructor here which is reading in some arguments from when we initiate our class then what we're doing is we're checking to see if this Connect function returns a true value and we haven't done anything with the connect method sorry yet but when we do if it returns a false value we're going to say connection failed otherwise if it returns a a true value we're going to say connected to DB host so what we could say is again we could say if this connect DB host DB username DB password so if this equals true basically because we don't have this exclamation mark here as our not saying is it not true so let's just test this out let's return true automatically in this connect function so when we cool the connect function or the connect method here and here we're automatically returning true so therefore we're going to say connected to and it's going to successfully work so at the moment if we refresh our page you'll see that there's nothing on there because we need to create a new instance of this connect this database Connect class so connection equals database connect and remember we need to supply it with three arguments which is the host the username and the password so this actually at the moment isn't using the MySQL connect function to see if it's worked on our we're just supplying through three arguments and then we automatically going to return connected to local host because we're automatically returning true on this connect method so let's refresh you can see oh no database connect oh sorry okay so I've put connection equals database connect we need connection equals new database Connect because now what PHP thinks I'm doing here is it thinks I'm calling a function when in fact is not a function it's a class or an object so let's refresh connected to localhost okay that's fine we presume that would happen because we've automatically returned true here now let's try to automatically return false to see what happens and you can see that it says connection failed so we know that everything is working up until now now all we need to do is inside our public function connect we need to let's just get rid of that inside our method connect I mean we need to do a MySQL connect and we need to check if this has connected and then we can return a specific value so we just say if MySQL Connect will put not in there so if the connection is false or if it hasn't worked and we're supplying remember database host from the arguments up here database username again from the argument here and then also DB password so if that hasn't worked bear in mind we already we automatically connect to our database because we supply this command but this if statement is checking if it's not connected properly then we return false so hopefully now you can see it start coming together else returned true okay so what we're doing now is we're connecting to our database if it hasn't worked we're returning folks back to this construct here where we've made our check and otherwise we're returning true back to not the construct but the check in here where we're using this connect so now let's double check that and let's refresh our page to see if we don't have any errors okay everything looks okay let's create a new instance of our connect and this will either work or not so we can say connect equals database connect and then we can put our arguments in here now just before that in this construct just above the if I'm going to say echo attempting connection okay so I'm writing attempting connection and then what will either get is connection failed or connected to our server so a database connect we need to specify the host which is for me localhost the username which is root for me and I don't have a password set but let's just let's just get rid of that for now and refresh and see what happens again I've done the same thing and I haven't used my new keyword in there let's refresh and you can see we've got a tempting connection and then connection failed so now let's try with the correct credentials I'll type my username in there so this will successfully connect to my database so let's check if it works okay and it says connected to localhost so with what we've learnt already and with using this constructor here we've automatically taken in some arguments from when we create a new instance of our class we've read these in and we've used a function called connect which has allowed us to connect to our database now why is this useful why might this be useful in a real life situation because it's just simply an easier and tidier way to connect to your database and return errors you can see that here we've got a really neat way to show that we've connected to our database we don't always need to tell our users that we've connected to our database but let's say for debugging purposes you wrote all your code like this you're going to have detailed error information sent straight back to you without just using a procedural code where you will maybe say or die kill the page here we get specific information and all we need to do is say connection equals new database connect and we're basically done
