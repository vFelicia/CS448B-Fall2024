hi this is Alex from PHP academy' 2 org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video we're going to be looking at Ajax and using a get request to a specific page in order to return an auto suggests style search box so you may have seen on Google if you use Google as a search engine you may see that when you type in a value where you start to type in a value you will actually receive a list of recommended results based on what you've typed so if I was to start typing in pH it may automatically suggest PHP for me because this is a popular result and it is displayed underneath the text box now there's a couple of things we won't be doing in this tutorial because this is just demonstrating how we can use Ajax with PHP we're not going to be using CSS to make everything pretty because we're going to be focusing on the Ajax relative to the PHP what we're also not going to be doing is searching it by popularity what we're going to be doing is we're going to use a a an SQL query to match or store or match every every time we press a key down so if I'm typing PHP here every time we press the key we're going to match what we've already got to the rest of a string inside a database so let me just make this a bit clearer let me just open up my database that I've already created okay so if you haven't already created a database go into PHP myadmin or whatever you use to administer your MySQL database and you want to create a database called Ajax or something of your choice but just remember I'm going to be using the name Ajax now we need a table inside of this database called names or obviously whatever you choose to call it but remember to add it in in the tutorial in the substitute of what I've named it and we have two field names we've got ID and we've got name now idea is just something I always tend to put in a database just to keep track of how many records there are and also also the ordering of which each record was entered so you can see that I've got a few names that I've already entered in let's just take a look at the database structure so you can you can see how to set this up we've got ID which is a primary key and it's an auto increment so every tummy in insert a record it will it will increment this value and name is just a variable character of 40 so that's all you need to do and then you want to put some dummy data inside your database inside your table sorry and the data that you want to put in is that the data which you know put a few names in first of people you might know etc and then choose a name that already exists but with say a different surname for example so when we start to type let's just go back to context when we start to type Alex like that we'll get Alex Garrett and Alex Malcolm returned and then when we continue to type we might have Alex ji then Alex Malcolm will no longer match what we've currently typed so Alex Garrett will be returned so hopefully that makes sense if you can though add as many rows as you can in here as many records as you can in here to get the best effect from this possible so what we're going to be doing is we're just going to be creating a text area or a text input box first of all and we're not going to have a submit button obviously because as the user types we want the autosuggest to work so we're going to do this via Ajax and our search Inc dot PHP file is going to do the searching for us so an index dot PHP let's just set up first of all our page the head of our page the body of our page then we'll set up the the area that the user can type in we'll also then set up the div area where the results will be shown so let's go ahead and create our HTML root tags let's go and do the head tags just underneath the and body so obviously feel free to properly set up your document I'm just keeping this really clean and simple for the purposes of this tutorial so embody the first thing we want is a forum we don't need an action and we don't need a method because we're not posting this form this form is just going to add the reason we create in this form is so we can access the elements inside the form so I'm going to give it an ID and I'm also going to give it a name so the name and the ID we're just going to call this search and I'm going to add my form there so inside the form I want some text to tell me what to do so I'm going to say type a name and then underneath that I'm going to have an input box and this is type text the name of this can be a keyword because this is the place where we're typing keywords and then we want this on Mouse down up sorry sorry on key down what do we call it a event so we want an on key down event and what we're going to do is every time a key is pressed so every time we're in focus on this in this let's just preview it so I can explain a bit better so every time we're in focus on it um we can we'll click in here and we'll start to type something and every time we press a key down so I'm pressing a key down now the the Ajax page where all the Ajax code will load in this this search in PHP page that we have here so let's go ahead and make up the name of our function now so we can put that into our JavaScript in a moment so I'm going to call this find match we'll call it find match okay so obviously now that we have this find match function we're going to need to add that function up here a bit later on inside JavaScript so let's go and create our div we need to create an ID for our div as well because remember within the Ajax we get this element by its ID and then we load some HTML into this this HTML is going to be the return values that we find from search string PHP
