hello this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video I'm going to be looking at extending classes so we can use specific data or rather properties and methods from another class but quickly do this so we've created a new class to use this data we can we can do this on one line but we can also specify additional properties you don't know what I'm talking about then follow along this example this is the bank account class from the previous examples the previous videos if you haven't watched them already go back and do so and the we simply have a class bank account I'll just walk you through got a class bank bank account we've got a property called balance which is by default equal to zero and we have three different methods we've got display balance which simply displays this property we have a method called withdraw which with withdraws a certain amount of money and we have a method called deposit which puts in a certain amount of money so deposits a certain amount of money okay so now what we want to do is we want to think about what happens if we want to create a savings account now the sort of first way of thinking about this would be to maybe copy this come down here paste it in and just change everything around so instead of class bank account we can call it class savings account the balance we can keep the display balance we can keep the withdraw we can keep and the deposit we can keep as well so what we've essentially done is created a new in a new class called savings account but with exactly the same properties and methods of our of our bank account up here now by doing this we've duplicated code and the point of object orientated programming is that you can reuse classes but call them different names and you can add different properties but keep certain aspects of certain aspects of your other class so we do this using extends you notice now I've deleted the duplication of this bank account class what we're going to do now is we're going to create a new class but we're going to do it we're going to do exactly what we just did by copying and pasting but with one line so let's go class savings account now this time before we do this like this all we do is we say extend and then we give the name of the class that we want to extend into this savings account so we're extending this bank account class to this class called savings account so we just type bank account and that's it that's all you need to do inside here you can specify additional properties but as of now this savings account has the all the properties and methods of our bank account class so we've got a public balance and public methods here which we can use within our savings account so let's just go ahead and test this if I was to say Alex savings equals new savings account let's go first of all to our browser and test this ok you can see that nothing's come up at the moment but this basically means that this has worked and now what we can say is Alex savings display balance and let's echo that out so you can see that balance is zero now notice we're using this savings account class so what we what we've done is successfully extended our bank account class into the savings account so we have useful the methods so instead of the first method I just showed you copying and pasting the whole class and just changing the name we're now not reusing any code whatsoever because we are keeping the same class but we're just creating a new class as an extension of the main bank account class so we found a lot a much easier way of doing things so let's run these sidebyside we've created our savings account and let's maybe with let's maybe deposit some money into our savings account so Alex savings deposit and let's deposit deposit 3000 pound in here and up here we'll create a normal bank account so Alex equals new bank account and we'll say Alex deposit and we'll deposit just a hundred in here and then we'll display both the balances at the end so what we've done is we've created a new bank account which is our main class we've deposited a hundred pounds we've created a savings account class with an instance of our savings account class which we've deposited three thousand pound but remember this is not a main class this is our extended class from bank account however even though we're using it side by side and we're creating a new instance of bank account and savings account we can use both simultaneously so now what I can do is say echo Alex display balance and we can put a line break on there just so we can keep things neat and then we can say echo Alex savings which is our savings our extended class we can say display balance as well so now what we should do is we should create with what we're doing is we're creating a new bank account and the new savings account and we are depositing three thousand pound in here and a one hundred pound in there and then displaying our balances so let's have a look at that under find property display balance okay movie or spell that wrong oh okay sorry and I didn't include the parentheses on the end so some things to watch out for okay so we've got balance 100 and balance 3000 so these could correspond to the correct values that we deposited in earlier let's just make it interesting and I'll say Alex withdraw and we'll withdraw so 20 pounds we've forgot the greater than sign there so we were left with this value so you can see that we can do different things to different our different classes now that we've created new instances of them even though we haven't put anything in here we've extended so we can use the methods and properties inside but what we can also do in more interestingly is we can specify additional properties that we want now inside our savings account and we can do the same with methods as well so we can specify additional methods and additional properties inside the savings account
