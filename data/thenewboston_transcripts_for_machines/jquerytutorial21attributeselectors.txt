hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to be looking at the attribute selector an attribute that belongs to a particular element we can use as a selector and as an example I've chosen to create a very short but useful application which will apply functionality to all email fields now this is an email field on my page I've not I've actually got a normal field here as well just to demonstrate obviously the difference I've used a selector to select all email fields or all input fields that have a type email because I'm using html5 you can see that I can use the type email which has some benefits over over text have some frontend validation but what we're doing is we're looking for all fields with the type email and then we're applying this functionality and this functionality is a default message when we click on it this message disappears when we navigate away this message comes back if nothing's been typed this is something that's found on like the majority of places you have to enter your email address it might be a subscription to a newsletter at the bottom of your page or something when I go ahead and type an email address in and then navigate away from this or tab away from this we have the value remaining if we leave this empty we get this enter your email address back again so as well as going over this particular selector which has a wide variety of matches so you can go ahead and look at that in the jQuery documentation but we're going to look at how we can practically use this on our page so I'm going to go ahead and open my text editor with no code at all and we'll start to write this out okay so I'm on to my index.php page I'm not going to waste time writing this out but essentially all I have got is a name field here with the input type text an email with an input type email because we've just got these little labels on here and that will produce something like on your page so we've got a field here and a field here I've also given this email field slightly larger lengths just so we can see the text inside of it by default so now that we've done this we need to go ahead and include this selectors je s external file and at the moment there's nothing in that we're not going to be using style dot CSS so I can go ahead and get rid of that so once we've included this we can write start to write some external JavaScript inside this selector CAS file and that's going to be selecting all input fields with the type email so I'm going to show you how to do this and then we're going to go on to look at creating this short other extremely useful application ok so the first thing I want to do is wait for my document to be ready so I'm going to use document dot ready and inside here we're going to have a function which will just bring down and we can start writing our code in here now the first thing I want to do is I want to go ahead and set a variable with a default message that's going to be placed inside of this box so we'll do that before we talk about selectors I'm just going to call this email default and that's going to be please or let's just say enter your email address into your email address and it's worth bearing in mind that the way we're doing this we'll apply it to every email field that you ever create as long as you have this selectors jeaious file on your page so we're selecting you know if you were to go ahead and include this functionality on your page as you go and perhaps create more email fields elsewhere this functionality will still remain due to the way that we're selecting it so now we're going to go ahead and use our selector to set a value to this field and we initially want to set this to the default text that we've defined inside this variable so here's the selector part we want to go ahead and select all input types this just on its own here we'll actually go ahead and select all input types anyway but we want to define which email type we want so we can say M input type equals and then in quotation marks I'm going to say email so now what we've done with this is we've successfully selected any input fields with the type email now it's worth noting that we could do absolutely anything we wanted with this and we could write it out with other elements as well for example if you had links and you wanted to select only links that had a particular a particular href so particular link you could go ahead and say a where the href is equal to let's just say google code at UK I'm not sure why you'd want to do this but you might do you never know you might want to turn the link into an image for example or something but essentially we can use this with any really any element I'm not sure which elements are included and not or rather which are not but we can go ahead and use this with anything so that's the essence of the you know selector the attribute selector so we can select any attribute from any different element that we want obviously in this tutorial we're looking at all input fields with the type of email again if you wanted to you could change this to all input fields with the type of text or we'll input fields with the type of password etc etc etc so in our case it's email now the first thing that we want to do is use the attribute function or whatever you want to call it to set the value of this to our email default so this will take two parameters the first is the value that you want to change all the attribute that you want to change and the attribute I want to change is value and this changes what's what you can see inside of the box or inside of the input field and I want to change this to email default so we've selected all types or all input types of email and appended or given this an attribute value with the email default so now when we refresh that text goes straight in there and notice it doesn't do it for name if we were for example to leave this as input this will apply to all input fields on the page you can see it's been placed into both of them but we're using this selector for the reason we only want emails to work
