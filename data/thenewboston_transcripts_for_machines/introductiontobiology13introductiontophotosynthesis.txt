welcome back everyone my name is Sarah and in these next couple of videos I'm going to be covering the process of photosynthesis in this video I'm going to be talking about the structure of the chloroplast and some stuff about light the theory of Light how it acts all that good kind of stuff and give a brief little overview of the actual process of photosynthesis and in my next videos I'll go into more detail about the photosystems and the Calvin cycle photosynthesis is the process by which light energy is captured and then is used to synthesiz carbohydrates the general reaction is you take six molecules of carbon dioxide and six molecules of Water and Light energy in the form of photons to produce a one molecule of glucose and six molecules of oxygen and during this process carbon dioxide is going to get reduced water is going to get oxidized and it is an endergonic reaction which means it requires energy to proceed and that energy like I said is in the form of light en photosynthesis mainly takes place in plants and green algae it can take place in some bacteria too but we're not going to really discuss that I mean the process is the same they just don't have the specialized organel for it but anyways in Plants it's going to take place in the mesophile of of the leaves Within These mes mesophi there are structures called chloroplasts and these chloroplasts contain what are called thids they're just little flat membrane Stacks they these things called photosystems that trap light energy in the thids and then carbon fixation is going to occur in this stroma of the chloroplast and you can see my little drawing here of the chloroplast you got the outer membrane the inner membrane the thids which are organized into big Stacks called gra or Grana however you want to pronounce it the stroma is just this material between the thids and the inner membrane the plant is going to get water through the roots um it's absorbed and transported up to the leaves through what is called xylem and CO2 is going to enter through stomata which are little like pores within the leave these stomata are going to prot be protected by guard cells so nothing else that's not that's not supposed to be there is going to come in and then oxygen is also going to leave through the stata so the nature of light light is a type of electromagnetic radiation it travels as a wave it's got short wavelengths or long wavelengths and it also be behaves as a particle light energy be comes in these little bundles called photons light has two different or three different properties rather you've got your velocity which is 3 * 10 8 m/ second which is hey freaking fast dude but um this velocity is not going to change for the most part so the properties of light are based on their frequency and their wavelength so visible light has a wave length of anywhere from 380 NM to 780 NM and the shorter the wavelength the higher the energy there are several different pigments involved with photosynthesis you got chlorophyll a is the main pigment chlorophyll B and keratinoid are accessory pigments and the color depends on what wavelengths of light are absorbed or reflected or transmitted for example leaves are green because they're going to reflect green lights white like white flowers and things like that reflect all colors of light and a black flower for example would absorb all colors of light so the actual process of photosynthesis has four different events that happen in two phases you've got your photochemical reactions and electron transport chem osmosis and carbon fixation and the two phases you got the light phase where oxygen is generated also uh hydrogen ions to form the Chim osmosis ATP and nadh and then during the dark phase which is light independent this is going to use ATP nadph and carbon dioxide to form carbohydrates
