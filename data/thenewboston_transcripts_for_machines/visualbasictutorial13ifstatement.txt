hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be learning the if statement now the if statement is one of the most useful tools for beginners in Visual Basic because there's so much that you can do with it and it's very easy to pick up it's very intuitive so let's go ahead and get started now first off we are going to make a program that will ask a user for their username and password now this may be a little bit different than what you'd expect for a username and password login to be but um it will give you the concept of the if statement and then you'll be able to go make some programs using the if statement and get used to it so that you can move on to the next tutorials so let's go ahead and get started we'll do console. right line what is your name so now what we're going to do is we're going to declare string so we'll use the dim keyword to let uh Visual Basic know that we're going to make a variable so we'll dim user name as string and we'll set it equal to console.readline so now what we're going to do is we're going to do console. rightline and we're just going to ask them for their password so what is your password and then we'll declare another variable and it'll be password so dim password as a string and we're going to set equal to console dot read line so we're just getting whatever the user typed in so now we're going to create our if statement so to start off an if statement you're just going to use the keyword if and when you type that in it's going to highlight it blue and it's going to show it up in intellisense now the um the definition for the if statement in this is conditionally conditionally executes a group of statements depending on the value of an expression so basically what that says is if a certain uh condition is true then go ahead and do whatever is inside this if statement so if username equals Sam then what do we want it to do and if you press enter you can see that it'll automatically add end if for you now all if statements have to end with an end if or else you'll get a syntax error so I'll do if username equals Sam then console do right line welcome Sam and now we're just going to create a second if statement so if password equals the New Boston then what what do we want it to do we will just type console do right line and inside of there we'll type you have entered the correct password okay so now if we run this you're going to see we have a little bit of a problem here so if we type what is your name and I type Sam what is your password the New Boston you can see It'll close out right after we're done with that so we're just going to add a read line right here so console. readline and so this should pause the program and let us see what we have done so what is your name Sam and what is your password the New Boston so because name is equal to Sam then it's going to print out welcome Sam and because the New Boston the password that we have typed in is equal to the New Boston in our code right here it's going to say you have entered the correct password so let's go ahead and let's separate this a bit here just to make the a it a little bit more readable so we'll just uh write another line which will just give us a blank line and separate these so so now if we run this again it'll say what is your name and if I type let's say Gerald and it'll say what is your password I type the New Boston it's going to say you have entered the correct password but it didn't say welcome Sam because Gerald is not equal to Sam so username whatever they have typed in is Gerald and it's not equal to Sam so it will not do the code inside of here and since we typed in the New Boston as our password it's going to tell us that we have enter the correct password and this will also work the other way around so if we do what is your name Sam and say what is your password I'll just say on live gamer it'll just say welcome Sam but it won't tell us that we have entered the correct password so here is uh a basic example of an if statement uh they're very fun to use when you're first beginning programming you can do a lot with them a lot more than you think you could and uh so go ahead uh look at this code over again uh go ahead and use some if statements and make some programs yourself and once you've got if statements nailed down uh go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
