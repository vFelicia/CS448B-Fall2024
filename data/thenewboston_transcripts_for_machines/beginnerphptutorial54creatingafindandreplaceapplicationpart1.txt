hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video we're going to be creating a web application if you like or a script that works in a similar way to this now we have a text box here in which we can type any data so I'm going to say the cat sat on the mat in this box here I can search for a string that I want to replace in particular and then I want to specify what are to replace it with so let's say I wanted to search for Cat Cat exists here in the string so I want to replace it with let's say dog or let's say monkey yeah speak things fun so now I'm going to click find a replace and you'll see that cat is replaced with the string monkey okay so we already know in PHP that we can use the AB STR underscore replace function and this allows you to specify either an array or a single string to replace now let's just open up my text editor and I'll demonstrate this for you ok so STR replace works by taking the string you want to replace the data in so the overall string which in this case would be the text in this box here then what we'll do is we would search for the string that we want to search for so search and in this case it would correspond to this here then what we would do is we would specify what we want to replace it with and that would correspond to this box here however this tutorial is dealing with the substring a function and this function works in a similar way that has a combination of technique and what we do in this function I have another video on this so if you want to go back and refer to that is we have strengths or our overall string once again what you want to what you want to replace so for example in this case we will be supply monkey in there because we're choosing to replace with monkey and then we would choose the position the start position that we'd want to start replacing up so in this case let's go back to the original example of a cat sat on the mat it would be 0 1 2 3 we'd be starting at the third position so we'd Pier 2 2 3 and there we then say how many characters we want to cut off and then add this string in so in this case it would be 3 also because we want to get rid of 3 characters starting from the third position and we want to replace that with the text monkey and this will be shifted along to above and allow you you know to have more than one more than three characters so obviously monkeys at six characters so in this example I use the substring replace function where I could have just used STR replace now the reason I'm doing this is simply to demonstrate the use that substring function can have if you wanted to create um a script that did this you could just use the string replace function and you would be able to use it in the way I've already talked about however I'm going to go the long way around things in this tutorial and talk about how we're using the substring replace it's just going to give you an idea of how it can work in your program and maybe from this example you can adapt and use it in your own uses when you feel like you might need it so I'm going to get rid of this code here and we're going to start from the beginning so the first thing we want to do is create our form so let's start creating that we're going to use a method of post and the action is going to be to the index dot PHP again so we're submitting this form back to index dot PHP now let's refresh the page we've got nothing on the page at the moment so what we want to do now is create a text area in which users can enter a string of data so let's create a text area and end that there and what we also want to do is give it a name and in this case I'm going to call it text I'm going to just add rows and calls this is rows and columns just to make it a bit larger than it is by default now we want to break down a couple of times and we want to say search for we break down again we use an input type of text so by now you should be comfortable with HTML forms and how they work and how they submit so I'm not going to be talking about that too much an input type of text and the name of this is going to be search for now we can break down a couple more lines and say replace with so we're just simply setting up how our form is can look so the input type in this case is going to be text again text again and the name is going to be replace with so we can break there as well now we want to put a submit button so I'm going to say input type equals submit and the value is going to be find and replace so let's go back to our our page and refresh to see what we've got let's cancel down just submit your elegant okay so we've got the forum where we can now type data in here we can search for a string in here and the roof we can replace it with a string so all of this is string data so it's pretty easy to work with now let's start validating our form before we allow these functions that we've discussed to take place so inside PHP we're going to use to networking your nested if statement first of all we want to check if the form has been submitted that's very important we don't start processing data at the top of our page unless the user has actually clicked submit button and these are present
