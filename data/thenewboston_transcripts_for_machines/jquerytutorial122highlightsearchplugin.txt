so highlight is the class that we need to go ahead and create so inside here I'm going to go ahead and create a highlight class and I'm essentially well basically just going to set the background color to yellow so now what's going to happen is if we were to if we were to apply this to any element on our page for example search it would be the same if we were to actually perform the search as creating a span around this with a class of highlight and now sorry highlight now that's taken the class and applied it to this particular span here so that's basically what the plugin does just as a bit of a background information on that but obviously our highlight our highlighter plugin here is going to do all the work for us so what we want to do is we want to reference something in a selector and then apply the high highlight plugin to this and in here we need to provide the search term now the search term is obviously search underscore term the value that we stored from the text area however what do we want to do with go ahead and when we go ahead and actually select this now there's a few things that we could do in terms of this we've got a paragraph surrounding this paragraph of text so what we could do is we could place a P in there and that will just mean any element that's inside or any any text that matches this value here inside of P we're going to go ahead and highlight it so we can go ahead and actually test this that's just refresh I'm going to go ahead and type search and click find and you can see that a search has now been highlighted or we could go ahead and type a and you can see this you know everything's been highlighted here so what's going to happen now is we need to change this so everything on our page is searched for so at the moment if I was to take this out of its paragraph okay you'll be able to see that when we search for something so search and click find you see nothing happens and the reason for this is that we need a selector that's global to the to the page now when I was testing out this plugin I thought it would be acceptable to go ahead and use document dot highlight to search for something on the document now this will work with regards to this paragraph now let's just have a look when we refresh oh no it doesn't work yeah okay so essentially this is the problem that we that we have we've got document dot highlight search term what we actually need to do is go ahead and use the asterisk selector to select everything on the page so it will essentially search between any element I think this will work if you were to type body with this outside of the paragraph if I was to go ahead and use search you can see that that's worked now because we've got this plain text within our body and not within another element if I was to go ahead and change this to P and we have this text within a paragraph using the body selector won't work now because although it's within the body oh it does work okay right that's fair enough absolutely fair enough maybe I sort of overlooked this but using the using an asterisk selector will select you know throughout the page so it's sort of like a global search across the page selecting all elements so when we click find this successfully highlights for us now we do have another problem in terms of when we go ahead and perform another search which you might have caught earlier when I typed in a and click defined you can see that search has still been highlighted now the reason for this is that we have not removed the class from here if we go ahead and look inside highlight j/s and we come down you can see that we've got this almost other plugin which is called remove highlight so remove highlight will remove the highlight you know from you know a particular place so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and just before we use highlight search term I'm going to remove high light and what that will do is it will just remove the highlight altogether so now what happens is when we go ahead and search for say search we highlight this but when we perform a new search for say just a what will happen is we'll remove the highlight before we then go and highlight the new search term so when we click find you can see that it's been it's been removed but then again we have another problem where we've actually you know just remove the entire element so what we can go ahead and do is just analyze this and we'll want to go and we'll want to make a change to this now the problem is is that when we're selecting everything we're talking about selecting absolutely everything in this in this case what we're going to want to go and do now is because we do actually face this problem with the search clicking find and searching something typing a and not actually removing the entire span together we want to go ahead and change this to body so now what's going to happen is when we go ahead and search for something and click find we highlight search but when we perform a new search for a it doesn't actually remove the element altogether so we've now actually you know highlighted everything completely successfully so this highlight function here available obviously at this address here has just used a class it's taken a particular element on a page and by all means this could be a particular div so for example you could reference it with a hash if it was a particular area you were searching in for example a Content area obviously if you were performing this globally across the page inside of your the area in your page you're looking at you know highlighting absolutely everything you might just have a specific content area on your page and you might want you might solve wondering disclude or exclude a menu rather so we've removed highlight before we've gone and we highlighted because highlight is just going to apply this span as we analyzed earlier it's applying a span with a class name highlight so it's quite a useful plugin I just wanted to quickly go over you know something like this how it's you know quite lightweight it's about two kilobytes in file size well 1 1 3 7 4 so it's you know extremely lightweight and quite useful as well and the benefit of this is that if we wanted to say change something like the font weight to bold we can go ahead and do so and that will literally just update the process of highlighting so if we click search this will turn this bold as well so we can customize out how we want inside a style sheet so that's just a quick example of another plugin and how you would install it and also how to sort of select in the right place and also removing then then highlighting the next search term that's searched for so again a simple plugin and extremely useful
