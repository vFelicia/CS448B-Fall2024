what's going on guys welcome to your fifth udk tutorial and before we get to the tutorial I want to show you guys this right here I am moving into a new apartment my very own apartment next month so I thought you guys might want to see some pictures uh right now I live in a room and it's like 10 ft by 10 ft and it smells like tuna and beef stew all the time so I figured I might as well get a new place so here it is for you guys who are interested I posted some pictures up on my forum and if you guys I live on the third floor right there and if you guys are not a member of my Forum I would recommend that if you have any questions about any of these tutorials you can ask me there and I'll be happy to answer them for you but anyways I just had to get that out of the way welcome to your fifth udk tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to be talking more about these options right here so we left off with this real time now let's go over this brush wire frame option right here the brush wire frame option does displays your 3D models in wireframe now wireframe is basically well the easiest way to describe it is just to look at it it's basically all the edges all the vertexes it's basically a blueprint rather than this nice lip mode right here so that's what brush wireframe is now this next option after this is wireframe now if you switch on and off you can only see some subtle differences and the reason for that is because well the differences are subtle while you're frame and brush W frame are very similar they only differ in what they display um for now I'm not going to be covering that because that's really when we get into 3D modeling and you know working with this stuff over here but for now just remember that brush wireframe and wireframe kind of help you display the blueprint rather than you know the models themselves so with that being said let's hop over to this one right here and this is unlit mode mode whenever you're in unlp mode this displays your textures and materials but not your lighting whenever you're making levels and 3D models you need to make 3D models and then you need to apply textures and materials to it and you also need to add lights to your word to show what part of your you know Castle you want lit up what how you want your lights to display in your 3D World basically this basically shows everything with the constant light no Shadows or anything like that so remember unlit mode what we're working with right now just shows textures and materials but no lighting if we want to show the lighting then we need to hop over to this mode this is your nice pretty lit mode and check it out we have bright spots and shadows pretty much your map with Lighting in it that's why they named it LP mode cuz it's pretty lighting Shadows it's basically however you see it in LP mode is is how it would look to the player when they're actually playing your game now we can go ahead to uh let's go to detail lighting lighting only what these two options are are basically whenever like I said before in order to make a map we need to add lighting whenever we want to concentrate on just the lighting and we don't want to worry about any of the textures or materials or anything like that we can look in one of these modes these modes allow us to say we want to work with making sure our shadows appear properly we probably want to work in one of these modes again they're either detail lighting and lighting only mode this it's pretty much selfexplanatory what these modes are show a constant material with lighting only now a lot of these options right here pretty much take a couple tutorials each to cover like uh lighting complexity texture density Shader we don't even know what textures and shaders are yet so let's go ahead and skip those um lighting without any texal density I guess the next thing we can cover is this game mode right here now the game mode I touched on I think in the second tutorial it's basically what you would see if you were playing the game all of these modes right here they're kind of like the designer mode but the game mode takes care of all that wireframe and you know all this little stuff right here it makes it disappear basically if you are the player playing the the game this is what you would see now the lock viewport mode right here is actually let me see let me see how much time I got since I you know had to show you guys those pictures of my apartment first I'm going to be covering the rest of these buttons in the next tutorial so for now I guess that's all you guys get for now in the next tutorial I promise we're going to be finishing up the viewport toolbar but for now I'm going to go uh check out the pictures in my apartment and I'm probably going to go McDonald's andan milkshake so you watch this tutorial again and once you have perfected all the different modes you're ready to move on to my next video so thank you guys for watching don't forget to sign up for my forum and I'll see you guys in my next video
