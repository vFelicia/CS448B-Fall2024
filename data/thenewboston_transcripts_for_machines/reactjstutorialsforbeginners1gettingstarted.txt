what is going on guys my name is Bucky Roberts and welcome to your very first react tutorial now question number one what the heck is react react is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces specifically single page applications now what I was going to do is I was going to kind of tell you guys the history about react and go into a bunch of details show you guys a bunch of demos but then I was like let's just go ahead and instead of looking at demos let's just get our hands dirty and start making them so so what do we need to get started with react well the very first and probably most important thing we need is the react Library so this is the code for the library and this is actually made by Facebook so if you ever go to this website and you're like facebook. GitHub what the heck this entire library was created by Facebook so that's some background information but essentially we need these two files react.js and react.js now we have a couple options of how we can include these into our HTML what we can do is we can just go ahead and copy this and then plop them right in here just like you include any CSS or JavaScript file or what you can do is you can actually download these and have them stored on your own machine now the benefit of kind of just including them from here is you don't have a bunch of files on your own computer now the benefit of having them on your computer is of course what happens whenever your internet goes out and you suddenly become in the mood to rate react well you can't because you're not connected and you can't get these files anymore so if you guys want to kind of do it this way then feel free but my setup and what I did is I actually have them downloaded on my own system and just to make it easier for you guys if you go to this Ur URL right here and this is just my GitHub page um I already downloaded all the files as well as some additional ones that we're going to need so I'll show you guys what to do if you just go here clone or download and hit download zip then it's going to give you all the files and once you extract it is going to give you this right here all of these juicy files so from there what I did is I went in demos I made a new directory called Simple demo and I made a really basic HTML file and as you can see I already included all the JavaScript we need which is right in here so you guys are looking at this and you're like all right so you said that we need the react react Dom JS but what the heck is this file you told me that we only needed these two JavaScript files so what is this third one are you lying to me Bucky well believe it or not whenever we write react even though that this is a JavaScript library we're not going to be writing plain old JavaScript we're going to be using a flavor of JavaScript called jsx so why are we doing this instead of writing plain old JavaScript well even though your browser needs plain old JavaScript whenever we write jsx we have some really cool features for example we can basically write this code that looks exactly like HTML and if you guys ever tried to do this with play Old JavaScript it's a pain in the butt so whenever we write jsx it's just really intuitive and easy to understand and learn um react however like I said whenever you run this in a browser your browser cannot understand jsx it can only understand JavaScript so what we need to do before we actually run it is we need a tool to convert it to Plano JavaScript so again this is what we're going to be writing on the left called jsx and after we run our translator it's actually called a transpiler um it converts it to plain old JavaScript and you can just use a tool like this one online to do it all for you or you can just go ahead and include this link right here which basically takes care of all of that behind the scenes so we can write jsx right in here run it and it's going to be beautiful our browser is going to understand it we're going to be able to write jsx it's going to be awesome so with that being said let's go ahead and get started
