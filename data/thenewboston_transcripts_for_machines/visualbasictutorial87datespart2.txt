hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking more about dates now if you remember in the previous tutorial we created a date object and set it equal to the current date and then we just went ahead and showed that in the message box now what we can do is we can extract certain parts of the dates so we can get the month the day of the year hours minutes seconds the day of the week or the day of the years and all of these are available to us inside of the date class so let's go ahead and show some of these so we'll type message box not show and we'll show the month and we go ahead go ahead and add current date dot month and we'll just create a couple more of these and we will show the various parts of the date so we'll just do year now you can see that these don't have the little purple boxes here they have a little box here with a finger pointing at it and what that means is that it's a property or a variable so this isn't a method or this isn't a function like the two string or too short date string this just gets values from the object that we've created so let's go ahead and show some more stuff here so we can show the day which will show the the current day of the month now we can get the hour and the minute and the second so let's go ahead and type that so we'll type our and then we will add current date dot our and now what we can do is we can add what's called environment dot new line now I may have talked about this in a previous tutorial but what this does is it takes this string right here and then when we add environment dot new line it'll go down the line for us now let's go ahead and add some more stuff so we'll add will do hours minutes and seconds so minute and we'll go ahead and add current date dot minute and then we'll do seconds too so environment dot new line and we'll go ahead and add seconds current date dot second okay so let's go ahead and fix this right here we do not need these parameters now what we can do is we showed the month year the day the hours the minutes and the seconds now we can get the day of the week in the day of the year which is of type integer so the day of the week is either gonna be 1 through 7 and the day of the year is going to be either 1 through 365 or 366 for a leap year so we could type message box not show day of week and we'll go ahead and add current date dot day of week now we will show the day of the year so message box not show day of year and we will add current date dot day of year ok so now what we can do is we can run our program and we it will get all of these time values so here we have our long time value which shows the the month the day of the month the year hours minutes seconds and p.m. or a.m. then we get month 5 so it is the fifth month of the year which is May year 2011 which is of course the year we get the day which is May 9 we get our 19 and this goes by the 24 hour time period so our 19 would be 7 minute is 29 minutes and second is 18 seconds so 7 29 18 seconds it is the first day of the week because it is Monday and the day of the weeks start from Monday in visual visual basic they do not start from Sunday and then the day of the year is 129 so I'm go ahead and put this code in if you are already have it and once you've used some day functions gets values from your date objects and you're familiar with that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
