hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video I'm going to be briefly explaining and demonstrating the pier egg match function the pier egg match function looks like this and what it is is it takes it takes a expression matching and lets us do this so what is expression matching but it's basically matching patterns inside of a string so we could say we could use this function to check if a string exists inside of a string but we can also take on more complex patterns and check for these inside of strings so I'm not going to be demonstrating some of the more complex patterns because with the amount of different expressions that you can use to check for patterns we would literally be here for hours because there's lots and lots of different ways you can check but what we're going to be doing is we're going to be creating an example of just checking for a string inside of a string so let's go ahead and create a string data and this is going to be equal to this is a string now what we want to do is we want to check to see if we find a match inside of this string now what the pewag match function will not do is tell you where the match is it will just show you it will just return a 1 or a 0 depending on if there's a match so what we can do is we can put this into an if statement and the condition will either return 1 or 0 which is going to be the function itself therefore if I equals 1 then we have found a match if it equals 0 then we haven't found a match so let's go ahead and create our if statement and let's also create our else as well so we've created an ifelse statement now what we want to do is inside the condition area we want to give the function so preg and then brackets so in here we were going to take we're going to take two parameters the function itself takes three parameters I think we're just going to be giving it two so essentially what we're going to be doing is searching for a string inside of this string up here that we've predefined so let's say we chose the word is we want to see if there's an is in here we could also do it with simply something like is there any spaces in this in this string so we'll go for both examples and we'll demonstrate this twice so the first parameter is the expression the pattern that you want to match for and the second parameter is the string itself so the string data and this can either be supplied in using a variable or you can add your plaintext in here pain text plain text in here okay so we're going to be feeding in string there and we're going to be searching for a particular word so the simplest way that you could possibly do this is two forward slashes and then in the middle of these two forward slashes is the word that you're searching for so this just it this is just basically meaning as this is so what we're searching for is inside this string as essentially what we're doing with these two forward slashes here contained containing this is so if our room if this returns one that's going to mean it is found which at the moment we know that it is going to be so in here we can echo out match found and in else what we can do is echo out no match found if we can't find a match so let's go ahead and open up our browser and test this okay so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to refresh the page and see what we got so it now says match found we knew that it would do that because we know that the word is is contained within a string or within this string so now let's just simply put a space see if it will return match found okay so it's saying match found so what we could do is we could have a function that would check for example force for a space in a program or sorry in a string and we'll do that a bit later when I've explained a bit more about this function now what happens if we don't know what this string is we might want to specific pattern inside of a string and when we don't know we don't know how the string is formed or what we're feeding in so we're just double checking something
