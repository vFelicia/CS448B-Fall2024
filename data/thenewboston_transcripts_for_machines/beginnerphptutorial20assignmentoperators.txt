this is Alex from PHP academy' and this is a PHP tutorial for the new Boston in this video I'm going to be talking to you about assignment operators now assignment operators in PHP we've already seen a few for example if I was to say number one equals ten we've already used an assignment operator here this is the is assigning a value of ten to this variable so it's not is equal to we're not comparing anything that's comparison operator we are assigning this value now what happens if I wanted to let's create another variable say number two equals five now if I wanted to for example create a result and I wanted this to equal 10 oh no I wanted this to equal number one plus two and here I'm trying to achieve the result 12 in fact let's get rid of this number two now for complete so we don't confuse ourselves so we've got number one and we're assigning the value of 10 to this now we're assigning the value a value to result and this value is ten plus two now how can we use this in shorthand we've already seen this basic assignment operator here however there is a lot of lot quicker way to do this and this would be to say number one plus equals two now what this is saying in plain English English is number one so we're saying ten equals not equals ten plus two so we are taking the value and just adding on two rather than creating it as a long string a long line of code sorry so let's refresh this and we see that we've got no we need to echo out so echo number one so we're signing up here we're performing an operation on here but we are reassigning a value and then we're echoing out the value here so let's refresh and you see we've got the value twelve so we've used plus equals as opposed to we could say number one equals number one plus two but removing the whole of this we can just say plus equals so that's a lot easier way to demonstrate that now for example we could use the same thing with minus equals so let's refresh that and we're left with the value a so we're doing exactly the same thing we're saying number one equals number one minus two but instead we're doing equals so it's an easy shorthand version to do things we can do the same as well as multiply so here we'll receive the result 20 and that works and the same with divide as well you can use exactly the same thing so we're going to say ten divided by two and that's going to be equal to five you can also do the modular so in this case we're going to be left with zero because there's no remainder however if we would change this to three we get the remainder one so you can see how already we're shorthand in the code it's a lot easier to program it's a lot quicker to program and as far as looking at it as a whole it's as long as you learn the way it looks and convert it into plain English in your mind well enough you'll understand it straight away so you can just say yeah that's number one equals number one plus two now we can also use concatenation with the equals we've already looked at concatenation in some of the past videos and but what we can do is we can work with string data so I'm going to say text equals hello now what if I wanted to concatenate some text onto this to make it say hello world obviously this is a useless example but now you'll get the feel of how we can concatenate on easily all I need to do is I need to say text dot remember we use dots for concatenation dot equals I'm going to put a space in there and say world so let's just comment this line as it stands we refresh the page remember to echo out the text down here we refresh the page and we get the text hello now if we bring this back into play just by taking out them that comment there we're saying text equals text and then we concatenate in this on so it's the same as saying it's the same as saying well it's the same as basically having this up here like that obviously like I said I use this example but it shows you how they how it can be done and later on when you're obviously programming complex programs this is useful so if we refresh we get that hello world so these are basic examples of assignment operators and how we assign different values to other variables or plain plain text itself in PHP
