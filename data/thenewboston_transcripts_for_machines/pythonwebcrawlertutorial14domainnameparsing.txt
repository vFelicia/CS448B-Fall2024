ah already houses welcome back and yes I know my voice sounds goofy still I'm still sick actually waited a couple days because I was like you know my voice sounded weird in that video let me wait the next day Oh still sick all right let me just wait one more day oh my voice still sounds awful cuz I'm sick so yeah Here I am and I don't really want to go to the doctor because I'm not like dying or anything so I can't really justify getting medicine and shoot a bunch of crap up into my body just because I have a little cough but you know so there is 30 seconds wasted about me talking about nothing fight that are related let's go ahead and get on with Python now so in this video let's go ahead and make a new Python file and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna name it domain and this is gonna be a real quick video we're gonna write two quick functions and we're gonna make the functions responsible for extracting this domain name the new Boston com so the reason that we do this like I said is because whenever we're crawling some website and we come across a bunch of links most of them were gonna want to crawl but then whenever we come to links like this YouTube Facebook Twitter well if we add those to the waiting list then our spiders tries to curl those and of course we want to say hey only stick to links that are from this domain don't try to crawl the entire Internet so what we need to do is whenever we paste in the URL we also need to extract the domain it's actually pretty cool so from URL Lib dot parse import URL parse if I can URL parse so again Python already includes this cool little module for parsing URLs how awesome is that so let me explain what I'm gonna do first so this is the only part we care about this is called the network location this is the protocol HTTP these are just the files and directories over here this is the domain name the only part we care about now the thing about this is not all domain names are the same it's just not some bird and then Komori to you some have WW some have like mobile some have like male gov ny da lottery dot the New Boston comm dot whatever so the thing is that these domain names are a little bit weird so the first thing we're going to do is we're just going to get this entire network location so it doesn't matter if it is broken up into one five or my god I feel like shoot myself in the frickin face right now alright so it doesn't matter matter how many chunks is broken up into we're just gonna get the last two such as comm dot the new Boston and you guys are going to see alright so the first thing we're gonna do is I'm gonna make a potion called get sub domain name and this can be something like name dot example.com so usually it might just be like the new Boston calm but if it has more than one in it let me read something like a mail dot now keep that like this so again pretty much your entire network location no matter how many pieces there are so I'll say TIFF get some main name and we're just going to pass it in the URL and how do we do this well the first thing like I said we want to put it in a try except statement anytime we're working with networking or you know connecting to a server or anything like that we always want to put it in a trycatch so we're just gonna return URL parse which means we're gonna throw into your l right here it's gonna parse through it again this is built in Python functionality and we're just gonna return the net lock network location so that's all we do how easy is that now except we're just going to return blank because we have to return something the Colin function is going to expect a return value so we just can't right past here so we have to return that right there alright so like I said this is going to return the entire sub domain but we only want these last so what we can do is we can essentially call this function break it up and say okay return the last one in the second to last one and then this is where we're going to use in our program so that little chunk of it so I'll say this get domain name and this is just going to be our last one so example.com can't type today can't type any day def get the main name and of course we're just going to throw in the URL right here and make it a little try except so try the results of this is get subdomain name throw in the URL so whenever we call this function is going to call this function and it's essentially gonna return something like this but what we need to do now is we need to actually go ahead and split this up into pieces so we're gonna make a list out of this item this item in this item now once we have that list we can just return the last two elements and that's going to give us our Rod domain name so in order to split it up that way you just for a split dot right here so whatever you type in here is the character that it's going to charge it up by and now results is a list of three elements named example com if your sub domain has four in it then you know same thing whatever so what do we want to return we just want to return results so the secondtolast item plus a period plus results minus one so actually I can test this right now am I getting a hair right here oh because I'm an idiot so accept return and let me just throw in any URL like this all right so I'll say print get domain name you know just pop that right in right there and now hopefully I ran this right all right so now you can see here the new boston.com now if you guys know how that worked then you can go on the next video but for those of you who don't let me talk you guys through it one last time what we did is we passed in this entire thing right in here and then the first thing it did is it called get sub domain name so it got all of this right here but it didn't matter if it was check this out mobile email that the new boston.com it would get all of this and then it'll get this second to the last which was this one in the last one which was this one and that's what it returned and of course you have to put a dot in the middle and that's why I had the dot in the middle right there so now every single URL we tests we're gonna make sure that it has the new boston.com in it if it does we are good to go so delete this line of code and yeah so I'll see you guys in the next video where my voice is going to sound probably even worse
