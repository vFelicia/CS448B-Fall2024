okay so let's move on let's go on to the trim now there's three different types of trim there's trim in general there's El trim and there's our trim so let's go ahead and say string trimmed equals trim and that is string here string so why is this function useful well what this world what it will do first is it will trim the white space from the left and the right hand side of a string so if we've got white space here and we've got white space here this function will just return this itself so let's go ahead and first of all echo out the string so we can see what we've got here I'm refresh okay so you can see that I know that's because it's going to return I'll eyes now well I'm not sure how to show you this as an example but we could go ahead an echo string trimmed so this is just basically going to return the trimmed string think if we go ahead and put in & nbsp in there cool and we put that at the end as well which is an HTML space and let's echo out string okay yeah so now we've got a space at the start and the end of our string let's go ahead now and echo out string trimmed and should produce oh no because I'm using HTML data anyway okay so let me just explain this rather than demonstrate it if we were to have a string like this why might we have a string like this well let's say you are feeding in values from a from a text file for example and you'd use say an explode function to get each value separated by comma into into a string you may have white space on either side now this might affect if statements because you might be comparing let's say if the certain value is equal to this that I've just highlighted in blue when in actual fact it might equal this which I've highlighted in blue so might have white space either side we can use this trim function to trim the white space from the left and the right which will then just result in the string itself here so that's the trim function alternatively if you just wanted to trim the left hand side white space you can use L trim and vice versa if you wanted to trim the right hand side white space you can use our trim so that is the our trim function and the left and the standard trim of course okay so the last we're going to talk about is that mainly for security purposes let's go ahead and say string is equal to this is a string maybe and here we could yet well we'll leave it as now this is the add slashes function so slashes equals add slashes and we'll supply that with the string so let's go ahead and echo out string slashes to see the result that we've got okay nothing at the moment now let's go ahead and add in image source equals something so image jpg for example now the first thing is when we test this you'll see that it's added slashes before this and and this double quotation mark no it hasn't so okay so okay let's go ahead and get rid of this injustice lash in so for that you would use the HTML entities function if you wanted to remove the remove the you know the HTML code as a whole so let's go back to that actually and we'll use the HTML entities function in here and let's go ahead and refresh okay sorry so that has a underscore somewhere there no okay so what have I done wrong here and HTML entities nope that was my spelling so you can see now that we've produced a string with this that data here so what we've done is we've used the add slashes to add slashes just in here let's go ahead and remove this add slashes function and you can see that that's just produced on its own so why is this HTML entity sorry why is this add slashes function useful well it's useful so we don't we don't pass anything that we don't want to for example with them SQL injection which I do have another video on so go ahead and and watch that if you haven't already and if you've used database databases before that'll be useful but add slashes is basically going to add our slashes to escape different characters for security purposes so now what we can do is go ahead and say echo strip slashes and then we go so let's go ahead and get rid of that there and you can see that we've got rid of them so we've added slashes here and we've stripped slashes here let's just get rid of that again so you can see the difference there so why would you want to strip slashes well for example data may be stored in a database if it was going to be produced on to a page for viewing and you might want to strip the slashes or add the slashes rather so this isn't passed as HTML code now why would you want to strip the slashes if you were say putting this data back into a text box for people to edit so you might have this in an input text box you'll want to strip the slashes before you put it into a text box for people to edit and then you want to obviously add slashes when it's going to be viewed as plain text on a page anywhere on your website so what if you ever find you need to get rid of these to allow you know either for SQL SQL query security or just a display data in your page securely then the add slashes is is the function to use and to remove this it strip slashes which will then allow you to view the plain data so that's a short collection of string functions in PHP there are many more you can go to the PHP manual php.net have a look through the string functions but these are the ones that I tend to use apart from the string reverse I tend to use I on a regular basis when I'm coding so yet they're the string functions in PHP
