hello this is Alex from PHP academy' dog and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston and today we're going to be talking about arrays inside PHP now an array is a way to store data inside one variable and it's basically a collection of data so for example if I wanted to store a few numbers I'm going to say 1 5 10 20 now if I want to store these inside one place where I can access them that would be you know more useful than having to break them up somehow to use them individually it also works well when you want to loop through and take elements of an array so if you don't quite understand what an array is then follow the examples listen as carefully as you can watch as carefully as you can and you'll you'll start to grasp why they might be useful now in PHP I'm going to create an array by using a variable and I'm going to do this by creating the variable standard and assigning I'm going to assign it an array to it so I've called this variable food now I'm going to use the array keyword I'm going to put two brackets and then obviously I'm going to end my line now the two the two clearly broccoli bracket so rounded brackets are where you're going to put each element of your array in now an element is or a value of an array is automatically assigned a key and the keys start from zero and then they go on and on not so if I was to create first of all food here pasta this is key zero of our array this is the data held at Kesey row and the value of key 0 is pasta and Behrman we can put numbers in these as well but we can't mix them so they have to be all of one data type so food equals array of pasta Pizza salad and I've just separated these with commas and I have put them in single quotation marks so now we have three elements to our array at key 0 here key 1 and key too so if I want to access say pizza I'm going to say echo food and this time I'm using square brackets this is accessing the key of the Iranian side here the element of each array and I want to say 1 now 1 you'd think normally would be relative to this one but obviously this is 0 this is 1 this is 2 so we're echoing out key 1 of the array food and we know it's an array because we're using square brackets so this will simply echo out pizza so let's refresh and you can see that set out pizza the same as if we change this to 0 that's going to echo out pasta and if we change this to 2 that's going to echo out salad now there's a quick way to see I mean that's basically a raise on the round these are these are just normal arrays that were storing data in now if I wanted to say see all elements of the array I can use the print R here the print R function and all I do is put the name of the array in now this gives us it in a way that we can really understand how this is working so if we refresh you can now see a clear demonstration of how the array works and how they each value is stored so we start off with this array keyword that's just there and if but just out of our demonstration if you were to just echo out the array on its own all your display with is this array keyword you're not given the elements of the array you need to access them individually using the square brackets but for now if we're just using the print our food this is just basically showing us each key of the array so remember it's a key 0 P 1 and Q 2 and the value pasta is assigned to keys ero the value of Pizza is assigned to key 1 and the value of salad is assigned to key 2 so we can see these and access them however long however and many things we add on so for example I could add and on to the end of this and let's just say vegetable and I refresh you can see that that's LM added an a key of 3 with your value of vegetable so this is just basically how arrays work all you really need to know at this point is that you can store many different values inside one data type and then they can be accessed individually but later on we can look at things like associative arrays which give us a bit more flexibility and where we assign not keys but we assign our own our own of keys in in a specific type if you like that allow us to use associative arrays their advantage and also multidimensional arrays but this is just basically arrays as a whole now I've just had a thought you can actually assign values to arrays by you by this so if I was to say food now we've got 0 1 2 3 go into the assigned and a key at key 4 I want to assign something else so I could say fruit so I've assigned a key for the value fruit now obviously I could have just done this in here but if you wanted to do this and say a loop or something like that and this is would be the way to do it late obviously later on in PHP you'll understand why this method is a lot more useful than this method here so let's just go ahead and print our and then array of food which is how we've stored it and refresh and you can see that at the end we've got key 4 here and we've assigned the value of fruit and we've done that in a complete different way but individually it is useful in some circumstances so that's a basic arrays in PHP
