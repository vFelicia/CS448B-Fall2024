what's up guys welcome to your 35th JavaScript tutorial and in this story I'm going to teach you guys how to use something called an associative array now it's kind of different and then the arrays we've been learning before for one main reason instead of using array index numbers to access the elements in our array we can use strings of characters instead so basically words instead of numbers so let's go ahead and let me show you guys an example because if I try to explain it it'll just confuse it if I show you guys an example it'll make it really easy to see what's going on so I'm gonna make an array called Bucky and I'm gonna set this equal to new array let's just go ahead and leave it blank for now now like I said before we learned that you can make an array using index numbers like this but what an associative array does is it allows you to use strings of characters such as the word color and this would set this basically what associative array is and associates a word with another variable instead of a number so now we can set Bucky color equal to bunkies favorite color which is blue it's actually a tie for blue and white but you know I'll use blue it's shorter it's like so aside from that we can add other elements to the Bucky array so instead of you know 0 or 1 or 2 we can make Bucky array index food and this might be equal to my favorite food which is pockets or mac and cheese it's a tie but you know might as well throw hot pockets in there so now as you can see basically all an associative array is is instead of numbers like 0 1 2 you can replace it with characters such as color food name hair color and how you access this is the exact same so now we can go ahead and like make document rights and do something stupid like Bucky's favorite food is and then just go ahead and add a plus and now again like I said to access and the element in the array you're right the name of your array and then you're right the index which is either food or color right here so this is gonna print out Bucky's favorite food is Hot Pockets hopefully as long as I didn't mess anything up so I launched it in Chrome and refresh it and actually I need a semicolon instead of a colon there and now I get Bucky's favorite food is hot pockets so let's take a look at one more quick example and just throw color right in there so now we have an array Bucky that has two elements in it Bucky color was equal to blue and Bucky food which is equal to Hot Pockets so now it's gonna say Bucky's favorite food is blue which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever but hey at least it works so check it out Bucky's favorite food is blue maybe I'm talking about those kablooey because whenever I was in fifth grade I these things called kablooey they're pretty much a jawbreaker but they like dyed your mouth blue what you know why would you want your mouth dyed blue I don't know about I was in fifth grade and I absolutely loved it so so anyways that is what an associative array is it's really simple it's just a little bit different than the arrays that we've been learning before so anyways now you know the concepts of an associative array and by the way let me mention this whenever you're working with arrays in building programs later on like calculators and looking at data and stuff you don't really use associative arrays as long as much as you use the other type of array but they're always nice to know if you ever come across this so anyways that's all I have to say in the next tutorials we're gonna be stepping away from a race and going into another topic so for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and yeah I'll see you guys later
