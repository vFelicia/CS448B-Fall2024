okay I'm Alex from PHP Academy and this is a video tutorial created for the New Boston uh this video tutorial is going to be on PHP Echo now Echo is a language construct within PHP that allows us to Output uh data or string data if you like uh to the user's browser now you can see at the moment I've got a file open in my uh text editor this is uh index.php so we've used our PHP uh file extens mention and we've set up our PHP tags that are going to let us uh enter our um commands if you like within them um and in this video we're going to be focusing on the echo to uh Echo language construct so um I've got the uh page opening my browser or nearly the Page open in my browser um so now I'm uh viewing index.php you can see at the moment obviously there there's nothing uh there's nothing on the page cuz we haven't started uh writing now Echo is like I said a language construct it's not a function um it allows you to basically uh output the screen uh into the browser so how do we write this well it's simply just Echo we can either use double quotation marks or we can use single quotation marks and you'll learn about later on why you should use them and when you should use them uh basically um double quotation marks allow you to uh Echo out variables inside them if you've programmed before you'll know what variables are um however single quotation marks will only let you Echo variables if you append them and we append with a full stop but obviously this tutorial is on uh Echo uh so we're not going to go too much into detail uh remember your line Terminator at the end you need a semicolon at the end of your line uh otherwise we're going to run into uh some errors in fact what we'll do is we'll show that without that so we can see what the errors like in the browser so I just want to say Hello World um if I refresh this uh in my browser you're going to see that we're going to uh well actually we haven't got an error and the reason for this is that we don't have any other lines in the program but uh let's for example uh create a new um a new line here um and just say let's just say hello oh hello again and let's refresh um and you can see that we've got a pass error now it says we're expecting either a comma or a semicolon on the end of line three um so line three is here the reason for this is It's expecting it just before this e um so just before this e is in fact the end of this line we add our semicolon in um and we're working again so this is basically how to Output data to the screen let's just refresh you can see Hello World there again like I said before if you do use double quotation marks uh this is absolutely fine uh it doesn't make a difference it will produce exactly the same output so Within These tags what Within These um these quotation marks what can we actually do now we can also Echo out HTML um to the page because as we Echo out it's rendered as um as uh you would find an HTML page if we put things like uh strong tags for example around this you can see that when we refresh it's taken that into account and we've made this text now bold um you can also you could potentially create a whole HTML document inside an echo um inside a language construct Echo language construct inside these um um speech marks if you like however we tend not to do this we tend to uh just Echo out what we need um I mean things like strong tags uh for bold italics underlined uh sometimes even form data is okay but later on in the series you you'll learn that you know there are other ways to handle this but for now that's basically how you would output data to your browser
