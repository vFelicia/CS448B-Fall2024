so let's just refresh you'll see that now it will go up in I'll actually know I have to go ahead and set this to zero and step this at five so now you can see that it will go up in increments of five pounds so starting from nothing and going all the way up to 400 in increments of five pounds so every time we can only have multiples of five so that would be useful if you were to say step predefined amounts that you wanted to be used only so for example you know how much money do you want to donate you could maybe reduce this to one hundred and step at ten so the user has the option of say donating ten twenty thirty all the way up to one hundred so it makes it a lot clearer to actually for the user to to define obviously you wouldn't when you wouldn't use step if you wanted to allow any value between two particular values which at the moment is one and four hundred so now we're going to take a look at changing the slider to a particular range so at the moment we can only select one value let's just refresh we can only select one value between 1 and 400 now what happens if we want to select a range for example between a certain amount of pounds and then another button just like this between a higher amount for example well we can use the range and we can set this to true now by default this isn't going to look very nice it's just gonna not really work so nothing's really working and this is because we need to define the values that we are starting at so I'm going to define the values and this is an array of integer so let's say 0 and 10 or 20 and 40 for example when we refresh you can see I will need a comma just after that separator you can see that we now have between 20 here and 40 here however when we move this one we get the result that we want when we move this one you know it doesn't really look very nice so we're getting the the value of the absolute value of this first one however this were getting the other value which we don't want we want it to say between this and between this so we need to go ahead and change this value here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to first of all change this two values and then I'm accessing the first key of these two values and then get it append on to and then another pound sign and then I'm going to append on you i dot values and you probably guessed accessing key one this now represents this first here and this now represents this here so we've accessed values as opposed to the actual value of it and we're returning both of the values so now it will be updated to between 19 or 19 and 40 so we could say one to a hundred and something or we could get say sixty two three hundred and something for example so now we're accessing the two points of the slider so this would be useful as I mentioned earlier in the tutorial for something like defining a price between a price range so if you are using this on a retail website you might want to only list items between 1 and then 10 pounds so it's extremely useful in this sense as well now we can also look at other types of bars by changing the orientation so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and change this back to value and I'm going to get rid of this pound sign here and let's go ahead and refresh so now we've got that let's go ahead and get rid of values and get rid of range I'm going to set the maximum value to 100 and refresh so now we've got a simple slider with the range between 1 and 100 now what if I wanted to set the orientation to this to make it a vertical bar so orientation and in here we define vertical so there are a few options for this but I'm gonna go forward vertical here remember comment separate that there when i refresh my height it's not work let's have a look what we've done wrong oh okay yeah so I've spelled vertical wrong so vertical okay so now you'll see that we've got a vertical bar and when we go up you can see that this value changes as well so we've now got from 1 to 100 we've created a vertical bar as well on the jQuery UI documentation it shows a volume mixer as an example which is a I guess a good example of this so there's some obviously practical applications to this depending on what application you are creating so we've essentially covered the basics of the slider there are many more options and obviously more events that you can choose from however if you were to say create something like this and you wanted to implement this value into a database for example or perform a search query when we had the with the vertical bar early horizontal bar sorry you can easily use this slide function or the stop function we also have a stop function as well so when the slider has stopped you could then implement the value into this as well so let's take a look at this quickly I'm gonna create a new event called stop and I'm gonna create a function from this and we're going to alert UI dot value so essentially what you might do here is then implement a value into the database or perform something else when we've stopped us when we've stopped scrolling so now what's going to happen is when I stop scrolling nothing's happened and that's because I need event and UI just in there so we're accessing UI dot value when I stop scrolling you see that we have a dialog box of 49 which is the position that we've left this hour this could then be implemented elsewhere for example if you were say allowing user to scroll with the amount of money say they wanted to borrow you could pass this as a variable on to a next page or if it was for example I've no select your age it could be anything like that you would then on the stop event you would implement this into the database or again store it into a session variable obviously the a protocol applications of this are limitless however for now that's just a basic outline and a few of the options and a couple of the events with the slider widget in jQuery UI
