hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now we've already looked at Ajax and sending data to a page to return an a specific value from this page and we did this with using a name in a text field or some text in a text field we click load and it returns that data now what happens if an error occurs and something can't be processed or for example the page is not available can't be found or returns an error now in this case we need to add a hook onto the end of our Ajax call here in order to actually process or catch this error so what we do is we add a dot and error and this bear in mind comes after the main parentheses that Ajax is within and then we create a function inside of here and we're going to go ahead and pull that down a bit now if there is an error we are going to alert an error occurred now what's going to happen here is we're going to change the name of this file to Page pH which doesn't exist and therefore we should return an error so let's go ahead and refresh and go ahead and type a name in click load and you'll see that the page says an error occurred so you might have seen this happen on sites that use Ajax you might have seen a popup coming up just saying requests not could not be completed etc etc etc we do have other hooks that we can add onto the end of this as well we can use success and we can also use complete as well complete so I'll just talk about what they are and you know what how they work as opposed to actually giving an example complete will always run after the Ajax you know process has been carried out so as long as this is complete you may want to you know you wouldn't you might want to alert the user or you may want to courier carry out another operation once this age Act Ajax request is complete we also have success now this is different to complete complete means that it's run but may have returned an error but success means that the operation has completed successfully the request has completed successfully so that's the main difference between complete and success and we can add these on one after another we can just append them on to each other so there we go we could have perhaps and alert just in here and then you can go ahead and again append on the complete callback so that's the generally what you do with these depending on your use for them error is an extremely useful one because obviously if an error does occur you want to be able to tell your user as opposed to them just having you know a blank page and nothing happening again successful and complete a useful I'd probably say that success is more useful because once this has completed you can then go ahead and do something so that's the or rather these are different event handlers or event callbacks after alger Ajax requests
