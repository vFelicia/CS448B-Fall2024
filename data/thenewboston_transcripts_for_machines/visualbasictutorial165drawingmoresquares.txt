hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer from the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna learn a little bit more about graphics so you can see here that I have the graphics demo open if you don't know what this is you may want to move back to the previous tutorial and we just created this app that whenever you click draw a rectangle it'll draw a rectangle onto the form now you can see that we don't I deleted the code that drew drew the rectangle onto the form and we're gonna be doing something a little bit different now so come over here to form one click your lightning bolt and we need to find the click event so here's our click well doubleclick on it so whenever the person clicks on form 1 what we want to do is let's just say draw new rectangle now we will get an error when we do this because there's no such thing as draw a new rectangle so we need to create it so private sub draw new rectangle and we're going to need the exposition so by the exposition as integer and then the Y position so Y position as integer okay so whenever they draw the rectangle and whenever they click draw a new rectangle let's just go ahead and type G dot draw rectangle will do or let's do a fill rectangle so G dot fill rectangle and we'll do brushes dot let's make it cadet blue and then we will do the exposition so xposition yposition and we'll just make it 60 by 60 okay so now all we need to do is we need to pass the expose position and the Y position to our draw a new rectangle method so you can see here that we have four for more click we have five Alcindor as system object the sender is the object of the form and then we have E as system event args now he has a whole bunch of stuff that we can use so for our event args we're just going to use e dot X and e dot Y but you can see that there is no such thing as e dot X and e dot Y so what we need to do is change to something else so right now is it is system event args we need to change it to Mouse event args so Mouse event arguments so what this is going to do is when we access a dot X it's going to give us the x position of the mouse so a dot X it says gets the xcoordinate of the mouse during the generating Mouse event so we're going to draw a new rectangle at position x and y now you could do all of this right here up in form one click but it's always good to put it in a different method so that's easier to change in the future so we'll go ahead and run this and you can see that when I click the topleft corner of our square is going to be where I clicked again you can see it's going to keep adding new squares so what we can do is so that we create a new square each time we just need to refresh the form so me dot refresh says forces the control to invalidate it's client area and immediately redraw itself so it redraws itself and gets rid of any graphics that are already on there so it draws a square and then when we click it again it's gonna draw a square somewhere else and the squares disappear each time and it draws a new square now we can even draw it behind our button so go ahead put this code in if you have it it's very simple just make sure that you change eetu mouse event args so that you can access the x position and the Y position of the mouse you have any questions leave them in the comments and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
