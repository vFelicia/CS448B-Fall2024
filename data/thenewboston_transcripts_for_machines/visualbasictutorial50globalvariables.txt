hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look and private fields or if you are learning this after learning another language you could call them global variables so let's go ahead and get started we'll create a new project we will select windows forms application and we'll go ahead and call it just global variables now let's go ahead and add a button to our form by using the toolbox and we'll just make it a little bit bigger we'll set the text value to global demo and we'll go ahead and set the name to button global variable okay so now let's go ahead and right click form 1vb and click view code you can also just press f7 so here's our form 1 class you can see there are no event handlers yet because we didn't click double click on anything in here to open up the code we just opened it straight up from form 1vb now what we're going to do is we're going to create a public field or a private field so we can go ahead I'll add a comment here so we will declare a variable that can be used throughout this entire class so we'll go ahead and type the keyword private this tells the compiler that we only want this variable to be used in this class so we'll call it my num as integer and we'll set it equal to 10 now I'll just create a public one so we can do this by typing public instead of private we'll do my public num as integer now we'll go ahead and set that one equal to 32 okay so so let's go ahead and click on the global demo button to create an event for it and what we're going to do is whenever they click on this we're going to go ahead and type message box show and we will just type my num now you can see that we don't get an error error here because we declare these variables outside of any subs or function inside of our form 1 class and we use the private keyword so that only subs and functions inside of form one can use it and access it and now if we create another sub let's just do private sub my sub if we create it and we can set my num equal to 10 or we can set it to a different one and it's going to change my num which is used throughout the whole program so we can just go ahead and call my sub right here and then we can copy this and paste it so what this is going to do is first it's going to access our global variable my num and global just means you can use it throughout the whole class it's going to access that and it's going to give us 10 let's go ahead and just convert that to a string and after we click okay it's going to call my sub which sets my num equal to 14 and then it's going to display that new value and this whole time we're accessing this one variable that can be used throughout our whole class so now if we go ahead and run this you can see that if we click on global demo it pops up a message box that says 10 we click OK and it pops up a message box that says 14 let's go ahead and close out of that now I'll just talk a little bit about my public num now when we use the keyword public if we create another class let's say we create like a forum to class or something we can create an object of forum 1 and access this variable now this may be a little confusing to you but that's fine because we're not going to get into making classes for a while so I'll just keep that in the back of your head and you'll remember that later now you can also just use the dim keyword and what this is going to do is it's going to be private and it's going to let you use it throughout this whole class so we'll just type my public num equals 23 and then we can go ahead and we'll type we'll copy this right here now we'll just go ahead and change this to my public num when really it's private so we'll just change it to private ok so it's going to it's going to display private num and then after this my sub is called it's going to be equal to 23 so let's go ahead and copy this again and we'll display it after my sub is called so let's go ahead and run this we got global demo and this gives us the value of mynum then we click OK this gives us the value of my private num then we click OK we get the new value of my num which is 14 and then we get the new value of my private number which is equal to 23 so for now I would just suggest you guys use the dim statement or the dim keyword instead of private or public because that will just confuse you a little bit more but I wanted to throw that in there because it's something you need to know for later on tutorials so I'm go ahead get some practice with global variables just use the dim keyword for now and it's a very easy concept to understand and once you got it down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
