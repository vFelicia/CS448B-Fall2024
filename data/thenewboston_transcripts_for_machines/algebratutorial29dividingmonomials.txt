ok today we're going to talk about dividing monomials now if you remember from all our factoring work a monomial is just a single term so when we divide my nine monomials we're gonna have two single terms over one another so we're gonna divide the like factors just like when we add and subtract like factors you can only divide like factors so we need to divide this we're gonna divide 18 by negative 3 X to the 6 by X cubed and Y by Y to the 5th so 18 divided by negative 3 is going to be negative 6 when we divide monomials we're gonna subtract the exponents so when we have X to the 6 divided by X to the 3rd we're gonna subtract the exponents so 6 minus 3 and we're going to get X to the 3rd so negative 6 X to the third and we're gonna do the same thing Y to the first divided by Y to the fifth it's gonna be Y it's gonna be 1 minus 5 so negative 4 in order to show that that 4 is negative it's gonna stay on the bottom so it's going to be negative 6 X cubed over Y to the fourth so let's do some examples this is supposed to be to the 6 so when we have the variables with different exponents we're going to subtract the exponents and we're going to get m to the first on top so again we're going to divide only the like terms so 46 divided by 4 sorry I meant 56 divided by 4 is 14 s squared minus s is gonna be 2 minus 1 which is 1 so since it's positive the s goes on top t cubed minus T it's gonna be three minus one gives us two so that stays on top as well we have a couple more examples so we always divide only like numbers so 22 divided by negative 44 is gonna be negative 1/2 2 X 2 this x squared divided by X to the fourth is gonna be 2 minus 4 it's gonna give us a negative 2 so if you remember that means that the x squared stays on the bottom 3 minus 4 is gonna give us a negative 1 so that Y's gonna stay on the bottom as well and 4 minus 2 is going to be positive 2 so that Z squared is gonna stay on top so we have one last problem that we're gonna do 8 divided by 16 is 1/2 X to the first minus X to the third gives us x squared on the bottom 2 minus 1 is gonna give us 1 on top so we're gonna have Y over 2 x squared so like I said that's all we're gonna do with dive with dividing my monomials today make sure to come back and check out our next lesson where we divide a polynomial by a monomial
