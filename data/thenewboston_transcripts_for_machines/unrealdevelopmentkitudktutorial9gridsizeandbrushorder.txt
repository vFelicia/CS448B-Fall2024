all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to your ninth udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys how to change the shape and size of your red Builder brush right here so I know what you guys are saying all right bucket you already taught me that like two tutorials ago anytime you want to change the size of it just go to the scaling mode right here and stretch it to make it bigger or smaller or if you want to stretch it in One Direction select this mode yada y y well that's great and all and you can do that but anytime you want to get a precision exact size it's not the best way to do so in order to change the shape and size of this red Builder brush what we're going to want to do is select the shape we want I'm going to be working with the cube in this tutorial and rightclick right here whenever we right click it our options menu is going to pop up and it allows us to change the size to get an exact specific size now let me go ahead and change this say I'm building a game and I want to give my user or the player a floor to walk around on well let's go ahead and change the size of 1024 by 1024 by 16 or something that's going to give us a nice flat floor right there so let's go ahead and click CSG add to actually add some mass and give us a floor pretty cool huh so with that being said let me say this before I jump in anything else I want to tell you guys why I decided to choose those numbers I mean 1024 and 16 sound like pretty random numbers right well check this out anytime we're working outside the perspective view we see these graphs right here see these little checkboxes right here well they aren't just there for the fun of it they actually symbolize units now you can change what unit they show by changing the size of your drag grid you can change it to something small like two and then you have small little boxes or something big like 64 and then you get big boxes just like that so basically we want to choose a number that corresponds responds with the graph because that way whenever we're lining stuff up we can Precision it exactly how we want it to pretty cool huh so let me go ahead and zoom out here and show you guys that if I chose a number like a TH or 500 then it wouldn't go into this graph evenly and it wouldn't line up with the edges so that's why depending on what size of your graph is you want to choose numbers that correspond with that so that being said let me move on now for the next part of this tutorial I'm going to create another shape because uh it's probably going to be easier to see so let me go ahead and right click on my red Builder brush and change it back to let me go ahead and change it everything to 512 so we get a nice Square Cube and click this and let me go ahead and just move this around let me move it around so it actually just sits right on top and actually move it around a little bit like right there or something now let me go ahead and and build this and as you can see we basically get a cube on a flat sheet right here now let me go ahead and actually move my red Builder brush out of the way just move that right out of the way and I want to talk to you guys about these two different modes now I know before and it was probably four tutorials ago or five or something I told you guys that brush wireframe and wireframe moan were pretty similar similar I mean but they were different in one different way now now is the time that we can cover that let's go ahead and switch to brush wireframe mode in your perspective View and as you can see kind of as expected everything turns this wire frame mode okay that makes sense brush wire frame mode turn my brushes to wireframe mode simple enough so now you're saying all right when I click this it's probably going to look pretty much the same while wireframe mode changes everything to polygons and we can't edit everything check it out we can't move this stuff around now let me me explain to you guys what's going on brush wireframe mode changes everything to wireframe specifically your brushes wireframe mode this one right here only changes meshes and I know I didn't talk to you guys about what a mesh is static meshes different types of meshes but in the upcoming tutorials we're going to be learning about these things called meshes and what this mode does is it only changes your meshes to wireframe so these brushes right here are not meshes so that's why it does not put those in white frame bone and by the way just a quick little tutorial what's going on right here is what your computer is doing is it changes all these shapes to polygons because whenever your computer sees 3D it doesn't really see 3D like you and me see 3D it has to change everything to polygons first and then that's how it sees 3D so you know that's just a nice little side note you don't even have to remember that really because your computer takes care of all that but that's the basics difference between but brush rer fr frame and wireframe so with that being said let me go ahead and get a new document out or new level new scene whatever you want to call it and I want to talk to you guys lastly about something called brush order now before I do that let me say this look at our world right now it's black it's empty it's the beginning of time nothing is there at all so say we wanted to go ahead and create a subtractive brush we would go ahead and hit this and now if we go ahead and move our red brush Builder out of the way we can see in this top view or excuse me this front view right here and the top view and the side view that we get a subtractive brush basically what we're saying is this okay udk we have a universe where nothing exist nothing exists there we go can't talk today so we're basically telling you to take nothing away from nothing so so what we have left with is nothing so we kind of are left where we started from so now let's go ahead and you know this universe is getting kind of bland so in our front view let's go ahead and move this over and you know move it over just to take a nice little chunk out of it so now let's go ahead and whenever we add something you're saying all right well let me change this back to LIT mode so as you can see in our world right here this may look a little different than you expect Ed because if I took my red Builder brush and moved it out of the way look what's going on in this front view right here first we have this additive brush right here which adds Mass but we have this subtracted brush overlaying it so it might be a better view from down here so basically you're saying all right Bucky how come if you have an additive brush right here which means add mesh add mass and you have a subtracted brush right here which means take away Mass it's not taking away the mass so first thing you're going to say is this oh all right Bucky you didn't fool me you told me in the last tutorial anytime you want to update your geometry you need to rebuild it so if I rebuild this geometry then you should see a chunk taken out of this so let's go ahead and rebuild it okay it's rebuilt h no chunk being taken out still kind of weird well the reason that there is not a chunk being taken out of our mass is because of this it has to do with brush order the very first thing we did is we built an empty space and then we added Mass to it so therefore we have our entire Mass right here before in the last tutorial what I did is I built a chunk of mass and then I was able to take something away from it so it has to do with how you order your brushes again if you have an empty space and you add a block of wood to it you're going to have that block of wood that's what we did in this tutorial however if we have a block of wood and then we take out a chunk from it we're going to have a block of wood with a chunk taken away do you get what I'm trying to say it has to deal with the order of your brushes so if you're not getting your results this is the case so you're saying all right that's what brush order is how do we change the order of our brushes well what we want to do is we want to say this all right we want to build this additive brush first build this chunk of MK first and what we want to do is we want to build the subtracted brush last instead of building it first like we just did so in order to do that go ahead and rightclick your subtracted brush and go ahead and let me see if I can find order go ahead and put order to last now instead of the udk building the subtracted brush first it's going to build it last now whenever we rebuild our geometry check it out it's going to build this Mass first and then it's going to take a chunk away from it instead of you know just creating a void empty space and adding a chunk to it is going to going to create the chunk first and then take space away from it so that's your basics of brush order I know it's kind of weird to twist around your head you know adding nothing to nothing then something to nothing then something from nothing o but but that's the basics of it if you're not getting your results to change your brush order so that's all I want to talk to you guys about in this tutorial how to change the size of your brushes how you can change your size of your brushes depending on what GD size you're working with and also the difference between brush WIP frame and wireframe mode and lastly your brush order so with that being said we're ready to move on to next topic so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe
