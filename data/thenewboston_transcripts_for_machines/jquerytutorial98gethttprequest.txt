now we need to think of a name for this variable name so let's go back to ax. JS now you do this inside uh curly brackets and the uh each value you send to this file is comma separated so the first one we're going to well the only variable we're going to send is the string so I'm going to uh call the variable input and I'm going to make this equal to string now this might look bit odd essentially this input here is what we would um use in PHP to grab this so input is the name of the variable that we've sent and string is obviously the variable we created earlier with the string data from this text field so now that we've done that um we would you well I mean if we needed to supply additional parameters we could say um input two string two something like that so they you'll comma separate every single value that you um include the third parameter is a callback function which in this case is extremely important now after we've sent the data to this file this PHP reverse. PHP file we want to be able to return the data that's sent back from reverse. PHP and in this case we're reversing the string using the sgr Rev function in PHP so we need to create a callback function and again we create a block here which we can pull just down and in here it will make it easier to write the code but we need to give this function a parameter and that's going to equal the value that's returned by reverse. PHP so in this case I'm going to write data now data will contain everything that is sent from reverse. PHP so the the output contents of reverse. PHP will then be stored inside data so inside of our um callback function here what we can actually do is go ahead and put this data here into a div underneath here so let's go and create a div I'm going to call this feedback and I'm going to end the div there I'm obviously not going to write anything in there because uh we're going to have um jQuery handle that for us so in in ajax.gif is I want to um use a selector and I'm selecting the feedback div and then I'm going to say do text and then in Brackets I'm going to write data so let's just go ahead uh and explain again what we're doing we're sending data to this file here we're sending a variable called input with the value string which we've retrieved up here we're then using a callback function and we're grabbing dat data here that's sent back from this reverse. PHP file we're then putting this data inside the feedback div that we created on our index page so hopefully that makes sense so far now what we're going to do is test out um our our HTTP request now at the moment nothing really here um is is uh useful because we haven't created any code inside reverse. PHP however what I'm going to do is I'm just going to Simply come in create some PHP tags and Echo out test now what's going to happen is despite the fact that we've sent this variable here data will now contain the value test because we've echoed this outto the page the page contents will now become available in this data variable so our feedback div will contain the value test let's go over to our page and uh test this out so despite what I type in here now nothing's really going to you know work because uh we haven't created anything uh interesting uh we've just echoed out test from our PHP file however when I click go you can see that the value test has been returned and placed inside that div so now that we know that the HTTP request has worked we need to work on the PHP file in order to manipulate this input and then uh return the Reversed string so the first thing we want to do is check if the variable is set so we're going to say if is set dollar uncore get and in here we need to supply the variable name and that is input so input so if that is set we can go ahead and create a new variable and that's going to be um that's going to just grab this value here which we obviously have in get input so this is going to be string is equal to dollor getet input so now string is equal to um the posted variable here which comes originally from the text box so now what we can do is Echo St Str rev which is a simple function that reverses a string and we Supply that with one parameter which is the original string so now what's going to happen is when we refresh our page and type something else in I'm going to type my name and click go you can see that PHP has returned the Reversed version of what we originally typed in the text input field so we've now successfully performed a get HTTP request using jQuery now like I've said in um another part of this a these Ajax uh jQuery tutorials is that if we were to do this with Ajax on its own pure Ajax we would be writing um a lot more lines than we are now so although some of this looks complicated uh some of the syntax looks complicated especially with these brackets uh and this callback function here hopefully the concept is understandable to you and you can now go ahead and start to test with this in the next video we're going to look at the uh post HTTP request as well and a bit about why we might use that instead of get but for now we have created a short piece of code which sends data to the reverse. PHP file and then returns a reversed version of the string
