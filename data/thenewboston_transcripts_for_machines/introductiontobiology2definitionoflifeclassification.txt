welcome back everyone I hope you all had a great st. Patrick's Day I know I did but my name is Sarah and in this video I'm going to be covering life diversity of life and the classification system since biology is the study of life you may ask yourself what exactly is life well scientists haven't been able to agree upon a standard definition of life because for every definition that is put out there there's always going to be an exception however they have been able to agree on some common characteristics that all forms of life share these characteristics include organization life is highly organized homeostasis which is the maintenance of a constant internal environment such as temperature water concentrations things like that adaptation which is the ability of an organism to survive in their environment reproduction and heredity you have to be able to pass your genes on to future cells too in order to ensure the survival of your species growth and development energy acquisition and release response to stimuli and interaction with your environment although life is similar in some ways there are millions of different types of living organisms and in order to identify and study these organisms scientists have organized them into groups this is called classification also known as the study of taxonomy the first person to do a largescale classification of organisms goes by the name of Carl Linnaeus he made up this system in 1753 and he started off by organizing things by structure and Anatomy and things like that and there are seven categories kingdoms being the broadest and species being the most specific category the basic univ unit of classification is species and species are groups of similar organisms or individuals that can mate and produce fertile offspring some examples of species would be red wolves or humans are their own species or African elephants or houseflies they're in very rare instances species like closely related species can mate but the offspring they produce are infertile therefore their offspring are not considered a separate species Carl Linnaeus also introduced the binomial nomenclature system which is a way of naming organisms or species he used the genus which is a group of one or more related species and the actual species itself ie humans are called Homo sapiens Homo being the genius genus and sapien being these species and the language used is Latin which is a universal language all scientists use Latin to name organisms it just makes things easier so scientists in Germany were to say Homo Sapien scientists in Japan would know what they were talking about the largest and most inclusive category of classification are Kingdom's and in modern biology there are six kingdoms we have the archaea bacteria and you bacteria which were previously grouped into one Kingdom called manera we have Protista fungi Plantae and Animalia the characteristics of different kingdoms we start off with manera which are classified as single cell or small colony or a small colony of cells all of which are prokaryotic and prokaryotic means that they lack and organize nucleus and other membranebound organelles and they also have a circular chromosome and as I mentioned Venera is now broken up into two separate kingdoms we have the archaea bacteria these are bacteria that live in very extreme environments environments with very low oxygens such as swamps or marshes extreme temperature hot springs places that normal bacteria could not survive or places of high salt concentrations like the ocean you bacteria are just your everyday bacteria they live in your body on your skin rotten food in your dog's nose pretty much everywhere there are even you bacteria that are found in some extreme environments so the main difference between archaea bacteria and you bacteria is their biochemistry and the fact that they have an independent evolutionary history we now move on to Protista these are unicellular or multicellular organisms that do not have specialized tissues these are eukaryotic which means they have membrane bound organelles which are cellular structures and Protista this is a very very diverse diverse group of organisms an example of a protist would be plankton from Sponge Bob Squarepants if any of you watched that show it was one of my favorites when I was younger I still watch it and I'm almost 23 so anyways our next Kingdom is fungi these are non motile which means they can't move and plant like they can't make their own food so they have to absorb nutrients from their environment their cell walls are made of a molecule called chitin examples of fungi include mushrooms mold and yeast without yeast we wouldn't have beer we wouldn't have bread the world would not be a happy place the next Kingdom is plant a these organisms can make their own food by what is called photosynthesis they are also eukaryotic and their cell walls are composed of a molecule called cellulose and the final kingdom is Animalia all members of this kingdom are multicellular and eukaryotic they can't make their own food they are however capable of mobility for example if we want food we drive to the grocery store and we get it if a plant wants food it's it's just got to sit there and wait until something comes in the soil and the last thing I'm gonna cover in this video are levels of organization all organisms have all matter have atoms these atoms come together to form what are called molecules I'll explain this a little bit in a look ah in a lot more detail whenever I cover basic chemistry and probably my next video video after the next sometime in the near future but anyways molecules come together to form what are called organelles organelles are a subunit of a cell and they're involved in a specific function within the cell organelles come together to form what is called a cell and the cell is the fundamental unit of life must have metabolic chemicals and heredity information and not all cells have organelles only eukaryotic cells do anyways cells come together to form tissues and tissues are groups of cells doing a specific function tissues come together to form organs organs come together to form an organ system and organ systems grouped together to form an organism in multicellular organisms single cellular organisms are just one cell but that is all I have for this video I'll see you next time
