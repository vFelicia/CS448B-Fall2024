so the first thing to do is up here I'm just trying to think of we should it within this yeah we'll do it within this so if not logged in so the first thing to do is to check if each form field exists in our form so if everything's been correctly submitted and we use the is set function for this so if is set we can pull this down and it's going to look a bit better readability so if is set dollar underscore post username and is set dollar underscore post password and is set dollar underscore post pass one again and we go down the list and we just basically input and copy the code for everything so we've got first name and then we've got Sano so let's go and bring this up there and bring this up there so we're using this to check if each if each field has been submitted so we've got user name password password again used in puzzle first that's fine so now we open up to our block now what we need to do is check in fact we'll put this all on one line just so it's out the way okay so now what we need to do is we need to check if they're empty or not so let's come down again so it looks a bit neater so if not empty in fact what we'll do before this is we will create and the variables in themselves because we've already checked we're not going to we're not going to receive an undefined index error so now we can set them into their own variables because we know they exist so username equals dollar underscore post username password equals dollar underscore post password then we obviously have password again and that equals dollar underscore post and the field name is password again then we have a first name and that's equal to the Lance corpus name and the same with surname so we're finally at the last one you can probably see now why I didn't include a relevant data that wouldn't fit the suitability of the tutorial we're not going to go down and create loads of fields otherwise we'd be here for hours typing out things when I'm sure after this you'll be able to work out how to add your own fields so we've got the fields that we need and password again is something we're not going to be inserting into the database that's just going to be Froch inside here the first thing we want to do is check if all fields have been filled in because all fields are required so let's say if not empty user name and not empty password and not empty password again and not empty first name and last but not least not empty surname okay so now we can create a block to see if these are not empty to run if these are not empty I mean but otherwise we need to give a message to our user we need to say please fill or say all fields are required are equal wired okay so this is our error inside here we can echo okay for now just to see if everything exists if this okay does not echo and nor does this we all know will this will we know that we might have an error and we have inputted all data we know that we might have an error without naming or something like that so always check that if you if you receive an error so let's go ahead and click the button register button without typing any data in we get the message all fields are required let's just enter one all fields are required so let's fill them all out now one two three firstname Alex and then Garret let's click register and we've got the message up the top okay now you'll probably notice that the like let's say we were to enter our username our password and our first day but we were to exclude our surname and we click register we have this error up here but you've noticed that all the fields have now disappeared because we've resubmitted back to the page we are not keeping these values so what we do is is we take these values here and we input them into our our field and we do this using the value here so if I was to say value of username equals Alex you can see that when we refresh it says Alex so what we can do is what the data that's already submitted we can include within this form so if we open up PHP tags we're writing inline code now we can echo out the username so what will happen is though the page will be submitted this variable here will be set to Alex for example might be set to billy it might be set to anything but then we'll come down and even if we get this error we're still going to be putting this value in here so let's do that to all fields not the password fields because we don't them to remain so for the first name we want to open up PHP tags echo firstname and for the surname value equals PHP tags echo surname done so now we can return to our page I'm going to enter Alex I'm going to put my password in and I'm going to type in my first name now if we click register you can see that our username and our firstname stay and our surname is obviously blanks we didn't enter it in the first place but our passwords have gone this is just for security reasons you don't want to keep the password in there most websites don't so I don't recommend you do now if we click register we haven't entered the password so all fields are required again we've clicked register our information is staying we enter our information click register and it's okay
