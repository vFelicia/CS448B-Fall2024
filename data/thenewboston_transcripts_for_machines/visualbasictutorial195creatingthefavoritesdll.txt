hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash online gamer from the new boston and in this tutorial we're going to create a class library based on our favorite saw BB web favorite BB and web favorite collection now before we get started I just want to give full credit to the writers of beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 they did a great job of making this program it is written by Kieran Willis and Brian Newsome so let's go ahead and get started so what we need to do to create a class library is we'll come over here to file and we need to add a new project so we're going to select a class library and we'll just name it internet favorites and then we'll go ahead and click OK so you can see here over in our solution Explorer we have favorites viewer you do and then we have our internet favorites class library so let's just go ahead and right click on this and set it as the start up project now here you can see it generated a class 1 dot VB for us and we're gonna be getting rid of rid of that soon so we'll take a web favorite collection we'll rightclick it and we'll copy it and we'll just come down here and we need to paste it under internet favorites so we'll select paste now you can't see that but if you right click there will be an option to paste it so now that we have one in there let's go ahead and delete class 1 dot V B so now we have width favorite web favorite collection VB so we'll copy over web favorite so copy it select internet favorites and then paste it and now we'll copy favorites so copy favorites select internet favorites and then just go ahead and paste it okay so now we pasted favor saw BB web favorite dot VB and web favorite collection down in our internet favorites class library project so we'll right click on internet favorites and we will click build so it's gonna run through the process and let's see here we have an error message box is not declared so what we need to do is we need to use an import statement so let's find out where this is we'll double click on this error and you can see here that it is in the favorites class so what we need to do is we need to import windows dot or system dot Windows or C so it looks like that we cannot import system that windows soft forms so what we need to do is select internet favorites we will come up here to project and we will add a reference so we'll go to dotnet and we'll find system dot windows dot forms we'll go ahead and click OK and now if we go ahead and use imports system dot windows forms it will let us use our message box top so now let's find the other occurrence of this error so we'll need to import system not windows dot forms so in order for us to use a message box in a class library we're going to have to import we're gonna have to reference a deal a DLL for system dot windows off forms and we'll have to import it so now we'll go ahead and try to build it again and you can see that says build succeeded so let's go into our internet favorites we'll go to bin and then release you can see here is our internet they it's dll now yours will probably have a different icon because my icon is set to open with ILS il spy so here's our internet favorites DLL and we can use this in creating new applications now whenever we want to be able to access our internet favorites and get the names and the URLs and store them in a collection
