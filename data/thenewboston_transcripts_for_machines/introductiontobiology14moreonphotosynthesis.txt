welcome back everyone it's sarah and in this video i'm going to go through the light phase of photos this is the light phase is composed of two components you've got two photosystems you've got photosystem 2 i'm also called p680 because the chlorophyll a absorbs light at a wavelength of 680 nanometers photosystem 1 or p700 the chlorophyll a molecule absorbs light at a wavelength of 750 700 nanometers the whole purpose of the photosystems is to capture light energy and then that light energy is transferred to other molecules to produce energy intermediates basically the light is going to excite pigment molecules in both photosystems one and two photosystem to the excited electrons are going to travel to photosystem 1 water is going to be oxidized to form oxygen gas and hydrogen ions and the energy release in the electron transport chain which transfers the electrons from photosystem 2 to photosystem 1 and eventually to NADPH is also used to form to contribute to the hydrogen ion gradient and photosystem 1 its main goal is to produce NADPH another important aspect of the light dependent reactions is the formation of ATP synthesis and this is driven by the flow of hydrogen ions from the thylakoid lumen or the space within the thylakoid into the stroma by the enzyme ATP synthase and the hydrogen gradient is generated by the addition of hydrogen ions and thylakoids by the splitting of water the addition of hydrogen ions by the electron transport chain pumping hydrogen ions into the lumen and the removal of hydrogen ions by the formation of nadph in the stroma and it's a removal because you take those hydrogen ions and stick them on to an adp to form NADPH so a quick overview of what happens you've got oxygen produced in the thylakoids by the transfer of two electrons from water to the oxidized form of the chlorophyll a the p680 molecule NADPH is produced in the stroma from the highenergy electrons being transferred transferred from photosystem 2 to photosystem 1 so you've got your nadp+ two electrons plus a hydrogen ion all come together to form NADPH and then nad excuse me ATP is produced in the stroma from the hydrogen ion gradient so you have two types of electron flow in the light dependent reactions of photosynthesis you've got noncyclic which is where electrons flow from photosystem to the photosystem 1 and eventually to NADPH and in noncyclic flow equal amounts of ATP and NADPH are produced but then you've got cyclic phosphorylation this is when the electrons in photosystem 1 are excited and they release energy which causes the transport of hydrogen ions into the lumen of the thylakoids this drives the synthesis of ATP but instead of these electrons being transferred to NADPH their return to photosystem 1 to be recycled to produce more ATP this normally happens when the cell is low on ATP so the first complex involved in photosynthesis the light dependent reactions you got your photo system two got two components components there's a light harvesting complex or antenna complex this is going to directly absorb photons and transfer energy from residents or transfer bot double bonds electrons all that good kind of stuff then you got the reaction center which has your p680 molecule your p680 molecule is going to be oxidized whatever it gives up an electron this is very unstable so whenever the electron from your p680 is transferred to a primary after your p680 star which is the oxidized form is going to want to remove an electron from water to replace the p680 star and reduce it back down 2 p6 steady p680 and this is going to yield oxygen and this is the only transfers a one electron at a time it takes to water molecules to break apart to form the 02 but basically this what's happened photosystem 2 reminds me of the giant brain from blaster master I think it's at the Boston level 1 or level 2 or whatever so I drew a little picture of blaster master here the giant branes little electrocution thingies spending around him and blaster masters like WTF giant brain oh my god but anyways light is going to come in here and it's going to hit this it's going to cite excite these pigment molecules one of these pigment molecules is going to kick off an electron which is going to be kicked up picked up by the p680 this p680 is going to absorb a photon at the 680 nanometer wavelength it's going to excite these electrons and then it's going to kick one of these electrons up to the primary acceptor molecule or it's going to go down the electron transport chain all the way to photosystem 1 so it's going to be picked up by the p700 where p700 is going to be read by a photon of wavelength 700 nanometers is going to kick out this electron to another electron acceptor and it's going to travel down the electron transport chain until it reaches NADPH and this is what's known as the Z scheme because it's the electron starts at a relatively high energy it's passed down to a lower state of energy and then it's kicked up again to a higher state of energy and ends of it NADPH so now we have all this ATP nadph so in the next video I'm going to cover the Calvin cycle which uses as ATP and nadph to make sugars
