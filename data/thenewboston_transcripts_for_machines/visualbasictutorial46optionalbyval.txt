hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at default parameters now basically what this means is let's say you're creating a sub or a function and you want the user or the developer to be able to pass a value to that function but you don't want to force them to do that so you can give them the option to give you let's say a title for example so if they want to give you a title then it will go ahead and let them pass that to the function but if they don't give you anything for that spot it's not going to return it's not going to give them an error it's going to set the default value for it so let's go ahead and make a little demo application for this so we'll type we'll go ahead and select new project we will name it optional make sure you have selected Windows forms application and then click okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to come over here to our form one we'll resize it some and we'll open up the toolbox now what we're going to do is we're going to add a text box and another text box now the first text box is going to be our title and the second text box is going to be our message now I'll just add a button called show message so we'll resize that a bit so it'll fit in and we're going to go come over here to our textbox one and we'll rename that to text title and we'll re rename this one to text message so now let's close out of our toolbox and we'll double click on show message to open up the event handler for that and once we're in here I'll zoom in so now what we're going to do is we are going to create a sub so we're going to to start off with the keyword private and then we'll use sub and we'll call it show message and now what we're going to do is we are going to force the caller of this sub to enter in a message so we'll do by by Val message as string and then we're going to have them enter in a title now they can enter in a title if they want but they don't have to and the way we do this is by using in the keyword optional so we'll type optional by Val title as string so they can call show message with only one argument and it'll still work fine so we'll go ahead and press enter and then we'll type end sub now what we need to do is set a default value for our typ title now you cannot use optional unless you have a default value set so what we're going to do is we're going to add an equal sign here so optional by Val title as string is going to be equal to default title and so now we'll just do messagebox Dosh show message and title now this isn't very practical but it's to teach you the concept of optionals and um using default parameters so now let's go up here to our button one click and we're going to call show message but there's a couple things we need to do first we will declare a variable so dim message as string and it's going to be equal to text text message. text now we're going to create a title uh variable so dim title as string and it's going to be equal to nothing so now what we're going to do is we're going to create a simple if statement to see if the user has typed anything in the title so what how we do this is we're going to do if text title. textlength is greater than zero then go ahead and do this now what this does is it gets the length of the text inside that text box and you can see that says text length as integer gets the length of the text in the control so if they actually entered something in a text title then what we're going to do is title is equal to text tile. text now what we're going to do is we're going to show message so show message and then we'll do message and title now what if they didn't type anything into the text title to handle this we're just going to add an else so we'll just type else right here so if text title. text length is greater is um equal to zero or less than zero which it cannot be less than zero it's either zero or something greater than that so if it is equal to zero then we'll just go ahead and show message and then we'll pass mage message to it and no title and it will show it will set the title to default title so let's go ahead and run this and here's our form right here if we go ahead and set something as the title we'll type hello and then hello YouTube if we click show message you can see the title is set to hello and it sh shows hello YouTube now if we take out hello and leave it as nothing you can see that when we click show message it's it says default title right there so let's go ahead and close out of that so um go ahead and make some subs or functions if you'd like and play around with optional buy vals or use you can use optional buy vals with bu vales and with byrs go ahead mix and match those get a lot of practice with that and then once you're done with that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching guys
