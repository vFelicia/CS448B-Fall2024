hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to creating the exit menu item so we could go ahead and add a new class to our favorites viewer tray but we don't need to create a new file all we need to do is create a class within our web favorite menu item so we'll call it public class exit menu item and then we'll just go ahead and press enter and we need to have it inherit from menu item so that we can use it as a menu item just like all of our favorites so we need to create a Constructor for this so we'll do Public Sub new so whenever a a new exit menu item is created we're going to set the text of that which is uh the C caption of the menu item we're going to set that equal to exit so once this is created text is going to be equal to exit so now what we need to do now what we need to do is we need to access the click event of this um menu item so we'll come over here to exit menu item and we'll open up the events for that and we'll click on the click event so whenever exit menu item has been clicked we would we just want to type application. exit so what this does is it uses application which is um let's read the description here it's provides static methods and properties to manage an application um to start and stop an application and to do other stuff so it's going to access our application that we've created or our exe and exit now this is selfexplanatory it says informs all message pumps that they must terminate then closes all application Windows after the messages have been processed so what that means is basically if there's uh let's say a message box open um once you click okay it's going to exit the application so now that we've created our web favorite menu item and our exit menu item we're going to have to add those to our notify icon so we'll go ahead and come over here into form 1vb and under form one VIs changed we want to go ahead and access the load event so we can do this by just clicking form one events and we can scroll until we find load so this will add the form one load event so whenever the form one loads we want to go ahead and create a favorites an object of the favorites class so we'll just create it um inside of form one so that it's not created when the form one loads so we will type public favorites as new favorites or we'll do internet favorites. favorites so we created an object of favorites and what favorites does is it creates a collection of web favorite objects and stores them so that we can use them so it reads through all your favorites stores them in web favorite objects and then adds those to the collection so that we can use them so we have our web favorite here uh let's go to form one so we have our favorite right here so public favorites as new interet favorites. favorites and whenever the form loads we just want to scan the favorites so favorites. scan favorites and now what we need to do is create a context menu so we'll call it object menu as new context menu and I forgot to do this um in the previous tutorial and in this tutorial but full credit for this program goes to the writers of beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 um thean Willis and Brian Newsome they created this great app and I am teaching you guys how you can make it yourself so a context menu would be like this whole menu right here this whole file menu so new project would be a menu item open project would be a menu item open file would be a menu item and then this whole thing is a context menu and now this isn't going to take any arguments so go ahead put this code in if you haven't already um if you have any questions leave them in the comments uh and then if you don't have any questions move on to the next tutorial
