what's up guys welcome back um my name is Bucky yada yada welcome to your 37th p p tutorial yeah yeah yeah anyways in the last tutorial what we did is we created a class called people and in that class we created a name variable and a function called set name and all this function did is it took this name and it changed it to you know whatever we want to we'll learn that later on so anyways in this tutorial what we're going to be doing is we're going to be dealing with something called object so go ahead and in your body throw some PHP tags in there and here's what you need to do an object is pretty much a representation or it's pretty much this it's a way to access all those variables and functions in that class so say for this say we made this huge program and not only did it have this people class in it but it also had an animals Class A cars Class A places class a computer class we need an object that's only going to access the things in this people class we don't need the rest of that crap right now we only want to work with this class right here so let's go ahead and create an object right now um go ahead and it's just like any other variable I'm going to name mine person one go ahead and set it equal to the keyword new and then type the name of the class you want to use and our class is called people people looks kind of weird once you look at it kind of reminds me of pineapple in a way but anyways go ahead and type the name of your class and then go ahead and type um empty braces and I'll be covering again like I said these dumb keywords and these other signs these braces and stuff I'll be covering those later on but anyways in order to create an object you go ahead and just make any variable and set it equal to the keyword new and then the name of your class with empty parentheses and now this person one variable can access any of these variables and any of these functions in this class so like I said if you had another class called animals and another one called cars you knew that this variable was going to access the one the people class so that's why we need to create objects to ask access access the things in that class so now we have a key to access anything in this people class through the variable person one so let's go ahead and do that right now let's go ahead and Echo something out on the screen in order to access anything in that class go ahead and type the name of your object which is person one and then go ahead and put that little dumb operator minus greater than sign and now go ahead and type the name of the variable you want to access so let's go ahead and type name and what's this going to do right here well it's going to say all right what object are you using person one which is pretty much your people class so pretty much an object is basically the same thing as the class so when we use person one we say all right we want to work with the people class now what do we want to Echo inside of it and that's just this name variable but check this out whenever we created this class we didn't set the name equal to anything the name isn't equal to anything until we call this function so whenever we call this right here nothing is going to display and actually here's what I'm going to do whoa definitely messed that up break and just like that so now what this Echo is going to do is it's going to Echo nothing at all because our name isn't equal to anything at all so now what we have to do is use this this person one variable to which is pretty much an object to call the set name function and set this name equal to something so again anytime you want to access anything in this class you have to use this object this object is like a key for that class so now we use the object and instead of accessing a variable we want to access this function called set name so set name and what do we want it again this function takes one parameter and sets it equal to the name variable so I'm going to go ahead and pass in Bucky and that looks pretty good right there so anyways this is going to Echo a blank Line This is going to say all right in our class people we want to use the function set name and we want to pass in the value Bucky so it's going to go up to the class people it's going to grab the function set name and it's going to pass it in Bucky and it's going to say all right now the name variable is equal to Bucky which is my name so now once we Echo this again it's now going to Echo Bucky so at first your name wasn't equal to anything at all and then we called the function set name and passed in Bucky and now once we Echo that it's going to be equal to the value Bucky so let me go ahead and refresh this hold on a second and just copy all those yes and refresh that all right here we go so anyways yeah I don't like to use uh like xpp or W MPP anymore I just use it straight from you know one of the little websites I bought so that's what I was doing right there so anyways you can see right now here's my website at first it echoed out nothing a blank line right here because name wasn't equal to anything at all and then we called the function set name and then it echoed out Bucky because then the name variable was equal to Bucky so let's take a step back and recap one last time and cover everything we just learned because I know it can be really confusing a class is pretty much a way to organize data and by data I mean your functions and your variables so we made a class called people and inside of that class called people we made two things one was a variable called name and one was a function that changed that name so in order to access that class you need to make something called an object and an object is pretty much a way to access all the stuff inside of a class so we made an object called person one which gave us access to everything inside of the class people now now that we had access ACC to that class the first thing we decided to do with our object was Echo out the variable name however right now that name wasn't equal to anything it was just a plain old variable so that's why it echoed out a blank line but then we said all right now that we can do something with this class let's go ahead and call that set name function and set that variable equal to the word Bucky so now the variable name is equal to the word Bucky and now when we Echo it out again it's going to Echo the word Bucky so anyways the basic thing that you have to take away from this tutorial is a class is a way to organize your variables and your functions anytime you want to use any of this crap you need you need to make something called an object and with this object you can use any of this stuff in here so that's the basics of objectoriented PHP um the basics of you know classes Fields objects and in the next couple tutorials I'm going to be covering all these dumb little keywords and maybe throw in some more variables maybe make some more functions who knows I don't even know what I'm going to be doing so anyways it's going to be sweet and you're going to learn more about object oriented PHP and definitely if you want to get a job um using PHP this is what everyone uses now classes and objects and objectoriented coding and you're going to see why it's useful later on but but for now I guess you guys are just going to have to wait so thank you guys for watching um don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
