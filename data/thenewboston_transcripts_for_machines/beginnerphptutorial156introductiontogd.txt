hello this is Alex from PHP academy' all back with another video for the new Boston now in this short tutorial series about GED inside PHP we're going to be talking about what GD is and we're going to be doing a variety of things with GD and it's called the GD library it doesn't actually come with PHP by default so it's a library that you have to either install yourself or because we're using the xampp package as shown in my previous tutorials how to install it in windows GD will already come preinstalled with this and what we do is we use PHP directly and using this GD library what we can actually do is we can generate and we can also modify graphics so let's take an example and just speak about an example of what what how you might find GD useful now you may have seen websites that allow you to upload images or or groups of images so multiple images and you may find that these are watermarks I know eBay when you are upload an image it creates a little watermark in the bottom right hand corner which sort of you know gives the image some kind of relation to the website and this doesn't have to be a translucent watermark image it can in fact be some text so you can generate text with GD you can also watermark another image over over an image so there's a variety of things that you can do with the GD library now another example maybe you may have seen registration forms that ask you to enter some distorted characters or blurred outs or stretched characters and you'll obviously know this is for security purposes now why do we do this we use we use what called a capture form or capture image if you like to allow only humanbased registrations or submission of data through a form so for example if you have a form and you want to the data to be submitted but not submitted in mass we use something called a capture image or security image really there is only human readable or most of the times of 90 plus percent of the time is human readable so the the distorted text has to be just has to be read and then input into another box by a user for the form to you know or for the user of the website for the owner of the website to be satisfied that only humans can register with this form then obviously if the incorrect image is entered or the text from the image is entered then it's asked to be done again so this prevents automatic submission of data through forms now another way to use THD which is a less commonly used method but a really interesting good way to use the GD library and by the way capture forms or security images if you like and not always used with GD so there's a variety of ways you can do this but in my future tutorials that you may watch you'll see that we deal with creating our own capture image using Gd so we're going to be using GD to Crower own and not allow a form to be submitted unless this image is correct so now another use like I said is less commonly used but a really really great great way to go about things is let's say I've registered on a website and I was to output my email address so this might be anything at anything calm now my email address let's say we output on my profile page now if my email address is in text form so it's in text form that can be picked up by say a robot for example it's been programmed to go through websites and pick up web a pick up email address is so you'll see some people choose to write the email address like this sorry like this or they might do something like dot there and then at there in brackets as well viceversa using different symbols this is just simply for security purposes that they do this however a great way to store an email address when displaying it in a profile page to enhance the security of this so email addresses can't be collected in max this gives sort of peace of mind to your users if you store it in an image forum so what we can do is we can store this exactly as text so it can be text but we store it as an image so it can't be easily picked up by these bots now I'm not saying it can't be picked up at all of course it can because the point of capture forms being distorted is so it's hard for a bot to read or a computer program if you like to read but just by adding this into an image which is quite a simple process using GD just gives that added security so it's a lot more secure to store text as image if you don't want it to be automatically picked up by a piece of software that might be trading through websites trying to collect specific information so the GD library like I said is really useful for mainly these three things that could you can obviously use it for a variety of purposes it can it can take images and change them we can change colors we can change anything really we're not going to go into the complexities of these things because there are loads and loads and loads of functions used within GD it's a massive massive library with lots of functions and lots of ways to do this so I'm just going to give you sort of an introduction we're going to use these three examples we're going to change some text like this so an email address into an image we're also going to be looking at watermarking images as we upload them or just or just looking a function to walk watermark images so you can combine this with an upload script and we're also going to look at creating our own capture form so that's basically the GD library and what its useful if you are using it if you're having trouble using it so if the functions that you're giving that we're going to look at in other tutorials aren't working I suggest you go and google for GD have a look at downloading it and installing it but otherwise I'd highly recommend you use it preinstalled on a package such as xampp like I'm using and then it'll already already be there for you installed and it will be available to use
