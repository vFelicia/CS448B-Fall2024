what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome to another backham tutorial now in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is covering the rest of the rules at back aming and once I cover the rest of rules then we can begin talking about strategy but for now there's some other rules that I didn't teach you yet that we need to know in order to play the game correctly and the first thing is this you know how in the last histori I told you that when you roll two numbers like for example if you're roll a five and a one you can move one of your checkers one and and one of them five spaces 1 2 3 4 5 or what you could do is you can add them together and move one six 1 2 3 4 5 6 just like that well here's the thing whenever you roll doubles let's say you rolled a three and a three just like that whenever you roll doubles you might be thinking logically in your head that I can either move one three and then another three or I can move one six and then that would be my turn but something happens whenever you roll doubles not only do you got two turns but you get four turns so this pretty much counts as four threes instead of two and if you had two fives it would be four fives instead of just two fives so let's go ahead and play this double three right here I can go ahead and move this one one 2 3 that's one um 1 2 3 that would be two two 1 2 3 that would be three and let's just go ahead and move this one again 1 2 3 that would be four so as you can see not only do you get two moves you get four moves and that's the same with any doubles double sixes double fours whatever so that's your move right there the next thing I want to talk about is hitting your opponent and that doesn't mean you know uppercut donkey punch them I mean hitting their chips so you know when I said that you can't land let me uh move these around getting Prime for hitting there we go you know when I said that there we go that's a little bit better okay let's recoup here we go you know when I said that you can't land on one of the spots or one of the points that your opponent has a checker on well there's one exception to this Rule and this is probably the coolest thing about back gaming whenever they only have one checker on a point this is called a blot and you're able to hit this it pretty much means it's vulnerable so let's go ahead and say you're roll uh that's not a good roll that's not a good one either a three and a two what you can do is since with one two you can land on this since there's only one Checker there you can hit it and knock it off the board and put it on the bar now if there were two Checkers there or three or anything thing with two or greater you couldn't land on it this is only with one checker on a point so for example where was that right there I think and now let's go ahead and say that this was a four 1 2 3 4 is there one Checker there yes so I'm going to go ahead and hit that and take them off and whenever you hit them you put them on the bar and this pretty much means they have to restart from the beginning remember my point my one point is down here my 24 point is up here so now instead of you know I was so close to finishing I have to go all the way around the board again off the bar so that is how you hit blots or hit Checkers when there's only one checker on point so now you're saying all right Bucky now that these Checkers are on the bar how are you supposed to get these Checkers off we'll check this out say I roll a three and a four just like I did right here now I'm not going to be able to move any of these Checkers until all of my Checkers are off the bar so if I can't make a move then I have to pass my turn so for example here's what I would do I rolled a three and a four remember 1 2 3 I can't do that because there are two or more so I'm going to have to use my four only so that's the only move I can make for my turn and remember I can't move this one three because I still have Checkers on the bar so pretty much as long as you have Checkers on the bar the only thing that you can do is try to get them back and if you can't you have to pass your turn so now that's my turn I have to pass so you would play for example you had a six and a three so 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 that would be your turn now it's my turn again let's see what I get this time a one and a three so I could say 1 2 3 can I use that three no I can't because that's blocked now I would have to go for the one can I use the one yes because that point belongs to me so I can use the one and now I can continue playing a normal game again so again like I said you can't do anything you can't move any of your other Checkers until they are all off the bar so that's why hitting someone or hitting a blot is such a powerful move in back gaming and that's one of the key aspects knowing when to hit knowing when not to hit and uh like this when you're so close to finishing and you get hit it's really frustrating so let's go ahead and let me teach you the last kind of rule of the game and that's bearing off or pretty much the end game how you win back gaming
