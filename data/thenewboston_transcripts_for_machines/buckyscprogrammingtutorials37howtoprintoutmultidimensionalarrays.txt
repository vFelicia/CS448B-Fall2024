alright guys welcome back to your 37 C++ toriel and in this is oral I'm going to show you guys a really easy way to print out multidimensional arrays so let's go ahead and first thing we need to do is create a multidimensional array go ahead and name it Bertha and Bertha can be two rows by three columns same as before so now what we need to do is go ahead and make an array of arrays so the first thing I do is put my two arrays in there separated with the comma so now we have two arrays which would be two rows and now put three values in each like um we'll just put one two and three in the first one and seven eight and nine in the second one so now we have an array called Bertha that has two rows and three values in each row so it's basically a table that's two by three so in order to print this out what we need to do first is we need to loop through each row one by one we're going to loop through the first row and then we're going to loop through the second row so let's go ahead and make a for loop and int well we might as well name this row and of course it always starts is zero because the zero if index is the first element in your array so row zero and the second one is Row is less than two so what this is going to do when we put row plus plus is it's going to go from zero to one so row zero then Row one it's not going to go row two because of course two is not less than two so now we're looping through each row one at a time and now of course you guys can probably guess what I'm going to new next we need to loop through each column or each element in the row so now in order to do that go ahead and make another for loop and this is going to look really familiar familiar there we go int column make sure I spelled it right this one starts at zero as well again all array start at zero even there even if they're inside another array column is less than three because that's how many columns you have you basically write the maximum the number of rows in the number of columns right there simple enough you know what that kind of looks like a heart hmm that's kind of cute anyways moving on column plus plus so now what we're doing is this we're looping through each row one by one the first time it loops through Row one it's going to loop through each of those elements 1 2 & 3 and then it's going to loop through Row 2 and then it's going to loop through each of those elements 7 8 & 9 so after we get through looping through each column we want to move to the next line see out and line because again each row is on a different line so that's why when we're done looping through the last element in the row we want to move to the next line so now we can just go ahead and print it out on the screen like see out a Bertha was your name and you put the row number which would be this 0 or 1 and then you put the column number which is going to be some value 0 to 2 and that would be these values right here so let's go ahead and make sure you don't write end line on actually what we do need to do though is add a space there but make sure you don't write end a line on this line right here because these are your column values you don't want every single one of these numbers to go on new line you only want it to go to a new line after you're done looping through the last element in that column so let's go ahead and print it make sure I didn't forget any semicolons which I did somewhere and let me see what's wrong are oh I see what I did here is I put a call come on eyelet put a comma instead of a semicolon so now let me check make sure to run it again and there we go in our first row it printed out one two three and in our second row it printed out seven eight nine so this is a perfect way to visually see multidimensional arrays so pretty cool huh so again one last time here's what we did I'll just leave this down here we made an array that was two by three and what that means is it was an array consisting of two different arrays with three values each and what that means is basically made a table that was two rows by three columns as we can see right here the first thing we needed to do is loop through each row loop through this row the first one and then loop through the second one and we did that by writing row 0 rows listen to yahya data all that fun stuff you basically the only thing you need to worry about is make sure this value right here is the same as this value right here so we said all right for each row we loop through we wanted to loop through each one of the elements one at a time so that's why I wrote start with zero one two one at a time and why we had this little spacer right here is because if we didn't have that it would put one two three real close together so what it did is it basically printed out a row one element at a time and then when it was done it said see out end line and that's why it jumped to this next line and printed out seven eight nine and it did that until it was done printing out all the rows and then it just ended so that is how you print out a basic multidimensional array again of course this is a whole lot to see visually it's a whole lot better looking at than this right here so that is why you actually use this quite a bit whenever you're programming so that's all I have for you guys for this toriel thank you guys for watching hopefully you understand how to print out a multidimensional array now because we're going to be done talking about arrays for now in the next tutorial I think I'm going to be covering something called vectors which is kind of like an array but it's a little bit different so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe if you have any questions check out my website and I'll see in the next video
