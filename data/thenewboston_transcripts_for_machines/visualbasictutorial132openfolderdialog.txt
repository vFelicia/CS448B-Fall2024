hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live camera for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about the open folder dialog so just like the Open File dialog the open folder dialog opens up a window that lets you browse through the folders and select what you want but instead of selecting a file you're gonna select a folder which is let's say a folder to save something to if they're not saving a particular file at that moment so let's go ahead and create a new project and I'll show you how to use it so we'll select the windows forms application and we will call it folder dialog go ahead and click OK and wait for that to load ok so once it's loaded we'll resize the form some let's come into our tool box and we will add two buttons we got button 1 + button 2 now for button 1 we're going to set the text to right file we will set it to button right and now for button 2 we want it to the name to be button folder and we want to set the text to change folder okay so now I'll come back over here to our tool box and we will add two text boxes so we've got text box 1 and text box 2 so text box 1 is going to be the title of our text file and the text box 2 is going to be the contents so we'll set the name of text box 1 to text title and for text box 2 we want text contents so now we're going to add a folder browser dialog so we'll go ahead and add that right in there and you can see it creates an object of it for us and we can change the name of this if we want so let's go ahead and double click on change folder and so now that we're in our code for form 1 what we need to do is let's just make a variable that can store the path of the selected path that they got from the folder browser dialog now you can access this directly from the folder browser dialog one but I like storing it in another variable it just makes it a little bit easier so we'll just type folder browser dialog one dot show dialog and after they've shown the dialog or once they click OK what we want to do is get what they selected so we'll do a string path it's going to be equal to folder browser dialog one dot and you can see here that we've got a whole bunch of stuff that we can use we just want to use selected path so now that we've got the path where they want to save their files let's go ahead and double click on write file and we will just write the files for them so we'll type system dot IO dot file so we're going to use the long version of this so that we don't have to import system dot IO and no one want to do is write all text now for our first first argument it's going to be the string so we're just going to use string path now we're going to have to specify the name of the file so we'll just add a backslash and now we'll add the title so text title dot text so what this is going to do is going to get the path that they selected add a backslash to just separated because everything is separated with the backslash folders and then if you select a file on that it's got the folder name backslash the file name and then we're gonna use the title of what they selected and then we're just going to add an extension to the file so we'll make it a dot txt file so now for the contents we're going to use text contents dot text so it's going to write all the text from this text box right here to the path that they selected from change folder and it's going to use the title that they used up here so let's run this and hopefully we won't get any errors now let's go ahead and change the folder I can see that this is a little bit different or a lot different than the save file dialog or the open file dialog but it works essentially the same way let's go ahead and open up computer will drop down Sam's extra external hard drive and we'll just go ahead and select that go ahead and click OK so now I'll type will title it apples will add some stuff in it so and now we'll just go ahead and write the file now we can also write this a couple more times so we'll just title it YouTube and then we can write the file again now I'm putting come in here into my computer we can open up my external hard drive and you can see that we got YouTube and apples and this is my file from a while ago we can just delete that and if we open up apples you can see that we get nvidia intel and AMD the stuff that we added it'll be open up YouTube we also need the same thing because we left it the same inside the text box so go ahead and practice a little bit with open folder dialogues and once you got familiar with them and you're not going to forget how to use them go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
