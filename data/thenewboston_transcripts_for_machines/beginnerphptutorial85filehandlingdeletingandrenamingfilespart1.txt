hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and welcome back to another PHP video tutorial for the new Boston now we've already looked at creating files putting content into files now what do we want to do if we want to delete we want to rename files so in this video we're going to go over a couple of functions for deleting files and one function to rename files so we have a function that specifically deletes a file that we specify and then a function that renames a file to a file name of our choice so I've got a file here could file to delete txt and I've got a file here called file to rename dot txt now I'm not going to be using any examples in this set in this tutorial I'm just going to be showing you the functions and how they work and we're going to be testing it in the video but why might you want to delete a file well let's just say you were allowing your users to upload files you may be storing them somewhere else say in a database or you may be giving them access to a link that maybe would let them delete the file so if you wanted to allow your users to delete files that you've uploaded then obviously this function that we're going to talk about in a moment is going to be useful to you now why might you want to rename files well first of all like my prior example about the deleting the file you may want to give you user the option to rename a file that they may have uploaded you also might want to rename a file that already exists on your server for example if you're allowing users to upload files but you wanted to keep these as a hidden name you could say generate an md5 hash if you know how to do that or you may generate some random numbers and call this file let's say you know a value of a random numbers txt for example obviously depending on whether it was a text file or another file type so I've created this file called file to delete and obviously we're going to be deleting this and then of creating a file called file to rename and we're going to be renaming this to a file name with a random number as the as the text of the file name we're going to keep the extension dot txt though so let's just open up our browser so we know what we're doing we can see the file dot PHP is the PHP file that we're currently working on this is where we're going to be conforming our actions from and we've got file to Lee txt which we can keep an eye on because obviously we want to delete this and file to rename because obviously we want to rename this file so let's go ahead and talk about how we're going to delete a file now you may think that the the function would be something like delete but we actually have the function name as unlink so we call the function like this it's always a good idea to put this into an if statement once we've done it here with the first argument it only takes one argument I think there's one argument which is an absolute must and there may be other optional arguments but go over to php.net look up this function and you'll be able to find specific information about it so the argument that we give this is the father we want to delete with regards to the whole file name so let's go ahead and type file to delete dot txt now if we were to run this program it would delete the file however let's go ahead and put this into an if statement and the first block is going to be if this is true so in other words if this file has been successfully deleted so inside here we can say echo file has been deleted we could also just to make things run a lot smoother and you're probably going to be storing your filename in a in a variable anyway we can give a file name variable a straight of string datatype just up here so let's go ahead and put the file name into a variable called file name and here let's reference that in there so what we can do is we can say file and then maybe create some strong tags here and we can then concatenate on the file name itself so you can see how it's easy to reuse the same file name that we've specified up here so otherwise we want to give an error message now we're going to be performing a test that is going to is actually going to activate this error message and that's going to be when we've already deleted the file so once we've deleted the file we're not going to be able to delete it again because obviously it doesn't exist so we're going to we're going to be showing this we're going to be running this cut script twice the first time it's going to successfully delete the file and the second time it's going to return us an error okay so let's go ahead and put some text in so file cannot be deleted just for example you can obviously reference this variable in there if you want it's entirely up to you so as it stands we're going to unlink the file name so we're going to be deleting this file to delete txt and then we're going to be giving a confirmation message to the user
