now what we're going to be doing is we're going to setting' we're going to be setting this a value to zero initially when the button has been clicked and then we're going to just create a set interval timer which is going to gradually increase this value and this obviously doesn't have practical applications but it shows us what the progress bar will look like once it is in place and actually has a real value to to feedback to this sir to this widget so just for now I'm going to go ahead and get rid of this line here and I'm going to create a new variable called interval and that's going to be equal to set interval and inside here we have a function so we pull this down now inside here is what's going to happen every X amount of seconds and we define the second just after this here so I'm going to do 50 milliseconds which is obviously point zero five over second and this is going to allow us to if gradually increase this particular value every 50 milliseconds so let's go ahead and update this value each time so we're going to say Val equals of hour plus one so that's going to increase the value here by one every 50 milliseconds and then what we can do is go ahead and implement or or put this into the value of the progress bar so again we create we reference or select the progress bar div and we use dot progress bar as we did before but this time we're going to go ahead and define a value in here which will be equal to Val and because it's equal to Val every 50 milliseconds this will increase by one and therefore the progress bar will constantly update with this updating value here this variable Val so let's go ahead and test that out and then we're going to go on to look at how to relay this back to the percentage so when I click upload' you can see that that gradually increases all the way to the end however we do have a problem when it gets to the end now the percentage the value is constantly increasing now so what we want to do is we need a way to break this interval because obviously this interval is still on this page now even though we can't see this beyond fit beyond 100 so the interval is still happening so this is wasting resources it's taking up you know too much processing power so what we want is a simple check underneath here to say if Val in fact we won't do this bit yet we'll go ahead and update the D percentage so essentially all we want to do is we want to reference this percentage so we use a selector percent and we want to apply text into here and that text is going to be Val and then we append on a percentage sign so now when we preview this in our browser you'll see that not only do we get the progress bar but we get an updating percentage as well and you can see that going all the way up when the progress bar reaches the end we assume it's still at 100 but in actual fact that timer is still in place so this percentage is gradually increasing so obviously we don't want this so we want to break out of this interval so although this is only for demonstration purposes we want to keep it as efficient as possible if you do decide to run this on a live on a live page where people can access it so I'm going to create an if statement with a block and the condition is if val is equal to 100 obviously that's at 100% we want to clear interval and the interval we want to specify is this interval here that we set because we set the interval into a variable called interval so we just clear interval interval so we define the variable that holds this set interval function so now that that's happened we will have this value stopped at 100 and the interval will be cleared and therefore nothing else will be happening you can still this see this is still going up now so let's go ahead and press upload you can see this is gradually increasing this time when it reaches 100 the interval is going to be cleared so elite we end with the Val equal to 100 so now that we've seen the practical application of this obviously it's important to think about why you wouldn't just use this on its own the progress bar has a limited amount of options for this because of this it's essentially because we don't use it on its own we use it to simply feed in a value this might be from you know like I said earlier an external PHP script that uploads or something on the page that feeds back a value with PHP you can feed back the percentage of a debt out of an upload and therefore you could implement it into this value here as opposed to the mockup value that we've created so that's how easy progress bar is to implement and the value option to define how far along the progress bar is
