okay so today we're going to learn how to use factoring to solve GM geometry problems so a square had nine centimeters added added to its length and 3 centimeters added to its with its new area is 280 centimeters squared find its original length and width so first we had a square that had a length and width and now we have a new square whose length is l + 9 + W plus three birds with so we know that this new area is 280 centimeters squared so to find area we multiply the length times the width to get to 80 and since it's a square that means that this lengthen with are equal so we're going to represent this with an X here and not an L and then X here instead of a w so this is X plus 9 and this is X plus 3 so when we rewrite the area we get X plus 9 plus X plus 3 equals 280 now we have to foil this out in order to set this equation equal to 0 so x squared plus 3x plus 9x plus 27 equals 280 we're going to combine like terms and bring this to 80 over so you get x squared plus 12x minus 2 53 equals 0 now when we factor this if you divide 253 by different numbers you'll get that 2 53 / 2 23 is 11 and 23 minus a negative 11 gives us 12 so that's so we know that a positive 23 and a negative 11 are going to go there so now we set each one of these equal to zero if you subtract over you get x equals negative 23 and if you add this ever get x equals 11 since we're talking about distance we can kick out this answer because distance can't be negative so we find that X is equal to 11 but they wanted to know what the original length and width was so that means that its original length is 11 and its original width is 11 let's do another example the length of a rectangle is 5 meters greater than twice its width and it's area is equal to 33 meters squared find the rectangles length and width so the length of a rectangle is 5 meters greater so 5 plus twice its width so 5 plus 2w so its width is going to be equal to just plain w so its area is equal to 33 meters squared so that means that its length times its width is equal to 33 if we distribute this w we at 5w plus 2w squared equals thirtythree now we're going to set this equation equal to zero and i'm going to rewrite this in decreasing order so then we're going to have to factor this so this is going to be 2w this is going to be w so the factors of negative 33 r 3 and 11 now since we have a two in front of this w when I these two numbers is going to get x 2 in order to make these to add to get five this has to be a positive 11 and this has to be a negative 3 and then if you foil this back up you'd get 2w squared minus 6 w + 11 w minus 33 and 11 w minus 6 w would give us five so then we can set both of these equal to 0 2w plus 11 equals 0 w minus 3 equals 0 so add 3 over and we get W equals 3 with this we'd get w equals negative 11 halves but since we're talking about length can't be the answer so it wants us to find its length in the width so its width is right here w but its length is equal to 5 plus 2 times W which is three so it's like this equal to 11 that's all we're going to do with factoring in order to solve geometry problems make sure you come back and check out our next lesson where we're going to talk about dividing monomials
