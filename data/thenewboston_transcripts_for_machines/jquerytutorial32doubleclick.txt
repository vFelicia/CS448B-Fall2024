hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in the last video we looked at the jQuery click event handler however in this tutorial we're going to look at the double click event handler now this is going to be triggered when an element is clicked twice with the mouse as you would normally double click on for example an icon on your desktop now the reason I am talking about double click is if you were to create a jQuery website that had for example icons that you might want to double click on for example a simulation of a desktop environment or something you might want to use the double click functionality you might also want to create say an image and say double click on the image to edit it or open it up or retrieve some more information there's a variety of applications this can have however I'm going to be demonstrating it in this tutorial with a link so the first thing we're going to do is we look at the script we've included first of all and we've included obviously jQuery and then we've included this click j/s file as well and this is here and it currently has nothing in it so let's go ahead and create a link I'm going to call this menu and the href is going to be hash and the ID is going to be menu so essentially what I want to happen is when the user double clicks on this link I want a div to appear with some more menu options so let's go ahead and create a div and I'm going to give this an ID of let's just say menu link for this one I've changed the name to menu underscore link and the ID here is going to be menu so inside of here what we can do is create a few more options and obviously this can be tiered so if the user was to for example click on the menu double click on the menu they might have then a list of other options that they can also double click on and you can add all these event handlers to click yes so this is going to be for example programs and settings and log off so we have all of these menu options inside a div now I'm going to again use inline styling which I don't recommend but I don't really have the time to go ahead and create a style sheet so I'm going to give this style of displaynone so this menu will be hidden basically okay so let's go ahead and just start this a bit better we're going to use breaks after each link and now this should display just the menu link on the page so now we have the menu link when we click it obviously nothing happens we're going to have jQuery handle this for us so we've got the clicked at Jas file included so now what we can do is use this to reference the double click of the menu link and then to display this menu so let's go over to click j/s and start writing the jQuery code so we're going to use a dollar dollar sign and inside of some brackets the menu the link element we're then going to say instead of dot click we're going to say dot dbl click and then in bracket again we need to include a function that allows us to run a block of code based on this event so function we create out block and a function as we usually would define it but we bring this down so we can start writing our code in here so now once this menu link has been double clicked we want to display the rest of this menu so the div is called menu so we can reference that with hash menu so we use our dollar sign and inside hash menu dot show or we could use another animation effect but we're going to be looking at them a bit later on in the series so essentially now when we double click on this link the menu should show so let's go ahead to our browser and refresh click on it nothing happens if I doubleclick on it you can see that the menu has been displayed ok so hopefully now you can start to see the functionality behind this and why you might have to use it or my what may want to use it in a more I guess operating system like web application because jQuery is really powerful in this way you could essentially create something that was a bit more you know app had a more application feel to it rather than a web page so the doubleclick function can be extremely useful when you want to show this kind of functionality
