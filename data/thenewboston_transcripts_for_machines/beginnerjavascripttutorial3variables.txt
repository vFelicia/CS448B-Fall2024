what's up guys welcome to your third JavaScript tutorial and as promised in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about a huge concept in JavaScript probably the most important concept that you guys need to learn and that is the use of variables so go ahead and try to remember all the way back to like fifth grade algebra class until you first learn about variables now if you can't remember here's a little refresher in order to use variable or what variable basically is is you take something like the letter X and you set it equal to something else like the word ham and then when your math teacher wrote something like I love X or X comes from a pig you understood that this meant I love ham and ham comes from a pig that is because X and ham are basically the same thing so that is pretty much what a variable is it's just a fancy word for a placeholder a variable is a placeholder holds the place of something else and let me go ahead and delete that first of all so in JavaScript we use variables a whole bunch and we use them kind of in the same way but a little bit different now in order to tell JavaScript that we're going to be working with a variable we need to write the keyword var this tells JavaScript all right you're ready for this we are about to make a variable you need to include that the next thing that you're right is the name of your variable I'm just going to go ahead and name my variable X but you know you can name it whatever you want so after this you go ahead and write the equal sign now the equal sign is called the assignment operator technically like if you're learning this because you have a JavaScript class and you're trying to refresh on JavaScript and he says all right what's the equal sign called in JavaScript you need to say it's the assignment operator but other than that in these tutorials I'm just going to say equal sign because you know it's a whole lot easier but anyways you write var the name of your variables the assignment operator or equal sign and then you write what you want your variable to equal so go ahead and just write like 23 or something any value in there and then of course like every single statement in JavaScript we have to end it with a semicolon so you're saying RA Y is a variable useful what can I do with variables well a variable is useful for many reasons I mean already we know how to print something out on the screen so go ahead and write document dot right and then inside your parentheses instead of putting quotation marks in the line of text that it will print out go ahead and delete everything and just go ahead and write your variable and check this out go ahead and save this and refresh it and see what we get 23 just like that so as you can see that it pretty much this is what Java Script is understanding all right you're making a variable called X and you're setting it equal to 23 so now whenever I come across the term X in my program I note that to substitute it for 23 so if you're saying alright Bucky you probably could just wrote 23 in here and it would have printed out just fine so why go through the trouble of writing X well when you're building computer programs you don't just have it occur one time you might have a thousand different lines of code that include the term X so you can either type out the word or excuse me the number 23 each time or you can just go ahead up here change it one time and automatically going to change in all of your code for you so anyways it's going to save you a bunch of time and it's also useful for different reasons that I don't want to talk about right now or it'll just confuse you but anyways that is what variable is how to make it and how it's useful another thing I want to mention is go ahead and delete this is I said you can name your variable anything you want but I kind of lied just a little bit the first thing I want to mention is this variables are case sensitive and I mean that in if we go ahead and try to type a capital X up here and refresh it and see what happens we get nothing on our screen that's because a lowercase X is different than uppercase X the variable name Buckey or excuse me let me thick the variable name Bucky is different than this be you see KY even though they're spelled the same if we try to run it you're going to get nothing again because it looks at it as two different variables so make sure that if a variable might be messing up that and that means that you might have capitalized something that you shouldn't capitalize another thing I want to mention is you just can't you know use any symbols and letters you want you need to start your variable name with a letter or an underscore so since Bucky starts with the letter you can also start it with the underscore that would be valid but you can't start it with like and/or percentage sign or anything like that it needs to start with the underscore or a letter another thing is that the other characters in your variable name must be letters numbers or underscores for example you can't have like armed Bucky percent dollar sign dollar sign to at sign that's that variable doesn't make sense at all basically just use letters numbers and underscores and you'll be fine and lastly I want to talk to you guys is that the most difficult thing to remember is that your variables can't start with numbers for example if you have variable six Bucky equals thirtytwo and you try to run this program it's not going to work out because your variables can't start with numbers that's probably probably the most forgotten rule but I needed to tell you guys so whenever I said that you can name your variable anything you want I kind of lied you just have to remember these simple rules it has to begin with a letter or an underscore and only use letters numbers and underscores you can't use dollar sign spaces percent signs at signs you can't use any of those and if you follow those simple rules you'll be good to go so now that we understand what a basic variable is and how it's useful in computer programming we can go on and move to our next tutorial and in the next tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys about the different types of variables and trust me it's be extremely useful so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see in the next video
