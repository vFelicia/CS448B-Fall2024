hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and this tutorial we'll be talking about constructors now sometimes when you have a class and you want to add what's called a constructor and what this does is it initializes values for that class so let's say we want to make a new person I want to individually set their weight money income and name by what we want it to be and not just by using the default so we can how we can do this is to use a constructor now even though these variables are private we can still access them using a constructor so to create one we're just going to type sub new and now what I need to do is we need to buy Val wait money income and name so wait as double or let's just do W as double by Val M as double now mnw aren't very good to use for names to be passed to our constructor because if someone is trying to create a new person and they look at the arguments for the constructor and they see what is W and what is M they're not going to know what that is I'm just going to use these in the tutorial so I as double and by Val n as string okay so now we're going to do is going to set each one of these variables so weight equals W money equals M income equals I and name equals n so whenever a new person object is created it's going to be required for them to use to pass these different data types to the constructor now what you can also do is use optional which we learned about using in functions and this can also be used with constructors so we'll come back to form or not VB and you can see that we get an error for my default person so for the argument for the constructor we're just going to add two parentheses now inside of this we'll need the weight so let's just go ahead and set this to let's say the person is going to be 150 pounds their money will give them five hundred dollars their income will pay them $20 an hour and the name to default person okay so now we've created this person and we've set all that the values that are needed for the person to work so now let's come down here and we will add the person so let's just use some default values for the person in this so we'll just use eight pounds 100 money $7.25 an hour and then P name for the name for person name so we created a new person and just use the constructor to make the necessary changes to the variables that are in there so we'll go ahead and run this and see what happens it should work just the same as it did before so we'll click new person and we will click I mean we won't click I'll just type in Sam go ahead and click OK you see we get the current weighs eight money income instead of 725 we can work and make money we can exercise and lose weight we can eat to gain weight we can increase the income so everything is working perfectly fine so let's go in here and change some of these values so you can see what changes are made so let's have the person be born at 150 pounds and we will give them nine hundred ninety nine dollars and we'll pay them five hundred dollars an hour so we'll go ahead and run this and if we click new person we'll just leave it at John Doe and then click OK and see John Doe weighs 150 pounds he has nine hundred ninety nine dollars and he makes five hundred dollars an hour and we can just keep working this guy until he gets a whole bunch of money and we can exercise to lose some weight so that is a way to initialize values for objects whenever and that is creating and it will force the person to do that so that they will not forget it and later on we're going to be talking about overloading constructors and default constructors so what I challenge you guys to do is take this person program and let the user enter the weight the money and the income whenever they create a new person and have it passed to this add person so that it will put the right values in there that that the person specified when they click new person and if you do make that go ahead and leave that in a video response so I can see you guys are learning from these tutorials and thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
