so today we're going to learn the parts of a circle so the first thing you need to know is that a circle is a set of points equidistant from a center c so right here is our center so if I draw a line anywhere from C to a point on the circle I'm going to get the same distance between seeing that point so C is the center of our circle so the radius of a circle is a segment joining the center to a point on this on the circle so right here we have radius Dec drawn in a chord is a segment joining two points on the circle so we have this cord right here H J and a diameter is a special kind of cord which contains the center of the circle so this segment right here it's a chord because it connects two points of the circle but it's a diameter because in the center of a B is C so a B is the diameter of our circle so now we're just going to identify each segment like what it is is it a radius accord or a diameter so segment Oh a so oh eh oh and just so you know o is the center of our circle so this segment joins the center to a point on the circle so oh I is a radius LW is this segment right here so it's a chord because it joins two points of this circle together but it contains our Center so therefore it's a special kind of cord called the diameter DW joins this point to this point and since it doesn't go through the center it's just called a cord a w so that wasn't drawn in but it would be this segment right here aw is another cord because it does not it joins two points together but does not go through the diameter dl is also a cord wo so this segment right here it contains a point on the circle it connects a point on the circle to the center of a circle so it is a radius and if we were to draw in this line right here la it would it would join two points of the circle together but it doesn't contain the center so it's a cord o L so this segment right here as joins a point on the circle to the center of the circle so it's a radius so that's all we're doing today we had to learn the parts of a circle so that in the next lesson we can talk about special kinds of lines that go through a circle
