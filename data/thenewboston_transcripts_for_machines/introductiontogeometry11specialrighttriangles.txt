last video we learned about right triangles in general and how their sides relate to one another but today we're just going to talk about special kinds of right triangles that have a different Association so an isoceles right triangle and remember an isoceles triangle has two congruent sides which would be this one and this one so that they have the same length so we're just going to call that length a well their hypotenuse which is across from the right angle is equal to that side times the sare < TK of 2 so that means that this length is square < TK of two so let's do an example we have this triangle and this angle is 45° so that means that using our Pythagorean theorem 45 + 90 + x = 180 that X has to equal 45 not not side x just this angle X so that means that this and we know that this is an esles right triangle that this is congruent to this so that means that side x is equal to 4 and we're trying to find what Y is equal to and Y is the hypotenuse so we follow our Rule and we take four and multiply it by the square < TK of 2 to get the length of Y so y = 4un of 2 so now we're going to talk about another kind of triangle that has its own special rules as well it's called a 30 60 90 triangle and these numbers right here are the measures of the angles so it's a right triangle so it has to have a 90° angle which is right here and this angle there ° and this angle is 60° so this length right here is just a this hypotenuse is 2 * this side this side is a * the < TK of 3 and we're going to use those to find out what the length of each side of the right triangle angle so we know that this side is equal to five so that mean so that means that this angle is equal to 30° so the side opposite the 30° angle is five this side of opposite the 60° angle which is y is equal to a square < TK of 3 so right now A is equal to 5 because this side is equal to five so we're going to take five and multiply it by the sare < TK of 3 to find out what y equals so y = 5un of 3 and then we know that this side is equal to 2 * a which is so we just take 2 * 5 which is 10 so that means X is equal to 10 and those are the two special kinds of right triangles make sure to watch the next video where we're going to take all this information and use it to do right triangle trigonometry
