what's going on guys it's Bucky and I just want to make a real quick video to update you guys actually this drop again be a pretty long video but I want to make a video to update you guys on a couple things I got some news for you guys and a lot of you guys are probably gonna be real upset at first but just stick with me it gets better I promise so the first thing is good news my entire website is updated so for everyone who is asking to put my videos in a playlist if you go to my website every video I have is now on there and in the playlist nice and organized so there you go check out my website all the videos nice and organized the next thing I want to talk to you guys about is kind of sounds like it's gonna be bad news at first but trust me it's not I decided not to teach a blender and not to teach ocher and I know a lot of you guys we're looking forward to game development and you guys are probably you know p√≠o to me right now but before you freak out just listen to what I have to say so first let me say this I've wanted to create computer games ever since I first sat behind a computer it's the reason I started learning programming it's the least reason I went to college for computer programming it's been my goal for a very long time to make awesome computer games and also teach you guys how to make awesome computer games as well so that being said here's the reason I decided to not teach over 3d ocher 3d is a 3d graphics engine and 3d is only one small aspect of game development for example whenever you make a 3d game you need a lot of things other than just the 3d engine a 3d engine basically helps you put 3d objects on the screen that's it in order to make a game you need like physics libraries sound libraries you need to code networking artificial intelligence there's so many more aspects to a game other than just programming 3d objects and stuff so that is a kind of why I'm not teaching over but aside from them um whenever you're going to get a job in the computer game or even you know the programming industry your ogre still skills aren't really gonna get you in the door it's a good graphics library but if you want a job working for like a major company ogre is it really your best bet so the huge companies kind of stay away from ogre it's awesome if you wanna you know make a game with your friends or if you're working on a college project then ogre is the best you know it's pretty good choice but if you're gonna go jump into the industry and making professional applications I wouldn't recommend ocher surveying alright that sucks you're not gonna teach auger I guess my game development days are over that's the reason I subscribe to you Bucky see you later well let me tell you guys this before you know start writing nasty comments on I don't know send me like anthrax and the email anthrax and email anthrax in my mail but anyways the solution to not teaching ogre and not developing using this 3d graphics library is this instead of teaching you a 3d graphics library I'm gonna be teaching you a fullblown game engine now a game engine I feel let me talk about this first I know I talked to you about like a 3d engines and game engines you guys are like what the heck even is an engine I know what engine is my car but you say engine Allah please tell me what the engine is and I'll explain it way back when when they first started making games they made 3d games like doom and quake like the very first 3d games ever and whenever they were programming it they kind of started writing the same code over and over all right we need to write code for physics and collision detection and how the graphics appear on the screen now let's make another game all the physics all the collision detection all the way your graphics appear on your screen and for the same game they were typing the same code over and over and over because you know with every single game the graphics are the same how your computer works with sound is the same collision detection is always the same so instead of writing the same over and over and over and don't forget the game was changing but this little pieces of code were staying the same those pieces of code that always stayed the same those code is what make up your engine it's the core functionality behind every game the kind of stuff that you don't need to create new every time it's the basic core functionality that stays the same and what happens is you have this main engine and that allows the developer to concentrate on the cool stuff like the design the character design the main concept all the fun stuff so it gives you all that core functionality of how sound works on the computer of how graphics display on the screen and all that stuff and now you get to concentrate on the character design and you know all the fun stuff like I said so that's what an engine is so you're saying re instead of teaching the graphics engine what are you going to be teaching me I'm gonna be teaching you the best game engine on earth and that's Unreal Engine this is the engine that is used by huge companies to develop awesome games and I know in the last video I told you guys about ogre and I showed you guys that game and it looked pretty cool but it was like kind of you know not a great game it was a pretty cool game but I'm not talking like a huge game let me tell you guys some of the games that are made using Unreal Engine Gears of War let's see army up to Bioshock and Borderlands I'm talking huge epic some of the most amazing games ever built was built using Unreal Engine so I figured you know what if we're gonna learn to develop games we're gonna do it right and we're gonna use the right engine so instead of you know give me any guys the kiddie kind of college version we're gonna be jumping right into the pro level Unreal Engine to develop awesome and epic games so I you know no need you know messing around with a small stuff let's go right for the professional stuff that's my theory and aside from that Unreal Engine has everything you need it has audio animation oh let me think networking level editors artificial intelligence everything you need to develop any game in the world you have an Unreal Engine so you know that's a lot better just suppose the ogre 3d so the last thing I want to mention about Unreal Engine is like I said with ogre 3d it's you know you might want to mention it whenever you're looking for a job but it's not gonna really get you in the door if you go up to a industry like you know a main gaming company that develops huge games and tell them you know Unreal Engine they're gonna be begging to hire you it doesn't matter if you have a college degree or not if you know Unreal Engine you pretty much are guaranteed the job in the computer game industry since this is the main program that huge companies use again some other companies like blizzard and stuff they probably make their own engines but you know this is like one of the main engines out there so enough about you know Unreal Engine pretty much it's amazing it's the best game engine it's gonna guarantee you a job if you know and that's why I'm citing Unreal Engine game engine rather than a small graphics engine so I'm done talking about Unreal Engine for now and now I'm let me explain you guys why I decided not to teach a blender 13 now before you know I'm not crapping on blender 3d here because it's an awesome 3d modelling program but it's not the best out there it's free and you know for being free it's the best free one out there but the reason I want to teach blender 3d is because I want to allow all my subscribers to follow along with my tutorials and if I taught you know one of the expensive 3d modeling programs then they wouldn't be able to follow along because when I was in high school in college I was broke and I know that a lot of you guys probably can't afford you know a huge 34 thousand dollar program so that's why I was like alright even though it's not the best I'm gonna teach blender 3d because all my subscribers are gonna be able to follow along with it so that being said let me tell you guys what I'm doing I decided instead of teaching blender 3d to teach 3dsmax now 3ds max is the best no contest if you had all the money in the world and you could only buy one 3d modeling program you want to choose 3ds max now it's a $3500 program and before I made a couple tutorials about it and I was like you know what who's gonna be able to afford this program you know probably none of the people that are watching my tutorials so I kind of stopped making stories about it but I'm gonna start making tutorials on 3ds max because it is the best program for computer game character modeling anything you need for a computer game you can create in 3ds max it's a whole lot better than blender I know a lot of you you know hardcore blender fans are probably gonna disagree with me but trust me it's like you know how Photoshop is the best photo editing program and then you know some people say is free it's awesome well that's kind of how this is 3ds max is the best it's an industry standard when it comes a computer game development and you know blender is a pretty good program but you know it doesn't it's leaps and bounds below 3ds max so that being said let me tell you guys what I found out yesterday that's why I was gonna teach blender 3d because it's free and everyone could follow along even though it wasn't best but yesterday I found out that if you are a student in high school or college you can go to the Autodesk web and by the way Autodesk is who makes 3ds max you can go to the Autodesk website register and all that means is you need to enter your email telling me you're a student and you know make a account a password and stuff and you could download all their software they have for free I'm not talking a 30day trial I'm not talking some crappy toned down version of the software I'm talking if you are student you can download the entire 3ds max $3500 program for free and I was like oh my god why did I not know about this before and it kind of makes sense why they're doing this because they want students to learn 3ds max because then when they jump into the computer game development industry or 3d modeling industry there have those skills in you know the companies they work for they're not students they still have to buy the program so it kind of makes sense why they're doing this letting students to learn on it and use it for free and then when they jump into the workforce they're gonna have to buy their program but for us being students it's all there at our fingertips for free the best most amazing 3d modeling program out there and you know just this is kind of getting on my chest I know a lot of you guys are gonna say well Maya is the best 3d modeling program well Maya is the best program for like movies and animations and logos but for character design 3ds max is the best like I said if I had ten million dollars and I can only build and I could only buy one 3d modelling program it would be 3ds max so this is not up for debate that's what we're doing so that's why I chose to use 3ds max in Unreal Engine rather than blender and over like I said guys if we want to develop the best games we need to have the best skills and use the best tools so no need thinking around with this you know a little kind of cool computer game stuff if we want to develop the best computer games ever made and that's what I plan to teach you guys how to do we're gonna need the best programs out there so that's what I'm gonna be doing so I hope you guys understand my decision in the long run it's gonna be better for you guys and by the way like I said just like Unreal Engine is the industry standard and so all the pros use when you're looking for a job if you know 3ds max good you're gonna be able to get a job like that it's what all the huge companies use and you know like I said I'm gonna stop rambling right now but that's why I made my decision I hope you guys understand so um let me think if I have anything else to say I think that's it so I hope you guys uh you know are looking forward to this game development is much as I am because I cannot wait I'm probably going to start these tutorials I want to say like four or five days is when you're gonna see these tutorials start pumping out I don't know if I'm going to be teaching 3ds max I kind of I really want to jump into a Unreal Engine because it's just so awesome and I love using it but I don't know if I should teach 3ds max because you know you kind of need the 3d stuff before he can build a game you can't like build a game without the 3d objects but you can build 3d objects without a game so I might have to teach 3ds max but uh I really want to teach Unreal Engine so I'm not sure what I'm gonna be doing but that is what I need to tell you guys that's my decision and I hope you guys are excited for it and understand where I'm coming from so thank you guys for watching and don't forget like I said at the beginning my website is now updated so all my tutorials are on there and a nice neat playlist for you guys so again one last time thank you guys for watching thank you guys so much for subscribing and donating you guys have no idea how much it means to me so uh think you think you think you and I will see you in about a couple days when I start making stories
