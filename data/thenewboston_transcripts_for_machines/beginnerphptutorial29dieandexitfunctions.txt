now this Alex from PHP academy' to org and welcome to another video tutorial for the new Boston now I'm going to be talking about PHP die and exit and these are two really useful functions that you should get used to using in your program so you can cut the script at any point where you may receive a fatal error in which you don't want to execute any more code now let me just show you demonstrate how this works let's say I want to echo out hello and a space and down here I want to echo out a space and world now if we were to run this if we to run this normally refresh our browser you can see it will just produce the result hello world because we've included hello with a space and we've included world now let me just use the die feature in here and what this is going to do is it from this point onwards is going to kill the rest of the page okay so let's have a look at the result in the browser okay so we're just receiving the string hello now why is this useful I mean Barrowman you can also use exit as well and this does exactly the same thing if we refresh we're getting the same result now why would we want to kill our script in the middle of a page I mean first of all dottie using dine exit exactly the same thing bear in mind you can also part of this function you can specify an error in here so you can use some string to output so error page has ended for example and let's just echo again the world part of this page so if we refresh you can see that we've received this message so you can do that if you want and you can do exactly the same thing with exit as well and we go same thing so how do we use this in a reallife example and why is it useful okay so without overcomplicating things I'm going to attempt now to connect to a database now whether you've come across databases yet or not this is an example to show you how died or exit can be used now to connect to a MySQL database we use the MySQL connect function and we supply it with three I mean we've looked at functions anyway so that you should really understand this at this point and anyway so I'm connecting to localhost my username is Alex and I don't I don't specify a password because I'm running on a local server so what do I do if this is wrong now at the moment if i refresh the page nothing oh okay Oh No okay so sorry my username is root so I've already produced myself an error so if i refresh there okay so that's that's connected absolutely fine so we know that that's connected because we've not received an error that might not necessarily be the case but I know that my username is root my password is blank and the and I'm connecting to my local server so what happens if we want to specify our own error if this hasn't connected so for example or die could not connect to database what I've essentially done here is used or so it's a logical operator we've said or you can also say or like this so or die if this is unsuccessful we want to die and produce this error to the page so at the moment nothing's happening so I can echo down here connected and I refresh and a refresh and I received the error the message connected now what if I change this around so I want to connect to in fact let's just change this back to Alex because I know that's not my username now when i refresh you can see that we've killed the page this has produced an error and we've specified our our own error as well now what if we want to get rid of this error and we just want to display this error we've already displayed userfriendly we just pop an apt before just pop an Apps beforehand now when we refresh we basically are just left with could not connect database so this is essentially a user friendly way of connecting to the database or killing the page obviously we're not now outputting connected killing the page and saying could not connect to database so that's essentially what we've done like I said before you can replace that with the double vertical lines and it will do exactly the same job we're just using logical operators there which we've already covered so you've now seen a reallife example of where you can use die obviously this can also be exit so if we refresh the page it is exactly the same thing could not connect to database so that is basically the die and exit functions within PHP and how useful they can actually be
