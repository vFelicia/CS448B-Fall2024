hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna continue working on the log for our game now you may be may be wondering how are we going to use the name of the zombie or not zombie the enemy if we don't have name variables that store their names so what we can do is let's come in come in to each class we'll do public string name as string and we'll set it equal to Zambia now there is one problem with this this would seem like a simple solution but if we come over here to form one dot V B or yeah format maybe you see that current enemy is subtype enemy and so anything that current enemy can do enemy should be able to do too so if we're calling a current enemy function here or a method or a variable enemy has to contain that variable so come over here and we'll get rid of this that's not needed so we'll do public string name as string and you could ignore that thing I was just deleted because I was just experimenting with the code so we've got public string name a string so now we can come in here you can see that we get a message that says it conflicts it conflicts I mean with a string name in enemy so in order to get rid of that instead of read a cleric string name we can just go ahead and set that equal to a value so it's going to be zombie and we need to go ahead and copy this or we'll cut it and we need to put it in our constructor so the names gonna be equal to zombie when a new zombie class is created so in our constructor for Dragon will do string name it's gonna be equal to dragon villain string name it's gonna be equal to filling okay so now that we have string name for each of the enemies and it's in the enemy class so we can use it on an enemy object we can go ahead and use that whenever we need it okay so now that we've got all this working we've created our damaged arrays we've used names and some indirection to make it easier to access parts of our program in our variables what we want to do is go ahead and create one of the logs now we have event log VB now this isn't just gonna automatically open when our program run runs we have to tell it to open because form or not VB is the form that is run by default and no other forms will run so we need to come in to form one DB and whenever it loads we need to create a new log so we'll just declare one of those sodimm new log as new event log and we need to event log VB now it looks like we lucked out here because there's already an event log built into Visual Basic so we did event log VB so after that's done what we need to do is type new log dot Show so it will show us our new log now we want to be able to access new log outside of just form one dot load so we can go ahead got this right here and we will paste it in the class itself and we'll just declare it as private so now that we have new log and it shows when it's open let's go ahead and add some stuff to the log but first I'll show you that it opens with it so here is our game and then here's our logged C says event logger has successfully loaded and it allows you to select indexes of this so we'll go ahead and close out of these so whenever you attack the the enemy after we attack them what we want to do is we want to create that event so we will just type new log dot list events or we don't want list events we want to do let's see here figure out what the name of that is add event so we want to add an event so new log dot add event and we need an event as a string so since create event is a function and it returns a string we can use that as the argument for add event so we can just add event and we can create event and then the argument is going to be pop I dot name okay so this might be a little bit confusing to you but we we added an event to our list box and for the arguments of that we use create event which is a string because that's a function and it used it returns a string and that function requires an argument itself which is the name of whoever it's making the event for so we'll do that once more for the enemy attack so let's see as soon as it attacks we want to create the event but first we have to type new log dot add event and then we want to create an event so create event and then we'll do current enemy dot name or string name so it's gonna create an event based on their name and it's gonna pass that to the add event method in new log so hopefully we won't get any errors from this okay so here's our game and I'll just drag the log over here and if we attack looks like we got an error here okay so we got a bit of an error there and I'll tell you why so whenever Popeye it adds the log for Popeye it says hero dog attack damaged which is a an array of integers and it uses at index of attack num now we can't put an integer into a string an argument that takes a string or returning as a string we can't put an integer in there so we need to convert that to a string so this is gonna be the number this is gonna be the damage that is returned which will be an integer and then we just convert that integer integer to a string so we'll do that once more for this one so current enemy dotted for the attack damage dot to string so we've converted each of those to a string now we'll go ahead and try this one more time and it says event logger has successfully loaded and then we can go ahead and attack and you can see that says papaya has used kick for a 10 damage and then zombie has used punch for 10 damage and let's just use spinach now you can see that it says 10 damage right in here we haven't accounted for in case Popeye uses spinach and we're going to be learning about that in the next tutorial see Popeye uses kick for 10 damage and then use just 5 let's see let's try to get popped by to use anchor throw aha Popeye has used anchor throw for 15 damage so what this does is it just logs everything that happens each time one of the users attacks or gets attacked so go ahead and close out of that so go ahead and put this code in if you haven't already then once you've done that if you don't understand it leave some comments I'll try to answer the any questions for you and then after that move on to the next tutorial
