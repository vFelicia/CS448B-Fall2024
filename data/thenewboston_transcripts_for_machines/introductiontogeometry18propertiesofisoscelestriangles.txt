our focus today is isosceles triangles and their their properties so if two sides of an isosceles triangle are congruent then the angles opposite the sides are also congruent so this side is congruent to this side of this triangle so that means that the angle across from this side and the angle across from this side are equal so if this angle equals 24 that must mean that x also equals 24. if i know that this side is congruent to this side that means this angle is congruent with this angle so if this angle equals 68 degrees that means that y has to equal 68 degrees and just if we wanted to we could use our interior angles of a triangle property to find out what this equals so 24 plus 24 plus z equals 180 48 plus c equals 180 so z has to equal 132. so we can do the same thing for this one we'll call this w 180 this is one 76 136 plus w equals 180 w equals 44. so the next property if two angles of an isosceles triangle are congruent and the sides opposite the angles are congruent so since these two angle angles have the same measure they're congruent so that means the sides opposite them have to be congruent so if this side is equal to eight x has to equal eight and these two have the same measure therefore they're congruent so the sides opposite that those angles have to be congruent so this side equals thirteen so y must equal thirteen and we don't have any way of finding what this other side is quite yet so that's all we have to do for that one so next video we're going to talk about ratio and proportions in order to compare triangles so make sure you come back and watch that
