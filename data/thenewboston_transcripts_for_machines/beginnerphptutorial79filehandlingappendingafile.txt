hello this is Alex from PHP Academy and this is another video for the new Boston on appending uh data onto the end of a file or the contents um inside the file so we've already established we've opened up names.txt with the um property of right s writing to it um we've written the name Alex and Billy and we also have closed the file and then given a written confirmation so what I'm actually going to do now is I'm going to um open up the file itself so yeah names.txt now what happens if I want to add to this list so I'm going to change this to a okay now I'm going to put Steve oh Steven that's fine and I'm going to put um Tom so what I've done now is I've written um I've already written a name in fact let's just get rid of that um I've already written names to to uh this file if we go back and have a look refresh it Alex and Billy uh now what I want to do is say another line break after um Billy write the name Steven and then another line break um and this is a pending whereas before if we were doing W it would overwrite everything in the file so if we use a and uh we go back and we click on file we can see that it's simply added it to the to the end of the list um now if we go back um I'll show you an example in case you haven't caught it if I was to just do a w now watch what happens when I run the file so file.php we go back you can see now that we just have the name Steven and we have that line break before that so you can now understand the importance of using the W or the append now why do we have these two um these two features um obviously uh we need to at one at one instance we need to open up a file and write to it and then we close it and we may never need to use it again however in most cases we'll be opening up um a file and rewriting names to it and I'm going to give you a real life example let's um we'll just tighten this code up a bit here and um we're going to keep it as a penned but I'm going to get rid of this just here for now now I'm going to come under here and I'm going to create a form and the action of the form is going to be uh file.php the file we're currently using and the method is going to be post now what I'm going to do is end the form and I'm going to specify um a form field for the user to enter a name so uh name and then input type equals text uh name equals name and I'm going to break down a couple more lines and input type equals submit and the uh value of that is submit so this is what we're displaying to the user okay so let's just comment out this code for now and preview our form and we can see what it looks like oh know that's names.txt file.php okay so this is what it looks like um let's just uh get rid of names.txt Okay so we've got rid of names.txt if we open up the browser we can see that that's now gone now what we need to do is we need to um this this is automatically this data is automatically going to be posted um as we've seen before with far handling so what we need to do is before we um create this in fact we'll get rid of that all together what we want to do is we want to perform a check to see if this variable is set so if um name is set remember uh we're posting this from here so we're using the dollar undor poost because we've set the method to post and we're using the is set function to check this has been set so if it has been set we can uh specify this variable so I'm going to say name equals um uh dollar uncore post name okay uh now what we want to do is we want to say if not empty name else and in here we can just do an error message please type oh dear type a name okay so in here what we want to do now is if the user has entered um a name we're all okay so we can just test the functionality of this now click on file.php so I'm going to type in a name Alex click submit so that's okay if we don't type anything in it prompts us to type a name so this is all very well and good but now we're inside here what do we want to do we want to open up a handle and we want to open names.txt and we want to open up this to append now what we want to do is fite and we want to write to handle so what data do we want to write to this we want to write name now we want to append on a line break so a back slash and N so the functionality of this program is we're asking the user to enter names and every time they click submit and they submit a new name it's going to write it to a new line in this file so this is a real life example of where you can store data for um your user input now we're going to say f close you'll important F close and we're going to say handle inside that so now let's check if it works um at the moment if we go back to our file handling directory we've got no names.txt but once we type a name in and click submit uh we haven't given a confirmation message but what we can do is we can go back to here you can see that um a names.txt file exists and we've got Alex in there so let's go back again and type a new name in Click submit okay and let's type in Steven while we're here and we can type Tom while we're here as well so submit so now if we go back to file handling directory and look in our names.txt we can see that this has appended each name that we've processed through the form that's appended that onto the end um of well the end of the content of this file so that's about it for um appending um in the next tutorial we're going to be look at reading this data in and then displaying it back out to the user
