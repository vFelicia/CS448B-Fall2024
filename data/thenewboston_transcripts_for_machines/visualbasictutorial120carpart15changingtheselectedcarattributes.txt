hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about changing the values of the car that is selected now you can see that if we click Honda CRV and we change the name to some other name and click OK and show the info you can see that the name is still Honda CRV but then if we go to Mustang GT you can see that the name has been changed for that one now the reason this is happening is because in all of our button click events all we do is change the default sports car name so what we need to do is set this to change the name of the selected car now this is quite simple we'll just type selected car dot car name equals whatever the inbox input box returns now let's go ahead and help the user out a bit so we'll just add a new line here so environment dot new line and then we'll go ahead and tell them what the old name is so we'll just type old name and then we'll add the old name of the car so we will type selected car dot car name now this is shown before the value has been changed so we'll go ahead and minimize that right here and you can see that I've done that for each of the other buttons so selected card out color and then I so I showed them the old color and then have them input it and it will change it for the selected car now if we go to get powertoweight ratio you can see that I have commented commented this out because the selected car may or may not be a sports car and if it's not a sports car then we get an error for the get powertoweight ratio so let's go ahead and run this and see what kind of results we get so let's create a new car we will type we will call it a Sierra we'll set the color to green the number of doors to 4 I will set the horsepower to 300 we'll go ahead and click Add and here's our car right here now we can change the color of it to let's say black it'll show the info you can see that we get the colored black right there and when we change it again it shows us that the old color is black now we can change the number of doors to let's say 2 and you can see that it's going to update that there we can also accelerate the car so we can accelerate it to 45 miles per hour and you can see that the car is going 45 now if we change the name of this car to let's say Toyota Tundra and click OK it's not gonna update it in our list box but if we show the info info it's still gonna update it now there's an easy way to get around this and have it update in the list box without having to go through and reading every single item in our ArrayList so let's go ahead and come over here to button set name so whenever they set the name of that car what we want to do is update that name in the list box so we'll start off by accessing our list box so type list cars dot idem x' and now what we can do is we can add some parameters so you can see that if we arrow down here we get index as integer so we can access the currently selected index so we'll type list cars dot selected index and then we'll go ahead and set that equal to whatever the new name is so we'll just type selected car dot car name so by the time we're setting this new value it has already been changed by using the input box so let's go ahead and run this and see what kind of results we get so we won't make another car we'll just use one that's already existent so let's go ahead and change the name of the Mustang so we'll change it to Camaro SS we'll go ahead and click OK and you can see that it updates the name in our list box and it updates the name whenever we show the info so go ahead and add this code in for each one of your click events and once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
