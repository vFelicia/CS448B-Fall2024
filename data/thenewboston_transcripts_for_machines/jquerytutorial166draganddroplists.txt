hi this is IX from PHP academy' talk with the video tutorial for the new Boston now in this example application we're going to take a look at creating a simple draganddrop list and by this we're going to be dragging particular elements in this case we're going to be dragging Li elements from an unordered list into a div and then appending the text associated with them so essentially what it's going to look like is this and what's going to happen is we're going to be able to drag elements into this div and they actually append on here and then we can drag more than one element in if we like now this isn't a foolproof shopping list I guess this the names here give away that sort of food items but it does give you a good idea of how we are appending the text inside of here depending on what we dragged in so it's a really good way to practice the draggable and droppable elements using jQuery UI ok so let's go ahead and look at the code this is the index page we've obviously included jQuery the jQuery UI and UI j/s which we're going to be writing our code in now we've also got style dot CSS which is extremely important because we're going to need to style up a lot of our page as well as the borders associated with list and obviously the list itself so the first thing we're going to do is create an unordered list and inside here we have each li element and I'm going to have three of these for three different items this works with an unlimited amount of items within Li tags so you can add as many items as you want so I'm just going to go ahead and create a few items here and now that I've done this let's go over to our page and you can see that we have something looking like this now I want to style this up to remove some of these bullet points as well as the padding as well on this let's go to style dot CSS which I've included in my document as well and let's go ahead and style the unordered list so we're going to have a width of 100 pixels because by default this reaches out across the document and we'll have problems dragging I then want to set the padding to zero pixels and what this is going to do is just pull that in a little bit and we want the list style to be none so we don't have any of the bullet points okay so now that we've done this let's done this get let's go ahead and create our div which will be our list area I'm going to given this an ID of Lists now at the moment obviously we don't see anything we need to go ahead and give it some style so inside here we want to style our list element our list div on our page and the width of this is going to be 120 pixels and the height I'm going to set to 180 pixels and then going to give it a background color just so you can see where it is and that's going to be F 0 F 0 F 0 and the border by default is going to be set to 1 pixel solid and black so now we have something that looks like this so we're going to eventually be able to drag these inside here now when we drag elements over we want this border to increase to 2 pixels so I'm going to go ahead and create a class of our list div and that's going to be called border and inside here I'm just going to specify the border width and that's going to be 2 pixels ok so now that we've done this we need to go ahead and actually start to create our UI j/s which like I mentioned earlier we have included in the page and this is going to make these li elements draggable so let's create a document ready point here and inside here we have a function ok so once this is done once the page has been loaded we want to make these elements here draggable so we can drag them around the page so the first thing we do is we go ahead and use a selector this time what we're doing is we're selecting Li on its own so all Li elements on the page we want to make draggable now there's a few things we need to specify in here being the options in for the draggable element or draggable function i guess if you want to call it and this the first one is hover class and this is going to be the class that we put into this so the class that we apply to this div when an element has hovered over before we do that let's just go ahead and look at the draggable element so you can see that we can now drag them across the page obviously we can drag them up here which we don't want we'll fix that a bit later so the hover class is going to be border so now when we hover out when we drag over that hasn't worked let's check why that might be let's just go back into here list order now we might want to go and say border2px solid black oh so my apologies I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing the draggable doesn't take a hover class because this is the draggable element okay so that probably threw you off a bit but the draggable element doesn't take the hover class I'm thinking of the div itself so let's go ahead and actually get set the correct properties to draggable so the containment of this we need to set to our document and what this does is it stops our elements going off of the page you can see that now they've stopped once my cursor leaves the the document itself the next thing we want to do is set revert to true and what this will do is it will revert the element back to its original location once it has left here so it won't stay in a particular place forever that's extremely important because we want to drag append and not return to its original place okay so now on with the actual list itself we're going to go and make the list so we reference this as hash lists so using a ID selector and we want to make this droppable so now that we've made it droppable nothing is actually changed because we haven't applied any events or any properties to it now we can want to test the air actually works so what we're going to do is inside curly brackets we want to say drop function and then inside this function we're just going to go ahead and say alert let's just pull that over a bit we want to say alert dropped and this will check if it's working so yeah is working as I dropped this element over we have this dialog saying dropped and then that reverse back to its original position
