hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and welcome to a PHP video tutorial for the new Boston now after we've installed PHP and perhaps later on in our PHP development we may need to take a detailed look at everything within our PHP installation so for example you might go on later to look at the GD library so the GD library is used to generate images using its command set so it's a it's an addition to PHP it may not be included well I know it's not included with the original PHP installation so for example if someone was to say to you do you have curl installed or do you have G HD image installed and you know what these are and there's different different libraries for PHP but you needed to find a way to quickly check everything in your PHP installation and just find general information about your PHP version for example someone might ask you or you might need to find out which PHP version you're using because obviously different features of PHP work with different versions you may have a an older version of PHP which then later features aren't available so you always want to check that your update to the latest PHP version and you can check this also using this PHP info function that we're going to be talking about so to call the function is relatively simple it's just within your PHP tag to remember we create our PHP tags like this we can do PHP and then info and then two brackets so this is the standard notation for calling a function you can see that my text editor hasn't turned it blue like it normally would with other other language constructs for example echo you can see is automatically turned blue this is because it's a language construct within PHP it's something that's builtin and enables something to happen when we when we run it so PHP info we're just calling a function key you can see that it's remained black just like when we type something that doesn't exist for example it's also black so you need to watch out for this this means that we're calling a function so we're calling the function PHP door in pit sorry PHP info and I've saved this in index.php so let's come over to our browser and let's refresh and see what we get okay so here you can see that we are listing a a selection of data about our PHP installation so we've got PHP version so very very top in large letters we've got the version that we're running and if we go down we can see different things things that are enabled for example not enabled then we can come down and look at specific things like inside the PHP core so a lot of these will worm will be relative to your PHP dot ini file which we looked at previously and we will be looking at later on in the tutorials so let's just go down and see what information we have ok so all this information we've got information about Apache as well the Apache environment so that's our web server HTTP headers information down here about BC math calendar and just things like this that we don't have installed currently and then we can come down to things like FTP support Gd so for example earlier I mentioned the GD library you can see that GD support is enabled we've got the GD version which is bundled with this package etc etc we've got support for different things so you can find a lot of information out about your PHP installation by just by calling this function and it generates a long list of thing details about your PHP installation now one thing is really really important you mustn't keep a file with this function on your server you must not have this live on a server in fact even on your local machine if you know that you're not protected against people accessing this this will give people lots of detailed information about your PHP installation now the reason I'm okay to show you is because I'm working on a local machine it's not giving any information that I that you know could harm my my computer through my internet connection if you're running a say a website and you had this command somewhere on your website that allowed people to view they can view all sorts of information about your PHP installation so despite now seeing it work you also must realize that if you have to do this do it and then quickly delete it so that's just a bit of security advice for you so we've run through the PHP info function which gives out information about your PHP installation and obviously you can use this when you need to find out any specifics about your PHP package
