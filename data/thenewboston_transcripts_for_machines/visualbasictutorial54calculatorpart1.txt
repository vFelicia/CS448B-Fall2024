hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the New Boston in this tutorial and in the next upcoming tutorials we're going to be creating a calculator so let's go ahead and get started by making a new project we'll select windows forms application and we will just call it calculator and we'll wait for that to load now let's go ahead and add some stuff to our form so we'll open up our toolbox we will add three text boxes and for the third text box we are going to set readonly equal to true so readonly is now equal to true and we'll go ahead and set the names for these so the first one is going to be text num1 the second one is going to be text num2 and the third one is going to be text numb three or text answer now let's go ahead and add some buttons here so we'll just add them below and we will make this a little bit bigger okay so here's our add button will add a subtract will add a power what else can we have we'll add multiply will add division and we'll just add PI so now that we've got some buttons and some text boxes let's go ahead and rearrange these and make it look a little bit nicer so we'll strength these down and you can see here that lines show up whenever we want to shrink them down and this is what Visual Basic does to help you make your forms and controls look a little bit nicer so let's go ahead and set the name of this one to button add we'll hit enter with we will have button subtract button divide button multiply instead of power for this one let's just do button modulus and for this one we will do button pie so now let's go ahead and set the text value for each of these so the first one is just going to be ad this one will be subtract and this one will be divide multiply modulus and pie so now let's add some labels so the user knows what these boxes are for so we will just select all of these and drag them down some will drag this down and this down with it will open up our tool box we'll add a label and we'll have this label say first number we'll copy this and paste it and we'll set the second one to second number and we'll set the third one to answer so we'll just ctrlc and ctrlv to paste it so for this one we'll just type answer okay so now I'll just create click events for each one of these now if you don't want to double click on each one of the buttons you can go ahead and select the button and click the lightning bolt and find the click of it and double click on that so now that you've got your forum initialized and you know what it looks like you can you don't have to make it look exactly like mine but um go ahead and once you've made that move on to the next tutorial and will start putting in the code for this
