what's up guys is Bucky here and welcome to your 39th JavaScript Zorro and in the last tutorial I tell you guys how to access and differentiate between different forms on your web page but now in this tutorial since we already have access to each form I'm going to show you how to access each element in those forms so let's go ahead and create a form but I didn't want to keep the old one from last time because I want to make it a little bit different so as we know from our XHTML tutorials hopefully you are shows each form can have a property called name and I'm just gonna set this form equal to Bucky's form simple enough so now if we go ahead and end it we can begin adding our elements so let's just like before add a username a password and submit bun so the username all we need to do is just like last time we'll just make it input box so input type equals text and let's go ahead and add a name to this too so name equals user's name simple enough so now if we just go ahead and and we won't copy it so for the password box it would be input type equals might as well make a password I think I made it text in the last tutorial but that's definitely not secure so the name equals um password so well know so let me just go ahead and test this right now hello didn't want to look I got Yahoo son of a beach launching Chrome there we go so now we've got a password box in the text box working perfectly so I might as well add a submit button I mean why not um input type equals submit value equals submit now let's go ahead and save it and refresh again and check it out we got a perfectly working form a username secret password and the submit button that does nothing at all pretty cool huh so like I said in order to access our form itself let's say we want to set equal to variable would first rate document since the forms array is an object of the document so then we would write forms and since this is our first form on our web page we would go ahead and identify it by 0 since everything in arrays start at 0 so after that I told you guys that there is a way to access each element so for example if we want to access the first element right here the forms array has a property already built in and that's the elements array so elements 0 will give you access to the first element in your form elements 1 will give you access to this and elements 2 would give you access to this and you're saying all right why do I even want access to it and what's the use of it what am I going to do with it well typically people want access to let's say they wanted to verify that the user name only consisted of letters and numbers so when a user logs in your web page you don't want them to enter lucky dollar sign percentage sign at sign semicolon semicolon you want like Bucky 65 Bucky 1492 so this is why you would want access to each element so for now since we're not validating any data all we're going to do with this element it is get a property of it and that's the name and again your form has a name called Bucky's form and each element has a name this one is username this one is password this one we didn't give a name so now the name of username since this is the first element in form zero is going to be equal to the value username x equals username so now we just go ahead and document write this and if we print out X on the screen and save it and launching Chrome check it out it says username right there so one more quick example if we go ahead and access the second one by typing form zero since it's the first form second element and go ahead and save this and then we go ahead and launch this in chrome it says password right there pretty cool huh so I'm saying all right simple enough whenever I want to access a form I just write form whatever number it is and then whenever I want to access an element I write element whatever number it is in the array but all these arrays are getting pretty confusing Bucky is there something easier that I can do yes there is instead of worrying about arrays you have a different option of accessing your forms and also your elements instead of using the forms array you can just go ahead and use the name of the form itself and this oh I think I can I'll cough so anyways let's just go ahead and copy the name of the form which is Bucky's form instead of form zero we're just gonna go ahead and put Bucky's form and it just like that so just to verify that it's working so far let's go ahead and run launching curl and check it out we still get password pretty cool so now we know that we can use the form name instead of using that dumb forms array a whole lot more simple or a whole lot simpler what is it I don't know I'll let you decide so now what we can do is we can treat elements the same rate the same array oh I crack myself up the same way if element has a name we no longer have to use that dumb old elements array we go ahead and use the name of it which is users name in this case so let's go ahead and paste this in and of course if we're writing code where we wanted to print out the name of an element I mean the names right here so it's gonna print out user name kind of redundant but anyways this is just an example so let's go ahead and launch this in chrome and we see in fact we can access that element using the name instead of the array so anyways probably printing out the name wasn't the best example but hey I did it anyway so what I want to stress you guys in this story is in order to access each individual element in the forms array we can either use the element array simple enough element and then the name of whatever element you want to use or excuse me the number of whatever element you want to use or if it has a name we can use that as well for example we use bucky's form right there in user name right there and it works fine so with those two things we now have knowledge of how to access any item in our forms any item in any form on our webpage pretty cool huh so now that we have access to them we can be then begin doing things like validating the data make sure they're filled in checking whether or not a checkbox is checked checking whether a radio box is checked you know simple stuff like that so that's what I'm probably gonna be covering in the next tutorial but for now that's all I have for you guys so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
