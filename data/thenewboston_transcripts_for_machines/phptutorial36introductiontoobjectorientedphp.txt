what's up guys it is Bucky and welcome to your 36 PHP tutorial and if you've been following my tutorials since the beginning you probably noticed a little small detail and that's that I have not made a new PHP tutorial in literally about two years but this morning I woke up and I was like you know what I feel like making speech be tutorials so that's what I'm doing but I just want to give you guys that warning because that was two years ago and I don't have the best memory so I'm not entirely sure the things we covered in the past um if we were working on any projects then you know you can forget about those because you know it's two years later my memory isn't that great so just want to give you guys a heads up that that was two years ago if there's something that I teach you guys and I'm going over and I didn't cover just leave me a comment and let me know hey you didn't cover this but anyways what we're going to be doing in these tutorials from now on first thing we're going to do blue the first thing we're going to be doing is working with objectoriented PHP that's where we're going to pick up and that's where we're going to go from here so ever saying all right wTF is objectoriented PHP objectoriented PHP is pretty much a different way to program than we were in the last couple tutorials objectoriented PHP has deal with two main concepts and that's classes and objects now what a class is is it's pretty much a way to organize your data all your variables and all functions that are related can go in one class in an object is pretty much a way to access that class to get all the variables and functions from that class and actually be able to use them so for example if you're building a program of all the things in the world you probably make a class for people and probably make a different class for animals and you probably make a different class for places or something now in order to access all those things you need objects and if you create an object you can access all the stuff from the people class let's say and you can create another object to access all the variables and functions from the animals class so you know enough of me talking because you know I'm a programmer not the talker so let's go ahead and start program the first thing I'm going to do is make a simple class and let's just go ahead and use that let's go ahead and make it for people so class let's go ahead and put it right there class people and by the way typically whenever you make classes you're going to want to put them in a separate file but I'm going to throw all mine in the index and this is just for the simplicity of making this tutorial real quick and showing you guys how to make a basic class but anyways if you're like working on it for a company in building these classes you typically want to put each class in a separate file and that's how people typically organize it but anyways like I said in this case everything is going in the index so anyways I have this class called people in order to make class go ahead and type the name class and then go ahead and name your class whatever you want now anything inside your curly braces is going to belong to that class so let's go ahead and make a variable in a function that's part of the pupils class or the people class now the first thing you need to do in order to make a variable which is technically called a field when it's inside a class but I call it variable but I just want to tell you guys that because if you're you know learning this for a class or something not this class but like a college class and the word field was on your multiple choice test choose that instead of variables but this isn't a college course this is the new Boston so I can say whatever the F I want I can't even say F how cool is that so noise go ahead and in order to make a variable or field you first need to type a stupid keyword and that's public now these keywords and they have to deal with something called scope we're going to be covering those in a later tutorial not this toriel because we don't have time but anyways let's go ahead and make a variable called name by the way if you just can't wait public means every thing outside this class has access to this is pretty much basically that but anyways now that we have a variable called name let's go ahead and make another function that can you know set the name like set it to Bucky or Lisa or something like that so let's go ahead and make a function and of course use this go ahead and type that stupid public whatever that means we're going to be covering that in probably the next tutorial and go ahead and make a function just like you did before one name is function set name and pass it in the parameter X and now we want to say this alright we have a variable in this class called name and what we want to do is we want to set it equal to whatever value we pass in so if we pass in Bucky as X we want to set this variable equal to Bucky so how do we say we want to work with this variable I know are we saying just go ahead and type name like that well with classes it's a little bit different in order to access a field in this class or a variable you need to type a special this keyword this means our I'm going to be working with something in this class what am I going to be working with and now you're going to want to make a little arrow and this is another dumb syntax out you have to use but hey now take it up with me take up whoever invented PHP and now once you have this and the dumb little arrow go ahead and type whatever variable name you want to work within that's name and note that whenever you're working with it in this style it doesn't use the dollar sign the only time you got to put the dollar sign is with this and that's it not on the name if you put it on the name you're going to get a error or something weird is going to happen so now that you're working with this variable right here go ahead and set it equal to that x value so check this out we have a class called people that has a variable in it and a function whenever we call this function what it's going to do is if we pass in Bucky 4 it is going to say all right set this variable equal to the name Bucky or you know whatever your name is so anyways let's go ahead and in our body let's go ahead and do that right now actually I don't even know if we're going to have time in this story actually we'll save this for next story because I really hate running time so anyways in the next story where we're going to be doing is I'm gonna upload this to my website and I'm going to show you guys how to create you know what enough of me explaining what I'm going to do in the next door just watch the other tutorial and then you'll know what I'm doing so anyways thank you guys for watching this tutorial and I'll see you next time
