hi this is Alex from PHP academy' no org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to look at the jQuery at function the way I say it's a bit odd I guess but it looks like this it's short for attribute I guess it's not really a function it's an attribute part of jQuery however it is used to take specific parts of an element attributes of an element and actually relay them or store them okay so what we're going to do is we're going to create a link and with this link we're going to retrieve the href and the target so if we were to go ahead and just create some paragraph tags I'm going to create a link inside here now remember href is an attribute of this a element and as well target is also an attribute so we can use jQuery to return the values of attributes as they're currently set so in this example we're looking at taking the attribute href and target which might seem pretty pointless but obviously you can make use with this on any attribute so I'm gonna create a link just in here and then I'm going to create a target as well which will be underscore blank which essentially means to open in a new window and then gonna give the link text as a link so let's go over to our browser and take a look you can see that we've just got a link here when we click on it we'll be taken to the URL we specified okay so now what I'm gonna do is just below this create another paragraph area and I'm going to call this I'm gonna give this an ID of ATRA just so we Semmy know what we're doing we also need to give the ID to href we could just we could just refer when we actually take the value as a we don't need to supply an ID however I'm just gonna supply an ID so we take it specifically from this link okay so I'm gonna just call this link so now that we've got link we want to take the attribute href and then later on we're gonna take the attribute target and we're gonna place it inside this paragraph area here so we need to create an external javascript file so let's go ahead and open up a new file we're gonna save this inside our j/s directory as atrophy is i'm gonna come over to index dot PHP and i'm going to come down and include this file into my page so the type is text forward slash JavaScript the source is js4 slash etre j/s okay so now that we've done that we need to go over to action is and actually take this H ref and place it inside this paragraph tag so let's go ahead and simply reference our link so link dot atre so we using the etre attribute in jQuery and we want to supply what attribute we want to take from this link so I'm gonna call that H ref or reference H ref so we take the H ref so now we need to save this inside of a value so we can relay it back to the page so I'm gonna create a variable and I'm gonna call this atra so now what's happened is this variable here contains this value in here so now what we can simply do is come down to the next line we can reference the paragraph which I have called ACTRA and I'm gonna say dot text etre so I'm replacing this variable inside are inside this text function which is going to take take this value here and actually place it inside of this paragraph so let's go over and refresh the page and you'll see that the link has been displayed from this link here so we've successfully taken the attribute we can then go ahead and perhaps change this to target save that out refresh our browser and you can see that we've got blank so I guess this example could be useful if you had for example a collection of links on a page and you wanted to display the URL next to them I guess this isn't a good example with the method or the example I've given in the tutorial but obviously using atra you can actually take attribute of almost any HTML element so we can go ahead and take attributes of divs attributes or form fields to get their value even so there's you know a sort of an endless supply of ways you could actually use this however for now that's the ATRA attribute in jQuery
