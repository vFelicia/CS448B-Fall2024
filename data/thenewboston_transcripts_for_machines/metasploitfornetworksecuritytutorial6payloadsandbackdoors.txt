all right hostas welcome back and in this video I am going to be teaching you guys about payloads and I'll also show you guys how to get back door into Metasploit able so if you don't have Metasploit about up and running go watch my last video but once you do the first thing like I said that you need to do is you need to get the IP address of that and we found out in the last video that it was one two one six eight one five two dot one two nine now another thing that you're going to need to do is you're going to need to get the IP address of your own Kali Linux machine so this is one I 2 1 6 8 1 5 2 dot 1 2 8 so pretty easy to remember but what I did before this video even started is I just wrote those down now the reason that we need to get the IP addresses of both the Machine we're at right now and our targets machine is because what we're going to be doing in just a second is we're going to be getting a backdoor into this machine so once we do that we need to say ok for the exploit we're going to use this is the target and this is where we're going to listen or control that machine from so make sure you have that and once you do you are good to go so clear out of there and by the way chances are the IP addresses are going to be different for your setup so just don't copy those IP addresses since yours might be a little bit different and I remember I don't even have Metasploit started yet so service post Jerry SQL start up that database dunt dunt dunt dunt down and MSF console so this is going to start database for the exploits and this is going to launch the Metasploit command line framework console starting the Medus with framework on so we're about to get a book the back door got a bunny nice alright so clear out of there now I happen to know that the exploit is unreal three point two point one point eight now a word of warning this is an older exploit so it's not going to work a lot on you know modern systems I think it was found in like 2009 but the reason I want to show you this is just because I need to teach you about payloads and I know that this one has a payload we can use and also just to get a little familiar with Metasploit Abul so anyways like I said you're not going to find a lot of systems with this exploit but it's going to help us learn what we need to learn so all right so I guess the disclosure was in 2010 excellent looking good so let's just get a little bit of info about it before we start using it so we can see that all right so any system running unreal this version there's exploit where it gives where it allows us to have a malicious backdoor that sounds amazing let's go ahead and use it so we want to use it boom roasted now before we can and remember like I said the first thing that you should always do whenever you use exploit is just write show options so what this does is it gives us the information that it needs in order to work properly so it says that we're missing one piece of information right here and that is the targets address so if I open this back up we know that the IP address of our target is one I 1 6 a 1 5 1 2 9 all right so I'm going to set our host to 192 168 1 5 2 1 2 9 that's the Machine that we're going to be attacking so now let me clear out of here and show options ok Bucky can you type sausage fingers and our a so we have all the information that we need so before we learned about this cheat just the these basic options and how can how we can set them how we can edit them whatever but now we need to take it one step further and actually need to set something called a payload now so I'm going to go ahead and write show payloads and it's going to go through and list a bunch of these things all right so before we go any further what the heck is a payload a payload is something you can do once the exploit work so the exploit what we set up so far it's basically just gaining access into the system but now you have to ask alright once I have access to the system I probably want to do something right well yes we do and what we're going to do for our payload or kind of the ending or result is words just going to get a back door right through this payload so basically what we're trying to do is have full control over the system that's all we're saying easy enough so sounds pretty cool and in order to set a payload no nothing it's not too hard to remember just right set payload and then paste the name of it right there so hit enter that's what we're going to be using and just like the main exploit payloads also have options so if we were a show options then we can see that this is the main tool that we're using to gain access and these are our payload options so what now it says okay this is the computer you want to attack or try to find an exploit but now whenever you get access what address are you going to listen from and we're just going to do it from our own computer so copy this and you know simple stuff so set L host to our IP address 192 168 1 5 2 1 2 8 show options in our egg so this is our attack this is our payload and make sure that you have everything set properly and then once you do just right to exploit now let it run and don'tdon't uh let me do my thing all right so see if I can scroll down a little bit it's kind of weird having this on uh alright whatever so the tools running and you know it looks like it completed and what the heck did this thing like pause or something all I'm looking at is a blinking line at the bottom of the screen now it says that a session is open um all right what exactly is going on well believe it or not this blinking line that you're looking at this is actually a terminal to our targets machine so check this out if you just type Who am I it says root now it's not for my Kali Linux machine this is actually we are in the other server Metasploit Abel so let me just look around LS and all right so all of these files that we're looking at right here these aren't files on my computer these are files on the target computer so we now successfully have gained back door into another remote system so from here I mean you can do anything you want you can start deleting files you can look around you can you know I'll leave it up to your imagination but that ladies and gentlemen is the basics of what a payload is and also how to use Metasploit to gain access into Metasploit able and there are a bunch of other vulnerabilities and exploits that we're going to be covering later on but for now that's all you guys get thank you for watching I'll see you next video
