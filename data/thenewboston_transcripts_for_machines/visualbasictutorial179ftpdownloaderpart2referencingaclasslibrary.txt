hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our FTP downloader now FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol if you didn't already know that so here is my project directory for the FTP downloader it's in documents Visual Studio 2010 projects and then FTP downloader YouTube now you will have all of these files here except for FTP client vb d ll now I haven't talked to Bucky yet but I'm going to see if it will put this DLL file in the download now this is a class library that has a bunch of stuff that we can use with FTP now this was created by a guy named Howard with Howard Richards he is a programmer for the he posts at the code project a lot and now I'm not advertising for the code project I know that I don't actually use it myself but I just want to get full credit to Howard Richard for creating this class library that we can use so we'll go ahead and make out of that now here is ftp client vb now at the moment we can't do anything with this dll file so what we can do is open up a program called il spy now what I'll spy does is it lets us decompile dotnet programs and class libraries now I'm not gonna give you guys a download link for this one you can search for it on Google yourself but what we're gonna do is we're gonna file open and let's just go ahead and go to documents Visual Studio 2010 projects and we'll do FTP download or YouTube and here's FTP client VB DLL and you can see we can open this and it opens up this right here in our menu in its art class library so you can see it has references which we don't need to look at it has resources which we don't need to look at and then here is where all the code is stored so let's go to utilities dot FTP so here is FTP client now we can go ahead and look and see what he has created for us to use so we've got FTP File exists now it's abilene and it returns to check and see if an ftp file exists and it takes the string argument which is a file name now you may be thinking what is all this typed in right here this is not basic this is some other language well this was written in csharp and if you create a craft class library in csharp because csharp runs on the.net framework you can also use that class library with visual basic programs in the same issue the other way around so if you create a class I'm very individual basic I believe you can go use it with csharp so this has a whole bunch of stuff in it it just checks to see if the FTP file exists and if it does it's gonna return it in a true and if it does it'll return false we can rename FTP files and we can delete directories we can do a whole bunch of stuff that Howard Richards has added for us which makes it very easy to work with the file transfer protocol so we'll go ahead and close out of that so now what we need to do is we need to come into our FTP downloader YouTube project we need to come up here and we need to add a reference so we need to go to project add reference and let's just browse so we've got FTP downloader YouTube right here and if you just click this button right here up one level you can see we have FTP client V B dot DL and you can see that this accepts dot DLL files so we select FTP client VB DLL go ahead and click OK and you can see that it adds a reference in our project now nothing really changed so what we can do is come up here and click show all files and we can go up to references and you can see that we have FTP client VB under our references which is a class library now let's just go ahead and get rid of show all files so in this tutorial I walk you guys through decompiling our class library with il spy so we can see a little bit about what it does and how it helps us use File Transfer Protocol and then we added a reference to that class library so in the next tutorial we're going to start using that class library to do stuff like update our server open folders and other stuff that we have already added on our GUI so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
