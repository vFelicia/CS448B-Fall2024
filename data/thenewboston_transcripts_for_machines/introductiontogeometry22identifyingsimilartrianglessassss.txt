our Focus today is on the two other ways to identify similar triangles which are side angle side and side side side so side angle side is when you have two pairs of corresponding sides that are in proportion and the included angles are congruent side side side is when you have three pairs of corresponding sides in proportion so now we're going to do some examples with these two properties so tell whether triangles are similar by side angle side or side side side well for this first one we don't know that any angles are congruent so it can't be side angle side so in order to do side side side we're going to put each one of the little triangles um sides over the big triangle to see if they're all in proportion so 2 over 8 is = to 2 over 8 and if we cross multiply um you get 16 = 16 so yes those are in proportion and since the other ones are also 2 over8 we know that all that each one of these sides is in proportion with this side and if you want to know what the rate of it is it's 1/4 because this side is 1/4 of this side so for the next one we have these two triangles we know that this is a right angle this is a right angle and we have these two side lengths so since this is a right angle it's measure is 90Â° so that means that we're going to call this angle a and this angle D so we know that angle a is congruent to angle D so that's the a for this part so now we're going to put these we're going to put the little triangle over the big triangle and set it equal to the Little Triangle over the big triangle so then we're going to cross multiply and you get 72 is equal to 72 so there so those sides are proportional so therefore these triangles are similar by side angle side we have one more example we have these two triangles right here and we know the length of these sides so first we're going to check and see if these are proportional so we're going to put this side over this side and this side over this side so 2 over 6 is that equal to 2 over 6 and yes those two sides are proportional so there's no property that's just side side but if you remember our special angles these angles right here are vertical angles and vertical angles are always congruent so we'll call this J and this angle K so since angle J and angle K are vertical angles angle J is congruent to angle K so now we can say that these therefore triangles are congruent excuse me not congruent triangles are similar by side angle side so now that we know the property properties of similar triangles and how to prove that they are similar triangles make sure you come and watch the next lesson where we're going to talk about perimeter and similar triangles
