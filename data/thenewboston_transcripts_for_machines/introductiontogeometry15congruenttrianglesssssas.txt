we're going to be proving that triangles are congruent today using two of the five basic methods the first is side side side and the second is side angle side so the first one side side side is when you have three sides of one triangle congruent to three sides of another triangle so here we know that this side is congruent to this side this side's congruent to this side this side's congruent to this side therefore we're going to call this triangle a and this triangle B triangle a is congruent to Triangle B so then the next one we're going to talk about is called side angle side or for short SAS two sides and the included angle of one triangle are congruent to two sides in the included angle of another triangle so this part right here the the included angle is really important it has to be the included angle so for these two triangles I know that this side is equal to this side this side is congruent to this side and I know that this angle which is between these two sides and this angle between these two sides are both right angles they don't have to be right angles like if you were trying to prove other triangles were congruent and you just knew that they were their angles were equal that's all that matters you don't have to know the right triangles or right angles but we know that because right angles equal 90° they these two angles have to be congruent because they both measure 90° so knowing that these three things two sides in the included angle we're going to call this a and this B therefore we can say that triangle a is congruent to Triangle B so let's do some examples so we're going to um State whether these triangles are congruent and if they are congruent we're going to say whether it was by side side side or side angle side if we find that these triangles aren't congruent we're just going to put neither so first we have these two triangles and I have this side congruent to this side this side congruent to this side and these two sides congruent so therefore there triangle one is congruent to Triangle two by side side side I can now I'm going to look at this one I know this side is congruent to this side this side is congruent to this side so so far we have two congruent sides but if you look this angle is the included angle of this of these two sides but this angle over here is not the included angle for us to prove that these are congruent we'd have to know that this one is congruent to to this one but since we don't know that we have to say neither now this doesn't mean the triangles aren't congruent this just means that we can't prove that they are so we went over the first two ways to prove triangles are congruent so make sure you come back and watch the next video and we're going to talk about two other ways to prove triangles are congruent called angle side Ang angle and angle angle side
