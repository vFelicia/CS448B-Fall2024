hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at dates so in Visual Basic there is a class called date and you can create objects with that and use that to get the current date you can also format this in several different ways so we're just going to make a little demo application that will show us what we can do with some of the date functions so we'll select windows forms application and we'll set the name to dates and once that's loaded we'll come over here to our toolbox and we will add a button so we'll just resize this a little bit and also the text of button one to show date and we will set the name to button show date okay so now we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and double click on show date so what we can do is zoom in here a little bit first so what we can do is create an object of the date class so we'll go ahead and type dim current date as anyway type date if you read the description it says represents an instant in time typically expressed as date and time of day so it will go ahead and get the time that the current date the year of the month the minutes the hours the seconds every part of the time it's going to get that so go ahead and set that equal to a value so current date equals now so you can see it says public readonly property now as date returns the data value containing the current date and time according to your system so it's going to go ahead and get the date and time on the user system so whatever machine it's running on is going to get their time and it's not going to use a pacified time now you so let's go ahead and output the the current date in a message box so we'll type message box dot show and we will just take our date and convert it to a string so current date dot two string and let's go ahead set the title to date application now let's go ahead and run this and see what happens so here's our form and when we click show date it gives us May 9th 2011 at 701 p.m. and 8 seconds so if we keep clicking this you can see that updates according to the current time because every time we click it it creates a new date and sets it to now so if we click it it's got 28 seconds wait a couple seconds click it again and it's got 31 now what we can also do is we can convert the current date to another format so let's say you don't want the month the day the year and everything in there so we can do is we type current date dot 2 short time string so while this is going to do is going to convert it to a short time string and what that means is that it's just going to show the time 701 p.m. now there are many other things that you can do with this you can do dot to long time string let's go ahead and run this we'll click show date and we get the seconds as well as the hour and minute and you can see that it does not update in real time so I'm going to close out of that and we can go ahead and look at some of the other stuffs that we can do so if you just type a dot you can see that we've got two short time string two short date string two zero eight date two long time string and two long date string they string so you can go ahead and play around with those see what those do see what happens when you type those in and once you've practiced a little bit with date and date objects go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
