hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we are going to be creating a paragraph we're then going to be going going ahead and finding all strong tags or anything that's surrounded by strong inside of this paragraph or inside of our entire document depending on which selector we use and we're going to make this 120 percent of its original size so for example will receive an effect a bit like this this is a simple paragraph this has been put in strong tags the font size is enlarged and this one here is in strong tags as well and that's been enlarged as well so we're going to be creating something similar to this although this isn't really a great use of find it's still to demonstrate how we can sort of pick out different elements in the tutorial in the traversing set of this series I use find more usefully so you can go ahead and look at that tutorial as well but for now we're just going to be demonstrating the functionality and how we might use it so the first thing we're going to do is go ahead and create a paragraph and just going to say this is a paragraph some things are bold and some are not okay so I'm just going to go ahead and put some strong tags around a few things in my page so strong and we could say bold in strung as well and maybe we could put not in strong as well just sort of for effect so now when we refresh you can see that we've got bold bold and bold now what I want to do is go ahead and make these bigger by using find and finding strong tags in my page now obviously we could go ahead and do this from style.css i've got style dot CSS included in my page already so for example i could specify that allstrong has a font size of 120% so I could do this straight up from my style dot CSS file however I could then go ahead and use jQuery to sort of filter this down and select particular elements on a page so we'll go ahead and get rid of that inside ext j/s which i've included on my page as well as jQuery we're going to go ahead and select all strong tags on our document or we're going to say we're going to say find so you know sort of a pretty useless idea of using it but you know we can go ahead and test it anyway so once our document is ready we're using the ready event handler once the Dom is loaded and we can access our elements we want to go ahead and select a document dot find now what fine is going to go and do is it's going to find anything on the document which matches this criteria so I'm going to go ahead and write strong and then going to go and say add class I could you know go ahead and change the CSS if I wanted using CSS but I'm going to go and add the class big inside style dot CSS I need to now need to create this big class so I'm going to go ahead and create it now so big and in here we're going to specify that the font size is 120 percent so what we are doing is inside of our whole entire document altogether we are saying that we're finding strong tags using find and we're adding the class big to them so you know obviously something you might not normally do when we refresh we get the same effect let's just go and change that to 130 refresh you can see it's bigger now the beauty of this is what we can actually do is now what we can say is P find strong so when we refresh we have the same effect yet anything out of this paragraph that is strong strong we can go ahead and say you know just outside of power graph now when we refresh you can see that this is bold ie strong but the text size hasn't been increased so what we've been able to do here is any strong tag inside of P so we found any strong tag inside of the any P element we've added the class to but we've ignored anything out of this bounds so before we were using document which applied to the whole document and then you can see that's been enlarged as well but this time we're using a selector and going ahead and finding any strong tag inside and then going ahead and adding this class on so this is a pretty useless example of what we would do although you know you could apply it to your page for some kind of weird text effect however in the tutorial on next nextdoor previous and previous all I look at the you know using a more useful way to use find but for now this is just a functionality or find and how we can sort of apply something to it using a selector and then finding a particular tag
