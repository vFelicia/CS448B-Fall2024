hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we're going to look at the button selector in jQuery so the first thing that we're going to go ahead and do is actually create a button on our page so let's go ahead and say input type is equal to button uh our value can just be a button and now with this we can actually uh specify the button uh selector inside our selectors do JS file so we've got selectors JS included in our page now let's go ahead and um actually try and select this button so to select this button or to reference this button at any point we could either add an ID or we could select by button so let's go ahead and uh use this uh colon here and button now what we've done is we've successfully now selected all buttons on a page so now what we could say is do click and we could create a callback function in here uh in this event handler and we could say alert and alert for example hello so now for every button on the page that's clicked remember this is an event handler here uh we carry out this function inside of here so let's go ahead and test that we've got the button here when we click on it we have this hello appear here okay so because this is an event handler that's specific to all buttons or or for all buttons when we duplicate this button on the page Okay so we've created three buttons now we've got this one this one and this one what our jQuery Handler or selector is going to do here is it's going to pick up all buttons on the page so it's only selected button or elements with the uh type button so we can have a look at this when we click here we have hello when we click on this button we also have hello and when we click on this button we also have hello so for example if I was to go ahead and change this first one or the last one to submit uh this is going to make all the difference because when we click on this button here and this button here this third one is not does not match the set that has been selected with jQuery the element isn't a button so when we click on it nothing happens because this is a submit so let's take a look at uh this the jQuery submit selector which is exactly the same using a colon however we just use submit so now what's going to happen is when we refresh our page the first two buttons aren't going to work but the third one will work so we've selected all buttons on a page so how would this be used in a practical real life um example well let's just say you have a lot of buttons throughout your website and you have this JS file uh selectors JS let's just say you have a lot of submit buttons that when pressed you want to disable them and uh then go ahead and uh wait for the form itself to load you might have these submit buttons as part of a form now if you were to um create say an inline function for each of these buttons uh this is extremely inefficient so if you reference just all buttons on a page and carry out an action just for them buttons uh this makes uh first of all a lot easier for yourself uh because you only have to write a few lines of code but not only that it actually creat a more efficient application so let's take a look at what I've just spoken about um as an example Okay so we've got the input type button here um let's just say that when we um press the button uh we want to go ahead and create um um okay so uh let's go ahead and we've created our button here uh we've got a type of button and value is let's just say um register we might also have a button somewhere else on our website uh that's called just submit uh for example a contact form or something so we've got these two buttons now what we want to do is when the either of these buttons are click click or when any button on our website is clicked we want to display the text please wait so let's go ahead and uh say submit which we haven't got that button let's just change these to submit so when a submit button is clicked somewhere we want to change the value of the um the uh text in the button and you could also disable it but we won't be looking at that in this tutorial so you can reference the um the button like submit and then you can say do atra this is uh the attribute of a function so for example the value we can change to please wait so don't worry if you don't understand this functionality just yet uh but essentially we're just changing the value to please wait so now for every button on our page when we click on it uh it changes to please weight now we do have another problem here and uh this was created on purpose uh we have please wait now on uh the buttons so what if we had two of the same button on the page well what we can actually do is we can use this selector here and what this will do is it will only change the text for the button that was currently selected so now let's go ahead and uh click register you can see that that just that one has changed when we click on this one just that one there has changed so I took this a little further than i' planned to uh but just for now that is the select seor the submit and the button selector in jqu
