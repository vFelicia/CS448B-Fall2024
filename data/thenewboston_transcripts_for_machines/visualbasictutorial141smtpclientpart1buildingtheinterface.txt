hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be making a program that will send emails using SMTP so let's go ahead and create a new project and get started so we'll select a windows forms application and we will name it mail client go ahead and click OK and wait for that to load ok so now once that's loaded we're going to open up our toolbox let's add some stuff to our form so we'll add some labels so we're gonna have label from you're gonna have to input your password for your email account and then we've got to you've got subject and then we've got the body so let's just go ahead and set the text value for each of these so from password to subject and body okay so now let's move these down a little bit and we will add some text boxes so we will add one for each one of these labels so we've got from password to subject and then the body so we'll make the body of it multiline by just clicking this arrow and selecting multiline and let's go ahead and we will move some stuff around here to make better use of our form so okay so let's drag the body up here and then make that a little bit bigger and then we'll start adding the code to our form and now I need to add one more button when you add a button that says send so we will change it to will change the text to send and then we will set the name to button send let's go ahead and add another button so they can reset the fields without having to go through and doing it themselves so we'll do button reset fields and we will just set the text to discard make sure that these buttons are the same sizes okay so now we've created the user interface for our email client so what are the title of form 1 email client okay so now let's go ahead and double click on email client to open up public class form 1 let's just go ahead and get rid of for more load because we're not going to be using that now let's go ahead and come down here and what we're going to do we're gonna have to do to use email is import system dot net dot mail so this is our mail namespace that has everything we're going to need to send emails now let's go ahead and create two objects so private my message as new message so it's a Windows message which him be used to send email messages and let's go ahead and make this a mail message instead of a message sorry I messed that up there and now we're going to need to do is create an SMTP client so SMTP sender as new and now what we're going to use is the SMTP client so we're going to create a new SMTP client and they says allows applications to send email by using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol so that's what SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol ok so in this tutorial we set up the user interface for our email client and we went ahead and created two objects so go ahead and do this if you haven't already I highly suggest that you do everything we do in their tutorials it'll help you learn a lot better and a lot faster and once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
