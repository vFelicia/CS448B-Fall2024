okay so today we're going to talk about how we geometrically prove that triangles are congruent so the important thing to talk about first is what do we mean by geometrically proof if I was to tell you to algebraically prove something you wouldn't use equations to solve for the sides and then that's how you could prove that they are congruent but instead we're going to geometrically prove it which means that we're going to take the theorems and the rules that we've learned up until now as reasons why these triangles are congruent so if you remember there's a bunch of different ways to prove triangles are congruent there's side side side side angle side angle side angle and H L so those are the kind of things we're going to use to prove that these triangles are congruent so that given so we're always going to start off with a given statement given D is the midpoint of AC and that a B is congruent to BC the directions should say prove triangles are congruent so first what we want to do is take note of the information they give us so we know that a B is congruent to BC and that's always going to be our first step our first statement is that a B is congruent to BC and our reason for that is simply given because we're told right here that that's true the next thing we're told is that D is the midpoint of AC so first we're going to say that D is the midpoint of a/c and that is also a given so if D is the midpoint of AC which is this segment right here if you remember what it means to be a midpoint that means that D divides AC into two congruent pieces so for our next thing we're going to say that a D is congruent to DC and then our reason is going to be the definition of a midpoint because that's how we know that these two are congruent okay so so far we have one pair of congruent sides two pairs of congruent sides so most likely we're going to be doing a sidesideside proof if you notice they share this side right here B D well we have this little theorem that says BD is congruent to BD because it's the same line so it has to have the same measure as itself and our reason for this is called the reflexive property that's like saying five is equal to five well obviously five has to equal five and the length of BD has to equal the length of BD so now we have three pairs of congruent sides so for our last step we can say therefore triangle a B D is congruent to triangle C B D by sidesideside that's how we always finish our proof is by saying therefore the triangles are congruent or therefore the parallelograms are congruent or something like that so now we're going to do one more practice proof for today so given that QT and is parallel to our s so QT is parallel to our s and QR is paralleled TS prove that triangle our q RT q is congruent to T our s so we're told that these two we have two pairs of parallel lines well if you remember there's a special kind of angle formed when when parallel lines are cut by a transversal so if we look at this these two parallel lines first this one and this one you can see that it's cut by this transversal TR and if you remember if you look these two these two parallel lines right here have this angle and this angle and if you remember these two angles are called alternate interior angles remember when that Z forms there's called alternate interior angles and alternate interior angles are congruent so we can say first we have to write down the given information QT parallel to our s and Q are parallel to tes and that's given okay so for our next thing we're going to say that angle 2 is congruent to angle 4 because of and our reason is that if lines are parallel then they're alternate interior angles are congruent now if you look we have two sets of parallel lines which means we have two sets of alternate interior angles so if we're talking about these two lines that are parallel and it's cut by this transversal you can see that angle 1 and angle 3 are alternate interior angles for those two lines so in the same step we can say that angle 1 is congruent to angle 3 and that has the same reason that if lines are parallel then they're alternate interior angles are congruent and we have one more step so far we have two pairs of congruent angles now if you look these two triangles share this side TR so TR is congruent to itself by the reflexive property and now if you look we have we have one angle congruent to one angle the included sides are congruent and we have another angle congruent to another angle if you remember there's a property called anglesideangle oh I'm writing it on the wrong side so therefore the triangle RT q is congruent to triangle t are s by angle side angle so that's all we're doing with proofs today but make sure you come back and and we're going to be talking about constructing congruent segments in different kinds of segments we can construct
