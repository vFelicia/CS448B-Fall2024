alright guys welcome to your 26th udk tutorial and this is oral it's probably going to be real quick because I only want to go over one very small thing and that's this this little tea with the updown leftright arrow is the texture a line mode so go ahead and click that now click on the texture and let me tell you guys what the textural on mode does the texture a line mode pretty much allows you to mess with all the properties of the texture it allows you to move her around scale it rotate it pretty much anything you can do with a polygon before you can do with the texture now so basically it's an alternative to this surface properties whenever you're working with textures I recommend that you use these surface properties but if you just need to do a real quick fix on a texture like just move it a little bit then the texture mode would be fine so go ahead and you can do things like move them around using the translation mode I'm go ahead and demonstrate moving around the texture and you could also hop over to rotate now rotate only allows you to rotate in one direction and in this case the Z it doesn't allow you to rotate it like in the X in y direction because it shouldn't it should always be aligned right with you know whatever surface you're working on so you can rotate it this way or this way but like I said you can't rotate it in other directions because that just wouldn't make sense this is on flat plane so we should only be able to rotate it like that and the last one is of course scaling and nonuniform scaling which allow you to grow it or shrink it so again like I said this is just a real quick tutorial demonstrating one of these other modes called the texture align mode so I said we're going to be going through these buttons when the time is right and now the time was right to cover that so well that's why I covered it so I don't know where we're going to be talking about in the next tutorial but I promise you guys it's going to be amazing and awesome and you should definitely check it out so thank you guys for watching and I guess I'll see you guys in next video
