what's going on guys welcome to your 44th udk tutorial and in this story one can be doing is I'm going to be covering one of the things that I didn't have time to cover in the last oriole and that's this so let me go ahead and hit play from here and I'll show you guys what I'm talking about but before I do if you guys notice that you can now hear my computer sound check it out hear me shooting around and also my footsteps it's because I got a new screen recording program and that's because in these upcoming tutorials I'm going to be working with sound so I needed my other screen recording program wouldn't record my computer sound so if this video looks a little different that's why so you guys can hopefully hear my sound even though it's incredibly loud I should probably fix that turn it down a bit but hey i'm too lazy to do that so check it out in the last tutorial I taught you guys how to use a light switch aka a trigger and whenever you touch it it turns the light on but now check it out whenever we back away from it the light stays on hmm that's no good let's try bumping into it again mmm no that's not working okay so we definitely need to fix that so that's what I'm going to be teaching guys to do in this tutorial so go ahead and oh I think I got kennel cough go ahead and X out of that an open unreal kismet by of course hitting this little k with the arrow and move this over till it's entered and we actually need to change a couple properties in kismet the very first property is we need to change one of the properties on this touch event so go ahead and select your touch event and whenever you do this properties panel is going to pop open in the bottom left and by the way if you're not seeing the properties you want to see you right here it's because you don't have the right thing selected this window right here changes based on what you have selected so if you have this event selected the properties for this event is going to pop if you have an action selected then you see the properties for the action if you have a variable selected then so on and so forth but anyways we want to change your property of this event so go ahead and select the event and actually the property move on change is in this sequence event now what we're looking for is this right here max trigger count now I know I call that thing a light switch a lot but it's actually called a trigger and one of the properties it has is how many times can you use it now by default this is pretty dumb but by default it's set at one right in it right here and you see if you hover over it a little box pops up that says oh it went away how many times can this event be activated 0 for infinite so by default we can only use it one time basically whenever we hit our trigger one time the light switch is on and then that trigger breaks we can't use it ever again so we have no way of turning those lights on or off ever again so for infinite it said hit zero so now that we hit zero we can now turn on an infinite number of times you can turn on off on off on off until our fingers bleed so go ahead and change max trigger count 20 and now that trigger can be used an unlimited number of times but let's go ahead and examine this a little bit closer so if we've read our program it says alright whenever we touch our trigger which basically means whenever we bump into our trigger the lights are going to turn on but what is telling our lights that whenever we walk away we want them to turn off well here's the thing that says turn off and nothing's happening so basically our own our lights which basically only works one way it only turns our lights on so in order for our lights to turn off we need to say all right whenever you untouch that trigger turn your lights off and i know this language is a little bit weird because in real life you never tell anyone to untouch something you're either like all right turn my lights on or off you're never like hey Tony untouch my face you know you don't say that you said get your hands off my face by anyways in the UDK they use this language touched in untouched and it pretty much means are you touching the trigger or are you not touching the trigger so that may help help clear things up a little bit so it is in this is hora what we did is we change that max trigger count 20 this means our lights which were work until the end of time we can turn on and off a million times if we want to when we also told our udk or kismet or whatever whenever we aren't touching that light switch to turn the lights off so now when every bump into the trigger is going to turn on whenever we'll be back away it's going to turn off oh you don't believe me do you well let me just go ahead and play from here now freak with you guys so go ahead and touch this light switch and keep your eye on that stack mesh right there our lights pop on now back up they turn off do it again on off on and off run it through on off on off I can do this all day guys you think I want i'm gonna i'm about to record a threehour video of me doing this now i'm just kidding so anyways i just want to tell you guys that we now can use our trigger an unlimited number of times and also unlike before when we could only turn our lights on we can now turn them off by untouched the trigger so for now that's all you guys get in the next tutorial what i'm going to be teaching you guys how to do is use the sound in conjunction with kismet and it's probably the coolest tutorial yet because we are finally incorporating sound into kismet it's awesome so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I guess I'll see you next time
