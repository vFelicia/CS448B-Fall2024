so now obviously this image is useless without our user input so what we want to do is we want to we've already broken down a line we want to create a form and this form is going to submit to this index.php page and it's going to check that the GD value in fact no we're going to submit to another page I think that's probably a bit better and the reason we're submitting to another page is is what we're doing is we are refreshing when we come back on ourselves so we've got form action equals check PHP that's absolutely fine and now in fact we will go back to the index page right okay so now we need to say type the value equal value you see okay and then we can create an input type of text and we'll give this the size of six just to keep things quite neat and then I'm going to say a name is secure and then obviously we need a submit button so we'll preview this in a moment to make sure we like the look of it so submit for the value okay so let's start preview this and see what we think okay so type the value you see we're going to type the value in here and then we're going to click Submit okay so at the moment nothing's happening cuz we haven't created a process for this but up here what we want to do now is we want to say if the form has been submitted so if the user has submitted the form we don't want to generate a random number just yet so if is set and the variable that we're taking into account is this post variable secured down here so dollar underscore post and that is secure so if is set or if not set we can generate a number otherwise we can do some some validation of this so what we can say is we can say else and we can say if dollar underscore session secured is equal to dollar underscore post secured so essentially what we're saying is if the session that's been set so the random number that's been set and displayed in our image is equal to the post that the user has made so the images that the letter or the numbers so that they've seen then we can do something so we can say echo success or or a match for example otherwise we can say echo incorrect try again and then this is important what we need to do is we need to generate another one of these because they've got it incorrect therefore we want to change the value so they have to look at another another value without this what we're going to just be doing is displaying the same value to them now for this example where we're echoing out a match but this could be part of your form validation so if you're validating say I user name password a first name and a surname you'd want to include the relevant checks in there then register your user then forward them into another page you wouldn't be forwarding back to the same page and if I was to say yet successful we wouldn't be showing the registration form so hopefully that makes sense to you let's refresh the page so let's try and have a look at this image according to everything I've written hopefully this works now the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to type in the correct image to see where the corrector numbers to see what we get up so three to eight four let's click Submit okay so it's as a match let's just create a break before this image to make everything look a bit neater to refresh that so we've got a match so we've got three to eight four we typed in three to wait for that's fine now let's type in well presumably this now would have registered the user and gone to another page so let's go back onto your next up PHP and generate another number so you've got 4 9 6 8 here let's type in 1 2 3 4 we click Submit now what it says is incorrect try again it's generated a new number so now I can't make this out I think it's 7 4 7 7 let's try 7 4 7 7 click Submit incorrect try again 4 5 9 3 submit and it says a match say 4 5 9 3 it successful we've successfully you know typed in the number so we're saying a match and we've still kept this number here but obviously would be something forwarding the user elsewhere at this point but you can see that the most important part about this is if the user gets it wrong that generated a new number to try so every time they get it wrong generating a new number to try so this is basically capture in PHP with the GD library and how we generate a random number you can use letters as well that's perfectly acceptable we're generating a random number displaying it as an image with these lines to ensure that it can't well it might be able to be read by some sort of robots I mean things again clever but at this point it's hard to be read and by a robot on a basic level but our user can still see it and we've processed it this through form validation so not only if we generated this image we've tried it out in our own little form
