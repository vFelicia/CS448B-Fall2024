So today we're talking about right triangles um we're going to learn What's called the Pythagorean theorem and this is where your knowledge of squares and square roots will really help you out because we have this equation a 2 + B2 = c^2 so for any right triangle this long side right here which is called the hypotenuse of the right triangle is equal to this side squared plus this side squared so now that we know that we're going to do an example so this is the hypotenuse this is our hypotenuse and this is what we're trying to find out so a 2 which is 8 2ar plus 6^ 2ar is equal to X2 or c^ 2 it's the same thing because they're just variables so 8 SAR is 64 + 6 2ar is 36 is equal to X2 so 100 is equal to X2 but we want to know what x is equal to 2 so we're going to take the square root of both sides and we get X is = to 10 now we're going to do another example so notice that we know we know what our hypotenuse is equal but we want to know what this is equal to so we're going to like we would normally we're going to take a 2 + b^ 2 and set it equal to the hypotenuse squared so 49 + X2 is is equal to 625 so X2 is equal to is equal to 576 and if we take the square roots of both sides we get X = to 24 and for one last example we have so this is our hypotenuse and we're trying to find out out what x equals so we're going to take each one of the parts square and square them and set it equal to 5 squar so if you take the square root of seven and you square it you're undoing this square root so this just becomes s + X2 = 25 X squar is equal to 18 you take the square root of that you get X is equal to the square < TK of 18 18 is not a perfect square so we're just going to leave it written like that because there's no way because this isn't a whole number X is not a whole number so now that we've learned the Pythagorean theorem we're going to learn some rules for special right triangles in our next video
