hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the New Boston in this tutorial we're gonna be looking more at the car program now if you remember from the last tutorial we looked at inheritance and we're gonna be focusing mostly on inheritance in this tutorial and if none of this makes any sense to you and you don't know what code is on my screen right now then you might want to go back and start from the beginning of the car series so if you remember we created this sports car that inherits from car and we added weight and get sports info so everything that we can use in car we can use in our sports car so let's come over here to form on BB and you can see here we've got show car info now we can show the sports info or we can also just do two string and now let's go ahead and run this and see what kind of output we get so we get show info info info we get the car name which is nothing the color red the number of doors is five and the speed is zero now this is exactly the same as it is in the car class you can see that we have overridden the two string function and how did have we have it output the name the color and the number of doors and it will work with any other class that inherits from car now we can also access any of these other methods and functions so let's go ahead and do that we'll go ahead and change this back to dot show let's do what was it called the get sports car info or get sports info okay so now will we have them set the name of the car let's just go ahead and use default sports car now we could change this I mean not change this we could put these into other methods so that we don't have to continues to change the code we can just change the arguments send something else to the arguments and we'll do that later on but for now we're gonna be focusing on inheritance so the evil sports car car name and it's going to enter the name of the car and that is a public variable the car name so that we can access it directly and we don't have to make a property for it we could set the color too so let's do default sports car dot color and it will store the color and that in color is a public variable I'll skip the show info and we'll do default sports car dot number of doors and the number of doors is a property I think yeah right here we've got the number of doors property and just sends back the end number of doors which is a private variable so go ahead and collapse that and we've got default sports car dot number of doors and then we get whatever they type in and convert it to an integer so we'll go ahead and minimize that and we've got accelerate so we'll just change that to be false sports car dot accelerate and I don't know why we have that right there but let's go ahead and minimize that so now let's go ahead and run this and see what we get if it compiles successfully we've got our normal form we can set the name of it so for our sports car let's do a Camaro SS go ahead and click OK we'll set the color to let's say orange it okay their doors obviously and let's accelerate it by let's do a 140 miles per hour and then we will show the info so we've got our Camaro SS our color orange we've got two doors the speed is 140 miles per hour we got 500 horsepower and the weight is 1,000 pounds and now we didn't even have to write any code for our sports car class because it's all inherited from car now let's go ahead and show car info we'll just do two string here and see what kind of output we get from doing the same thing so go ahead and run this so the name Camaro SS click OK set the color to orange set the doors to two will accelerate it to a hundred and fifty miles per hour and then we'll show the info we get the Camaro SS orange color two doors and the speed of the car and two string is pretty much the showing the default stuff of the car that every car would have so the speed the doors and the color and the name and every car has a horsepower and a weight but for sports cars that is particularly important it wouldn't be important for say a minivan so we'll just go ahead and click OK so if you haven't typed in this code already go ahead and do that and then once you understand this and you're starting to understand inheritance go ahead and move on for the next tutorial and we're gonna be working more on the car program
