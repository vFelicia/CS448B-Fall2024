so we've got name size type and temporary name not all of these are required to actually upload the file and the ones that are not required to upload the file are this this an in fact named but what we want to do is we want to keep the same name as the file and as we've uploaded here so we need in this case temporary name and the name of the file so underneath here what I'm going to do the first thing I need to do is check whether we've actually chosen a file and we've submitted the form so we can do this we're with the is set function so I can say if is set name and in fact you can incorporate others in there but I'm just going to be assuming that the the file has a name which it would do in most cases so if is set name what we then do in hid inside here is we can echo out something just to test so okay for example so if we come back to our form as it is and we don't select a file and I click Submit oh okay oh yeah sorry it is set so if it's set name then we need to do another check saying if not empty name do something otherwise do something else so here we can just say please choose a file otherwise we can say everything's ok because this will presume that we've selected a file from our computer we've clicked the submit button the two if statements have validated to true if the file is first of all if the form has been submitted and second of all if the file has a name which you presume it will do if that user select a file so let's just go on we won't choose a file for now but back to the page that is click Submit and it's telling me please choose a file now what I'm going to do is actually choose a file click Submit and it's telling us it's ok so this is the some basic form or validation to make sure the file is here now what do we do with the file once we know it's there and we've performed these couple of checks well what we need to do is we need to move the file from its temporary location to a specified location and this specified location is in the uploads folder okay so I'm just going to put uploads and then a foot and then a trailing forward slash now what we need to do is we need to use a function called move uploaded file and we need to give it two parameters the first one is the temporary location which is temporary name in fact before we do all this let's just kill the page there and echo out the temporary name so you can get a general idea of where it's being stored so let's just pick that file there and click Submit you can see that this is being stored in C colon backslash xampp' temp and it's and the file name is PHP C to 790 MP this is the file that we've just uploaded however it's in an unusable format and it's not in the location we want it in so let's get rid of that and we won't kill our page anymore so move uploaded file you need the temporary name as the first argument to this function and the second is the location so I'm going to say location now we do need to add something else on to this we need to give it a name so fair enough we're uploading to the uploads folder but now what we need to do is append on the end of it a file name here now obviously we already have the file name so we don't need to specify that ourselves it's just simply name because we're taking the file name of the file we've uploaded so to make this to make sure this works a bit better I'm going to enclose this function in an if statement and then if the file is successfully uploaded I'm just going to echo upload it okay so now let's test this out let's go back to our plot PHP I'm going to click Submit and it's telling me to please choose a file so that's just testing our validation I'm going to choose this image called words Lee underscore Nicollet one jpg and if we go back to our that will just quickly go back to our folder and make sure there's nothing in history so let's choose that file and click Submit and it says uploaded so we've Pro says to everything that we've written already with no error now for the interesting part let's go back and have a look this uploads folder and see if it's uploaded and in actual fact it has so we've clicked you can click on this and preview in our browser but we've successfully uploaded a file now let me just take you through the stages again we grab the name of the file itself which is here here and we have the temporary name or this is the temporary location rather then what we do is we're checking if the form has been submitted then we check if then we check if the file exists so have they selected a file we specify a location in a variable which is the uploads folder so this corresponds to the folder here and then what we do is we say if this is successful if this function is successful and while we're performing this if statement where we're calling it as well so we're uploading from the temporary name and we're renaming it into this location with this file name here so obviously I could say I could specify here let's put it in uploads forward slash image dot jpg ok so now what I could do is click on upload dot PHP select a different file click Submit and you'll see that it will have put it into the exact location I've specified there however what we want to do is we want to do it based on the file that the user is uploading and obviously I've just stored this in in a different variable then we echo uploaded if that's ok and we could obviously add something here to say and there was an error now so this is how to basically upload a file as you can see there's sort of a lot involved with it but it once you get the hang of it it's easy to do however what we haven't done is we haven't performed any validation on the file itself so as it stands I could upload a PHP file I could upload any XE file I could upload anything I basically want so in the next video we're going to be looking at how to secure the form and only allow a JPEG file
