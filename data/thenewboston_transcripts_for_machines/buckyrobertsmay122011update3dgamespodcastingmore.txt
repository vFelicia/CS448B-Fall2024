what's going on guys welcome to another update video as you can see or maybe you can't tell but I'm on my brand new webcam right now I bought a brand new webcam and I'll tell you why a little bit later on I'll save that for a little surprise but uh if the audio or video is a little weird this is the first time I use my webcam and I'm also have to use my microphone that I use to make tutorials so yes this is actually what I look like when I'm making tutorials so in case you guys you know we're wondering here it is but anyways sorry I haven't made an update video in a while but I've been super busy um I know I haven't actually made any videos in a while and that's because last weekend I flew up for mother's day uh I had to fly up to New York and then when I got back I had to order a bunch of audio and video gear for I'll tell you why later on but anyways I have been super busy so uh that's why I haven't been uploading or making any videos but anyways speaking of of videos I'll give you guys a quick update about what's going on for the biology videos we just uploaded four new biology videos I put those on right before uh you're watching this video so if you can see this video uh right about like 30 minutes ago I uploaded four new biology videos we're also in the process of making a new algebra math series but I decided instead of just uploading those videos as they're made I'm going to wait until the entire series series is created that way I'm not spamming your guys' inbox and also as soon as you see an algebra video you can watch a whole series if you want to I just think it's better that way and it helps me organize my videos a lot better so that takes care of uh their videos that they're making and now for the videos that I'm making as a lot of you guys know I'm making a C++ Series right now and I think I'm like 60 videos in and I actually hope to finish this series this weekend so I have to work tomorrow and when I come back I got to take a nap and as soon as I wake up I'm working straight through the weekend Friday night Saturday and Sunday I'm going to try to pump out as many C++ videos as I can actually you guys are in lick because we covered all the really confusing stuff like inheritance and polymorphism and templates all the stuffs that's going to stress your stress your brain so from now on it's not the easy stuff I don't want to say it's easy but from now on I just have to teach some Concepts that are Core Concepts that you need to know and uh like I said they're not easy but they're a lot easier to grasp so you definitely don't want to miss those so I'm going to try to get into you guys this weekend but it might take a couple more days I have a few more subjects to cover probably 40 more videos so aside from that you guys are probably wondering all right so after C++ everyone wants to know what am I going to do next what subject am I going to teach next and drum roll please you guys ready for this I'm gonna be teaching something called blender 3D now a lot of you guys are probably cheering right now and a lot of you guys probably have no idea what blender 3D is blender is a program that allows you to make 3D models and like if you want to make a cool 3D logo or if you want to make awesome movies in 3D like animations or if you want to do some like character modeling for games um you can do all of this in blender and the coolest thing is everyone can do it it's a free program um a lot of really good 3D programs cost like hundreds and hundreds of dollars but this is one of the best programs and it's absolutely free so anyone can follow along with these tutorials um I know there is a huge request so I'm doing this and the reason that I'm teaching blender 3D is because after blender 3D and this that series is probably going to take like 50 videos to complete I'm guessing uh could be way off but after blender 3D and after we learn how to create awesome 3D animations and models I'm going to be teaching something called ogre 3D now ogre 3D for those of you guys who don't know ogre 3D is a graphics engine for 3D um objects and what this means is blender allows you to make the models and the graphics engine allows your computer to work with the 3D models basically basically what I'm saying is once you learn C++ and blender and ogre 3D you're going to be able to make fullfledged 3D games and if you guys are like yeah right what kind of cool games can I make with C++ and blender in this ogre that you're going to be teaching probably some crappy you know Nintendo looking game well I'm going to post in the description box below a game that that was made using I don't know uh how they modeled the characters but you can model characters it really doesn't matter what program you use but it was made using C++ and also ogre 3D so this is an idea of what type and um you know not just crappy games we're going to be making we're going to be making high quality awesome amazing 3D games I'm talking like Black Ops and World of Warcraft of course we probably can't make a game that advanced because because I mean they take millions of dollars in uh thousands of people in you know 3 years or 5 years to complete uh I'm only going to be making teaching you the concepts but definitely you're going to have the skills to create games like that so that's what I'm going to be doing don't forget to click the link below and you can see an ogre 3D and a C++ game so basically you're going to be using C++ to do all the programming blender to make the character modeling and all the you know cool textures pretty much everything you see in ogre 3D to handle all the 3D graphics and piece everything together so I'm super excited about that and uh I cannot wait so aside from that I told you guys earlier that I bought a bunch of audio gear and new video gear and that's because of this beginning next month I'm going to be beginning to podcast on a website called Ustream now if you never heard of Ustream before it's called ustream.com with you and this is a website that allows you to broadcast live streaming video for example uh sometimes they have sporting events on there sometimes they have live concerts sometimes if like anyone wants to make their own web show like I Carly I know I watched I Carly before on Nickelodeon um that's kind of what I'm going to be doing so that's what Ustream is and I got a little cheat sheet about things I'm supposed to talk about here but also so I'm going to be recording these videos in HD and posting them on YouTube and whatever website I make um I don't even have a name for the show yet but I'm going to have a name in the website soon and in case you miss an episode or you know you don't have time to watch it each week we're going to be uh posting them live on this channel and also on the website whatever it is so I am super excited about it I ordered a bunch of audio G I order a mixer board HD webcams HD camcorders a bunch of awesome mic phones I actually have to go get a new office tomorrow I think I'm going to get one upstairs and I also have to hire two new people I think I'm going to hire a dude and a chick or a male and a female so that's what I'm going to be doing I am super excited I'm super excited for a lot of stuff coming up so uh that's what it's going to be so basically um it's going to be a radio Style Show it's going to look a lot like the Howard Stern Show when it's everything's produced and pieced together but we can't can't talk about you know some of the things they talk about actually we're basically going to talk about whatever is on our minds the show is really about nothing specific basically whatever I'm feeling whatever is on my mind whatever I want to talk about it's going to be fun and entertaining and like I said nothing really specific but it's going to be super awesome so lastly with that in mind I need something from you guys this radio show doesn't have a name yet so I need a good name for you know whatever this thing is a webcast a podcast the radio show an online Extravaganza I don't know but I need a good name from you guys to call the show and also remember it's going to be a website too so you know you can't have something like The Daily Show because that's taken already so anyways from you guys I need a really good name for my uh podcast and webcasting show whatever you want to call it and uh I'm going to look through the comments and pick whatever one I think is you know the coolest sound of name so with that being said I hope you guys are excited for at least one of the things I talked to you guys about um I know I am I'm super excited I'm about to be my pants so uh thank you guys for watching thank you guys so much for subscribing to my channel and supporting and thank you guys especially whoever donated to my channel you cannot believe the donations I've been receiving lately and all of this is possible thanks to you guys so I'm going to try to pump out as many highquality tutorials as I can this weekend looking forward to blender and ogre and uh with that being said thank all of you guys for watching subscribing and um I'll see you guys later
