what is going on guys welcome to your 16th you decayed soil and in this story I'm gonna be going over something called the content browser so what we need to do next with our level is we need to add some materials to this house because unless you're a huge fan of chess or checkers you probably don't want these purple and gray boxes covering your house you probably want to apply it with some nice looking pretty material spice things up a bit make it a little more interesting looking so in order to do that we need to apply materials to this house and in order to access our library of materials we need to go up here and open something called the content browser so go ahead and hit this low black button and now your content browser is gonna pop up now I'm gonna take the rest of this tutorial just to go over the basics of this content browser I'm not going to be going over every little radio button in checkbox in all these different packages but what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be giving you the $2 tour of the content browser so basically what the content browser is is it's basically a big search engine for example whenever we start making advanced games we're gonna have a bunch of different textures and a bunch of different models for example we're gonna have models of trees and guns and cars and we're gonna have a bunch of sound effects like gunshots and you know car engines and people screaming and this is where everything gets organized any asset that we make in an external program such as like Photoshop and 3d max or maybe some sound program we can search for that in this right here so basically let's start with the left hand side on the left hand side is where we can basically tell our content browser where to look for the stuff we're looking for for example everything in the UDK gets stored in packages so we can either look for those specific packages right here or and by the way a package is just like a folder basically so as you expand these you can see that everything is just stored in folders and subfolders and yada yada yada so basically if we want to look in a specific package or folder we can expand it or what we can do is this is what we're gonna be doing generally just go ahead and hit all assets and that's gonna allow us to look through all of the folders or packages now these different collections is your shared collections is pretty much if you're working on a project as a team you can share your favorite collections pretty much this is pretty much my favorites so this is your shared favorites and if you want to have your personal favorites you can make your very own collection right here I'm not going to be going over that because we got other more important stuff to cover so in order to minimize this if you don't want look at that anymore you can also hit this arrow and that'll hide it from the view but for now I'll just keep it open for you know the tutorials sake now let's hop over to the righthand side and this is your tags section now you can create new tags and straw tags but basically a tag is just a keyword so if you want to apply tags to some of these materials like you want to apply the building tag to any materials that you can use on a building that's what you would do so again just like this packages section you can minimize this if you don't want it or maximize it now the top here actually I'll get to the top later because that's the part we use most often but the bottom here is if I just go ahead and minimize this this is how you can set up your content browser in different views by default it's in the thumbnail thumbnail view excuse me but you can also switch it to list view and to split views horizontal or vertical I like the thumbnail view the most that's what I recommend using now right here is your zoom if you want to zoom in for example if you really want to scroll when you're looking at textures or something here's how you can do that but by default again I like to reset that leave it at a hundred percent now right here is your default thumbnail size so say you're saying alright my thumbnails are way too big when they're 128 so I'm gonna go ahead and change it down to 64 it may make searching for your thumbnails a little bit easier but by the way I basically like to leave everything in default because they set it up default is a reason they thought it was the easiest and I think it's the easiest so that's basically the basics of how you can set up your view if you really don't like anything how they have a setup by default so now let's go ahead and hop to this top section this top section is pretty much your browser or search engine it allows you to search for any materials any textures model sounds it basically is a really advanced search engine and it's awesome so what we could do is search for you know specific things like door and then whenever we do that we got all the door aspects look how many there are pretty cool huh all the different doors door sounds door static meshes so that's how we can search for specific assets we can also not search that and hop over to here and this allows us to search for specific types of asset searches what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be searching for material so later on in the next tutorial I'm gonna go ahead and click materials and then I'm gonna be scrolling through here and we're gonna be finding the material that we want to apply to our house but it's basically an advanced search engine and you have a bunch of different options here and whenever we need to I'm gonna be going over these but for now I don't want to throw everything at you once don't want to overwhelm you guys so I'm just gonna leave you at that for now basically just remember this your content browser is where you go is basically a search engine for all your content that you can add into your level such as sounds in 3d models like cars and guns and also textures and materials like cloth and maybe wood or something like that but in the next tutorial I'm actually going to be putting this to use so you might get a better understanding of how this works a little bit better so for now that's all you guys get so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
