hello youtube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna continue working on the paint program which can be found in beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by Theron Willis and Brian Newsom now what what we've been currently working on is something that I created myself the options form because in the book we have to do a whole bunch of extra coding to do exactly what they did so I decided to just make a new options for him and allow you to change the brush size and the color so let's go ahead and create a set color method so public sub set color and then was to bivalve color as color so now what we want to do is when I access paint canvas one so paint canvas one dot graphics color it's going to be equal to color so if you don't know what paint canvas one is well on for Mondavi B we added a paint canvas right here you can see that the name is paint canvas one so we'll go back into for Mondavi beam and now I need to do is go into our option form and we need to add the set color method or we need to call it so we'll come back into the designer for option 4 so option 4 BB design and let's just double click on change color so when they click button color what do we want to do well we want to set the color so we'll call my paint dot set color and then we'll just do color dialog or let's see what was the name of that color dialog brush color dialogue brush dot color but first we need to get a color from that so we'll do color dialogue brush dot show dialogue so by using show dialogue they will only be able to interact with color dialogue brush and not anything else until they close out of this so click OK and now if they click cancel then it's not going to give us a color back so what we need to do is let's just go ahead and chose tros close this in a trycatch statement so we'll say message box not show the X dot message so if something happens then we'll just show that now I haven't worked a lot with color dialogues so there may not be an era zone if they click cancel because it might have a default color set but for now we're just going to close this in a trycatch statement so they click cancel and it sets a color to something that is null it'll catch that and show the message so let's go ahead and run this you can see here we got paint V beef and our option point so I'll just go ahead and set the brush size to let's do large and now let's change the color so we'll make it let's say red and we'll click OK and you've seen when we start drawing it gives us a red line none of you changed to color again let's say lime green and we could draw with that one too so let's go ahead and close out of these and let's add some stuff to our program and that will make it a little bit more user friendly so let's go ahead and come into option for me 1 dot V be the designer and let's go ahead and add a label so we'll say we'll have our label and whenever the forum unloads and then whenever option form loads we want to set the label that label to a the color so let's first go back and change the name of it so we'll say label one and we'll set the name to label color so whatever option form loads we want to say label color dot text is going to be equal to equal to my paint dot paint canvas one dot graphics color dot two straight so there's a lot going on here we're accessing our my paint form and inside of our my paper form we have paint canvas one which is the paint canvas that we're drawing from drawing on and paint canvas one create contains a variable called graphics color so you can see here under paint canvas VB we have graphics color and you can see that it's black and then what we did is we just went ahead and converted that color to a string so it can be shown on the label so now we need to do is let's just copy this and whenever they changed the color we want to update the color now we could create a sub called update color but this I believe this is all we're gonna be using to update what the color is so let's go ahead and run this and you can see here that we've got color black now we can change the color to blue and click OK you've got colored blue now we can set the brush size to medium and we'll change the color oh never mind we don't want to change the color and we can start drawing with blue to change the color again to orange and start drawing with orange and now you can see here that whenever we get a color that isn't that doesn't have a name I'm just gonna give us the art a RGB values for that so this one has a name which is olive but you can see here that this orange right here doesn't have a name so it gives us the values for that now this can be useful if you're using Photoshop along with this and you want to know what the a RGB value is so we'll go ahead and close out of that and make one more change before we're done with this tutorial we'll come over here to option form BB then let's add let's make this set to something at the beginning so what I mean by this is let's find the selected index or let's just go ahead instead of doing that in the properties let's do it whenever the form loads so form unload we will set combo box size dot selected index is going to be equal to zero so now it won't be blank when we run this and it will always start off at brush size small and we can color with black when you change the color to green and then the size to large and then we can draw with that too so go ahead put this code in if you haven't already and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
