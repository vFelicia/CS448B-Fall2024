what is going on guys my name is Bucky Robertson welcome to your very first tutorial and learning the UDK the Unreal development kit now before I even get started telling you guys what the UDK is why it's useful what you can do with it I want to tell you guys this in order to watch these upcoming tutorials you need to change your resolution to 1080 and you also need to watch in full screen that's how I'm going to be recording I'm going to be recording my entire computer screen and 1080 resolution so instead of trying to watch these videos on your small little YouTube player watch on full screen 1080 you're going to be able to see every single detail of what I'm doing on every single menu button and dropdown box and it's a lot better way so that's how I'm going to be recording my videos that's how I recommend that you watch my videos so now that I got that out of the way let's talk a little bit about the UDK the UDK is basically a program that's going to allow us to make awesome amazing 3d games so let me show before I even get in you know talking about a little more let me show you guys a couple games that were created using this unreal technology Gears of War infinity blade army of 2 Bioshock 2 Mass Effect oh let's see what else we got down here Batman Borderlands one of my favorite games so as you can see these are some of the newest most visually stunning awesome games that were ever created not any you know crappy 1980 computer games these are some of the most amazing games and this is what we're going to be learning so these are the magnitude and caliber of games that we're going to be learning how to make so that's what we had to look forward to I am super excited for this so with that being said let me talk to you guys a little bit more about the UDK I told you guys that it's a program used to make 3d games but it's a lot more than that the UDK is responsible for organizing all of our assets for example it organizes our 3d models our 3d characters our sound effects it takes all these pieces and brings them together in order to allow us to put together an awesome game it also takes care of how our computer handles the memory the graphics that appear on the screen it also takes care of the game physics so whenever you're playing a game you take a lot of things for granted such as the sound and physics and the game engine also known as the Unreal Engine is responsible for this so like I said it takes care of a lot of behind the scenes stuff that we take for granted so with that being said the UDK basically has all the tools that we need in order to create epic amazing games and by the way it's entirely free how awesome is that so let me go ahead and show you guys where to download this UDK go ahead and go to google and type in u DK and go ahead and press Enter now go ahead and go to the UDK website UDK comm I guess you could just like that in your browser but I like Google so might as well use that now this website may look a little different depending on when you're watching this video but you're going to want to look for a button that says download UDK and click that now you're going to see a bunch of different versions of the UDK they basically come out with a new version each month just go ahead and download the most recent version now at the time of this recording the most recent version is the May 2011 UDK but if it's a different version then don't fret it's basically the same program no matter what version you download just a few little features maybe they have them you know a couple more options included or something but go ahead and download the latest version I'm not going to go ahead and download it because I already have it downloaded and downloading to you DK's would be stupid so I'm going to assume that you guys know how to download and install things because you guys probably have a lot of experience from downloading illegal music and stuff so I'm not going to hold your hand and teach you guys how to download and install because I'm going to guess that you guys know how to do that already but once it's downloaded and once it's installed go ahead and under your all programs I'm assuming you guys are using windows go ahead and click Unreal development kit and I want to create a shortcut to the desktop so go ahead and right click UDK editor and click sent to desktop this is going to give you a nice little shortcut on your desktop right here and it's a lot easier whenever you're you know you want to use the UDK to click on this icon right here rather than going through your Start menu every time so that's why I want to add an icon to the desktop and basically if your program opens successfully it means you downloaded it and installed it correctly if something goes wrong it means maybe you downloaded a corrupt file just go ahead and download it and install it again but once you have this open it means that you downloaded it and installed it correctly now that is all I wanted to cover in this tutorial but I want to tell you guys about one more thing at the end of these tutorials once I'm done teaching guys how to create 3d models and use the UDK to create everything you know game development related I want to get a huge project together and I want to create a huge game I think for the community for the new boss then it would be super fun it would give us all a bunch of experience and also we'd have an awesome game to add to any of our resumes if we wanted to apply you know as a job as a game developer or anything like that so that's the goal of these tutorials to teach you guys how to create amazing games and at the end of these stories if you want to sign up to be part of this project you can but for now that's all I wanted to cover in this tutorial so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video
