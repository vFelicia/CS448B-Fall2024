it's Friday Friday GNA get down on Friday everybody's looking to oh crap is this thing recording oh man that's embarrassing well anyways guys welcome to your 16 JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial well you know what before I even get started first of all I apologize for my voice it's a little raspy but anyways I I'm not sick but I got like a bunch of FL in my throat won't go into detail but I'm taking MN DM so anyways if I cop up huge lugie during the tutorial then you know don't be mad at me it's Destiny it's bound to happen so just deal with it so anyways let's go ahead and talk about nesting what it is and why it's useful you know before when we had an if statement it's basically said this I'm going to give you a condition and if it's true run a bit of code well now what we can do is nesting is the idea that you can have a if statement and you can stick another if statement inside it and then it's going to say basically I'm going to give you a condition and then I'm going to give you another condition and if they're both true then run a bit of code so it's just saying instead of meeting one instead of passing one test you have to pass two tests instead so let's go ahead and give you guys example before you get extremely confused so I'm going to go ahead and set my first name equal to Bucky because that's my dang name and then go ahead and set my last name equal to Roberts because that's my dang name and now let's go ahead and build a basic if statement what we learned before if um first name equals two equal signs Bucky then go ahead and run this bit of code and we already know that whatever we write in here is our statement then it's going to run because we gave it a test and it passed it so now it runs the bit of code but what next thing is is the idea that instead of just a regular statement like print out hello Bucky or alert box pops up we can actually go ahead and put another if statement in here with another condition so let's go ahead and put if last name equals Roberts and make sure I spelled everything right you see when whenever you uh like have a variable or something and you want to make sure it matches just go ahead and double click it and then you don't have to be like f IRS t f r s t n m n just double click it and it's going to highlight all the other ones that are spelled the same but anyways back to the tutorial so now let's go ahead and add a body to this and now let's go ahead and write something like document. right welcome Bucky Roberts explanation explanation and I accidentally hit notepad so there we go just like that so now let's go ahead and save it and run this baby and see what we get whoa probably should have minimized that a little bit okay uh yeah about this um I don't want to talk about that so I actually forgot I forgot that that was up there so yeah pretty embarrassing but anyways as you can see it says welcome Bucky Roberta meant to say Roberts but who cares so now you can see the basics of nesting instead of having one test the pass you now have to pass another test before you can get to your code and this isn't only basic if you can also nest if else and now check it out say you're making a script here and you want to make sure the bies or excuse me the user's first name was Bucky and then you want to make sure their last name was Roberts so if their first name is Bucky and their last name is Roberts it's going to say hello Bucky Roberts I'll just go ahead and change it but if their first name is Bucky in their last name is not Roberts let's go ahead and write something else copy paste hello Bucky someone or something like that so now if your variable was Bucky Covington or something like that you go ahead and it says welcome Bucky someone because it passed this first test right here so it got in his first name was Bucky but then it says is your last name Roberts well no so it's so I'm going to go to else and that says welcome bu someone so again I just want to give you guys the idea that instead of just writing a statement in here you can actually Nest an entire if statement in here and then it's just going to give it more test to pass and actually I don't want to confuse you guys too much but you can actually put another if statement in here and you can Nest it like a thousand times if you want so you're saying all right make sure your name is Bucky make sure your last name is Roberts make sure your favorite color is blue make sure you're 24 and you can give it a bunch of different IFS but actually if you guys are thinking about doing that there is a lot easier way so mostly people Nest you can probably Nest three ifs instead of inside each other and that is you know most the deepest that people go if you want to get deeper than that then there are better techniques and I'm going to show you guys those techniques in the upcoming tutorials but I guess now that the cat's out of the bag then I'm going to go back to watching my favorite music video and I guess I'll see you guys in the next tutoral
