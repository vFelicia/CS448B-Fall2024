alright guys welcome back and in this video I am going to teach you about arrow functions now before we do that I want to talk to you guys about a little story so a few months ago I was actually working on this awesome program and what this program did is it calculated the area of a circle now of course you know that the area of a circle is PI R squared so anytime you need to calculate it you just throw in the radius and then what you can do is you can multiply your radius squared by pi so I'm like ra bar PI on this is you put the 3.14 you know I don't want to add too many decimal places I want this thing is in accurate as possible and then any time you want to calculate it you just return PI x our R squared is just R times R so there you go boom roasted and let me test this baby by console.log and we'll just say seven for the radius and check it out so I did verify that whenever I wanted to calculate the area of a circle with radius seven that it was indeed 153 point eight six now that was fantastic my program was working beautifully but then the new season of orange is the new black came out and I'm like ah right I got to make a couple more functions and I ain't got time to keep typing this keyword function because I gotta get to my Netflix you know so I wish that there was a easier way a quicker way to write these functions so I called up the CEO JavaScript and I'm like dude you got to make these functions faster too right he's like all right Bucky we'll get on it so what he did is he made a new kind of syntax and this is what the arrow function is it's basically a way that you could leave out the keyword function so instead what we can do is this so I'm going to keep this function just so you guys can see the difference but I'm going to name this one um let's call it let's call this one circle area one and we'll call this new one circle area two so of course your function needs a name so I'm going to set this equal to a variable called circle area which is essentially the functions name and instead of writing the keyword function write equals and then throw your parameter right there never sin alright so where the heck is the function body this part well this comes after the arrow operator so this is actually pretty much the same syntax is this but instead of using the function keyword your parameters go right after the equal sign and then use a fat arrow and then you have your function body right here so you can actually do something like that pretty awesome a so just to show you guys that this is indeed the same let me go ahead and print out so quick area to and run this bad boy pretty awesome at so again all that arrow function is is essentially a way that you can write functions without using the keyword function it's just a little bit cleaner syntax now another thing that I want to point out is this with es6 you really should avoid using the keyword var whenever possible now we sum less tutorial that we have the keyword lip but PI it isn't a variable in the sense that we can change its value that we can manipulate it it's actually a constant now before we didn't have any way of making constants in JavaScript but now we do using the keyword Const in all this keyword does is whenever you're making a constant then you should do this because then it ensures that you can't accidentally assign another value so pi always equals 3.14 right it never changes so then later on if one of my programmers or one of my developers try to change this value you see that we would have error right here and the error would say attempt to assign to a constant variable so again anytime you want to have a variable that's value never changes go ahead and assign it using the Const keyword instead of let and this is just better syntax and actually boost performance a little bit too so there you go so this is the new fat arrow syntax and the recently call it fat arrow is because whenever I'm teaching tutorials you sometimes have this arrow operator which is minus greater than and a fat arrow is just what I call equals greater than and this is just me not even sure if that's the proper terminology but fat arrow there you go but now I'm looking at this and I'm like re so this is a little bit cleaner syntax definitely useful but what if there was an even easier way what if you could condense this even more well luckily I had the CEO of JavaScript on the phone anything's like Bucky you actually can so make a new function called circle area 3 and set this equal to this I'm just going to go ahead and type it and then I'm gonna explain it to you guys so before I actually show you guys what everything means let me just go ahead and run this and verify that whatever this crazy new syntax is it actually works all right so all of these little chunks of code they give us the same result calculate the area of a circle with the radius of seven now here's the thing you know that I said whenever you use this arrow operator then you pretty much write the name of your function set it equal to some um variable and then after you put your parameters and then after is the function body now this is the thing anytime you only have one parameter that you need to throw in you don't need to include these little parentheses all right so when when you only have one parameter you can just write the parameter right like here and my parameter is named R now the same goes for whenever you are returning a value directly and you don't need multiple statements so in this line of code we need this statement in this statement so we needed to break it up with curly braces however what we can do is we can actually return the value in one statement so this is essentially the same as writing return and surrounding the entire thing with curly braces but that's the thing this is um an even more shorthand way that whenever you're only used one parameter you can omit or leave out the parentheses and whenever you just have one return statement in no other statements or little bits of code in there then you can actually leave out the return keyword and the curly braces as well so if you guys see this syntax you now know what it means this is new es6 syntax for writing functions called the arrow function pretty cool I'll see you guys next time
