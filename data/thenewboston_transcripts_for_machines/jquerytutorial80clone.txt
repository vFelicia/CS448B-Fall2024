hi this is alex from phpacademy.org and welcome to a video for the new boston now in this tutorial we're going to take a look at another manipulation function in jquery and that is clone now we're going to be using the same application that we developed for append and append 2 or append 2 rather because we essentially took a value here and we placed it here using the append 2 function and that just moved this element inside of here so let me just go through this for those of you that were either unclear or haven't seen the append 2 video we're taking an input button and we well when we click it let me just move this down when we click it we're taking this span here and replacing it and appending it to the end of this paragraph now we do this using the following code and just append to paragraph so the span with my name is or sorry the span with alex in it is appended to the end of the paragraph which says my name is now the problem is here is that we instead of actually just taking a copy of this we're just moving the element and appending it on now to fix this we can use the clone functionality so if you have uh you know attempted to append one element onto another and you just want a copy of it to be created we can actually make a simple change to the code that we're currently using and actually then clone the element and then append it on so in fact what we do is we simply just um after our span we would we would just say clone and then dot append two so we've got the span here we're cloning the span and then we're appending it to the paragraph so instead of this happening where we take the element up here and just completely move it to the end of this element will actually receive a copy of the element and then it will just take it and append it onto the end as a copy so you can see now that using the clone function will clone an element and then append it to rather than just appending two and moving the element altogether
