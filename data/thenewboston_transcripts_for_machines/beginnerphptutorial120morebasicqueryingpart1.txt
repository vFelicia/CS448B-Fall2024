hi this Alex from PHP academy' to org and this is a video for the new Boston now in this we've already looked at or within PHP myadmin we've already looked at creating things deleting things but I'm going to use PHP admin to just demonstrate demonstrate some simple SQL queries just so we understand the basic concept of queries how they work and how they retrieve values and also how to structure them because that's very important the minute we structure it slightly wrong we won't be will be returned an error we'll have an error in our syntax so we've got a tab up here that I've just clicked called SQL now PHP myadmin will also automatically put in this little query from you select star from users where one and that's because we were on the Browse tab here by clicking on this we're doing exactly the same as what we're doing on the Browse tab it will return everything from at this table there's no limits to this at all it's just select everything meaning star from the table users and where one is irrelevant we can take this out so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to click go and you can see that this has showing rows 0 to 1 and to total query Turk and in amount of seconds and it's shown our query here with this limit on the end which I'll explain soon but we've been we've retrieved exactly the same data as if we were to click browse so this SQL this SQL query for us at the moment is that useless inside PHP myadmin but when we're working within PHP we might want to select everything from the database however some advice for you is to not use select star because what you're doing is when you're selecting data from a database you rarely will need all of it I could just say select username password for example if I was logging my user in I'm not going to need to access their username or password at their first name or last name to log them in because this is a relevant login details we just need the username and password so if we would just say select username and then comma password now bear in mind these have to exactly match your field names and as with this here you can enclose them in either semicolons or this slanted ab not a semicolon sorry a single quotation mark or this slanted ' so we're using an apostrophe here in our username and password so now let's click go and see what happens so what we've done is we've returned a query but this time we've only selected a certain amount of data we want to be retrieved so we've automatically cut time out of our query you can see here it says seven seconds however if we were to select everything no it's quicker but yeah okay so my point there was rendered invalid but when we're working within PHP and we're using lots of queries at once or we're using joins things like that which you'll learn later we want to be selecting as quick as possible plus there's no need to select some amounts of data so here I'm saying select username password from users now at the moment we've got this where one where one's just going to select everything so where one one's true so it's going to select everything but what we can do is we can specify where we want to select this data in specifics now remember we've got unique user name fields a user unique ID field sorry and here we've got ID of one and two for Alex and Billy and these are unique to this user so let's say I just wanted to return from ID one all I need to do is say where ID equals one and we can put that in there as well so we're ID equals one so this is going to select the username and password from the users table which way in where the ID is equal to one and we're not using a double equals here we're just using equals because there's no assignment of data using this equal sign so in PHP we use a double equals button structured query language we use at an equal sign so let's click go and see what happens I know column 1 right okay okay so let's go back to edit this ID okay right okay no problem so let's go back to SQL and we'll start again so we want to select I'll tell you why that error occurred in there username password from users where ID equals 1 without our that our apostrophes so now we can click go and our query was successful this time so you can see what we've done is we've only selected Alex and password so we've selected the username and password where the ID is equal to 1 if we look back here you can see that the idea one matches Alex Alex is data so it's quite simple to grab the data that you need ok so let's return to SQL this time what I want to do is I want to perform a query which is going to retrieve the username and part or the first name and the surname but with this time we're going to specify a username and a password now if the username and password don't match we're not going to return this data however if the part username and password do match we're going to return this data so this is essentially a login system and to do this we're going to say select a firstname lastname remember this is the data we want to display when we've selected it and we don't need to put these in in apostrophes but it's probably good practice to so firstname lastname from users we're and this is where we specify the username and the password now if I was to say where username equals or is equal to Alex and so we're using an OP M a n operator here with sang and password or not in capitals equals Fred for example or possibly equals a P 1 2 3 or P so what we're doing here is we're selecting the first name and last name like I said we're going to be returning this data from the users table where user name is Alex and password equals P now nowhere in this table does the user name equals Alex and the password equal P we've got user name equals Alex and password equals password and user name Billy and party password equals past 1 2 3 so what we're actually doing this query here is we're returning no rows and you'll see that when I click go in a moment now this is automatically told us that a username and a password combination is invalid therefore a login cannot be processed so let's click go okay so we've got unknown column last name okay surname so this corrected query should now return o username equals Alex password equals P okay let's try at that in the click go okay so my MySQL so I've used I've used apostrophes for this and just single quotation marks for the actual data itself so MySQL returned an empty result set I easy roro's so this query here that we've selected Alex is for the used lemon puppy for the password has returned no data there for the username may exist but the password might be wrong so in general we have a username and password combination error so now what happens if we run the query with the correct data in so you can see that my username is Alex here my password is password so let's run this and see what happens
