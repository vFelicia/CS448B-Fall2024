our last lesson for intro to geometry is gonna focus on the surface area of a right circular cone so a right circular cone is a is a threedimensional object with a circular base just one base circular base right here and the reason it's a right circular cone is because when we draw a line from the top of the cone to the middle of the or the center I should say of the circle it's gonna be perpendicular and it's gonna form a right triangle with the radius of the cone and the side of the cone so to find the surface area of a right circular cone we have to take the area of the bottom plus the area of the sides so the area of the bottom is the area of a normal circle so PI R squared now the area of the cone part is PI R s so we take s which is the slant height of the cone which is this which is this height right here normally we're going to use a perpendicular height but for this we don't use the perpendicular height we're gonna use what's called the slant height and of course R is the radius so this part is how we find the area of the cone shaped part so now that we know how to find the surface area we're gonna do a couple examples so first example we have this cone right here and so that we make sure that we're plugging in all the right numbers we're gonna write a little list over here so R equals and H equals R or our radius equals three because if you look this is the center of the circle this line right here is drawn to a point on the circle so that's our radius so R equals three and our height I should have wrote s I wrote H by accident so s which is our slant height is this height right here the hypotenuse of this right triangle that's formed when you drop altitude down so our s equals five so to find the surface area we're going to use our formula which is high times R times our slant height plus PI R squared so our slant height or surface area is equal to PI three times five plus PI three squared so three times five is 15 15 PI plus three squared is nine nine PI so our surface area is equal to 15 plus nine which is 24 pi and we're going to leave it just like that so that we are giving the exact value but we can't forget our units so our units are inches squared because area is always measured in units squared so we're going to do one more example so our equals s equals so our R right here is unknown so to solve for our R we're gonna use our Pythagorean theorem which says that a squared which is R squared plus B squared equals C squared so R squared plus 8 squared which is 64 is equal to 10 squared which is a hundred if you minus the 64 over you get R squared is equal to 36 take the square root you get R is equal to 6 now you remember when we take the square root we always get a positive or a negative square root but since we're talking about the length of something we can't have a negative length so we only take the positive value so our R is 6 our s is 10 and now we can find our surface area so the surface area is equal to PI R s plus PI R squared now you don't have to write the formula every time you solve the problem but when we're just starting to learn it helps to write it out so you can memorize it because these are all things you'll need to have memorized so PI R which is 6 times s which is 10 plus PI R squared so surface area is equal to 6 times 10 which is 60 60 PI plus 6 times 6 squared is 36 so 36 PI so our final answer is 96 hi centimeters squared so like I said this is our last lesson for intro to geometry but we're gonna start our geometry series soon so make sure you come back and check that out
