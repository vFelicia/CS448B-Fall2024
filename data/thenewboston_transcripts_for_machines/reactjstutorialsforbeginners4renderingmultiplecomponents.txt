already houses welcome back and in this video I am going to show you how to render multiple components now this is one of the most important rules that you need to understand whenever you make components and that is every single component can only return one parent element so what the heck does that mean well say that you wanted to make this bacon component and you wanted to have a heading that said bacon component and under it you want it to have I don't know like a paragraph tag or something so you went like this paragraph paragraph and alright I am some simple text all right looking good wait a minute why the heck are we getting a bunch of errors right here well remember like I said right here what we're essentially doing is we're returning to main parent elements but we want our component to consist of both these things so how do we get around that well what we need to do is we actually need to wrap these inside a div so if I just go div div then check this out this allows us to use two elements inside a single component because we're only returning one parent div so now whenever we render this check it out so again just remember whenever you make a component make sure that you only return one parent div if you have multiple HTML tags in here then you need to encompass them or stick them inside one div now another thing I want to mention is this this render right here it can only render or display essentially the same thing one parent tag so what happens whenever we want to display bacon three different times well if we do this just rake the tag three times you see I'm getting a bunch of errors and remember whenever I try to run it it's not going to work so what do we need to do well the same thing and actually let me clean this a bit so whenever we want to render multiple components we just go ahead and make a main parent div and then inside here we can write bacon is met many times as we want check it out so again that's one of the tricky things to watch out for in react on whenever you're getting an error or something's not splaying properly and you don't know why just know that every single component can only return one parent element if you want your component to be made of multiple elements then you need to wrap them inside one main parent div or span or whatever you want so there you go I'll see you guys the next video
