hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be taking a look at nests and namespaces again but instead of doing them like we did in the last tutorial we're gonna look at a better and easier to understand way so we'll go ahead and just delete this code right here and we'll delete this too now let's come back into our people dot VB file you can see that we have namespace all people other people and friends all nested inside of all people now there is an easier way to do this so what we can do is let's go ahead and take out this right here and we'll come back up to the top and here is our namespace people okay so now I have names tastes people and other people and friends now what we can do is we could take functions or we could take classes I mean and put them inside of all people and allow all of the other classes inside of other people and friends doing what's called inherit those classes from the all people now we'll be talking about inheritance and probably a couple of tutorials from now so let's go ahead and make some changes to this code so you guys know what I'm talking about about nesting the the namespaces so you see here we have name States all people and other people know what we want to do to nest this is type namespace all people dot other people and then we'll go ahead and do it again right here so now this namespace right here is pretty much part of the all people namespace so whatever classes are put inside of this these classes can inherit from those too and now this probably confuses you the tournament heritance but we'll be talking about that soon and after we've done that you can come back to this and use inheritance to make this code a little bit easier to work with and understand okay so now we have all people without friends and all people to other people so we can come in here and let's just create an other people object so private my person as new and then we're gonna type all people dot other people dot people so we've created an object of the people class from other people which is right here and it has nothing to do with this people class down here in friends so let's come in here and we will access the button one click so we'll type my person dot firstname equals texe first name dot txt my person dot last name equals text last name dot text and they'll go ahead show that out so message box my person dot string and we'll go ahead and run this so we can type the first name tomm last name let's just say let's just do Harris again okay so we'll go ahead and click show person and you can see that we get Tom Harris right here in the title is name spaces so we'll just go ahead and click OK so go ahead and practice a little bit more with nesting namespaces so that you can organize your classes better and I would recommend using this type of nesting namespaces over just putting them inside of each other because that could get a little confusing and when you use this it makes it a lot easier to understand so go ahead and practice that a bit and then once we've got that down move on to the next tutorial
