Now we move on to chemical formulas which is the way compounds are written for example water dihydrogen monoxide is written as H2O this means that there are two molecule two atoms of hydrogen combining with one atom of oxygen to form water the little subscript right here tells you the number of atoms that are in said compound and if there's no subscript then it is implied that it is one we have sodium chloride one atom of sodium and one atom of chlorine and acetic acid or vinegar two atoms of carbon four atoms of hydrogen and two atoms of oxygen we have an empirical formula that shows the smallest number of atoms in a compound for example acetic acid the empirical formula is going to be C H2O molecular formula shows the actual number of atoms in a molecule acetic acid again there's actually two atoms of carbon four atoms of hydrogen and two atoms of oxygen and finally the structural formula gives information about the arrangement of atoms acetic acid can also be written like this ch3 C o this means you got your carbon here with three hydrogens on it you got a carbon here and then it's attached to two o's and then the O is attached to an H we next have chemical equations these are how chemical reactions are written and a chemical reaction you have reactants which are what are used to form products water is formed by hydrogen gas and oxygen gas water is formed by hydrogen gas oxygen gas that's what it just said sorry anyways um these chemical equations have to be balanced just like a math equation you have to have the same number of things on the left side as the right side so in order to balance this equation we start off you have two atoms of hydrogen two atoms of oxygen but on the right side you have two atoms of hydrogen but only one atom of oxygen so in order to balance the equation you have to add what are called coefficients which are just numbers before the reactant so to balance this equation you want two molecules of hydrogen gas one molecule of oxygen gas and then you have two molecules of water this is a multiplier so you have two oxygens four hydrogens which equal two oxygens and four hydrogens Now we move on to chemical bonding there are a couple of different types of chemical bonds that can be formed the first example is the first type is an ionic bond ions are atoms with a charge like chloride ion sodium ion this means that an atom has either gained or lost electrons remember if you gain or lose protons you change the element so for example you have your sodium atom here your chlorine atom here this is just going to take an electron to form a bond cuz like I said you either want to have a completely full veent shell or a completely empty veence cell shell excuse me so this chlorine chlorine atom right here is going to take this electron from sodium sodium's veence shell is empty chlorine veence shell is full these types of bonds don't for molecules and it's basically just an attraction so you can have a sodium atom here with a bunch of different chlorine atoms attracted to it because both of these atoms ATS have a charge on them sodium is going to have a plus one charge chlorine is going to have a negative one charge these bonds are pretty weak they for and whenever you dissolve salt in water it's going to form ions Co calent bonds form when atoms share electrons this means electrons are going to spend some time on all the atoms for example you have nitrogen gas which is written in you have your electron density Cloud right here which is where the electrons can be found orbiting around the nucleus these electrons are going to be attracted to the other nucleus for example these electrons are going to be attracted to this atom's nucleus So eventually these electrons are going to be shared calent bond forms the same thing happens here with methane CH4 electrons are all shared there's one electron from hydrogen shares with one electron from carbon carbon has four electrons that can be shared so it's going to share all four electrons with four different hydrogens shared electrons are called an electron pair you have a single Bond when one pair of electrons are shared a double bond when two pairs of electrons are shared and a triple bond when three pairs of electrons are shared single bonds share two electrons double bonds share four electrons triple bonds share six electrons and when electrons spend more time on one particular atom you get what is called a polar bond polar calent bond this means that each atom is going to have a partial charge oxygen is going to pull electron density from hydrogen so oxygen is going to have a partial negative charge hydrogen is going to have a paral partial positive charge and the last thing I'm going to talk about in this video because it's already 13 minutes long is hydrogen bonds these result from the weak electrical attraction between a partially positive hydrogen atom and a partially negative atom the ones you need to remember are oxygen nitrogen and sulfur those are the big ones in in organic systems living systems but basically what's going to happen is you're going to have this partial positive on your hydrogen atoms a partial negative on your oxygen atoms and these are just going to form really weak attractions the partial positive hydrogen atom is going to be attracted to the partial negative oxygen atom and these just form a bunch of different little bonds in water but I'm sorry this video was so long but there's a lot of stuff to cover I know this is very brief or not very detailed but these are just the basics of what you need to know for biology
