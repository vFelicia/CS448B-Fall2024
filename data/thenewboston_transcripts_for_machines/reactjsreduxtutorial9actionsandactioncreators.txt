already houses welcome back and now that we have our component displaying exactly how we want what we have to do next is we need to set up our actions now remember in action is basically just anything that you can do to your application so clicking a button that's an action submitting a form that's an action moving a slider that's an action it's really simple it's just anything that you can do to your app so what I'm going to do in this little lesson is I'm just going to have it where whenever the user clicks one of these user names like clicking the name Bucky Roberts that's an action so whenever they click it I'm going to display the details below so again we're only going to have one action in this little demo keep things really simple but once you see how to build and setup one action you can do it for 100 so in action if you could guess is just a function a function that you call and I'll explain a little bit of terminology in just a second but for now just go ahead and create a new directory and let's just go ahead and name actions in a sense I'm only going to have one I'm just going to make a new file and I'll name it index is usually if you have a bunch you may want to break it up but again I'm going to keep things real simple so there you go let me rearrange this alright so for this action again it's just a function so you can name it anything you want what it's going to be is whenever the user which is me clicks one of these names so you can say click user but what I'm going to do is I'm going to say select user and since it's going to be the only function in here we can just go ahead and export it as a constant select user now what information do we need to pass in to this function well the only thing that we need to pass in is what user they selected so as a parameter I'm just going to go ahead and write user and actually let me do it this way I might as well keep everything on nice and neat so make a fat arrow we'll do that kind of new Essex syntax get my semicolons taken care of right now and I guess we can do this right now so I'm just going to print out in the console whenever they click and this is just to verify you really don't need to do this but just so we can see that something's going on I'll say um whenever they click the user I'll just print out you know click on user now remember this user is the user object so whenever we want to print out something from it well you have to say like a user first to print out their name so user first and that I'll print out their actual name instead of this weirdlooking object so there we go but now what we have to do clean up my code a little bit is this so you know that I said that basically this action right here is a function well that was kind of like the action is actually the part that gets returned the actual function is called the action creator so I'll finish this in then I'll explain it's it really doesn't matter that much is just terminology but I figured I might as well explain what's going on so the action itself is made up of two parts let me show you my diagram the first part is a type and the type is really just a string that explains what happened like a new movie button clicked user name clicked slider removed any way to describe what happened to your application now the second part is the payload or any information that you need to give your app in this case we're just going to go ahead and give it the user object so they have access to whatever user they clicked so if I click Jovi's name we're just going to pass the user object in to or as the payload so I'll go ahead and finish this and then you guys are going to see what's going on so the type again this can be anything you want for the app whenever it needs to handle it I'm just going to say user select it so that's the type of action that occurred the user got selected the user got clicked on now again the payload I'm just going to pass in user and you can actually name this parameter anything you want you can name it data it's just kind of convention name it payload all right so ten seconds ago I was saying something about this isn't actually the action it's actually the action creator what the heck was I talking about technically in a react the correct terminology is the action is made up of two parts it's an object with the type and a payload so this whatever turns this is actually the action now this entire function is called an action creator so again you have a function that you're going to be calling from your application and it's called the action creator and it's job is just to return an object called the action alright so that is fantastic so now let's actually go ahead and use this action creator or this function that we just made so over in your user list of course what we need to do is we need to hook it up so we're going to put a function or event handler on this list item and we're going to pretty much hook it up to this function right here so whenever they hit this we're going to say on click call this function so what we need to do first is just go ahead and import everything so we're going to import select user from how do you get there up to actions index alright and a semicolon and okay so this select user is equal to whatever this exported boom this function so here's the thing and this is the only other thing that may throw you for a little bit of a loop so we can just say on click call select user and you may think that that would be perfect but here's the thing see we are hooking up our react application to work with redux so if we do that then we kind of bypass the important stuff so it will work but it isn't hooked up properly to be used in a redux application so in order to use it in a Redux application we just can't pass it in directly what we need to do is we need to connect it to this container which is the smart component so again we can pass in to the component directly but to hook it up with Redux we actually need to hook it up to this connect function right here and it's almost the exact same is this just another function actually let me add it below so what we do is we need to make a fun function called match dispatch to props and it sounds confusing they name these functions so confusing but they're actually really easy to understand it's annoying miss to match dispatch to props okay so let me go ahead and type this to make sure I don't have any typos and check this out so all we're doing right here is instead of just passing it in directly we're just going to pass it in as a prop so you know before all we did right here is we pretty much said all right whatever the state is we're going to pass that in as a prop well in order to use it in our component we also need to pass it in as a prop so we're going to take this function pass it in as a prop and we're going to hook it up pretty much so we can use it with the redux in dispatch just pretty much is a fancy way of saying call a function that's it alright so what we're going to do is we're going to return bind action creators in bind this is just a synonym for connect in action creators remember I said it's just another name for a function so we're pretty much going to connect this function see it's so easy why didn't you everything so confusing and whenever we pass in as a prop we can actually just use the same exact function name so it's super easy so the prop select user is equal to the function select user easy enough now just for housekeeping the last parameter that we have to call them this is dispatch and again like I said that is just some something that happens behind the scenes with redux to actually call this function alright so in order to actually throw this in right after match state the props you just throw this function and that's it so again all we did is whenever the user does something to your application they need to generate in action and an action is just a way of telling your entire application that something happened so we made an action called user selected and of course this entire function that gets called is called the action creator because it creates this object now whenever we pass it in to our component or container since it's kind of smart now we're just going to pass it in as a property with the same name so we don't get confused or anything like that so now in here we have access to a property called select user which is essentially this function boom roasted so we can go ahead and call that right now actually so let me clean up this code a little bit so we can see what's going on entertaining myself over here all right so the key is equal to the user ID still and I'll say on on clock skin all right so on click what do we want to do we just want to say this dot props dot select user and remember this function it actually takes in the user object so make sure just the pass in the entire user and not the user ID or username or anything like that and now listener if your function and got object and that is because I am an idiot it just needs to be alright so make sure they actually treat this as a function and not a property since it is a function through bulky art so now if I rebuild this hopefully if it in do anything else wrong whenever we click these we bump this up check this out you clicked on user Bucky Joe be Matty Joe be Bucky tomato tomahto so what we did is we successfully hooked up in action creator to a user event so now whenever they click this it calls the action creator and in essence we know that it's creating this action or this object because we have this line of code that is running successfully so now that we can create actions using user events what is the next piece of the puzzle well now we have to figure out how to pipe this off to a reducer what the heck of reducer is and why we need it so that ladies and gentlemen is what we're going to be doing in the next tutorial and it's going to be awesome I bet you guys can't wait the suspense is killing you so yes thank you guys for watching and I'll see you next time
