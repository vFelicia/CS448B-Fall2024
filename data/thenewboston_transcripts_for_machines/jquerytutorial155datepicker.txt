now because we're showing the textual representation of the day if for example you wanted to go ahead and store a timestamp in a database table you could use backend functionality say in PHP to actually deal with converting this date to a timestamp as far as I'm aware the widget doesn't allow timestamps to be displayed but it's always better to show this in here and submit this data and convert it in the backend of your application so now that we've done that we need to think about what happens if we want a minimum and a maximum date now at the moment we can go back for as long as as long as possible and obviously go forward for as far as possible but let's say we wanted to only allow a date to be chosen from today onwards now we can do this using the min date function of the min date option so min date now we specify this as an either as an integer or we can specify inside text and I'm going to show you how to do that in just a moment for now I'm just going to say zero and when we click here now you can see that we only are allowed to select the date from now onwards so we can select today tomorrow and that will go ahead for the rest of time so now that we've specified that we can also go ahead and specify a max date now the max date might be easier to implement in textual form however we can in fact say for example max day 3 now that would allow us three days on top of the current date so we've got 1 2 3 and then we can't click any further because we've only allowed 3 dates so this is extremely useful if you only want to allow specific dates either from today or a few days back or a time period in the past to a specific amount of dates onwards now we have a supply three and that is taking into account the actual days we can also do a textual representation of this so for example we could say plus one month and that would only allow one month onwards so let's refresh you can see we can go on here and we've got one month onwards from this particular day so the 28th of this day to the 28th of next day and we can then go ahead and also supply a particular amount of days so maybe two days for example so we use plus one month and plus two days will lead us to the 30th of August so we allow we're allowed to do this in textual representation as well as well as the min date as well you could say for example minus five days what this would then do is allow you to go 5 days 1 2 3 4 5 days backwards as well so with both these options you can specify either an integer which represents the amount of days or you can specify it in a textual form as well ok so the next option we're going to look at I'm just going to calm and separate this and come down a bit so we can fit everything on to the text editor is the show button panel now show button panel is default set to false however we can go ahead and set this to true and what this will do is this will show a panel at the bottom so for example selecting today and done now in this case when we select a particular date we automatically activate the done function in essence and this will automatically close the date picker however if you implement this in another way you would in fact be able to use these buttons so for example if a date it was selected say the next day onwards you could then press today and that would jump to the current date so for example if you were I'd know wanted to show yeah like I said show then tomorrow as the default date you could then press today to select the day and then if you wanted the user to select these but not close the box you'll be able to click done and that will just remove the box it's useful to have it here anyway just in case the user decides to say select the 29th and then say oh I don't want to select that anymore they can either press done or they can click outside of the date picker area and that will close that date picker widget okay so the last thing we're going to take a look at is the add animation types now by default it is set to show we're going to go ahead and specify show annum so show animation and there's a lots of different options we can give this they're all listed in the jQuery UI documentation for example we could choose bounce instead of the default show and this will bounce in the box here just depending on how I guess how animated you want the effect to look for example we could also choose fade in and that would just fade in the date picker like I said by default is show and when we refresh and click show that will just pop out like that if you wanted no animation whatsoever and you just wanted the data picker to appear you can leave this blank here and what that will do is it will just show it like this probably for more corporate or more important you know websites I guess however you want to describe them the show option is a good idea because it just shows the date picker rather than including too much animation and making it look fake so that's the date picker widget in the jQuery UI as you can see is extremely easy to implement by just using the default date picker widget on top of the form field that you want to show you can easily implement this to attach to an input field
