so today we're gonna talk about compound inequalities and don't get worried they're not they're not that hard and you solve them just like you would solve a normal inequality what happens is you have two different inequalities that are joined by the word or as in like this or that where they're joined by and which means blank and blank so the only thing that's gonna change with compound inequalities is the way we graph them because we're gonna have say X less than 2 or X greater than 5 so we have to we're gonna have to graph each one of these separately and for this one we could have X is less than negative 1 and X is less than 2 which means both of these things have to be true so we graph and a little bit differently but the best way to really explain it is to just go ahead and do an example so this is our first compound inequality and what you need to understand is that these two things when they're joined by this or make one problem so we're gonna solve each inequality separately and then when we graph them we're going to graph them together so for this we would do like we usually do where you would subtract 3 from both sides we get negative 4a less than or equal tonight or the positive 2 we divide by negative 4 we would get a greater than or equal to so remember you got to flip the sign negative 1/2 and then we're gonna write or in between and we're gonna solve this inequality so 5a is less than if we subtract 1 over negative five divided by five divided by five a is less than negative one now if when you solve this you get a is greater than negative one then you didn't realize that you only divided by positive five you didn't divided by negative five just because you get a negative answer doesn't mean that you have to switch your sign so when we graph this first we're going to plot our points for each one of these so this is a greater than or equal to negative one half which I'm just gonna have to estimate and say that negative one half straight here so I'm going to put a circle around that and then a less than or equal to negative one which is gonna be close to one half we'll say like right there so since I have a greater than or equal to I'm gonna have a close circle over negative one half and an open circle over negative one now if you look you have to put your make sure you match your inequality up fit with the right point so we have a less than negative 1 and then greater than or equal to one half so that means that this you're gonna have an arrow going this way for all your A's that are greater than one negative one half greater than or equal to negative one half and you're gonna have an arrow pointing to the left for all A's that are less than negative one so when you plug in your numbers for each one of these you're gonna plug them in separately to check so we're gonna do one more example but this time we're gonna use an and compound inequality so again we're going to solve both inequalities like we normally would so we're gonna subtract 3 from both sides get negative 1 less than or equal to Y so I always like to write my inequalities with the variable on the left because that's how we graph them so this is y greater than equal to negative 1 now if you look I didn't change anything about this inequality because this inequality says that negative 1 is less than or equal to Y and this inequality says that negative 1 is less than or equal to Y 2 so I'm going to write my hand down and I'm gonna solve this inequality separately so we would subtract 3 from both sides and we get Y less than 2 so first thing we're gonna do is plot our points so 2 is about right there negative one's about right there and this one's greater than or equal to negative 1 so we're gonna have a closed circle now this and right here is gonna join these two inequalities together and we're gonna shade the area in between these two circles and because and means the same thing that it does when you're talking if you say that I am I like blue and I like red it means you like both of them so if this means that so when you say that Y is greater than or equal to negative 1 and it's less than 2 it has to fall somewhere in this region between negative 1 and 2 so that when you graph your inequality for an and you should always have a little shaded area between and if you notice with an and you cannot have the same inequality symbol because if I had y greater than 5 and y less than negative 3 that could never happen because like 5s all the way over here negative threes all the way over here there's no way that it could be greater than 5 and less than negative 3 so when you graph compound inequalities you have to make sure that you pay attention to this word that joins them together because that's going to determine how you graph it so all we're gonna do with compound inequalities and make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're gonna switch focus a little bit and start talking about exponents
