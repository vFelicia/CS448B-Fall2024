alright guys welcome to your 17th UDK tutorial and in this tutorial we're finally going to be applying some materials to our building so like I said unless you're a huge chess fan and you love this texture right here of purple and gray squares all over your building you're probably gonna want to apply a new material to make it look a little bit more pretty I guess you could say so let's go ahead and scroll inside here and the very first thing I'm gonna be doing is applying a new material to our floor because this floor it kind of looks like a bathroom floor and I'm just not doing that so we have a couple of different ways where we can apply materials and I'm gonna be teaching you the most common ways probably the easiest ways so the very first thing we need to do is of course open our content browser that we learned about in the last tutorial and I'm gonna go ahead and I already raised playing around with this was actually I want to show you guys this anytime you already have a couple settings punched in and you kind of want to reset everything go ahead and if you have something typed in here you can go ahead and hit X and clear it out and anytime you have a bunch of checkboxes checked like this go ahead and hit clear and what clear is gonna do is it's gonna reset everything so now go ahead and hit X in clear and it gives you a brand new start another thing if you're not getting the results you think you should it means you're in a package so if you're in this package is only gonna show objects from that package go ahead and just hit all assets and that's gonna bring you back up to the top so again like I said anytime you want to refresh everything just go ahead and all assets X and clear and it's gonna take you back to the start so that being said let's go ahead and apply a material so in order to apply a material and I don't know if I talked about this unless Sora or not but a lot of you guys who are just beginning using the UDK are probably gonna get confused between materials and textures now whenever we talk about them in everyday life there really isn't that much of a difference but in the UDK here's what's going on a texture is basically a part of a material so whenever you're creating two materials you can use different textures to create them so basically the material is the final product and for that reason you can only apply materials to these surfaces so basically don't worry about textures for now we're gonna be covering those in mm a tutorial much different than this one so basically just worry about materials for right now because those are the actual things that we can apply to the surface to make it look pretty so go ahead and select materials because that's what we're gonna be working with in this tutorial and I'm also gonna scroll down here and select if I can find it building on our material because whenever we select this we get all the materials that are really good for applying to our building so the first way I'm going to show you of how to apply materials to your object is the easiest way so go ahead and find any material you like and this is the drag and drop method incredibly simple in order to apply a material to a surface just go ahead and drag it and drop it on your surface how easy was that so now you can see if we fly around our building a little bit that there's a couple of spaces we missed this doorway right here where we cut out we want to go ahead and apply to there and also remember we extruded this porch so this is actually a different surface than this main floor so go ahead and drag and drop your material on the porch and now if we go ahead and close out of our content browser and fly around our building a little bit we can see that this material is applied in nicely to our house pretty going on so that is the basics of the draganddrop method how you can apply a material to a surface by choosing the material and dragging it and dropping it on a surface so now what I want to do is you're probably seeing our a next let's go ahead and take care of these walls right here so a couple things we want to take note of first of all there's a lot of different walls and basically whenever you're painting a house or something you paint all your walls the same color so what we want to do is we want to get this done in one shebang so let's go ahead and select all our walls so we have a couple options of doing this in order to select all our walls we can go ahead and select the wall hold control select another wall hold ctrl on your keyboard select another and do this with all the walls or there's even faster way of doing this go ahead and when you have a wall selected rightclick it and what you wanted to do is select surfaces and this allows you to settle out surfaces in groups so what we wanted to do is select all adjacent walls aka adjacent walls so go ahead and hit that and once you do you you see that all of your walls left to right light up again it doesn't select the floor it only just selects the walls so that's a nice little shortcut of how you can do that so now we have all the walls selected pretty cool huh so now let me show you guys an alternative method of applying materials to these surfaces go ahead and open your content browser again and go ahead and look for a material that you like let me find find something with a little bit of flavor I guess that's a little bit different so go ahead and select this material right here and don't drag and drop it just yet an alternative method of applying materials to these surfaces is this go ahead and rightclick anywhere in your selection and hit apply material and once you do that you can see that if you deselect everything that it applied this material to all the walls and actually it probably even applied it yep to the outsider right there so again sometimes you want to select it in groups sometimes you want to select these surfaces individually but for the most part those are your two main ways that you can apply materials to surfaces so what I'm going to be doing when I pause this tutorial is that's the basics of how you apply materials to surfaces so you don't need to sit here and watch me apply material to this and this and this and this and this what I'm going to be doing is I'm gonna be applying materials to each one of these surfaces and when you come back for the next tutorial my house is going to be covered you know however I want it to be covered so that's what I want you guys to do as your I guess homework assignment go ahead and decorate your house however you want it really doesn't matter what materials you choose when you come back you're ready to move on to the next part of this story so thank you guys for watching that's what you need to do and I guess I'll see you when you're done
