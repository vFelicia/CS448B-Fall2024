hi this is Alex Ron PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to be looking at the jQuery now utility which is going to provide us with a timestamp in milliseconds that represents a time now we're first of all going to demonstrate how to do this and then then I'm going to talk very shortly about why you might want to do this and also the other functionality that the time in jQuery provides such as time between animations etc so the first thing I want to go ahead and do is just create a div on my page that's going to hold this value and then first of all going to look about look at returning the static value so the current value and then I'm going to set an interval and see this value rise extremely quickly obviously with the milliseconds and then you'll see it progress with the second part of it so we're just going to call this div time inside you tilde s which we've included on our page just here obviously as well as jQuery we're going to go ahead and place the time inside of this div so this is what our browser looks like at the moment that's just refresh you can see that there's nothing on the page obviously we're going to go ahead and wait for the document to be ready so when the DOM is fully loaded and inside of here we want to go ahead and create a variable with the the current time so I'm going to create a variable called time stamp and that's going to be equal to and this is where the function functionality of this utility comes in its jQuery dot No so it's you would do jQuery dot no and this will return the timestamp with the exact milliseconds as well so it's quite useful guess in a way because we're looking at a very precise precise language or precise action based on different you know things that jQuery provides like animation these animations can you know speed up very quickly so instead of returning a timestamp with you know as you would normally see in languages like PHP with just the chickens at the start we also have milliseconds because we can use this with animation so now what I want to go ahead and do is actually place this into the time div so I'm going to say time dot text and then just replace that with the time stamp so now when we refresh our page you see we get a time stamp which slightly longer looking than other time stamps and you see when we refresh this the value goes up quite quickly and I'm going to go ahead and set an interval on this so you can see this rise quite quickly well you know more dynamically so I'm just going to go ahead and set an interval let's just bring this down a bit and inside here obviously we run our callback function and we'll just go ahead and cut that and paste it inside this set interval functionality now the second parameter is the you know every time you want this interval to be or the block to be executed and that's every one millisecond so now when we refresh you can see the value should rise notice not so let's see what we've done wrong oh yeah there we go because we've we're just placing the timestamp in there so let's just go ahead and place that declaration of that variable inside the interval and then this will refresh every one millisecond so when we refresh you can see that the value rises now you can see here that this value that my cursor is over just now is the amount of seconds whereas these are the milliseconds the three digits that then count up to each second because obviously there are a thousand milliseconds in a second so you can see now that we have a representation of milliseconds and then we've got the seconds here and then so on so the reason that we have this jQuery dot now which we can apply to lots of different things and lots of different areas this obviously just returns the timestamp however you can do things like check how long it takes for an animation to complete or you know check the time that certain process is carried out and this is important for obviously accuracy so while we've just been looking at jQuery now which returns a tie stamp you can you know use this with different elements and loading times as well just to check payer you know times that things happen like animations or when elements are loaded into the Dom so the other use for this would be to pass this to a another script for example so let's say you have retrieved the time that a specific animation or a specific load time takes place you could then go ahead and store this inside of a database table for example let's just take the scenario that you're loading an iframe with a page inside so a web page inside the iframe you could count how long this takes for that particular page to load and then store that maybe you want to tell your users how long the last page load time of of that of this page that they're viewing is loaded so there's a variety of ways we can use time stamps but for now that's just how to display a time stamp to the screen and we've also created an interval so we've made the representation a bit a bit more dynamic
