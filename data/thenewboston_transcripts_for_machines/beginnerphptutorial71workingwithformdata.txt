hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is another video tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be talking or rather in this short tutorial series we've got get variable the post variable and we're also talking about requests which will be something later on when we've understood about forms in general this first tutorial is going to talk about HTML forms we're going to go sort of back to basics and how we use them in different elements of them that allow us to process data through PHP or send data to a page rather now I'm going to be using this at this example on for the same page but when you do post data you can either post it to the same page that you're on currently or you can post it to another page now if you don't understand what I'm talking about that's absolutely fine I will begin to create my HTML form and I'll explain each element of the form as we go along we're not actually going to be doing any PHP programming necessarily in this video okay so the first thing we do when we specify a form is the start and the end tag of the form we also specify an action and a method now the action is where this form is going to submit when a submit button is clicked so we include a submit button on our form this will be inside here a bit later on now the first thing we do like I said is we we declare the all the action sorry yet with the action first so in this case I own the action to link back to this same page and this page is called index.php you can see this shown here and up here as well so we've got form action equals index dot PHP when a submit button is clicked the form will then submit any data that is inside of it to this same page and then we can start to process this data inside our PHP tags the method can either be get or post depending on how you're submitting the variables now a little about either of them get is basically sending the data and it's visible in the URL and it's sending the variables through a the format of the URL post sends data through the HTTP POST method so they're slightly different I'm not going to talk about them quite yet but I'm going to use get just to show you an example in this in this tutorial so what do we want to do first the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to enter some input fields so I'm going to say day and I'm going to create an input type or an input tag so on its own it would look like this and the type is going to be text the name of it is essentially what you're naming it in regards to a variable this will be submitted and we can pick it up using the collection of get variables which is almost like an associative array so the name of this I'm going to call is day now what I'm going to do is I'm going to break down and I'm going to say date input type equals text name equals date so we're calling it something different we're breaking down again and we're saying year so input type equals text name equals year we break down a couple more times just to keep everything neat and I'm going to create a button in fact let's just see how this looks at the moment let's refresh okay so we've got day date and year in actual fact just to make things a bit tidier I'm going to break in between each one of these as well so that is looking like that so if essentially created our form already we just need a button like I said earlier down here and that's input type of submit and the value of that is what just what is what is displayed so if I get rid of this here and I refresh you can see it says just as submit some browsers it will default to submit request but I can specify by anything here you can see that that will just create to look like anything what they'll create with the capitalized text anything so I'm just going to call this submit okay so now what's going to happen is if you watch by default my browser doesn't show the index dot PHP page in its URL however I was to click on submit like I said earlier we've supplied the action of this form to go to index dot PHP so when I click on it you'll notice the URL up here changes and we've also included a few variables we've got day date and the year so the way this works is after the page name itself which is here in blue we have a question mark and after this we specify our variables so the name of the variable is day and that is equal to something at the moment is nothing and then we say and with an ampersand symbol we say date is equal to something here at the moment it's equal to nothing and then again the year is equal to something here which at the moment it's equal to nothing so here for example I type Monday I tote 31st and I took 2011 and I click Submit if you look at the top of the page you can see that the URL has changed and in actual fact day is equal to Monday data is equal to 31st and the year is equal to 2011 so now we have submitted what's called get variables through PHP using a form so that's how to create a form and submit them however we want to actually do something with them now in the next tutorial we're going to be looking at get variables and how we should use them and why we should use them and then in the other tutorial going to look at post variables and again the same how we use them why we use them so this has been basically how to create the form and submitting the variables and so we can use them eventually in PHP
