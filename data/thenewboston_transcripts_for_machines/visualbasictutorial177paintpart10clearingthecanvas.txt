hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash online gamer for the new boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our paint program now this can be found in the book beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by Theron Willis and Brian Newsome and this is public published by rocks now this option form and changing the color and the brush sizes we're all my idea I just took the base of their paint program walked you guys to it and then we created this form right here that will let you change the brush size and the color so what we're going to be doing in this tutorial is we're going to allow the user to clear the canvas and start over so we will make this a little bit bigger and let's add a button so we'll set the text to new canvas and then we will set the name to button clear so whenever they click new canvas what do we want to do well we want to clear everything that is on our paint canvas VB so let's come over here in the paint canvas dot VB which is our class that the control uses and we'll create a public method so public sub clear canvas and this is isn't going to take any arguments so we'll just access graphics items dot clear so we created this array list called graphics items and what graphics items does is a source every single shape that is drawn on the screen whenever we click and drag around so it paints these onto the screen when we're drawing now if there's nothing inside of this array list then it's not going to pay anything to the screen so if we get rid of everything in it by calling clear all of our graphics items are going to be gone all of our circles and now what we need to do is make the canvas refresh so we'll call me dot invalidate so this says oh no I have to repaint the the canvas because it has been invalidated and it needs to be updated so under optin form whenever they click button clear what we want to do is we want to access our my paint form so my paint is a type form 1 and it's an object so we'll do my paint not paint canvas one which is an object of paint canvas that is inside of my paint then we want to call clear canvas so we access our form then the object of the control in our form then we access the clear canvas method inside of that so we'll go ahead and run it here is paint vb we'll set the brush size to say large or me you and will change the color to red we can go ahead and just draw as much as we want and then when we click new canvas you can see that it erases everything on our canvas and we can start over so I will change the color to black and we can continue drawing so you can also have it set the brush size back to the default and the color back to the default if you click new canvas but we're not going to be covering that in this tutorial I'm you guys know enough about programming already that you should be able to do it you would just set the color property and then set the brush size property whatever they click the button which is quite simple so go ahead and make this program if you haven't already and then if you have any changes you made to it to make it better or to add some functionality go ahead and leave a video response if you can or tell us in the comments what you've done and if you made it and you just want to show it off then you can go ahead and leave a video response as well so thanks for watching this series on painting the creating the paint program in Visual Basic and upcoming in the next tutorials we're gonna be working on other programs
