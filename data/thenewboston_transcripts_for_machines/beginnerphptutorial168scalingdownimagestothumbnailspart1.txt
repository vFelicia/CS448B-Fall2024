hi this is Alex from here it should be Academy to org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now we've already looked at GED you may have watched the introduction video how to convert your text and place it into an image but this time what we're going to be doing is creating a really useful piece of code and this is going to be contained within index dot PHP and what this is going to do is it's going to read in a an image from our browser URL so let's just go over to our browser you'll have something like image image equals and then in this case we're going to say phone jpg because what I have here is a file called phone duck jpg and which I want to scale down to a specific thumbnail size now you may think oh you know resizing an image might be easy but what we need to think about is we need to think about first of all we need to think about the aspect ratio and maintaining the aspect ratio and by this I mean that when we scale it down we don't want to set a predefined width and a pre Dupre to predefined height for our image let's say we had a really long but short in in height wise image if we predefined this to a specific height say 100 by 100 characters we're actually going to cut we're actually going to skew our image so much might look a bit odd so what we want to do is we want to resize an image to a thumbnail acceptable size and you can play around with these properties in the code once we start writing them you'll see which values you can change and which you probably can't and our image will be scaled down to this size and every image will end up at roughly the same size so you're going to have a thumbnail size image and because this because you can use the let's not open a code just yet because you can let's go back do something like image equals phone jpg it means that when you're doing say file uploads say you're uploading files what can actually do in what you can actually do in in the process of uploading your file is call this and it will generate a thumbnail for you so it's really really useful when you do file uploads you want to keep an original copy and you want to give a thumbnail copy of an image so what we're not going to be doing in this tutorial is over writing phone jpg with a smaller image we're going to be creating a new file with a scaled down and we're maintaining the aspect ratio and that's going to be phone JPEG thumbnail JPEG because we're going to use the file name just in case we need to check on things later so we're going to give it a nice file name as well not nicelooking but so we know exactly what far we're dealing with and we know that it's a thumbnail file so let's go ahead and start writing out our code now what's the first thing we need to think about in Gd with the GD library when we create our document and what we need to do is we need to think about setting our header type we can do this to preview it I mean what we're going to be doing in the end is saving this file so we don't necessarily need to change the content type I don't think but we'll do this anyway so use the header function that you may have come across before and inside here I'm going to say content type and I'm going to do a colon so I've got content type the in the middle and now I'm going to say image forward slash JPEG what this is going to do it's going to change the content type of the page to a JPEG image because we're going to be reading in a JPEG image and we're going to be creating an image a JPEG image as the scaled down version so we're not dealing with any other file formats except for JPEG in this example okay so now what we need to do is we need to check for the input so we need to check that a user has supplied an argument to our URL so using this get and get variable we need to say if is set dollar underscore get image then complete the rest of our code so inside here is going to be the rest of our code if we haven't supplied an image in here and by here I mean in around here so image equals fine jpg this value here would equal a phone dot jpg then there's no need to run the rest of our code because we can't create a thumbnail from an image that we haven't already specified so let's create a new variable called image and let's step set this to the get variable and the reason I'm doing this is so I can use this image variable later on in the program and in the code sorry and use reference it a lot easier okay so there's a few things we need to do now and that is first of all get the size of the image and when we use the get image size function we actually create an array of the sizes the dimensions of the image so it sounds probably complicated but let's go ahead and do it and you can see that it's not at all so I'm going to create a new variable called image size and this is going to equal the get image size function so get image size so now what we're already doing is we're creating image size variable which is here and this is going to be an array and we're going to be focusing on element 0 and 1 in the array which is going to be the width and the height so underneath this we're going to create some more variables with the actual width and height of the image so we just supply this with an argument image because this is the image that we've already picked up so let's go ahead and comment out this header part and I'm going to write the code to get the image width and the height and then we're going to test that this is working so I'm going to say image width and this is going to be equal to image underscore size and in bracket so remember image size is an array so now we're taking an element of an array and I want element 0 this is going to return the width of the image now we can go ahead and do the height so image height equals image size and then we have one this time because instead of 0 being width one is height so let's go ahead and echo bet both these values out let's just append a break onto the end of this line so go out everything looks okay so let's come back to our page so what's going to happen now is we're going to read in a phone jpg and as this image variable here which we've already checked for and then preset so now what we're doing is we're grabbing the image size from the file that we've specified so let's go ahead and press ENTER and see if it works okay so my image is 730 by 410 let's just take a look at the image itself we're not going to obviously measure it ourselves but we can just double check that it's about that so the full size scale version I would say yet this is about the dimensions that we've already returned to 730 by for tech
