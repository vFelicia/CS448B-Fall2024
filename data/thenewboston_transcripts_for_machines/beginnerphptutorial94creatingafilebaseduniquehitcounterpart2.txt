so we don't actually want to echo out the IP addresses we just want to use them inside here so I'm going to create a variable called IP single and that's equal to each one so we can use this variable to check whether the user's IP address which is up here corresponds to one already in here so we can say if we can say if IP address is equal to so using a double equals comparison operator is equal to IP single do something otherwise do something else now in actual fact we don't need this ifelse statement we just need an if statement because if the if the IP address is in there actually let's think about this logically if the IP address is in there we don't want to record the IP so what we can say is if IP address doesn't equal IP single so essentially what we're doing is we're looping through this IP dot txt file we're checking of the user's IP addresses this is equal to this one first and then we're checking if it's equal to this one now if it is equal to this one or if it's not equal rather we're going to say found equals false otherwise we're going to say come back up here found equals true and the reason we do this is because we're in a loop here we don't to increment the value of the count dot txt file inside a loop because if we increment the value of something in a loop is going to be performed over and over and over again so we want to create a boolean value could found which is going to be equal to either true or false then what we can do is under this for each under this for each here we can then say if found equals false and in here what we can do is increment count txt value so let's just test this first of all we can echo here IP not found and in the case of the IP address not being found we can increment the value of count so let's just test this works refresh IP not found oh it should have been okay so I think the problem here is that we've declared this outside our function so we need to do is if we pop this inside of our function just in there and we refresh Oh No okay so let's try and determine the problem with this let's echo this up first of all and refresh so let's have a look inside our IP dot txt that's on the first line there so we'll go through and debug this carefully probably just something that I've completely missed echo that out and that's one to 7.1.1 so if that is equal to my IP IP address underscore address doesn't equal IP single found equals false found it was true oh okay I understand so if it is found we need to say if it's not found we need to say found equals I get false otherwise found equals true and we need to say it found equals true and we run this it means our IP address has been found however if I was to remove this IP address we can keep this one and refresh no no okay hold on let's take another look at this let's put that back in there so this is probably great I've made a mistake you can follow me and see what I've done wrong so if IP address doesn't equal IP single found equals false if found equals false is equal to false right okay I think I've sort of worked out the problem now I'll tell you why this isn't working first of all how to have had a little look at it and I've and I've sort of worked out what's wrong so what's happening is is where because we're looping through every IP address first of all we're going to set the boolean found found the variable found which is a boolean to true and then what we're going to do is yeah so okay so I P address doesn't equal IP single let's change this to equals equals and we'll change this around so it's just easier to grasp so if the IP address in the file does equal the IP address of the user then found equals true so therefore if found equals true we want to say already or will just say fountain for now so otherwise once say folks however when we go through again it's going to check the second one and put this to false automatically we're not keeping the same value of found therefore underneath each one of these we want to use break so we're only finding the IP address and then breaking in fact we can say folks keep that as folks that's absolutely fine so now if we were to refresh it says found because it's found within here so all break is doing is if it is found we don't need any more information so we're breaking out of this current loop it's for each here okay so obviously if we were to put a break here and it wasn't found would break out straight away we want to keep going through the file until it's found so logically looking at this I was confused and you may be at this stage but just have a good look and try and understand why we break out
