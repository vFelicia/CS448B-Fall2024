okay so today we're going to start off with a quick review of Transformations and then we're going to learn how to graph Transformations so our first kind of transformation is called the translation it's also known as a slide we take an object and we'll move it One Direction and get an image that's in the exact same place next we have rotation where you take a object and you rotate it around a point so we're rotating it around this point and reflection is where you have a line that you're going to reflect it over and you just produce the mirror image of the first shape so now we're going to do some graphing so for each point write Its Reflection so for 2 3 first we'll plot the fir the original point so 2 3 that's a and we want to reflect it across the X AIS well if you remember this is the x axis this is the Y AIS so we're going to reflect it across this axis so when we reflect across the x axis we keep our same x coordinate but we're going to make we're going to take the opposite ycoordinate so when you go from coordinate from Quadrant 4 up to quadrant 1 you're going to go from a negative y value to a positive yalue so this point becomes 2 positive3 2 positive3 and this is a prime so this time we're going to take B and reflect it across the y AIS so 1 pos2 B and we're going to reflect it across the y AIS which is this vertical axis right here so when we reflected across the y AIS we're going to keep our same y point and take the opposite x coordinate because if I go from Quadrant 2 to quadrant 1 I go from a Nega X to a positive X so this becomes positive 1 one two this is B Prime so now we're g to do some more examples so we're going to find the image uh so we're going to do whatever they tell us to do and we're going to produce an image similar to this one so first we're going to reflect it across the y AIS so when we do that we keep the same ycoordinate so first we have to find the coordinates of each point U is 1 2 V is 3 2 and T is 3 4 so we're going to keep the same y coordinate for each and we're going to take the opposite x coordinate this time if we go from one to quadrant 2 we're going to go from having a positive X to go to having a Negative X so we're going to take the negative value of each so 1 33 so now let's plot this new shape1 up to3 up two and3 of four so here is this Triangle T U V oh no excuse me v u reflected across the y AIS so now we're going to translate this shape to right so when we translate we're just going to push it over two to the right so we're going to take our coordinates and we're going to add two to the x coordinate because if we're moving it over right we're going to increase our x coordinate by two so this becomes 1 + 2 which is 3 one 3 + 2 which is five and 3 + two which is five so now let's plot this new shape so three two this point right here I'll use a different color so you can see it better this point right here is now Point u v is 52 this is our new V and T is up here at 54 and that's our translated image so that's all we're going to do with transformation today make sure you come back because we're going to start talking about triangle inequality
