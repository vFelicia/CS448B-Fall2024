so we can go ahead and again use a selector for hover div and we want to say dot show first of all we want to show this this div or in fact first we want to set the text for this div so by using text we're placing text in between here and then therefore that's going to display correctly so the text is obviously hover text because we've already gained this unique attribute that we've given it then we want to go ahead and shove it and what this will do is it will just modify this display property to actually display it so what we're doing is onmouseover we're grabbing the hover text attribute which we gave in inside the link here then what we go ahead to do is let's just bring this down is set the text inside of our hover div and then show it and then bind or change the CSS properties of the hover div to the current mouse position so in essence it's quite a simple idea and quite easy to produce something like this however we are going to have a few problems and we're going to take a look at them just now so now you can see that when I hover over I have this box display now the first problem you notice is this is a bit jumpy and the reason for this is let's go ahead and refresh again so I'm gonna hover over from this side and it works up into a point where I have to move my mouse back again and now you can see that you know it's we just have we just have our text on on what we just have our cursor on this div so it really at the moment is useless because the user is gonna be fiddling around with this and it doesn't look very nice and it doesn't work very well so we need to make a couple of small adjustments to allow us to work properly and what we're gonna do is we're gonna add a value of 10 onto the current Y position so this will actually move the div 10 pixels in the in the in the top downwards and the left across so now that I've made this small change by just adding 10 on to each of these properties now in a hover over you can see that the it doesn't affect it it doesn't the mouse is you know it's the mouse is over this but it's not affecting it when I pull it back but we also have this problem as when we leave the element the div isn't isn't hidden remember we automatically have this hidden but we don't have an event to handle when the mouse comes off of the element to actually hide it so we want to go ahead and actually hide this now so what we can do is onto the end of our selector for our hover class remember this starts here and ends with this bracket just here we can go ahead and assign another event handler onto this and that is Mouse out so inside Mouse out we want to do exactly the same thing as we do and create a function and just bring this down however the only thing we need to write inside of here is to hide the hover div so hovered if we use the selector to select the hover div and we just say hide so now what's going to happen is when the mouse goes over this element we perform what we've already seen to be working and when it comes away we just hide the div now if the mouse was to go back onto the map and on to this element it would just repeat the process so it's almost like a cycle so now what's going to happen is we have our working element however when we pull away it disappears so it doesn't you know remain on the page so now we have the effect that we've been looking for as we hover over the div isn't interfering with the cursor and when we move away the div element disappears again so this is all well and good but we want to know that we can go ahead and use it on any other element so I'm just gonna go ahead and wrap this link in paragraph tags and I'm gonna come down and I'm going to create a new paragraph with an image inside of it so this is essentially the steps that we would go through if we wanted to apply this effect to another element now we've got our hover class div up there there's no need to duplicate this for any reason because it's dynamic it'll change depending on which element so the image source is Tartan jpg that's an image just inside my my root directory notice this still obviously works and we want to apply the same effect to this image so we want to apply the hover class to this image so hover and then we also want to apply this hover text attribute that we created and explained earlier so I'm gonna say a lovely Tartan image or pattern so now that we've done this we've just simply created an image and the only two things we've done is applied this class to it which is picked up here and we've then gone and applied this hover text which is picked up here remember using this so we're using a unique attribute for the particular for a particular element so let's go ahead and preview this our our link works us as it would now when we hover over our image we have the same effect with different text now let me just explain quickly the process that again if you're not too sure in this the process that this goes through so now that we've hovered over we've shown the div we've assigned it to the particular cursor which will always happen because jQuery handles this event for us and we've applied the text Google a powerful search engine to the div on our page here now when we hover away that particular div is hidden then now the text will still remain assigned to that div however when we hover over the image we assign the new description to that div and then we show that div as well as well as you know repeating the process for assigning it to the coordinates arm out there I'm at our mouse are at is at so we're essentially done if like I said at the start of the tutorial if you wanted to go ahead and apply this to your own website all you would have to do is go ahead and include this Java Tex Jas file on any page that you'd want to use it or in a global JavaScript file that you might be using for your website obviously you need the use of jQuery and all you need to a place on your page is this div element here but then again you could go ahead and probably include it on another page or something so that was an extremely simple way of creating a hover over description using jQuery but we've tailored it to make sure that it works properly and looks okay and most importantly we've made it so we can use it with lots of different elements
