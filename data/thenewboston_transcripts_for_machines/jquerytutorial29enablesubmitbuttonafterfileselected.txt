hi this is IX Ron PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to be creating a form with an input field with the type file I'm also going to be creating a button next to this now what's going to happen is when we actually go ahead and upload the file or sorry select a file from our computer this submit button to actually go ahead and submit the file through the form it will be automatically enabled so the first thing we're going to look at is our file structure and what we have now the first thing is that we have index dot PHP and then we have ext Doug guess which I've included on the page I've also obviously got jQuery included because we're making use of jQuery selectors and also the remove attribute functionality of jQuery as well so we're looking at a fuse of basic things here that we can bring together to create a more you know useful and advanced script so the first thing I'm going to go ahead and do is actually create my form so let's go ahead and create a form and we're going to set the action in this case to hash because we're not going to submit the form anywhere but obviously you might be submitting this somewhere I'm going to set the method in here to post and I'm going to set the ink type to multipart form data now obviously this doesn't apply to you if you're just looking at the jQuery side of things chances are if you are following this for the purpose of you know implementing this into your own script you'll already have something similar set up however I'm just doing it for the benefit of those who are unsure how to pass file data correctly through form attributes so in this case this is how we would normally set up a form now I'm going to go ahead and actually create my input file now we can either give this a class or an ID or we could just literally go ahead and use the next traversing option in jQuery so I'm going to show you how we can do it in several ways but for now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and give this an ID and I'm going to give this an ID or file so we can use jQuery selectors to pick up on this file ID after this I'm going to create a submit button which ultimately would submit the data to the page that we specify in the action I'm going to give this a value of upload and I'm also going to give this an ID as well and that's just going to be called submit or work let's go ahead and call it upload now I'll call it submit keep the naming conventions the same but I'm also going to give this an attribute of disabled let's just view it without that first you can see that I've got my form here where I can go ahead and select a file and then I've got my upload button here that when I click it we'll go to the page we specified at the moment that's just hash so what we want to do now is disable this upload button and when we click on choose file and then actually choose a file from our computer we then want the upload button to be reenabled so let's go ahead and set the disabled property for this button or the submit button as disabled and that will basically disable the button so we can't press it you can see that it's grayed out now on my browser and I'm unable to click upload and this is going to prompt users to go ahead and choose a file and click a click here before they choose upload so we don't want the user to be able to submit an empty file attribute or a file element on our page so we're going to go over to ext j/s and we know that the ID of our files that we select from his file and we know that our submit button is submit so we can use these to actually you know modify things or set event handlers so I'm using now xt dot j s for all my external javascript so I'm going to come over to ext or J s and the first thing I want to do is just set up jQuery code so I'm going to say document dot ready so we're appending the sorry we're pending the ready event handler on to our document and inside here once the page is ready or the document is ready we execute the code inside of here now like I said the first thing we want to do is go ahead up and set an event handler to this file so we're going to use the selector hash and then file because we're using an ID selector so let's go ahead and first of all select this so hash file and then we append on an event handler now this event handler is change whenever this form field changes we can go ahead and actually run a piece of code and inside that is our function here so if we come down we could perhaps alert something has changed so once anything on this file element changes ie a user selects a new file let me just tell you exactly what happens when we select a file and from our computer so when we click on this and then choose a file here's the file name that's displayed just here however we actually add it into the attribute value so we can actually grab the value from this so change meaning has have any attributes changed or have any additional attributes being added when we select a file the value attribute is added so what we can do now is when we refresh and we click on here when we click on say tartan jpg what this will do is it will change the value attribute of this field to the location of tart and it we have fake path but it will still change and therefore when we select it you see we have this dialog box something has changed so we know that when file has changed we can grab the for example we're not going to be actually doing this but we can grab the value attribute of this so I could perhaps a value equals sorry value equals and I could say this which obviously refers to this object here I could say this dot attribute value and then we could alert out value
