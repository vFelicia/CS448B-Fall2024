hello this is Alex from PHP academy' dog following on from this video for the New Boston now we've already established our variables and we've output them in PHP and let's just take a look at the code again which we've basically fulfilled all three of our requirements if you haven't already seen this video of creating this please go back and watch it otherwise you're not going to completely understand what's going on now what we've done is we've taken the variables we've checked whether the form is being submitted if we submit the form with out we say fill in all fields if we enter something in each of these we are displayed with this now this video is going to deal with the security of form data if I was say extracting data from a database or submitting data a database then extracting it back and anything user submitted there's always going to be a chance that people are going to try and mess around with your code or with your proper with your web application whatever it may be now the day is Monday the date is 31st and the year is 2011 however what's to stop me typing in this so I'm going to have the day in bold a normal day and then let's say let's underline the year and I click Submit you can see that the output to the page is now has now been formatted depending on what the users put in now the reason this is dangerous is because I can in fact say iframe source equals and a page here I could end my iframe there and I could type in anything here but I've been anything there and you can see that what's happened is is that we've we've returned this HTML and it's echoed it out into the page therefore we're processing HTML on a page we don't want our users to be able to do this and there's a simple way that we can protect against this a simple and effective way to protect against this now what we do is when we declare our variables here day date and year we can also include these wrapped in functions and the function we need is HTML entities we don't need to worry about this here because we're not doing anything with this data when we check this here so for example we wouldn't need to say HTML entities there it would be absolutely pointless because we're not displaying the data here we're just checking whether this particular variable here is set so we wrap the function that we're eventually going to display remember we're displaying day down here so we need to protect by wrapping and what we're grabbing in in this function so HTML entities and what HTML entities does I can show you on the page and when we view the source of this these entities yeah okay so HTML entities what this is going to do is it's going to take let's say for example a strong tag it's going to keep the word strong that's fine keep the word strong here that's absolutely fine but it's going to turn these into a value that's rather than processed on an HTML page it's displayed on an HTML page so for example a pound sign like that exists a pound sign however you want to display a pound sign in in an HTML format we'd use and pounds okay or I think it's at and pound but you know I mean so we're actually taking these and let's view the source at the moment and we can see what we're talking about okay so at the moment we've got iframe source and this is being displayed on the page okay we need to take this away we'll just take day away for now so for the day I'm going to write a frame sauce blah blah blah 31 2011 let's refresh now for the day we've got this eye frame up now let's view the page source and you can see that the code exists as you would normally type it on a page so you'd normally type iframe if you wanted an iframe to be displayed now this is a massive security issue now because we're displaying it as we might type it if we want to create the page so with the HTML entities what we're actually doing let's just refresh the page is we're now just displaying it on its own and we do this by using these HTML entities in fact to display everything rather than process them as HTML tags so that's basically the basic security around your form there's obviously added security when you're dealing with different things but if you're displaying data on a page for now this is absolutely adequate to ensure that your users don't do things like change the background well it can't change the background color but iframes are very dangerous for sort of exit XSS tax things like that so that's basic security on your form
