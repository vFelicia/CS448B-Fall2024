two options which is essentially just merging two arrays so we uh okay so let me start from the beginning this is mentioned in other tutorials but I'll go ahead and mention it again we are setting a default value from from however if the options are set we want to go ahead and merge settings with options I.E the option that's provided inside of here we want to overwrite this value with so this will become 10 in the case that we've provided it as 10 here so hopefully that makes sense uh now what I'm going to do is go ahead and alert out uh this setting just to make sure I've got it right this is just something I always do so I'm going to alert out from settings from because remember we're working with an array here let's go and refresh you can see that it says 10 this is the value that we did provide here if I go ahead and change this to three for example and refresh we get the value three so we know that this uh value here is being sent through options it's then overriding this value here so it's changing it here whatever we provide and then we're just alerting that out so we'll get rid of that for now we don't actually need that okay so uh let's go ahead and create the actual functionality of the countdown and then we'll go ahead and provide the Callback function uh a bit later on so um the first thing I want to do is just up of here because we're using um this either this selector inside of a uh um function in a minute we want to select or create a this selected variable and that's just going to equal this and that's so we can just use this variable here uh inside a function down here which we're going to create and this is called countdown execution so inside of this function we're going to run the code over and over again by using an interval uh and we're using this selected because we need need uh this to be Global hopefully that makes sense if you know about global and local functions uh or variables sorry uh the scope of variables then this will make sense um so inside uh the countdown execution um or rather outside first of all we want to set the current value so the current value that we're starting the counter at and this is settings and from so we're starting at for example 10 then inside countdown execution we want to reduce this value by one each time so current is equal to current minus one quite simple uh what we then want to do is place the place the current value inside um this selected so this will equal this because we're using it in the function I.E this countown div um so we want to go ahead and say this underscore selected remember we're using this outside of here cuz it's now global um do text current so now at the moment because we just have this function here we're not actually calling the function at all but if we go ahead and call countdown execution and refresh you can see that 10 is been put into this div so that's worked but we actually want to run this every 1 second because we want the value to increase by one every one second so we create an interval and we call this or or we create an interval using set interval and we call this interval so interval equals set interval inside here we give the function name without the uh without the parentheses so countdown XC and then 1,000 for 1,000 milliseconds I.E every second so every second this function here is going to be run using this here uh and then we are reducing the value by one every time and placing it inside this selected which is this which is this countdown div so quite a sort of complicated to explain but now when we run it you can see that the value uh comes down every time now the only problem we have here is that we don't have a way to stop this so you'll see that when once it gets to zero it will go into minus one 2 minus 3 blah blah blah so what we want is a check inside of this function to check when it equals zero so we say if current is equal to zero then the first thing we want to do is stop the execution of this interval so we want to uh clear the interval so we say clear interval and then we specify the name of the interval and we gave the interval name as just interval so we type in interval and then after this we want to send the Callback uh function ready if you like now I'll write this and then I'll explain what we're doing callback do call this so essentially what this means is this callback here is our callback function and we've said callback do call so we've sent a call back to this uh this here and then we've provided just this inside so now callback is obviously a parameter in here so we can go and Define it so we've created our callback function as we would with any other jQuery um any other jQuery function if you like or Plugin or or set of uh tools and now inside of here we can like alert done and because when it's got to zero we clear the interval CU obviously we don't need the countdown to continue then we send the call back um you know as this so we send the call back as sort of done if you like which is our callback thing here which is we've sort of supplied in here and then we alert out done so let's go ahead and refresh nearly 100 100 there so as it counts down we obviously take a look at this code and uh you know it's counting down as we specified but when it gets to zero uh we send the call back and then we execute the block of code that we specified as our callback function here so I.E like I showed in the beginning we could say window uh location equals something. co.uk or blah blah blah a web address so we've taken a look at how we can obviously Supply a plugin with uh parameters or or options or settings whatever you'd like to call them uh as we've seen in other tutorials however we've now looked at creating a callback function and using callback do call callback being the name here do call uh and sending the fact that or or sending this um as itself essentially so we know when this has completed uh and then when it has completed we execute everything within the Callback function block so that's how we create callback functions in our jQuery plugins
