we can use the filled space option for this so essentially what we want to do is go ahead and wrap this content if that we've already created in another div and I'm gonna call this main we're done and that div there and let's just go ahead and indent this content here now inside star dot CSS I want to go ahead and style this main here so main and what I'm gonna do is give it a height of 300 pixels now you'll see that nothing's changed it hasn't filled to that particular space so inside you ijs we can specify a couple of one option and that is fill space and if we set that to true by default it's set to false that will fill a particular space so you can see that now with 300 pixels down and this has filled the space that we require okay so now let's go ahead and look at things like changing these icons here now you can either provide a custom set of icons which I'm not going to go ahead and and go through because it's too much CSS to probably include in the tutorial however we're going to use a predefined set of icons and change these dropdown little icons here so I'm just going to go ahead and show you how to do that I'm gonna come and separate this and come down just so we've got enough room I'm going to specify the icons option now inside some more curly brackets I'm gonna go ahead and specify another two options the first one being header and the second one what we'll do the head of first we're gonna set an icon for the header and that's going to be UI plus icon for sorry UI icon plus so now what's happened is when we refresh you can see that the ones that aren't open have a plus symbol here you can go ahead then and comma separate inside of these curly brackets and say set the for example header selected option and we can set this to something like UI icon instead so now when we refresh we have plus and minus icons so you can go ahead and set these to your own defined icons as well okay so lastly we're just going to take look at the event which is an option itself it's not a collection of events but this option will actually specify when the accordion opens so when these particular panels actually open so at the moment it's when we click on a particular header that's all handled for us however we might want to go ahead and change the event to mouseover for example now what this will do is with when we roll over an option without actually clicking on it each description area or div area actually opens as we roll over this header area at the top now we're going to take a look at the collapsible option now let's just go ahead and change this event or delete this event option so we have the clickable option set okay so what happens now if we want to say closed portfolio when I click on portfolio I can't actually close it so or there always has to be one div area open at a time so inside here we can set the collapsible option to true and let's just spell it right collapsible okay so you can set the collapsible option to true and what this means is that we can actually collapse all of them so they can all be closed otherwise you're gonna always have one open so this might be useful for for example when you enter a website let's just say it is a personal say web developers web site you might just want to leave these open these options closed before you allow your users to actually go ahead and immediately click on a on an option so if you were what if you wanted to say let's just refresh the page you can see that the first header and content has automatically opened then we can go ahead and open subsequent headers and content areas however if you wanted to say enter the website and they all to be automatically closed you would have to go and define an option inside of here and that is the active option now what you can do with the active option is either define a particular a particular header and content area that you want to be open for example if we were to set active to when we refresh the page this automatically opens this one remember we start at 0 1 and then 2 so 0 would be the first one which is automatically set by default then you would have one active one would open this second one and then we've already taken a look at the last one so by setting active to zero we don't disable it so what we need to do is specify it false and what this will do is it will deactivate all of the open elements so now a user can enter the website have all of them closed and choose which one they want to click so this is extremely useful for functionality issues if you wanted to click keep all these areas closed so I think we've taken a look enough at this accordion widget in the jQuery UI it's an extremely powerful and easy to implement tool in order for you to have these content areas which expand when clicked
