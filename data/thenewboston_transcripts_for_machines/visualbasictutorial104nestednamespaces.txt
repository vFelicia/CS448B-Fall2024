hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about nested namespaces now just like a whole bunch of stuff inside of Visual Basic you can nest namespaces so let's go ahead and get rid of this code that we have already added so we will delete our person and if you have no clue what this code is then you might want to go ahead and move back a couple of tutorials see what we're doing okay so what we can do is come up here and we can just create another namespace to nest people other people and friends inside of it so we'll just go ahead and type namespace all people and then we can go ahead and end that with an end namespace so you can see that we have they have sex all people and then we have two namespaces nested inside of it so this is a better way of organizing your types inside of Visual Basic but there's also another way of nesting namespaces that I will go into in the next tutorial is a little bit better than this but I figured I should teach you guys this anyway because it's always good to know if you need it so we'll go ahead and come back over here to form one BB and we'll go ahead and create an object so we'll type private friend or here my friend or here let's do my new friend as new things here that we're gonna have to specify the namespace all people so all people dot friends dot people so now we have access to all the stuff that is inside of people inside of our friends namespace so we can access the properties first name last name and years friends so let's just go ahead and send the year's friends okay so we'll go ahead and come back here to our forum one maybe maybe didn't know what I just did there I added was the the integer years friends the two string to the override to string function so it will give us back the first name last name and years friends so let's just go ahead and add another text box here so come down here and select text box and we will add another label and we will say years being friends okay so now let's come over here to our four Mondavi B now what we want to do is we want to select set the properties of my new friend whenever the button one is clicked so my new friend first name equals text first name dot text and then my new friend dot last name equals text last name dot text and they'll do that one more time for the years friend so dot year's friends equals and what we're gonna need to do is we're going to need to convert this to a an integer because you can see that under our years friends property it's an integer type so we're gonna do is we'll come over here back to four Mondavi beam will type c type and for our first argument is going to be the object so we're going to use over here textbox one dot text and we want to convert that to an integer and then textbox 1 dot dot text is this right here because we didn't actually rename it so let's go ahead and run this and see what happens so we can add the first name Jim Harris and years being friends as I say we've known each other for 23 years click show person and we forgot to show the person so let's come back here and we will type message box my new friend dot two string and we'll go ahead and run this and once again we'll type Jim Harris and 23 years being friends and what we show the person we at Jim Harris 23 so go ahead and practice nesting namespaces you can nest as many as you want but what you want to keep in mind is that you need to keep your code simple and easy to read so that lets say some other developer looks at your code they should be able to figure out what's going on without having to read through object and try to understand it themselves so don't be nesting native spaces all over the place and make it really confusing but just go ahead and practice nesting some namespaces and once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
