what is going on everybody my name is bucky roberts and welcome to your very first c plus plus tutorial now my guess is that if you're watching this video you probably already have a basic understanding of what c plus plus is but for those of you guys who don't c plus is a computer programming language it's how you make computer programs computer games so if you're interested in making any of those then congratulations you're in the right spot so before you just start opening any program and trying to write c plus code i want to let you guys know that you need to download and install a few programs first now good news all these programs are entirely free but before we just go ahead and start installing them let me tell you guys what they are and what they do the first program that you're going to need is called an i d e this is pretty much the program that allows us to write the code and run it aside from that we need something called a compiler now a compiler is basically the thing that translates the code that something that computer programs can understand to something computers can understand so we're going to be typing code and it's going to be easy for us to read and understand what's going on but in order to transfer it to or excuse me translate it to a bunch of ones and zeroes that the computer can understand we need that compiler so that being said a lot of people download these separately they download ide and then they download a compiler but what i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be showing you guys a program that is going to allow you to download and install it all in one big shebang so let's go ahead and open google and like i said don't worry about paying for anything because this program is entirely free so anyways like i said go ahead and open google and type in code blocks and go ahead and press enter now the first link that's going to pop up is probably going to be for codeblocks dot org so go ahead and click that and this is the program that we're going to be downloading so of course we need to find the download link you can either click on this one on the left or this one on top doesn't matter go ahead and click on one of those and we see a couple options here download the binary release download the source code or retrieve source code from svn we're going to want to download the binary release it's the easiest and most simple way to download this program code blocks so go ahead and click download binary release and check it out it gives us all these options now depending on what platform you're running most of you guys are probably running windows you're going to want to choose one of these options but for those of you running linux and they also have a mac version down here you might want to choose these but for most of us we're going to be running this on a windows machine so you're saying all right now we haven't narrowed down to two choices codeblocks 1005 setup or codeblocks 1005 mingw setup what we want to do is we want to download this second one the one that says min gw now this version 1005 may be different depending on when you're watching this tutorial and if they updated code blocks but make sure you get the one that says mingw the first one is the ide the second one mmingw that mingw means the compiler too so when we download this it's going to give us the ide and remember that's where we write the code at the compiler as well and remember the compiler is the program we need so the computer can understand what we're doing so go ahead and you can either download it from barely os or so excuse me sourceforge um i already have it downloaded so i'm not going to click this but oh excuse me i guess i'm flaming my throat i just drank fruitista freeze from taco bell and i ate a taco and that is not a good idea because they should call these things brain freezes brain freezies because that's all it does to you just freezes your brain in your throat and and it puts a bunch of phlegm in your throat but i can't stop drinking it it's addicting so anyways go ahead and click this link from sourceforge.net and go ahead and save the file and whenever you save it and open it a wizard's gonna pop up and you just have to click next like 80 different times and then you have code blocks installed so i already installed it so i'm not going to walk you guys through how to do that because it's really simple and i'm not going to act like you guys are dumb and you don't know how to install things on your computer so anyways once you have it installed you have this program called code blocks right here now you probably have it on your all programs you might have it under code blocks what i like to do is right click it and just send it to desktop and what that's going to do is it's going to give you a nice little icon on your desktop but anyways once you have it installed just go ahead and double click it and we're going to run a really simple program just to make sure it's working correctly so go ahead it gives you these tips close them out what we're going to want to do is create a new project and you can either do that by creating this new project right here but what i like to do is i like to go up to the file menu and click new project now it's going to give you a list of a bunch of different projects you're going to want to create what we're going to want to choose is console application this is where you're going to be choosing most of the time this pretty much means a basic program for the computer so just go ahead and select this and press go and make sure you're working in c plus plus c is a totally different language we don't want that so c plus plus go ahead and click next and now name your project anything you want i'm going to name mine youtube why not and you can save it wherever you want i might as well just save mine right on desktop it looks good but it really doesn't matter where you save it or even what your name your project just name it something that's easy to remember so go ahead and give your project title go ahead and click next and make sure you're using the gnu gcc compiler basically everything should be set up by default make sure your settings look the same as mine as long as you didn't hit anything by accident you should be good to go so go ahead and click finish and you see that nothing pops up by default you're saying all right i thought we just created something so how do we see what we just created actually if you click this little plus sign next to sources it shows you that all the files it created for you automatically so go ahead and double click this main cpp and it shows you or in other words it brings up the file that it created automatically so this is actually the core basics of a very simple c plus plus program we don't understand what anything means right now but trust me it's a very simple computer program that the only thing it does is it prints out hello world on the screen so to make sure that everything is set up and running smoothly let's go ahead and we need to do something called build and run this now i'm going to be talking about this later but for now i just want to make sure that your computer is set up you installed it and downloaded it properly so go ahead and click this build and run icon right here it's with the little gear and the little green triangle so go ahead and click that and it should you know maybe flash a couple boxes but basically a box should pop up that says hello world and this is all that that program is basically it prints out hello world on your screen so if you build and run this and you get hello world it means that you downloaded it installed it and set up your project successfully so we are good to go so again i know you guys don't know what any of this means or even know how to code one line of code yet but i'm gonna be going over that in the future tutorials but for now that's all i have for you guys so thank you very much for watching don't forget to subscribe and i'll see you next tutorial
