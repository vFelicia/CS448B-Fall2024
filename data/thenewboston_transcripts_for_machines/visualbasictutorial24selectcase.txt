hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the select case statement now the select case statement is very similar to the if statement but sometimes you need to use a select case instead of if because it's a lot more efficient and I'll explain this to you as we start programming so let's go ahead and get started we're going to create a variable and we'll call it my int and we're just going to make it an integer it's now what we're going to do is we're going to get the integer from the user so let's just ask them for an integer please enter an integer now I'm just going to get what they type in and now what we're going to do is we're going to create our select select case statement so we're going to start off by typing select and it says runs one of several groups of statements depending on the value of an expression so after select we're going to type case and it says the same thing and now what we're going to do is we're going to type in our variable that we're going to use for the select case statement so in our case we're going to use my int and you can see when you press enter it automatically adds in select for you so what a select case statement does is that it starts off by checking the first case so let's just do case zero console. right line hello and we'll do case one and you can see there that whenever you create a case you're going to start by using the keyword case and you're going to add whichever whatever you want it to be so in our case we're using an integer so if the integer is equal to zero then go ahead and do this and you can do this with a string so if a string is equal to uh this right here then go ahead and do whatever is in here now as I was saying uh I kind of interrupted myself there but with a select case statement the reason it's more efficient than an if statement is that it'll go through and let's start the select case statement and if case Zero is true then it's going to go ahead and in the select case statement for you it's not even going to take a look at any other cases you have so you could have hundreds and hundreds of cases but as soon as it reaches the the one case it's looking for it'll exit your select case statement now if you use if and else if then is going to even though it won't execute the code it's going to look at all of your else ifs and that's one of the reasons you would want to use select case over if else if so we'll just do case one we'll add a couple more cases here okay so now that we have three cases we're going to go ahead and run our program now let's not forget to do console. readline so it wa for us to input something before the program closes and if we run this it'll say please enter an integer so if we type zero it's going to say hello and we'll run this a couple more times and go through each case if we type one it'll say buy and then if we type two it'll say good morning so a select case statement is fairly simple it's quite similar to the if else if and um once you have that down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and we're going to be learning more about select case and thanks for watching
