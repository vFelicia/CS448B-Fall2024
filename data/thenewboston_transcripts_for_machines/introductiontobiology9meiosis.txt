welcome back everyone my name is Sarah and in this video I'm going to be covering meiosis meiosis is also known as reduction division this means the cell is going to go from diploid or two sets of chromosomes to hpid or only one set of chromosomes this is going to occur in the sex cells which are also known as gametes and unlike mitosis there are two nuclear divisions instead of just one you've got meiosis one which is the reduction phase and is 2 is the division phase during prophase one chromatin is going to coil to form visible chromosomes the nucleolus and nuclear membrane disappear homologous chromosomes pair up forming what is called a tetrad and these tetrads can wrap or synapse and something called my excuse me crossing over may occur spindle fibers are going to appear and if the cell has centrom these centrom are going to migrate two opposite ends of the cell here in my little drawing you can see that the nuclear membrane is disappearing you've got two chromosomes consisting of two chromatids so you've got four chromatids total and then during crossing over you got your two chromosomes here sometimes some of these chromatids can switch over they're actually going to break off of one and attach themselves to the same location on the other chromosome this is what is called a kada so you got one chromatid with part of another chromatid on it and then one regular chromatid in each chromosome during metaphase one the tetrads are going to move to the center of the cell and spinder F spindle fibers are going to attached to centimeters of each homologous pair you can see here you got both chromosomes here and in the middle of the cell and all the spindle fibers are attached during anaphase one each chromosome which consists of two chromatids is pulled away from its homolog but unlike mitosis in anaphase sister chromatids are going to remain attached to each other and you can see in the drawing you got each chromosome being pulled apart each chome consisting of the two chromatids and during telophase one chromosomes are going to consist of two sister chromatids but only one chromosome from each of the original pairs is on either side of the cell after telophase one sometimes cells go through a phase called interkinesis this may or may not happen but if it does there are going to be two haid nuclei that are going to be present and the chromosomes are going to uncoil but this this is a very very short phase during prophase 2 the chromosomes and spindle fibers are going to reappear and if the cell has centrioles they're going to migrate to either side of the cell during metaphase 2 spinal fibers are going to form and attach and the chromosomes are going to migrate to the center so unlike metaphase 1 where both homologous chromosomes were paired together everything is just going to line up in the center on its own during anaphase 2 each individual chromatid is going to be pulled to an opposite side of the cell so they're going to be four chromatids each from one side of one pair of the homologous chromosome so you got chromatid from each chromosome and finally during telophase 2 four haid nuclea are going to be formed each one having one of the original chromatids and then cyto canis is going to form four individual ha
