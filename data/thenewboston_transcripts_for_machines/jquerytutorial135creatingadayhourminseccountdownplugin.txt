so using settings and date we can now grab the date that the users passed so now that the options are out the way we want to go ahead and actually create or outline the function that we're going to be running every second which I'm going to call count execution so function count execution and this will be our function that essentially takes the day and makes a calculation from it and works out everything basically in places that inside of the div so this is going to run every one second and because we want it to run every one second down here a bit later on we're going to be creating an interval so what I want to do is just before I do anything here is go ahead and take the this selector and apply it into its own variable so I can use it globally so I'm gonna say var this underscore cell or just get rid of that they're equals this so that's basically my this selector remember later on we're going to need to change this dot days dot hours dot means dot seconds for for each value and what we're going to do inside of this function which we're just going to go ahead and execute down here is we're going to convert the date that we've supplied as a string into a timestamp so I'm gonna set a variable called event date and this is going to be equal to date pass and in here I just want to supply the string which remember is settings date now I want to divide this by a thousand and the reason for this is that it will give us in milliseconds and we don't want it in milliseconds we just want it in seconds by all means if you're creating a counter with milliseconds then this would be fine but in this example we're using the seconds so what I want to do is now go ahead and let's just go and alert the house so let's yeah that's just inside of this function alert out event date so we'll see what's been done with our string that's been passed you can see that it's been converted into a timestamp okay so now that we have the timestamp we can go ahead and grab the current date so I'm going to create a new variable called current date and this is going to be equal to jQuery or sorry we can use dollar sign now and what we want to do is that would be with brackets because it's a function divide that by a thousand as well because this will return in milliseconds and we don't want it in milliseconds we want it in in seconds but we want to floor this value so I'm gonna go ahead and say math.floor and that will just floor this value so it will round it to the nearest whole integer so let's go ahead and alert event date and then a space and then current date so we'll see that these two values will differ we've got the event date here and then the current day here now to work out the amount of seconds between the two of them we want to go ahead and create a new variable called seconds and that's going to be obviously the event date so the event date that we've specified the current date so this will be sorry not with brackets so this will be the amount of seconds between the current time and the date that we've specified in the settings so pretty simple we now need to go ahead and work out the days and hours and minutes but for each time we do this we need to make sure that the other values will update so for example when seconds gets to zero and then starts counting from 59 we want to make sure sorry No so if days is say one day we hit we you know countdown our hours then we need days to change and if the same with minutes if we if minutes gets down to zero we want hours to change if seconds gets down to we want minutes to change so we need all these values to be updating it's all well and good grabbing the seconds and you know making the calculations but we need to actually make sure that each each time each value updates so let's go ahead and do days first let's say days is equal to and I'm just gonna pull this over I will write out first we essentially want to take the seconds and and divide it by 60 times 60 times 24 in order to gain the amount of days we have so that will give us it's just really standard programming knowledge and we're gonna floor this value as well so I'm going to say math.floor and inside here we want to take the seconds and we want to divide it by 60 times 60 times 24 so now days represents the I will just line all these up days now represents the amount of days from the second okay so we'll go ahead and just alert out days and you can see that let's just refresh you can see we've got one and the date that we actually specified in here is 10th of August today it's the 8th of August and I've specified this at 12 p.m. so it is in fact one day and then it will be something hours so we now know that this works properly if I was to go ahead and change this to say the 15th of August when we refresh you can see we've got six days until the 15th because it's the 8th today and then we'll add on a few hours for that so we know that the day's works now however what we want to go ahead and do is specify the hours and minutes but we need to make a calculation bit of the seconds before we calculate these
