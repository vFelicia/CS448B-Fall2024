hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to take a look at the widget in jQuery UI which is the accordion now the accordion will open and shut a particular element depending on obviously where you place them we're going to look at a few options that we can use to change the functionality of this however this is more or less how it works so you have a header area which you click to activate a main content area now by default we have a few problems with the accordion that you might like to change so we're going to have things like resizing issues and we might like to change the icons as well as well as a couple of on mouseover events or events that we do that happen with our mouse so for example at the moment I have this set to click so when I click on an element or header it shows the content but we might want to say roll over and show content so we're only going to be looking at a few options and we're not going to be taking a look at event in this case again this will just get you started with the overall concept so the first thing we want to do is we want to go ahead and actually create this area that we're going to put the content into so the first thing we need to do is create an overall div and we need to give this a name and I'm going to call this let's just say content and inside here we're going to need to supply a few things the first of which is a header and we're going to create a link inside of this header and the location of the links just hash because it won't actually go to a different page and inside of this link it will be the title so for example about me now directly underneath this header we're going to create an area with the content that is displayed once this header is clicked so so that should be div the div here is going to be the area that whatever is displayed so inside of here let's just say a little about me okay so now let's take a look at that you can see that that's just a header here with a link and then some content so not really much at the moment we can go ahead and create two more of these just to get a good demonstration of how this works so we create another link portfolio for example with a link as a hash and inside here so this is my portfolio and then the we don't really need an ID for that and then the last one header three and a link inside of here again so it's interesting that these could be perhaps generated from a database table as long as you keep this structure it doesn't matter once you apply the accordion widget to this it will actually pick up on all of these values so these values can come from absolutely anywhere they don't need to be static so it could be for example a settings menu in a user interface there's a wide variety of options so now the last one I'm just going to do is contact and then inside a div with no ID my contact contact details okay so let's go ahead and preview that make sure everything's there yet we've got the three headers and the three content areas now we need to go ahead and actually set up the accordion now this is extremely simple in its purest form however we're going to look at three different options we can customize this with so the first thing that we need is obviously jQuery then the jQuery UI j/s file and we have UI j s which we're going to be working in here to create the accordion and then change some of the options we also need this stylesheet here which is found with a package when you download jQuery UI I do have a video on downloading that so we need to reference this content div and turn it into an accordion so it's extremely extremely simple we just go over to UI and we use a selector to select the content area and we just write accordion so we're applying this widget to this content here and what this will automatically do is pick up on all of the properties or the the elements we've given it so the headers and the content and when we refresh that's turned that into an accordion so it's an extremely easy way to implement this into your website now the one thing that we have at the moment is we have varying space inside of our content area and this has this has only taken up as much space as it needs so for example inside a little about me if we were to say I am a web developer a break after that you can see that this is now smaller than this area here well it's not that if you would have say more content down here you would have a lot more so for example we can break down just again and more so when we refresh we've got a larger area here than we do have with the others so what in actual fact we don't know anyway okay so we'll go from the basis that we want all of these to be the same size down the page and we want to keep a maximum size to it
