now let's go back to our php.ini file and have a look we've got error reporting currently set to eat all so we are reporting errors back to ourself um as we're developing now what happens if I want to report errors um strict errors for example well this doesn't include e strict so what I can do is I can specify to say and eore strict now what this is going to is this going to incorporate strict errors so what we're talking about is code that will might run but uh well let's have a look at the definition it might run but it um it's it's uh runtime notices enable PHP suggests changes to your code which will ensure the best um interoperability and forward compatibility of your code so it's basically giving you messages about your code itself rather than errors that you might be coming across so you don't need to include this but maybe it's a good idea if you want that kind of error reporting uh to show however we've used this Amber sand here but what we can do is we can say let's say e all and use this symbol to say um well we can say amber sand as well we can say not including e something else so we could say not including e notice I've just noticed as well this this example is actually written up here um so yeah I wasn't looking at it but coincidence so uh error reporting e or an e notice so what you could do is you could specify it like this which will show all errors except for notices and coding standard warnings um so it's not going to show uh coding it's not going to show notices and the coding standards warning is the estrict part of it so remember eel doesn't show e strict now if you wanted to show um um code standard warning so uh coding standard warning sorry you could just do this so you've got e strict here so it's up to you what level of output you want you can mess around with this and once you've got your application maybe built a bit bigger you can turn this on have a look I mean and keep it on anyway but um it's a good idea to fiddle around and see what you can come out with on this uh especially if you're getting a blank page you can change this to say just e or so when you finish developing um on your web server you should probably always turn this off um why the reason being is that if errors do occur on your page especially estrict notices you don't want your viewers to or your visitors on your website to be seeing estrict notices nor do you want them to see errors if you've maybe um trying to include a file somewhere for example if you're trying to include a file somewhere and it can't be found and you're returning an error what's happening is then there understanding the structure of your website so for security reasons it's probably best to turn error report to zero either on your local or web server when you release this to the public so you if you would say have paid Ser paid hosting um you might not be able to get access to php.ini however you can use a couple of functions to change values and that's what I'm going to go over uh just now so what happens if we want to D dynamically update this value inside PHP now let's close php.ini and we'll have a look um inside here so what we can actually do is um let's get rid of the outside content as well what we can actually do is we can specify error reporting either like this so we can say error reporting zero um I don't think it's working on my installation at the moment yeah uh let's just get rid of that see what happens yeah okay so error reporting zero um you can then change it to say e all um and then refresh the page and you can see oh no we're not getting that back maybe we could no okay so it's not working on my my installation just yet however you can use error reporting um maybe on like a public server you can also use things like um in I set is a great function to up update values in your php. inii so we can say p uh ini set error reporting e all so then I don't think this is going to work either for my installation no but um the idea of this is that you are dynamically setting your inii file or you're just using the error reporting function on its own um to uh change these values I think with the in I set you don't need to include these so it's just like that um regardless of whether it still works on mine no it doesn't so that's a bit about error reporting and how you can um produce either produce errors or hide errors from either yourself or the public and um a bit of information about why you should turn it off um as well as some examples of setting this up um on the Fly
