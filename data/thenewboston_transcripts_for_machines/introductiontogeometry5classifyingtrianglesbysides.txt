okay so we're gonna start out by talking about classifying triangles by sides so the first type of triangle you can have is called an equilateral triangle and it has three congruent sides and if you remember congruent just means they have equal measures so we mark by congruent sides by putting little tick marks on each side so these tick marks to show that all three sides are congruent because you can't you can't just go off what they look like like you can't just say they look equal so it's an equilateral triangle you have to actually measure them or be told that the sides are equal so the next kind of triangle we have is an isosceles triangle and it has it's a triangle that has at least two congruent sides so for this particular triangle this side and this side are equal and this side is just a different length and the last kind of triangle you can have is a scalene triangle and it is a triangle with no congruent sides so we mark this by putting a tick mark and then two tick marks and then three tick marks because none of the sides are equal so now we're gonna do an example using the rules we just learned okay so we have these three triangles and we're told that a B which is this big side right here is equal to seven the length of BC is equal to five and the length of CD is equal to six and they've already marked on here which sides are congruent so using this information we're going to fill in their lengths of the rest of the sides so since we know that BC is five and it's congruent with segment II D and D are congruent and we know that because each is marked with one tick mark we can say that the length of AD is also equal to five so we're going to fill that in now we're told that CD is equal to six and we know that CD and B D and B E right here are all congruent because each is marked with two tick marks and since we know that CD is six we know that BD also has to be six and B e has to be six so we can mark those on here and we know that the length of a B this long one is seven and since a B is congruent to this whole segment ad we know that ad also has C equals seven so now that we know how to classify triangles by sides make sure you watch our next video where we're gonna talk about classing classifying triangles by angles
