what is going on guys welcome to your let's see what tutorial it is n9th I think it's our ninth physics tutorial and in this tutorial now that we know the importance and how we understand the need for sig figs we can go ahead and start using them in our scientific notation problem so what I did is I went and grabbed a couple problems from tutorial 5 and tutorial six and back then whenever we were working with scientific notation we didn't know about significant figures and by the way I don't know if I mentioned this but sometimes I call significant figures sigfigs just because it sounds cool so anyways now that we know about Sig fix we can go ahead and solve these problems again and we're going to solve them correctly this time so what we need to do is go ahead and solve these problems again so 6.71 * 10 3 * 2.3 * 10 5th power = 6.71 * 2.3 times and I might skip a couple steps here 10 to the 3 + 5 which is eight so basically what we have is 15.4 33 time 10 to 8th so in our last tutorial or not our last tutorial tutorial number five I think it was our final answer was 1 5 433 * 10 to the 9th power now you're saying all right that answer looks pretty correct to me but we need to consider the rules of sigfigs so in order to do that when working with scientific notation we need to look at how many digits are in the least accurate number or coefficient as they're properly called the coefficient is the number that's not the one with exponent so basically what we're going to be doing is saying all right this number has one 2 3 and this number has one two so remember in the last tutorial when I was talking about how our scales had different accuracies well pretend that we're measuring these with scales right here this scale would only go to the tenth place and I just changed my color to red and my text is red this scale only goes to the tth and this scale goes to the hundreds so basically we can only use an answer that goes to the tth so basically our correct answer would be 1.5 and I got 1.5 from rounding 1.54 times 10 to the 9th and again the reason for that is because we can't just go ahead and include these numbers because we don't know for a fact that this is 2.30 so we can't claim to have more information than you know we just can't make up information like that because our equipment wasn't that accurate whenever we got this data right there so let me go ahead and give you guys one more example and I need to change my color again so actually let me go ahead and get out my piece of paper right here for my tutorial make sure I'm working with the right PR so 7.62 yeah that's going to pop up and by the way I think whenever I make uh my YouTube videos they always try to let me see if I can get it it won't even do it now but they always put the thumbnail as whatever I'm whenever that box pops up and it's really annoying because like uh it looks like I'm making a mistake on all my videos which I kind of am but do you guys know what I'm talking about when well never mind again I'm just rambling I'll stop doing that so let's go ahead and solve this problem I'll shut up 7.62 again we're dividing so we have to put divide by 2.1 and then we go ahead and multiply that by 10 to the 3/ by 10 to the 5th so let's go ahead and solve both sides of these equations 7.62 / 2.1 = 3 6 29 and we need to go ahead and multiply that and I'm just going to go ahead and skip a step here 3 5 = 2 so that's 10 to 2 so we go ahead and basically in our sixth physics tutorial we said that this was the final answer right there however now that we know about significant figures let's go ahead and take a look at this data up here this one only goes to the tenth of one place and this one goes to the 100th so basically our answer can only go to the 10th because that's our least accurate piece of information right there so what we need to do is we need to round this answer to the nearest 10th so 3.6 * 10 to the2 is our correct answer that's what we should have had because again like I said this data right here we don't know for certain how accurate that is we only have the equipment to measure to the temp so that's what our answer should be right here so now that you know the importance of significant figures and also basically saw those examples in real life examples saw those examples in real life examples what the heck am I talking about well anyways now that we saw that in practice we can begin to move on to something else however there are a couple different rules that I think I better tell you guys before you know jump into math and physics and atoms and electricity and stuff like that so definitely check out the next tutorial and um if you guys have any questions about sigfigs or physics at all I should probably mention this in last couple tutorials make sure to check out my Forum at the new boston.com forum and you can ask me questions there and I will be happy to answer them for you guys so anyways thank you guys for watching and uh don't forget to subscribe and I will see you in the next stor
