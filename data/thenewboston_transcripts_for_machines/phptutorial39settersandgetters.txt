all right guys welcome to your 39th PHP tutorial and in the last tutorial we covered scope the difference between private and public variables and functions and even though we covered how to access private variables from within a class using a public function we're going to be covering that again and we're also going to be covering how to change those variables and you might be able to figure it out if you just sit down and think about it but since this is such a huge part of working with private variables inside classes I'm going to be covering it in detail in the tutorial so you probably don't want to skip this one so let's go ahead and create a class right now and name it beef because you know can't use tuna all the time and let's go ahead and we just need one private variable and definitely spelled that wrong private yep come on I'll get it eventually private in call like cows name name uh let's go ahead and make that one variable and now since this is a private variable we can't access it in any way from outside this little class right here so we can't set cow's name equal to Bucky out here and we can't say all right Echo cow's name out here either we have to do all of our inner workings in here so since we don't want this variable to be useless and we actually want to be able to change it and and retrieve it from outside our class we need to build two special functions and these functions in I'm not making these up these are called Setter and getter functions let me go ahead and Setter and we'll build our getter down here now for every computer programming language where there are private variables this is a something so you know I just want to let you guys know that I'm not just making this up this isn't a cool nickname I I came up with Setter functions take a private variable and allow you to change them for example they can take cow's name and set equal to Bucky take cow's name set equal to Lisa it sets a private variable getter functions take a private variable and retrieve it so it would allow you to Echo Bucky from out here or Echo the name Lisa from out here so anyways it pretty much turns a private variable into a public variable by by using functions that give it that functionality so enough of me talking let's go ahead and start coding some stuff so in order to do this just like the last torial you need to make a public function because if you made it made it private we'd have the same problem we can only access it in here what we want to do is take something that's private to here and make it accessible to the rest of our program so that's why we need a public function and just name this set cows name you can name anything you want nothing special and just just go ahead and Ray X actually um what was it going to say like the uh not the standards but the convention is to write set and then in cam casing which means capitalize every first word um that's the conventions of what pretty much everyone uses so anyways now that I covered all the conventional crap we can begin program so anyways what we're going to be doing is passing in a variable called X and this X will hold a name like Bucky Lisa Tony and it'll set the variable equal to that name so let's go ahead and in order to access any variable from inside the class you of course use this and what variable do we want to use cow's name and let's go ahead and set that equal to variable X just like that so anyways whenever we call this function and we pass in a name now this variable a private variable is going to be equal to that name and again we can call this function from outside this class so that is why we need this Setter function now let me just tighten this up a bit that's what she said and let's go ahead and build our getter function now and public wow did you just see what I did there I like spelled every other word wrong every other letter I mean so public and function and now the getter is get cows name easy enough and check this out we don't need any parameter for this since we're not passing in any new information we're just getting the variable itself so what we need to do is return I should take a type in class all right and now let's go ahead and this I I forgot if I had a copy still this cow's name so anyways what this function does right here is changes this variable to whatever you want to change to and what this function does right here is pretty much returns whatever variable you ask or pretty much gives you a private variable but since it's in a public function and remember anything that's public we can use outside this class we're going to be able to use it in the rest of our program so anyways if you don't believe me let's go ahead and uh approve it to you guys right now so the first thing we need to do to use anything in this class whether it be public or private is create an object so that's cow object it doesn't have to be cow object I just you know that was a neat name so equals new beef with no parameters so let's go ahead and it would probably be a good idea to let's go ahead and Echo the name right now just so I can show you that it's not blink probably a good idea but you know it's not a good idea putting Gatorade in your humidifier cuz you know you might be thinking H maybe I'll kill two birds with one stone I will quench my thirst and I'll also humidify my room but that is actually not a good idea and yes I'm talking from personal experience here so anyways let's go ahead and Echo the cow object and let's just go ahead and use that method and what was that called me just copy this I'm way too lazy to type this stuff out I got stuff to do today all right get cow's name so what this is going to do is it's not going to give you that fatal error from last time since this is actually a valid code just cow's name is not equal to anything right now so this is going to Echo out nothing at all it's just going to do nothing so now what we want to do is we actually want to change this cow's name to set it equal to something so let's go ahead and yeah again not typing all this crap out so now what we want to do is we want to use our Setter function so set what make sure I don't type anything wrong set cow's name and what do we want to set this equal to let's set it equal to like uh Sarah so what this is going to do is it's first going to retrieve the name and Echo it out it's not equal to anything yet so it's going to Echo out nothing now we're going to give it a name right here so after this when we Echo it it's going to Echo out Sara that's what this line of code is going to do so now let's go ahead and change this game this uh cow's name Sarah but it had a little sex change and now it name is Dan Henderson hm didn't know that was possible but guess what it is so now let's go ahead and copy this and Echo it out one more time so before I run this program and uh first let me check for typos make sure I didn't write get Crow's name or anything like that and uh got on my semicolons everything looks good so anyways what this program is going to do is this it's going to create a new object which pretty much which gives us access to this class right here and after that it's going to say all right Echo out the name of the cow well he doesn't have a name yet so nothing's going to happen and then it's going to say all right let's give you a name Cal your name is Sarah and then let's go ahead and Echo that out so we can see it and then we say all right now your name is Dan Henderson and now let's go ahead and Echo that out so we can see that and we did this through the use of Setter and getter functions and whenever we needed set the name or change the name what we did is we made a public function to access a private variable and we pretty much passed in you know Sarah or Dan Henderson is X and it changed this private variable to X and whenever we wanted to get that name or retrieve it so we could Echo it out what we did is we just said all right return a variable from this class and may it be cow's name so yada yada you know the stuff you should know so let me make sure I save that uh refresh and move it over yes and check it out at first it echoes out nothing it does nothing so that's why it starts at beginning and then it echoes out Sarah and then Dan Henderson so check this out pretty cool pretty Flawless we didn't get any errors at all so again one last time I want to recap whenever you want to use a private variable you have to use public functions in order to use it from outside that class so anyways that's what I wanted to say in this tutorial so thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to subscribe and if you have any questions just ask me on my forum and if I don't answer for you someone will answer for you so thank you for watching and uh well I'll see you guys next St
