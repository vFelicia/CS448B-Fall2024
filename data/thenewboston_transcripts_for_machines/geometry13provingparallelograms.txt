okay so today we're going to talk about um how to prove a parallelogram really is a parallelogram so there's five ways we can do that we can show that both pairs of opposite sides are parallel we can show that both pairs of opposite sides are congruent we can show that one pair of opposite sides are parallel and congruent we can show both pairs of opposite angles are congruent or we can show that diagonals BCT each other because each one of those things is a property of a parallelogram so if we can prove any one of these things we can say therefore this shape is a parallelogram so unlike triangle proofs we don't have a we don't have like an as a or a side angle side instead we're just going to have to write out this that since both pairs of opposite sides are parallel this is a triangle or if both pairs of opposite sides are parallel the shape is a parallelogram so now let's do some examples okay so given that d a d which which is this line right here is parallel to CB and that d c a is congruent to b a c prove that AB b c d is a parallelogram okay so first we're going to write down the given information so a d is parallel to CB and angle d c a is congruent to angle b a c and our reason is that that's given to us so one thing I want you to notice is that since these two lines are parallel some of their angles are going to have a special relationship to one another so if you look this parallel line cut by this transversal and this par parallel line form opposite or alternate interior angles and if you remember the alternate interior angles of a pair of a pair of parallel lines are congruent so for our next step we can say angle d a c is congruent to angle b c a and then say if alternate interior angles of parallel lines then angles congruent okay so now let's take note of what we already have proven we know we just proved that this is congruent to this we know that this is congruent to this now I want you to notice that these two triangles share this side right here AC and if you remember there's a property that says a side is congruent to itself so since they both share that we can say AC is congruent to a c and that's the reflexive property and now if you look we have an angle a side and an angle and if you remember that's one of our that's one of our um ways to prove triangles are congruent now you might be asking why we need to prove that these triangles are congruent well to show that this is a parallelogram if we can get this line congruent to this line then we would have two a pair of opposite lines that are parallel and congruent and then we can say that we have a parallelogram so next we can say triangle d a c is congruent to Triangle b c a and then we get and that's by angle both side angle next we can say that a b CD is oh well no sorry my mistake next we can say that a d is congruent to CB because remember if triangles are congruent corresp bonding parts are congruent and I ran out of space but our last step I'll write I'll write up here so for our very last step we can say that a b c d is a parallelogram and the reason for that is if one pair opposite sides are congruent and parallel then it is a parallelogram so that's going to be the only one we're going to do today um I'll make a another lesson on proving a parallelogram is a parallelogram because they involve a lot of work so make sure you come back and watch that
