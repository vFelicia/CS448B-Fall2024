what is going on guys it is Bucky and welcome to another app review and this app is for a game called Nova n oova now Nova is a game uh made by gameof and it cost $6.99 on the App Store and it is I would might have to say I think it's my second favorite game that I played so far so let's go ahead and skip this video right here and I'll show you what it's all about it's pretty much a first person shooter and it says touch the screen continue and I already have a game going so I'm going to go ahead and click continue and now once this load I'll pretty much show you how to do everything now let's go ahead and get this in focus and as you can see I I'm like in the middle of a mission right now but let's go over the controls now in order to aim what you need to do is pretty much just slide or pain your finger on the screen and that's going to aim your gun for you right there now in order to look around I mean that's pretty much the same thing in order to fire your gun go ahead and click this little red uh I don't know what it is really whatever you would call that um Crosshair I guess and this is going to shoot your gun for you so I mean that's all you need to do in order to shoot so in order to move around oh that's why I had that this is what you do it's like a little Xbox joystick where you go forward back left and right so this is look around this is move around both at the same time hm not bad so anytime you need to reload let me kill this guy first anytime you need to reload just go ahead and click right up here and this is going to reload for you so just click your gun right there and anytime you want to change weapons just slide this right here but I like this weapon right here so I'm going to keep that but just remember anytime you want to change guns just slide your weapon so I guess that's it except for this thing grenades anytime you want to use a grenade just tap your little grenade and no throw throw it just like that and that probably hurt me and the last thing I want to talk to you guys about anytime you want to stun an enemy let's see if I can get one um let's see if I can find an enemy well here's what you do you press this a lightning bolt right here and it like sticks out your hand or something and he's like bam talk to the hand and it stuns him so you know it takes some of your power but that's what it does so I don't know really why they had that in there but it's pretty cool just like hold out your hand you like tuck at a hand and then it stuns them so let me go ahead and kill these guys real quick and this guy looking uh pretty rough he might pone me but uhoh oh nice a noob all right anyways and like I said when she she's out of the way this is my health up here once I go through it I mean whenever someone shoots me it depletes but it regenerates so that's another cool thing and also I told you about this paralyzed thing with a hand and you know that's pretty much it what you do is pretty much you just go through these levels killing monsters like that and also you know that's it just go through killing monsters and doing what they tell you to do and the cool thing is that they have this little arrow to tell you where it goes and you see that thing that pop up that called that's called your progress saved this is one of my favorite games because you don't have to go in somewhere checkpoint and save it automatically this game automatically saves it for you which is just amazingly amazing so that's why uh once I kill these two people I'll finish talking but you know can't do two things at once really going to keep regenerating right there so I mean for an iPhone or iPod app this game is absolutely amazing it's so indepth and I mean it's just really a lot for iPhone game so that's why I'm going to give this game my first ever 10 out of 10 rating so I mean that's pretty much it for this game uh I guess I don't got a whole lot to say except I highly recommend downloading it um the game controls are really easy to use and it's one of the most addicting funnest indepth wellmade games for the iPhone so I guess that's it for this tutorial I'm going to play this and you can check out my other tutorials I guess so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and remember if you have any more apps you want me to review then just leave a comment on this video and I'll review them for you so one last time thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you next time
