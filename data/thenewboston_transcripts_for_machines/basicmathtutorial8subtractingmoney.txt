welcome to subtraction with money you have 89 cents you have to figure out what kind of corns you have to make up 89 cents so so you have three quarters that'd be 75 cents so you subtract the 75 cents so 9 minus 5 is 4 and the 8 minus 7 is 1 so you have 14 cents left so you can either use two nickels or one dime so say you just either/or two nickels or one dime so let's count it down three quarters let's say two nickels two nickels is 10 cents bring down the poor so you have four cents left so you can have nothing left but four pennies so you can make 89 cents by having three quarters two nickels four pennies or let's say you can either convert this to one dime or you can revert this to seven dimes and one nickel so altogether you can have eight dimes one nickel and four pennies another option if you didn't have any quarters let's go to a different example 93 cents so you have the 93 cents and say how to use all nickels all you had was nickels and pennies so how many nickels make up 90 cents so you know five and five is ten so thinking critically if you had if you want to have 90 that would be nine tens so that would be nine dimes and you'd times that by to 18 so 18 nickels would make up 90 cents bring down three and all you have left is three pennies so 18 nickels and three pennies or you can do nine dimes in three pennies or say you had some quarters 75 cents get to carry over make that in a 13 that's 8 and 8 minus 7 is 18 so you have 18 cents left so you can use one dime that's three quarters so one dime is ten cents and then you let's bring this up here so yeah one dime and you subtract five cents is three one nickel and then three pennies remaining there is another option 26 cents so you're 26 cents and you can have one quarter and one penny you can have two dimes so just 20 cents one nickel and one penny that's two dimes one nickel and one penny or five times five is twenty five so five nickels and one penny so many possibilities sure another one sixty eight cents say you want to use this little coins you possibly can so you'd use your quarters first or if you have a half dollar you can use a half dollar so let's say you have one half dollar one H team that's 50 Cent's 8 zeroes 8 + 6 minus 5 is 1 and you have 18 cents left so you can do one dime just 10 cents one nickel oops that's not a plus sign one nickel and one penny so you have 32 cents you can't use a halfdollar so you have to use a quarter borrow one from the 3 negative to make that 12 and that's seven two minus two is zero so that's one quarter and you have one nickel and then two pennies and that's all I have with subtraction for money
