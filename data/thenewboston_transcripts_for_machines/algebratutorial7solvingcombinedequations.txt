okay so today we're going to work with solving combined equation equations so we're going to take what we learned in our past two lessons and put them together to solve for our variable so right here we have 7 * the quty of x + 2 = 35 so normally if we were using our order of operations we would do what's inside the parentheses first and then do the multiplication but because we don't know what x equals we have to do our ordering a little differently so what we're going to do first is we're going to use a property called the distributive property and we're going to take this seven and multiply it by this X and multi and also multiply it by this two so we have 7 x + 14 = 35 and we're allowed to do that because of this property which which we multiply the seven by both of these so it would be the same as if we added them first and then multiplied so now normally we would do we would undo division first but since our whole since our whole um point is to get this variable by itself we're going to subtract this 14 over first so we get 7 x is equal to 49 now finally we can do we can divide that seven out and we get negative 7 so the whole point is to get X by itself so we work with the things that are farthest away from X first if that makes sense okay so for this one same thing we're going to wait to leave this five till last since it it's closest to the X so we're going to plus three to both sides we get 5x is equal to 25 now we can divide by five and we get X is equal to 5 okay so the same thing goes right here normally we do division or multiplication first but if if we were to undo this division we would have to multiply every single term by four so it's easier just to collect these like terms first and then multiply so we're going to add six to both sides and we get ne or POS 5 is equal to y over 4 now we're going to multiply by the reciprocal and we get Y is = to 20 and then we're going to divide that 1 over we get Y is equal to 20 the same principle applies over here plus 23 on both sides so we get 51 is equal to 17x over 32 we're going to multiply it by its reciprocal and these are pretty big numbers so I'm going to have to plug these into a calculator so if you multiply 32 by 51 we get 1 6 32 and if you divide it by 17 you get X is equal to 96 so we have one last problem we're going to do we're going to take this four and subtract it over 2x over 5 is = to 16 multiply by the reciprocal get X is equal and here we can reduce by twos so this becomes one this becomes 88 * 5 is 4 so that's it for our lesson today but um make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to talk about solving equations with variables on both sides
