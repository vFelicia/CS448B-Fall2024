alrighty y'all welcome back to another video and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about the blockchain blocks and the mining process so to kick things off we already know that the ethereum network is composed of nodes and we also know that users can connect to the network through these nodes now once connected users can create transactions and send them to the network through these nodes now once a node receives an incoming transaction what it's going to do is actually send that to all other nodes that it's connected to so let me get some cool green arrows going here so say that this node right here received this transaction what it would do is it would send it to this node this node in this node and these nodes upon receiving the transaction they would send it to all nodes that they are connected to so that's how a single transaction coming from a user to a single node is essentially going to propagate throughout the entire network until every single node receives that incoming transaction now as more and more people begin to send transactions into the network each of these nodes upon receiving these transactions are going to start combining them into a potential block so for now we can think of a block simply as a list or group of transactions although as we're going to see in just a second there's actually a bit more to it but for now we'll just stick with the simple definition of a potential block is simply a list of transactions so either way once a node has a block of transactions what it can do then is begin validating and executing those transactions and by validating i mean ensuring that the data is properly formatted that the user included enough fees so on and so forth so this is when things get interesting because before these transactions can be considered finalized each node is then going to attempt to solve a difficult puzzle and this puzzle is going to require a lot of computing power now by solving this puzzle nodes can prove that they did work by using computational resources and by the way even though you couldn't see i had quotes around prove and work in that sense and that's because this process of trying to solve this puzzle this is called proof of work so to produce a valid block a node not only needs to validate a list of transactions but also provide a correct solution to this difficult puzzle now whenever a node is able to produce a valid block then what it's going to do with that block well a couple different things the first thing it's going to do is it's going to add it to its own blockchain and we'll talk a little bit more about this blockchain in just a bit but for now just remember that it's going to take that valid block and it's going to add it to their own blockchain and on top of that they're also going to take that block and send it out to all other nodes that they are connected to now these nodes upon receiving this new block they're first and foremost going to validate it to make sure that the results and everything else is good the solution is correct so on and so forth and as long as everything looks good then they are going to add it to their blockchains as well so this process is what's known as mining it's the process of generating a valid block to be added to the ethereum blockchain now the node who successfully mines a block is going to be rewarded in ether so in this case it would be this node right here so this is why in the ethereum network we have a lot of nodes always trying to find that next block because if they can mine that first block again validate those transactions and solve the puzzle faster than all other nodes then they're going to be rewarded with ether so now that we understand the basics of how these transactions are validated how they're grouped into blocks and how those blocks are propagated throughout the network let's go ahead and take a closer look at one of these blockchains now before we dive into the blockchain architecture there are a couple things that i want to mention the first is that the fields and the exact data that i'm going to be talking about as part of each block it's not 100 technically correct there are a lot of additional fields mostly for security and validation purposes here we're taking a look at a very high level overview and also some of these things aren't technically correct for example there's not a field called solution in here so again this is more conceptual later on if we need to we'll take a look at the actual individual fields and break them down like we did for the transaction object earlier on but just want to point that out now that being said let's go ahead and add two more fields to our block and that is one block number and i don't think i really need to dwell and explain this too much you can kind of see that a block number is essentially well i don't even know how to how how else to explain it other than block number if you view these blocks as items in a list it's really just their positioning starting at zero so zero one two next one would be three so on and so forth now another field that is indeed in each block again this isn't just conceptual this is actual value in these blocks is a hash value of its parent block in my parent block i mean that the block that came before it so first this may seem kind of strange like why do we need to include a hash value of the entire block that came before it what's the point of that well the reason for this is actually related to the overall blockchain architecture by hashing the previous block and including that hash value in the subsequent block what this allows is for the entire blockchain to essentially maintain the order of which block came after each other in other words it's kind of like a big linked list and by hashing it you're essentially just maintaining the order of blocks in the blockchain so through this entire mining process or in other words the creation of the ethereum blockchain every single node in the network is able to reach consensus on each new block and ultimately the blockchain as a whole now a couple last things to point out the first is that not all nodes in the ethereum network are indeed miners miners are the nodes that are using their time and their computational resources to process transactions in an attempt to produce more blocks however there can be nodes and in fact there are in the ethereum network that aren't interested in mining or finding more blocks and an example of this is let's say that we had a node that just wanted to listen for incoming transactions maybe they had some like api service and they were providing data to people in that case they really aren't interested in finding new blocks they really just wanted to you know gather data be part of the network for those reasons so that would be example of an ethereum node that wasn't a miner in other words they weren't trying to solve any puzzle now the last thing i want to point out is that the ethereum network right now it uses a proof of work consensus mechanism and that is what we described right here by essentially solving this puzzle now on that note proof of work is actually being phased out of ethereum in favor of something called proof of stake and the reason for this well one of the primary reasons is that they want to decrease the amount of energy use because this process right here it actually requires a lot of energy so ethereum is transitioning over to a different consensus mechanism that will essentially get rid of this puzzle solving process and eliminate the need for proof of work so for now i think that puts us in a good position have a pretty solid understanding of blocks the blockchain architecture and really the mining process proof of work so on and so forth so for now thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and i will see you in the next video
