hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live camera for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at namespaces now what namespaces do is they make it easier for you to organize your classes so let's say you have one namespace and you can put several different classes in there so that when you want to access let's say you group similar classes in that so when you when you want to access classes that are related to the namespace you would just use that namespace that you created and then access the class in here and also let's say for example if we were making the person program in one of the previous tutorials let's say you wanted to have two class two person classes but you know that if you are working in the same namespace it will not let you create two classes with the same name but if you put each one of those classes in a different namespace then you will not get any errors and your program will what will run fine so let's go ahead and make a little project to a demo namespaces so we'll go ahead and select windows forms application and we'll set the name to namespaces and we'll go ahead and click OK and we'll just wait for that to load okay so we'll come over here to our solution Explorer we will select the namespaces solution we'll rightclick it and we will add a class so we'll just name this class the people class so people dot VB go ahead and click add now here is our people class that we just created we're going to create some namespaces to go in to encapsulate this people class so we'll go ahead and come up here and we'll just come right above the people class and we will type namespace other people and now you always have to end a namespace with the end namespace keyword okay so now that we've created our namespace other people let's go ahead and add some stuff to our people class so we will do the first name and the last name so public property first name as a string and then we will do another property last name as string and we'll just go ahead and override the to string function so that it returns their first name and their last name as a string so we'll type public overrides function to string okay so you can see that it automatically fills in the rest of this function for us so what we want to return is we'll return first name and then we will add a space and then we will add the last name okay so you can see that we may namespace other people and a class people inside of that so now I'll just come down here and create a second namespace so namespace friends go ahead and hit enter and you can see that gives us in namespace now if we create public class people and hit enter you can see that we don't get any errors for using duplicate people classes because these are inside of different namespaces so we can go ahead and put the same stuff inside of our friends class so public property first name as string and we can put their last name in there too so public property last name as string and let's go ahead and put let's say how many years we've been friends with them so public property years friends as integer so now I'll just override the two string function so public overrides function to string and we will just return first name and their last name with a space okay so you can see that we have used two seemingly identical people classes but they both are a little bit different and they refer to different things and they are inside of separate namespaces so we've got other people and friends so go ahead you can practice a little bit with namespaces and later on we're going to be going into accessing namespaces and classes with inside of the namespace so once you understand what namespaces are go ahead and move onto the next tutorial
