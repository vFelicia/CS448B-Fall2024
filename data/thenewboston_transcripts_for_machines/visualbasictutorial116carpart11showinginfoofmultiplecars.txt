hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to be working more on the car program now if this doesn't look familiar to you this code right here then you may want to go ahead and move back to the beginning of the car program series um and if not then let's go ahead and get started now if you remember from the last tutorial we created an array list that stored all of our cars and added added them to this list box now you can see that if we click on Honda CRV and click show info we get Mustang GT now this has nothing to do uh with uh the Honda CRV this is just going to show the info of our default sports car because we said it to do that when the button show info is clicked as you can see right here uh let's find it right there so it's going to show the car info of the default sports car so what we need to do to show the info of the selected in the car that's selected inside of list cars we're going to have to create a uh private variable up here so we'll just call it selected car as all cars docar so you can see that we didn't use the new keyword because we're going to be setting it equal to different cars in here and when you use new it creates an instance of that car and it can't be set equal to any other types of cars and now you may be wondering uh what if this selected car is a truck or a sports car well um we can use what polymorphism here if you remember from the previous tutorials I think it was a couple tutorials back but any uh any object that inherits from the car class can be treated as a car object H which is the concept of polymorphism so now that we have our selected car um what we need to do is access the selected index changed event of list cars so we can do that just by double clicking and it will load it up right here so now what we need to do is set the selected car to whatever car they have selected in the list box so we'll just go ahead and type selected car equals and now what we're going to do is we are going to access our cars array list so we'll just type cars and now we're going to have to get use an index right here so it gives a sets of element at the specified index so we're just going to be getting uh that uh element at the index now if you remember when it adds these uh cars to the list box it's going to add them uh based on the index so the car index of zero is added to the index of zero in the list and the car at the index of one one is added to the index of one in the list so this is very useful to us um in accessing the cars so you can see when we do add all cars for each car as all cars. car in our cars array list we're going to add that to the uh list box and so it adds it in numerical order according to the cars array list so the way we can set this selected car equal to uh the car that the the user wants to see we can just type list cars. selected index and the selected index of list cars is going to be equal to the indexing cars that uh the user wants to see now this may be a little bit confusing to you but if you mess around with this code right here um this and your car array list you should uh start to pick up what I'm saying if you don't already know it so now that we SE set our selected car uh to the um the car that's been selected in the index of our list box what we want to do is show the car info so you can see here that we show the car info of the default sports car now all we have to do to show the car info of the car that they've clicked on is just change this to selected car and so this makes it a whole B this makes it a lot easier um to change change and modify your code when you split stuff up into different Subs um and you can see that all we had to do was just change the arguments in here because this already does everything for us but it takes a generic car right here and we can change that to whatever we want instead of having to rewrite all the code again so we'll go ahead and run this and see what kind of results we get so let's select CRV if we show info we get Honda CRV the color is red which is default it has five doors and the speed is zero we'll click Mustang GT will show the info the car name is Mustang GT the color is red it has two doors and the speed is currently zero now you can see that we didn't get any errors there because of polymorphism our sports car was treated as a car now I know I repeat myself a lot on this but this is a concept that is very helpful and you guys should all understand it if you want to progress in your programming so we'll go ahead and close out of that and let's add one more thing before we finish with this tutorial whenever they change the index of our list cars what if the index is not a valid index so in that case it would be1 so we can just add a simple if statement here so if list cars do selected index does not equal 1 then we'll just go ahead and set this value so this will prevent any errors from happening in our program um so if they tried to select the index to negative 1 it would try to do this and our program would uh most likely crash so um go ahead type this code and if you haven't I really suggest it it'll help you learn the concepts a lot better and you can change it yourself um and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next Tut tutorial
