what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome to another Back aming tutorial in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is teaching you guys another technique and this technique is called hitting them to kind of slow down their momentum I know it's kind of a long name but just deal with me so anyways what we have set up here is white already made their first move so what they did is they moved their 17 points your 16 point and they also took it off their 24 point on your five point so what we need to do now is play our role so we being Brown rolled a two and a one now a noob might do something stupid like this he might play his 2 to 22 and your 1 to 23 to get his 24 check Checkers off there but what a better play is is this for your two you're going to want to go ahead and play your 13 to your 11 into to your one you're going to want to take a checker off your six and hit them on the five right there and this is going to send their checker on the bar you're saying all right Bucky why would it be better for me to move these two chips and leave them susceptible instead of advancing my last two 24 Checkers just like that well there are a couple reasons why you'd want to hit them in this case than just going ahead and advancing your last two Checkers the first reason is this what white is trying to do is they're trying to build a point on your fivepoint now this is a critical point not only when you're trying to Bear off but when you're trying to just Advance your Checkers and land on your five point so you don't want to give up this point without fight so that's why it's useful to hit him now aside from that what you need to do is and this is the whole point of this tutorial is you hit them whenever you want to slow down their momentum and what that means is this whenever white makes his next role check this out he got a one and a two instead of just moving some of these checkers one then two or this one three spaces or whatever even though he can't even do that he needs to spend an entire dice just getting off the bar so instead of having two rolls or excuse me two moves to make he can only make one move that's actually beneficial to him and the other move he just spends getting off the bar so anytime you can make your opponent spend time getting off the bar instead of doing something useful that's beneficial to you and the last point I want to make is while you're saying all right Bucky but if he's on the bar and you left his blot open to get hit then isn't that susceptible for him to hit you if your rolls a five and you end up on the bar well this is something that you typically don't need to worry about early on the game first of all like I said you want to fight for these points and fighting for crucial points is more important than worrying about getting hit early in the game and I'll tell you why because early in the game right now remember when you enter you enter in his home board look at it right now look how open it is pretty much unless you roll double sixes you're going to be able to play this Checker it's going to be really easy in the opening turns to get your Checker off so the easier it is to get this Checker off the less you have to worry about getting hit and right now any roll 1 through five you're going to be able to move this baby off right there so that is why in this case hitting would be better than just advancing two normal Checkers from behind
