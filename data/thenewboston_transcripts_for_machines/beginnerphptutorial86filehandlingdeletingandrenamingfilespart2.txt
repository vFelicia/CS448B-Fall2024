so let's go ahead and run this code and see what result we achieve so let me just refresh the page and you can see that the file deletes is still there so we can double check if this is working we're making sure it's there first of all let's click on file dot PHP okay so file file to delete ext has been deleted let's go back and refresh and you can see that that's been deleted so now what happens if we run the code again this function is not going to work because it's not going to be able to find the file specified let's click on that okay so we get a warning up so unlink file to delete no such file or directory and we've got our error message up here so what we can do is we can actually change our code it says here file has been deleted we don't keep that in the editor so what we can do is we can change our code and we can burn at symbol before this so we're not going to get this warning up in PHP let's go ahead and refresh and you can see that we've just got our plain error message on its own so now we've successfully looked at deleting a file what happens if we want to rename a file so let's go ahead and get rid of everything on this page okay so we want to fire we want to rename this file to a random array if you like of numbers so we're going to be using the round function to generate a large random number and then we're going to rename this file here to that random number and then dot txt so we're still maintaining the file extension okay so let's go ahead to file dot PHP let's first of all specify the file name in in a string datatype so this is far to rename txt now let's go ahead and create a random number now if you haven't already looked at creating random numbers in PHP we use the rand function so let's go ahead and say Rand is equal to Rand and this is going to take two parameters it's going to take a lower and an upper limit so we can say set our lower limit to 10,000 and we can set our upper limit to 99999 so this is going to generate a five digit number between these two numbers so this is the lower and this is the upper here so the function name that we use is simply rename so remember before I said delete isn't as obvious when we use the unlink function but with renaming we just use the rename function okay so let's go ahead and do that so let's say rename now this is going to take two parameters obviously because what we need to do is specify the file name to rename and also what we want to call it after that so let's go ahead and we'll say rename file name and we're renaming this to R and remember you need to append on txt because we're still maintaining the file extension so if you don't have if you don't depend on a dot txt this R and value is just going to be the file itself so we're just going to have a number so it's going to be an unspecified file type so again let's go ahead and enclose this in an if statement so what we're doing is we're checking that the file has been successfully renamed and then otherwise we're giving an error message so let's go ahead and say echo file and then we can append on file name and then we can append on has been renamed to and then we can append on the phone name that has been renamed to so R and and then its dot txt so we'll put that in strong and we'll put that in strong there and then file file name so it's just basically basic concatenation of string data with the inclusion of variables so otherwise let's go ahead and say error renaming okay so this is going to happen this error is going to be produced when we've already renamed the file name to the random txt so like I said before the reason you might want to rename your files to a random number is to keep them hidden from users you may have this random number stored in a database somewhere so your database knows where the file is but your users don't so they won't be able to look at the file specifically on the server there's many reasons why you'd want to obviously rename a file but I'm just giving this as an example so let's go back and refresh you can see that we've still got file to rename dot txt that's going to file dot PHP so now it says file file to rename txt has been renamed to four one nine seven five TX okay so we've successfully renamed it to a random number now let's go back again and let's refresh and you can see that that in fact has changed to four one nine seven five txt so in this tutorial we've looked excessively at the unlink and the rename function why they might be useful and we've just given a brief example so remember when you put your functions inside an if statement what we're doing is we're checking that this function is successful therefore we're only giving a confirmation message when we've successfully let's say renamed or deleted a file
