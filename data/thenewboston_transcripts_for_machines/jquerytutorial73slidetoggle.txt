hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now we've looked at in previous videos at using the slide down and the slide up functionality in jQuery however we also have a slide toggle function this works the same as toggle on its own but in actual fact slides instead of just shows and hides an element so we're going to use an example of an image again I'm going to create an an image tag and I'm using this image called Tartan jpg I'm going to give it an alt attribute of just Tartan and I'm also going to give it an ID and let's do this just start here so I'm going to say ID is equal to image I'm going to have a button just up here so an input type and that's going to be button the value is going to be we'll just a toggle that makes certain that makes sense and I'm going to give this an ID as well this is just going to be toggle okay so I'll just finally surround this in paragraph tags and to make everything a bit more separate and then let's go over to our browser and preview it okay so we've got this image here and we've got toggle so what we want to happen is we want this to slide up and slide down every time we press this toggle button so we've already included jQuery and already included our effects j/s file now what we want to is to do is listen out for an event when this button is clicked then what we want to do is toggle this image accordingly so over in FX jes let's go ahead and create an event handler for this button which I have called toggle I'm going to say dot click so we're listening out for a click and inside we create a function that's going to be run when we have that click take place so everything inside the curly brackets is our code let's just bring that down to make it look a bit neater and let's go ahead and use the toggle function the slides toggle function so we are sliding the image so we need to reference the image with a hash image again using the standard notation to reference an element then we want to use the slide toggle function so the slide toggle function does take additional parameters I'll explain those in just a moment however let's return to our page and see what we have let's click on toggle you can see that that has slid up into the corner when we click toggle again it will slide back now you'll notice that as the image slid it actually slid into the corner and what the well the effect that we were actually looking for is sliding upwards and downwards and the problem with this is because we're using an image the effect doesn't have the same output therefore what we need to do is we need to include our image inside of somewhere and instead of actually sliding the image itself slide what is containing it so instead of the ID being inside of the image we're going to give it to this paragraph just here so the page is displayed in exactly the same way however all we've done is we've actually called the paragraph ID image story rather than the image itself now what's going to happen is we're going to get the same thing happen with this with referencing image which is now a paragraph and we're using slide toggle as we would normally but this time we'll actually retrieve or or display and a real sliding effect so you can see now that it's lit up and slid back down again so that's the problem with using some elements some elements won't display properly when you try and use animation effects on them however just by creating a paragraph with this image inside we've retrieved a perfect sliding effect now we do have other options for this slide toggle function for example the speed again it can be a texture or numerical representation of a speed for example we could do 2000 you also can change the animation type so for example at the moment it sort of bounces almost it swings it's hard to see when it slides fast however if we were to now you can see that it slows down just before it reaches the end here we can use Linea in this case to slide exactly so it maintain the same speed as its slides so if you watch now it maintains exactly the same speed as it slides up and down so it depends on what kind of effect you're looking for but by default this is swing and the other option and the only other option is linear we can also have a callback function which we've discussed in other parts of other tutorials which I won't be demonstrating in this case however for now that's T how to use the slide toggle function in jQuery
