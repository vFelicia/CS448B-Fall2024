hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at some variants of the do until and the do while loop now let's go ahead and get started we'll create a new project make sure you have selected console application and we'll go ahead and name this more do loops and just go ahead and click okay now let's wait for that to look and then zoom in okay so if you remember from the last tutorial we covered the do while Loops now let's say you have a block of code and you want that block of code to run no matter what once and then continue looping based on a if a certain value is true now the problem with the do while loops and the do until Loops that we learned is that it may or may not run once so let's say do until num one is equal to 10 well what if num one is already equal to 10 it's not going to loop at all so I'll show you how to make the code run once no matter what so we're going to go ahead and type console. right line and we'll just print normal do until Loop so let's go ahead and create a variable here we'll just call it num one and we'll set that equal to zero and then we'll make our do until Loop so do until num one is equal to 5 and then we can just go ahead and do num one plus equals 1 and then we'll go ahead and print out num one so this is going to start out U printing the number one on here because we called num1 plus equals 1 before we wrote it out on the console so now let's create a do until Loop that will run no matter what one time so let's just give us some space right here now let's go ahead and label this so we'll do console. right line do until variant okay so now let's create our do until so we're going to start off with the keyword do and we're not going to add until at at the top of the loop we're just going to go ahead and hit enter and you can see it fills in Loop for us and we'll just type console. right line num one so let's go ahead and set num one equal to 10 so after this loop after this has looped right here and it's printed out everything and it's done doing that we're just going to go ahead and set num one equal to 10 so we can use it with this do until Loop perod now there's something missing from this we just have do and we just have Loop where are we going to put the until well if we put it down at the bottom then what it's going to do is it's going to do this line right here no matter what and then it's going to Loop until num one is equal to 10 so if it starts out that num one is equal to 10 then it it won't matter because it'll do it anyways uh no matter what num one is equal to so if we go ahead and run this program it's going to close out really quick um so let's go ahead new console.readline okay so you can see here that it's got the normal do until Loop which goes 1 2 3 4 5 and then we've got our do until variant and you can see that it prints out 10 here because we added do before the loop until now we can go ahead and do this with a do while loop so we can pretty much just change this to Loop while num one is less than 10 so it's going to do this once it's going to print out 10 and it's going to realize oh num one is greater than 10 so we're not going to go back up here and loop it again so if we run this going to get the normal do until until Loop which prints out one 2 3 4 5 and then our do until variant which is going to print out 10 so you can go ahead and make a couple practice programs using normal do until Loops um normal do while Loops you can add the while and the until down at the bottom if you want and then once you got that nailed down and you won't forget it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching guys
