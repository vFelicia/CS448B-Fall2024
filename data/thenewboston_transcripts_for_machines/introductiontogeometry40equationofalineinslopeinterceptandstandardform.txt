so now that we've gone over slope we're going to talk about the equation of the line and writing the equation of a line first we're going to talk about it in slope intercept form so this is what slope interform looks like it's y equals mx plus b where m is the slope and b is the yintercept of the line and the yintercept is the place on the graph where the line hits the yaxis so this one the yintercept would be zero two so given two points one two two and five three we're gonna write the equation of a line so the first thing we have to do is set is find the slope so m is equal to y two minus y one over x two minus x one so two minus three is negative one over one minus five which is negative four so positive one fourth now to find th what this equals we're gonna plug in one of these two points it doesn't matter which one and the slope and solve for b so we're just going to we're going to use this one because the numbers are smaller so this is x and this is y so we're going to plug these numbers in for x and y so y equals mx plus b two equals m which is our slope x which is one plus b so two is equal to one fourth plus b if you subtract the one fourth over you get b is equal to seven fourths so if we're going to write the equation we're gonna write y is equal to m x plus seven fourths so now we're going to talk about the equation of a line in what's called standard form and this and a slope inner or standard form goes ax plus b y equals c where a and b are coefficients which means they're numbers that stay in front of a variable and c is a constant so this number doesn't change so given m equals 1 4 and the point negative 4 3 is on the line find the equation of the line so we're going to use our slope intercept form to help us so y equals mx plus b so if we plug this in and we're going to solve for b at the same time so 3 is equal to 1 4 negative 4 plus b 3 is equal 1 4 times negative 4 gives you negative 1 plus b if you add the 1 over you get b equals 4. so y equals one fourth x plus four now we wanna make this equation look like this equation so we have to get the x and the y on the same side so first thing we're going to do is we're going to eliminate this fraction right here so we're going to multiply every number times four so we get negative or no that's not a negative four y is equal to x plus 16. so if you subtract or what we're going to do is we're going to subtract y over so we get 0 is equal to x minus 4y plus 16. we're almost there but to get there all the way we have to subtract this 16 over and get 16 negative 16 is equal to x minus 4y and that is your line in slope intercept form or in standard form i'm sorry so now we need to write an equation for a line parallel to the line y equals two x minus one through the point two two so if you remember our parallel lines have equal slopes so this since this is in the form y equals mx plus b where m is the slope the slope of this line equals two so our new line has to have a slope of two in order to be parallel to this line so now we're going to plug this point into this equation to get our new equation so 2 is equal to 2 times 2 this one's this 2 plus b so 2 is equal to 4 plus b if you subtract the 4 over you get b is equal to negative 2. so the equation of the line parallel to y equals 2x minus 1 through the point 2 negative 2 2 is equal to is y is equal to 2 x minus 2. in our last example we want to line write the equation of the line perpendicular to 3x plus 4y equals 7 through the 0.13 so the first thing we're going to do is convert this to slope intercept form so we're going to convert this to slope intercept form so 4x or 4y is equal we're going to move the x over and we're gonna divide by four x plus seven fourths so we have a slope of negative three fourths so perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes so the slope of my second line needs to be the opposite so the opposite sign so since this is negative 3 4 our new slope is going to be positive and the reciprocal so all we do is switch the top and bottom so we get four thirds and so we're going to do the same thing we did in the last one now and we're gonna plug this and this into the slope intercept form to find our b so we get y is equal to four thirds times one plus b and this should say three because this is our y right here so three is equal to four thirds plus b if we subtract four thirds over if we subtract the four thirds over and get a common denominator we'll get b is equal to five thirds so because they gave us their equation in point um excuse me in standard form we're going to write our equation in standard form as well so our slopeintercept form is y is equal to four thirds x plus five thirds so to convert this to standard form we have to get rid of all the fractions so we're going to multiply everything by three so we'll get 3y is equal to 4x plus 5. we're going to subtract the x over and get negative 4x plus three y is equal to five and that's all we're going to do today with equation of a line but um be sure to come on to the next video where we're going to take the equations that we just made and graph them
