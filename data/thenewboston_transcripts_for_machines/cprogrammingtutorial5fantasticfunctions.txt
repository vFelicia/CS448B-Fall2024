what's going on everybody how you doing and welcome back to your fifth C++ tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be going over something called functions now there are two really main types of functions the first type is functions that we write we create ourself and we're going to be talking about those you know in a couple tutorials from now but in this tutorial what I want to talk about is functions that are already buil in to C++ that we can use so with that being said let's go ahead and uh you know start writing some code go ahead and make a variable double A and I know that you guys are used to int but I'm going to switch to double double is pretty much real numbers um they allow you unlike integers we are now allowed to use decimal points like 87.2 and you know it doesn't have to be just whole integers like int we can now use you know uh decimal points that's the main thing you got to worry about so anyways start using double instead of V because you'll see later on so now that we have a blank variable called a let's go ahead and take that and set it equal to this sqrt and write two parentheses and in those parentheses write any number you want like 154 pretty cool huh so we're saying all right all right what the heck is this squirt 154 WTF mofo no what this is is the square root function this is already built into C++ and what it does is it takes the number 154 gets the square root of it and stores it in the value of a excuse me in the variable a so now we can just go ahead and output that on the screen and it should print out whatever that value is this square root of 154 which should be like 12 point something so let's go ahead and do this and we're going to get an error and I'll tell you why we get an error right here and I know you guys can't see the error method or excuse me the error uh message but it says square root Undeclared first useing this function this is because whenever our program came across this sqrt it didn't know what the heck we were trying to do was it like are you trying to set a equal to the letters sqrt and then a parentheses and what the heck are you trying to do here that's because we need to include something called a function header now the header file let C++ know what sqrt is and lets it know that it's actual an actual function and we're not trying to set it equal to you know just some random letters and in order to do that we need to do this include cmath and once we include cmath this this gives us access to all the mathematical functions we can use so now that this is included in our program whenever we come across this line of code right here it knows that it's not just four random letters and some parentheses it knows that this is a mathematical function and it's to be treated as such so now if we go ahead and run this we're going to get an actual program 124097 H have to remember that so what it did is did this it took 154 found the square root of it and stored it in the variable a and then we just printed out a now for your terminology whenever you use a function it's called calling a function so whenever I'm talking I say all right let's go ahead and call this you know I don't mean like on my cell phone or anything I mean let's go ahead and use this I'll probably use them interchangeably so you know just bear with me here but that's the technical term so if you're ever you know interviewing for job say Calla function whenever you take that value whatever value you get back in this case 124097 h I remembered it I think it's called its return value so 154 is the number you want to figure out what the square root of but 12.4 that's the return value that's the value we stored in a so again calling a function return value the last couple things we need to go over is this number you put inside the parentheses this is called the parameter now a parameter is any information that the function needs in order to work so you know it needs a number to be square rooted so we pass it in 154 and throwing a number in there is called passing in a number and again that it's called the parameter or passing in a value you know once I use it in context you guys we'll see you later on they're kind of like the same thing so now that we got all the terminology down uh let's go ahead and let's go ahead and make another program actually so you need to include this anytime you use the square root function and that's not only square root function you get another set of functions you know built in with this by the way I don't know if I said this already but this include IO stream this allows us to use the you know C in C out uh functions method I mean not methods that's from another computer language that I've been uh using but anyways enough for me R rambling let's go ahead and create another program so let's go ahead and make another double number and also double answer and let's go ahead and allow the user to enter a number and then we will calculate the square root of that and then print it out for him so how do we make the user enter information CN and then whatever number they enter is going to be stored in the variable number and now let's go ahead and take that number find the square root of it and store it in the variable answer so answer equals sqrt of number so whatever number they entered we're going to get the square root of it and that's the return value the answer and we're going to store that return value in our variable answer so now all I have to do is print out answer see out answer and let just go ahead and end that line so now this should work as long as I didn't spell anything wrong so let's go ahead and enter you know 54 press enter the square root of that is 7.34 847 handy bit of information you might want to hold on to that so that was a uh breathtaking tutorial I hope hope you guys enjoyed that so that's pretty much the basics of everything we learned so far varibles C in C out and also prebuilt functions so again what function is is pretty much a builtin I don't know you guys can see for yourself it performs an equation or it does something else for you automatically saves you a lot of trouble so these are ways you can use builtin functions in C++ and in the upcoming tutorials like I said there are also ways we can create our very own functions which is uh a lot more fun actually so uh that's what you guys have to look forward to in the next couple tutos and also hearing my beautiful voice so don't forget you have to have that to look forward to and you know what else you have to look forward to all this
