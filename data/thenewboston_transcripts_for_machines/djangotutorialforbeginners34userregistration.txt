all right guys welcome back and in this video I am going to show you how to let users register for your site or create a new account and also log in now before we get to the code I need to talk to you about a couple Core Concepts first of all as you know jeno already comes with the ability to create users and we know that because we already created an admin now if you played around in your admin panel and clicked users you're going to see that this is your information right here so you have username email address first name last name and we don't have to fill these out we just left them blank and also the staff status and again if you click it you can see that here's your password that is hashed and it's important to note that whenever Jango sores passwords they're not raw text so that's actually good for hackers whenever they you know hack your database they don't get anyone's password and a bunch of these fields right there so we can just go ahead and you know make the forms like we did before but what you always want to do is you want to make these in kind of a different way now I say that because whenever I have a website and I want users to sign up I really don't care about their first name or last name or maybe there is some other thing that you want them to fill in I don't know maybe like their relationship status if you're making a dating site so whenever you talk about user authentication or registration you always want to handle it manually so I'm going to show you guys the best way to do that so let's close out all these got my cheeseburgers from the last tutorial all right so the first thing we're going to do is this in your music's app go ahead and right click and you're going to make a new python file and name it forms so you know like before let me show you guys this whenever we wanted to create let's say a new album we just said all right we're going to use this model album so it went over here and it generated a new form based on this model well that's essentially what we're going to do with the users however since we want to tweak it a little bit for example we don't need an input for first name and last name because we don't care about those we're pretty much going to inherit from users and overwrite whatever we want to or add whatever fields we want to so in forms that py what we're going to do is say from Jango trib off models import user all right so this is going to give us the base user class just a generic user class that we can use so after this what we want to do is say from Jingo import forms all right so what we're going to do now is we're going to make a new user form class and that's going to tweak it to whatever we want to display on the form so class user form and this is just going to inherit from forms model forms so again whenever I talk to you guys about model classes model forms all you're doing right here is you're going to make a blueprint that's going to be used whenever you're making the forms so the first thing we're going to do is we're just going to make a new class meta did I talk to you guys about class meta it's basically information about your class sounds kind of weird but there you go so the base model is going to be user in other words whenever a user creates or signs up for your site it's just going to go in the same table right here so we're not creating anything you know brand new we're just saying what information we need out of them so for the fields what we want to do is we just want to say What fields do we want to appear on the form so what I'm going to request is the pick a username their email address and also their password we can leave all the rest of the stuff out so again username email and password now up here we actually need to specify the password and all right so the password is going to be equal to forms. character field now if we just leave this like this then it's just going to be plain text in other words whenever the user tries to type in their password it's not going to give you those addresses it's going to give you just you know text like this so then anyone peeping over their shoulder can see what their password is so how do we specify that this is actually a password field and you need to actually hide those characters or just go ahead and wrate widget forms. password input so now whenever we display this form what's going to appear on the page for the user is a area to pick a username write their email and also their password so now over in views now that we have our blueprint of how we want the form to be laid out taken care of I'm actually going to show you guys how to do a bunch of cool stuff in this video what I'm going to do is not only whenever they register it creates an account and Pops their information into this database but I'm also going to show you guys how to have them log in automatically and that way you know on every page it can say hey Bucky or whatever custom information you want specific to them and aside from logging in I'm also going to show you guys after you submit the form it redirects you to I'll just redirect them to the homepage but you may want to redirect them to I don't know like their profile page their news feed whatever so we need to import a bunch of stuff so from Jango shortcuts we want to import render and also redirect so this redirect module is going to red rir them to whatever page you want after they log in and I also want to say from Jingo contrib off import authenticate and login so again this authenticate what this module is going to do is it's pretty much going to take a username and a password and is going to verify that they are indeed a user and they exist in the database and this login it just attaches a session ID so then no matter what page you're on you don't have to like authenticate them every time and they don't have to log in every page it just gives them an ID that they can use while they're browsing the site and you know a regular session ID so now I'll stick this after this all right so from Jingo views generic import View and the last thing is we actually need to import this fors file that we just created so from fors that's the file name we want to what do we name it user form user form looking beautiful mate
