we're gonna be using we're going to be using the focus in handler to check whether this has you know gained focus we could use the click event handler but this isn't going to accommodate for users that have tabbed down to this field so we need to make sure that we use the focus in handler what we then need to do is create a blur handler for when the user leaves this field so when either when they click out or when they tap out to something else and then we'll go ahead and create the actual validation process with the PHP file I mentioned earlier so we've given this email field an email of an ID of email so inside Ajax jas this is how we can reference it so we're gonna go ahead and create an event handler for this and we need to select a we need to use the hash selector because we've used an ID here and we are writing email now what we're going to do is create the focus in handler and we're going to create a function inside of that so focus in inside is a function as you would normally layout function parentheses and curly parenthesis we're then going to come down and inside here is going to be everything we write when we focus in now we're going to be doing something slightly different in this tutorial which you wouldn't have seen throughout the rest of this tutorial series at least not with event handlers and that is appending on event handlers to the end so in a minute we're going to create a blur event handler onto the end of this and what happens here is it just saves us having to reference down so instead of coming down here and typing blur and then coming down here and type in key up we can actually append or bind different handlers onto the end of this main selector here so that's just something useful to know with regards to focus in what do we want to happen well we want to create a span over which is just gonna hold some information about our selection or what we've typed inside this email field and I'm just going to call this email feedback so inside of here we need to again select email underscore feedback and we then need to apply some text to this so we're going to use the text function here inside here I'm just going to right go on enter a valid email address so now what's going to happen is when we focus in on this email field the email feedback span will you know fill up with this text here so let's go ahead and test that I'm going to click on that and you can see that's filled up when I click away it obviously doesn't disappear because we haven't created this yet so let me go ahead and tab down to this from my URL bar here and you can see that this produces more or less the well exactly the same effect I'm just going to tab down and you can see that this is now active and that has worked and this is in addition to or sorry as opposed to using the click the we would use the same effect or have the same effect when we click in here however if we were to tab down to it you can see that this is now in focus and we don't have our text so this is why we used the focus in event handler okay so the next handler we want to create is blur and when we when a user leaves this field either tabbing out or clicking elsewhere on the page we want to run another function so let's bring this down again and this time we want to do exactly the same as we did here but we actually want to create nothing so we want to remove the feedback so email feedback dot text and inside of there nothing so now what's going to happen is when we click in and click out that will disappear also when we tab down to it and then tell away from it it disappears as well so now that we have these two these two aren't quite complete yet for the simple reason that for example if I was to type something in here and leave and come back you can say it you can see that it now all sorry yet so it now disappears like this now this is absolutely fine however if we were to go and click into this we actually need to be able to validate it as well so if I was to click in let's just say there was nothing in here folks to click in it says go on it enter a valid email address I can click away that's fine if I was to then go ahead and enter a valid email address and click away that disappears that's fine we might have come down to another field down here but when I click back in because I'm using the focus in we're automatically generating this this message here so we want to always tell the user that the email address is valid if there is something in here so we need to create a quick check here to determine what we want to do so I'm gonna say if and I'm going to use a selector to select the value of our email field so Val here if that equals nothing then we can ask the user to enter something so now let's test that out let me just go back to the code and I'll quickly explain we use this selector here to select the value inside of this input field we then grab the value of the field so this would equal say Alex if I was to have entered Alex in here now that if that equals nothing so if it's empty then we can ask the user to enter a valid email address now if they haven't if it's not empty sorry we can do something else
