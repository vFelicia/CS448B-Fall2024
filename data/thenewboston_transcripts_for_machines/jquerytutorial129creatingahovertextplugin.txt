so we want to be more or less the same thing that we usually do and define a function within this event handler but this time we want to make a simple change and we want to supply a parameter in here that we can use to access where the mouse position is out because obviously the mouse position is extremely important in this circumstance with regards to where we're going to place this div we want it to follow the mouse therefore using e we can grab the client x and y position which essentially is the mouse position so let's go ahead and just bring this down and I'm gonna go ahead and just create a test so we know that everything's working I'm gonna go ahead and just create a div on the page and this is going to be called just pause for example this should just sort of for debugging and testing purposes it you know doesn't really have any other use now we want to go in the head and inside of our function here define the top and the left of the mouse position so I'm going to create a variable called top and I'm gonna create a variable called left and these are going to be equal to e dot and then we're gonna access the you know sort like I'm a method inside of this object and the first one is client Y this is essentially the Y position which is obviously the vertical position so we want to know how far from the top the mouse is which is this value here and then with regards to the left we want to get the X position because we want to know how far is on the horizontal or x axis so now what we can do is we can feed into this div that I've created called pause and we can apply these values to this so we'll get a sort of dynamically updating values so I'm gonna say top plus and then just a space and then left so now what's going to happen is when we move our mouse we're gonna grab the top and the left constantly so every time the mouse is moved up or down or left or right or vertically we're gonna grab these two values and then just apply them to this pause div so now what you should see is these values change you can see underneath my cursor here and underneath the link you see them changing so now that we have these values here we can determine where to place this div that we've created or defined in here and that we've actually applied to the document by putting it after the the link so now that we've just seen that in action we can go ahead and get rid of that div and get rid of this line as well the only problem here is is that we want to space this a bit further away from the mouse cursor we don't want it to be too close to the cursor because obviously it's going to get in the way and it's going to cause some problems so I'm gonna add ten to each of these values and that will just space it sort of ten pixels below where the cursor is and ten pixels across from whether from where the cursor is okay so now what we want to go ahead and do is okay so yeah what we want to do is we want to go ahead and apply the position that we've gained here plus ten so we want to move this div accordingly so you've seen that we could update the values inside that div I created just under here but now we want to do is actually apply the position of this here or accordingly now this is would be the same as applying say top as ten pixels and left as say ten pixels it can be absolutely anything the values could be anything but we can use jQuery to automatically update CSS so what we want to do is we want to go ahead and reference the hover text div which is hover text remember the idea of this is hover text so we use a hash to reference the name and then we want to say dot CSS and in here we can set top to a particular value here and then we can do CSS again to set the left to a particular value here and obviously this this value here and this value here we already gained dynamically depending on where the mouse is so we can just substitute these in so I can write top here and I can go ahead and right left here and now that we've done that we have another slight problem and that is that we haven't actually shown this div yet so we want to do is we want to just put show on the end of it and that will change the displaynone to actually display it so let's take a look at the the code you can see now at the moment we have another problem I mean the one thing is that this div is now following our cursor but we obviously haven't applied any text to it yet so it's pretty much useless so what we want to go ahead and do is just before we show it is apply some text and that text in here could be absolutely anything but we're substituting in a variable and that variable is title remember the variable that we gained from our link earlier so now when we refresh we can see that we have the div hovering over you'll probably notice that the tooltip is actually getting in the way of this but there's a way that we can deal with that and we'll go through that in a moment now the first problem that we're going to solve is when we move away from the link the div actually remains so it's really quite annoying and useless I mean you wouldn't want to put that on your site so what we do is after we've after we've used this mousemove event handler we want to come down here and say dot mouse out and create a new function so function in here is going to be let's just pull that down the function in here is going to be when the mouse comes away from the particular element and in this case all we really want to do is just go ahead and hide the hover text div so when the mouse comes away from it its hidden and it doesn't remain on the page so hide like that so we've shown it here when the mouse goes in and it's been moved around but when the mouse comes out we want to hide this so it's quite simple really if you think about it so now when we come away you see it just hides so we can still flicker over it and you will show itself and hide itself so mouse move it's being shown and now the way it's being hidden okay now the last problem that we sort of have to deal with is the fact that we get this HTML default tooltip appear now I took the time to personally research this and how we might be able to disable this tooltip coming up which default comes up when you supply a title
