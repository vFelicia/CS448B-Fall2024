so recalling it twice the the function okay so now what we want to do is we want to place this result which now equals the return data of validate email into our email feedback spam so email feedback text result and we can do the same thing just down here email feedback dot text result so as I mentioned earlier slightly inefficient because we're calling the ver the function twice and then using this twice to put the same thing in you could take this and apply it to another function that would be slightly more efficient because then you'd only have to again call this function again we might do that towards the end of the tutorial but for now we've taken this result variable which has the contents of validate email which has the content of data which come from the contents of email dot PHP so it's a slight slide of data here and then we're applying it to email feedback so let's go ahead and check this out we click in we get this message we've seen that as I start to type we should be getting hmm okay so it appears that something might be wrong here okay so let's yeah that's ho look here okay so I've returned this data just inside of here so let me just put that down there because we were returning it inside of this function here which in turn wasn't giving us this result value we need it from the function let's go ahead and test that again them sorry I click in here and I start typing and we should be okay so let's go ahead and do this another way let's pull this function down here and that's in here create a variable called data returned and that equal to data and then we'll return data returned and we'll just double check everything here so yeah okay let's see if this works no okay so what we're gonna what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna stick to I mean this is version JavaScript now you should be able to see how lazy jQuery makes me what I'll go ahead and do is I will just take the result here and that we did before or take this email feedback selector let's get rid of that and let's get rid of the var in front of this validate email function okay so I'll just go and explain what we are doing now what we're actually doing is removing the returned value of this function and I'm just calling the function itself now once the data has been returned I'm gonna go ahead and use a selector to select the email feedback span and then apply text inside here which is the return data so the validate email function returns the data to this email feedback span so let's go ahead and try that you can see I've just started typing and I've typed Alex and we have the text that doesn't appear to be a valid email address then I go ahead and continue typing and we would retrieve this valid email address message then when we come away from it you see that it disappears however when we come back it revalidate s' it so if for example it was just Alex ah but as soon as we click on here it revalidate s the the text inside of there okay so we've looked at a basic concept of email validation obviously if you were using this for every form field it would be inefficient so some kind of function that you would create to validate forms based on their type would be better in this case however in this we've just demonstrated posting data to our email dot PHP far from Ajax using our post HTTP request and essentially they're returning the data and putting it into an HTML element here so that's just some basic email validation in jQuery
