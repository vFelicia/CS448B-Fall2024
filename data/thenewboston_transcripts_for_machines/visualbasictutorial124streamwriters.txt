hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and this tutorial we're going to be talking about streams now basically what a stream is is it's the what you used to exchange data between files memory or maybe a network so you can send bytes of data back and forth so what we're gonna do in this tutorial is write some types to a text file so we'll go ahead and click new project we will select windows forms application and we will call it streams okay so let's go ahead and make this resize it a little bit so we'll add a text box and we will make it multiline by clicking the arrow and selecting multiline so now we can drag this out and make it a little bit bigger let's come up here and add a button now we'll set the text of this button to right and we'll set the name to button right and we'll set the name of textbox1 to text too right so now let's go ahead and doubleclick on right to create an event handler for that so we'll just zoom in some here now what we need to do is create a stream Rider so we can write to a text file so we'll come up here and to be able to do that we need to type in imports system dot IO and IO stands for input/output so it will create any new stream writer now so we'll type private my writer as new stream writer and for the arguments we're gonna need a path so I'll just do it in my G Drive and I'll call the file my file dot txt so it's gonna look for this file and if it doesn't find it then it's just gonna create it for you so now what we're gonna do is let's take the text that the user typed in or whatever they could click write you know go ahead and write that to the text file so we will type my writer dot write line which is similar to the console apps that we learned close to the beginning of the series so we're gonna write line and we're gonna write whatever is in the text box so text to write dot txt so it's gonna write that to the text file now there's one problem with this if we go ahead and click right and it'll write that to the text file if we try to open that text file you're not gonna see any changes made to it because in order for the changes to take place we're gonna have to close that file so let's move this button over here a little bit we'll add another button and we'll set the text to close file I'll set the name to button close so whatever they click close file and they're finished writing we'll just go ahead and type my writer dot close so this will close the file and all of our changes will take effect now we'll go ahead and open up my G Drive and you can see that there is no text file in here right now we'll go ahead and minimize that now if we run this it creates that text file so you can see that it created my file right here and currently it doesn't have anything in it you can see that right there so we'll close out of that will minimize this so that's just write hello world we can write that to it and we could also have it clear this text box every time we click write just to make it a little bit more userfriendly then we'll say just on live gamer we'll write that and you can see that whenever we write it doesn't actually save the changes to our text document so in order to save the changes we have to click close file now if we come over here and open up my file we get looks like we get hello world and on live camera so we could change this to say file that would look a little bit better but that's just something that you can do so basically we just made a streamwriter and it access to this file right here and since it wasn't there it created it and then we wrote whatever was in the text box to it and then when they're done working with it we click close so that it will say the changes to that file so go ahead practice with some stream riders then once you done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
