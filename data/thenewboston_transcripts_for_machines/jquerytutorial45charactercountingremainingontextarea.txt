hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a video tutorial for the New Boston now we've already looked at event handling in jQuery however now we're going to create an example application this application is going to involve a text area with a max length a limited amount of text that can actually be typed into the text area but what we're going to do is we're going to use jQuery to feedback to the user how many characters they have remaining so you've probably seen this on site such as Twitter when you type a tweet into the box it will tell you how many characters the user has remaining so let's go ahead and actually design out our HTML I'm going to create a text area just here and I'm going to give it some attributes in just a moment so the attributes we're giving it are an ID and this is used to identify the text area I'm just going to call this text area I'm going to create um two attributes row rows and columns which are just going to be the size so 7 and 25 there and I'm also going to create a max length attribute and this is going to be 55 characters so let's go over to our browser and refresh you can see that we've got a text area we can type some text in let's just copy and paste over and over again and you'll see that the output has stopped here I can't type anything else so the max length has prevented us from typing anything further than 55 characters however what we want is a little div down here that's actually going to relay this information back so how many characters we have left as we're actually typing so the first thing we want to do is create a external jQuery file and I'm going to save this inside the JS folder I'm going to call this text area. JS the next thing to do is go ahead and create the div and this is going to be have an ID of text area feedback so as the user types this div is going to be constantly updated with the amount of characters that the user has left to type okay so inside text area. JS we first of all need to use the document ready um functionality of jQuery to actually display an initial character count and this is automatically going to be 55 so let's go ahead and say document do ready so in jQuery uh we use uh a dollar sign and then we're referencing the document spell it properly do ready and inside of here we're going to create a function now this is automatically going to be called code in here when the page loads so we can test this by saying alert hi for example when we refresh the page ah okay so we haven't included this text area. JS file in our page yet so let's go ahead and do that now so script type equals text/javascript the source is going to be jsex area. JS and we end the script just there so let's go ahead and refresh our page to see that uh Notice come up we've got a an alert box coming up saying h tank high so we know that our document um ready uh function is working now what we want to do is set the uh maximum length of the text area so we're going to create a uh variable and this is going to be called um text Max that's going to be equal to 55 now what we want to do is actually initially put some data in this div that's under here to tell them how many characters they actually have to type so we're going to reference this and this is called text area feedback so we want to place some text inside text area feedback using the HTML function and this text is going to be textor Max and then we're going to append on some text and then just say characters remaining so now what happens is when our document has loaded we set this variable text Max which we can use later on in the Pro in our uh code and then we set the text area feedback to 55 characters remaining so quite basic let's just refresh the page make sure that works we've got 55 characters remaining now the goal is obviously when we start to type this value is going to uh decrease by one or by you know the characters that a user is typing and we need to get the value in order to do this the first thing that we need to do is check for an event and the event is key up so when a key comes up we need to count the the uh length of the text inside the field
