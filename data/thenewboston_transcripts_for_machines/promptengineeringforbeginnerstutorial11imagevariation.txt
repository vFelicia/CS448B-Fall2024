hey welcome back everyone thanks for joining us and in this video I'm going to show you how to make image variations with the openai API so we are inside of the number 10 image variation folder inside of the open AI folder inside of the AI playground repository and we're working inside this main.py file we have an image the image is less than 4 megabytes in size and it is a square ratio meaning the same width as the height so it's like 1,24 pixels by 1,24 pixels so those are requirements of your input image and basically what we're going to do here is we're going to pipe an image through the openai API and it's going to take that image and generate a variation of it with AI so let's go ahead and toggle close the left hand side so we can see our code a little bit better and you'll notice this is a really simple example it's only what do we have here like 11 lines of code so the top is just the boiler plate same as all the other videos we got to bring in open Ai and we have to create a client now that we have our client we're we going to go ahead and assign a variable response to the resulting object from this API call we do the API call with the client. images. creatore variation and that is going to take a few arguments the first one here super important is the image argument we're going to set it equal to and then we're going to use Python's builtin open method to actually open a local file now if you remember we have a file bucky. PNG in the same folder as this main.py file so we just do a/ bucky. PNG inside of single quotes and that'll point directly to that file the next argument inside this open method is the RB that means read binary it just means hey we're not dealing with text we're dealing with an image images need to be read in bytes as binary so that we don't modify any of the original data for that image file so that's what that is it's just going to allow us to take that image and send it over to the API now the next thing is the N equals 1 this is just the variations like we had in the previous video we are using Dolly 2 by default you can't do this with Dolly 3 at least not yet so I think you could potentially do more than one variation but for this example we're just going to stick with one so n equals 1 just means give us one variation as output to this API call the next thing is going to be the size of the output image so we're giving it 1,24 pixels by 1,24 pixels that's input so we want to go ahead and get the same output for our variation image and that's it we're going to Traverse down to this response object it's got a data property that gives us access to a list we're going to access the first element inside the list that's going to be an object with a property called URL and when we access that URL it's actually going to give us the URL to the CDN or the the hosted version of this generated image just like before these images are only available at that URL for a limited time I think it's like 1 hour so make sure that you download that image if you like it or you upload it somewhere else if you want to use it elsewhere on the web so we assigned the result of that to the image for URL variable and then we go ahead and print it to our console so python main.py wait for it to send us back this image and print out the URL and then we'll check it out in our browser and here we are so I'm going to control click on PC it's command click on Mac I believe on this URL we'll go to the browser over here and there's our variation so I I don't know if I showed you the original image let me go ahead and toggle back and show you the original here's the original you probably recognize this image the man the myth the legend himself Bucky Roberts and here's the variation original variation similar color of a tshirt similar type of tshirt the hat is on backwards in the variation definitely some differences but this is pretty cool kind of fun a little creepy but pretty interesting so there's all kinds of stuff you can do with this and it's only a few lines of code so definitely be sure and check this out mess around with it and let us know what you come up with in the comments we'd love to hear how you're using these tutorials to create projects of your own that's it for this video thanks a lot for tuning in so glad to have you all here and can't wait to see you in the next video until next time peace
