and then finally we are just placing the data that we've just discussed inside our email feedback div uh span let's refresh and uh test this out so I'm going to go ahead and type Alex um in fact we can't really test its functionality until we've done something in email. PHP and that's to pick up this variable and return it so I'm going to create an if statement I'm going to first of all check if the email variable that sent is set so I've used if is set post email then I'm going to go ahead and echo doore poost in fact let's just make this into a variable so email equals dollcore poost email now uh just a quick note it's up to you whether you want to sanitize this data or not if it's going into a database then it's strongly or highly recommended you sanitize this data and by that I mean either use HTML entities if you know you're displaying it onto a page at further times uh this will help prevent um crosssite scripting attacks so xss attacks or the MySQL real Escape string function uh which will replace uh specific special characters in order to help prevent SQL injection however for the purposes of this tutorial I'm neither putting my data into a database table nor am I displaying it back to the user so I'm not going to saniz sanitize the data in this case anyway we're going to go ahead and Echo our email so now our Ajax is sending the data we're then retrieving the data here and we're then echoing it back out now the echo will then be placed into this data variable and then inside the email feedback span so let's go ahead and test so I'm going to type Alex and you can see that it's returning everything I type so Alex at PHP academy.org it's constantly returning this value now the one thing to knowe is that I'm moving away and coming back and it's still carrying out this um validate email function it's not when we focus in just showing go on enter valid email address so that's an important stage of it that we're calling the function at these two uh key points where we need the validation to take place okay so now let's go on to actually um validating and then returning this value so um let's just get rid of that for now um all I'm going to do inside of this function is return data okay so uh this function will then equal the data that we get back from email. PHP and inside here we need to start actually validating the email address so I'm going to create an if statement here um I'm going to say if not empty email we're going to go ahead and do something here so the email address must contain some value and then going to create another if statement and the condition for this uh we're going to use the filter VAR function and the filter VAR function takes typically two parameters we're only going to be giving it two you can spec uh specify additional par parameters but we're not going to uh be using them uh filter V we're validating this email address and we need to say filter validate email now this function will either return true or false so if it's equal to false we know that uh the email address is not valid so we're going to Echo that doesn't appear to be a valid email address otherwise we should have a valid email or we will have a valid email let's just tidy them up and then we can Echo valid email address okay so now we are passing this variable email we are checking it using the filter VAR function against false first of all um then we're just returning the appropriate error otherwise we assume a valid email address now at the moment I've just returned this data so this data will now either either contain this value here or this value here now we need to actually display it so we've returned the data and you'll notice that nothing will actually display you'll see that we you know we aren't we aren't actually displaying anything inside of that um inside of the span here the reason for this is because we've only returned the data and we haven't actually echoed it out or sorry not echoed it out applied it to this email feedback div so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to create a variable called result and that's going to equal validate email um I'm going to do the same here as well far result equals validate email now this is a bit inefficient because we're we're creating the same variable twice for each well depending on each uh event we choose um we could Define this as a um as a variable elsewhere um however just for now we're going to be keeping them as two separate um variables
