hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be looking at the jquery focus in event handler and then in the next video we're going to be looking at the focus out handler essentially what we're going to be creating is a form field where the user would be to type for example their name and when we focus in we're going to give the user a bit more information to help them out and then when they focus away perhaps onto the page itself or on to another field we remove this span text so just so we can get the idea of what we're creating let's go ahead and create our input type our input field and as well as span so input type is equal to text and I'm going to give this an ID of name I'm then going to create a span afterwards and the ID of the span is going to be say name span and I'll in that span tag there I just have to label in front of here so for example your name now let's go refresh our page in our browser and see this you've got your name and we can type in a name here now what we want to happen is as soon as the user focuses in to this field either by tabbing down the page for example they might come from this field to another field that's why we're using focus in and not the on click or the click event in jQuery if we were to use the click event for this the user would have to click rather than tab down the page so as soon as this field is in focus in some way or another then the span here will give us a bit more information so let's go ahead and start to create our our javascript file I'm gonna save it in the J's folder and I'm gonna call this focus is okay so inside index dot PHP we need to include this in our page so let's go ahead and include this here so the script type is text slash JavaScript the source is Jay s /fo 'kiss dr. J s and will come just to end at the script there so now we've included focused at Jay s we can go ahead and start to write the code inside so we reference the text field with creative which is name so we can write in here hash name now we want to say focus in so dot focus in and this is the event handler and that we need inside of this we're going to create a function and we'll just pull that down so we can work inside a block here now what we want to do is add some text to this span here so let's go ahead and reference that we're gonna say hash named span dot HTML and we can write in enter your full name so now what's going to happen is when we refresh our page and we click here we get this text enter your full name now let's go ahead and duplicate the current field we have and actually create something else so I'm gonna say your age I'm going to keep this as a input type of text but I'm going to change this to age and similarly similarly I'm going to change this to age as well oh no sorry yep we need age just here so let's surround these in paragraphs just to separate this out and we'll be able to see out two fields one below each other so when we click on your name it says unto your full name when we cook on age nothing happens at the moment because we don't have a handle of this let's take the easy option and we'll go and just copy and paste this down and we'll change this here to age we'll change this here to age and we'll change the message so enter your current age okay so now that that's working when we click on your name we get this spam filled with this text when we click on here we get this span filled with this text however what happens if we were to click on your name and then we tab down we still get the text if we were using the click function or the click event handler you'll notice that it will work a bit differently so let's change both of these to click refresh the page in our browser when I click on it it still works we still have this information relayed back to the user however I'm going to press tab on my keyboard to tab down to age and you'll see that we don't get this text appear in the span here so the reason we use focus in is to actually allow this event to take place or this event handler to be called when we actually have focus on the text area rather than a user clicking on it it's extremely unlikely that a user would come along to a website and click each individual field so now that we know the reason why we use the focus in in the next tutorial we're going to be looking at focus out to get rid of this span when the user focuses away from it
