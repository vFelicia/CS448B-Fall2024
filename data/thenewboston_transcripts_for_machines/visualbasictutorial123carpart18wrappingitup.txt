hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and this is the final tutorial for the car program now I know I got real uh deep into the logic and the coding of this we got over 200 lines into this program and it got confusing uh at Parts probably really confus confusing for some of you so uh this is going to be the final video cuz I don't want to keep confusing you even more and after this we're going to go back to some of the more core subjects of Visual Basic instead of making a specific application now if you remember my create car sub right here it wasn't the best made but it worked and hopefully it gets the concept across to you guys about how to work with objects how to store objects use inheritance and polymorphism um you learn the WID keyword and a whole bunch of stuff sorry I had to pause there for a second but anyways you're going to be learning you learned a whole bunch of stuff about inher polymorphism I'm using objects array lists and stuff like that so if this didn't confuse you too much uh then I'm going to challenge you guys to expand on this program um add some stuff with a truck and the sports car and you can add buttons here that will get different information about the car and let you set values to the car or the truck and create new forms for like new car new sports car new truck and stuff like that and uh if you can do that and if you want to do that then go ahead and leave it down in one of the video responses so that we can take a look at the program you've made um sorry I'm kind of just like dropping out of this program right now but I got all the stuff across that I wanted to teach you and I don't want to drag it on for too long so if you want to work on it you can so let's just do um one more final demo of this so we can create our new car let's create a truck we'll click new car we got the name of our truck so we'll do uh Dodge Ram we'll set the color of the truck to Red we'll give it four two doors and it'll set the horsepower to 300 and we'll click add now we can show the info about this um we can do a whole bunch of other stuff we can show the info about these cars we can set values of this so uh we can make it orange we can accelerate by let's say 45 mph and we can show the info and it updates that now um we cannot get the power to weight ratio uh because it is not a sports car so what I'm challenging you guys to do is disable this button unless they have selected a sports car um so that they can't they won't get any errors and then we can add more trucks we're get out a sports car the name of the sports car to um we'll do a challenge chenger even though that's like more of a muscle car we'll make it blue we'll give it two doors and we'll give it 400 horsepower we'll click add and we can get the power to weight ratio uh we can change the doors whatever we want so as I was saying you can um expand on this if you want uh but for now we're going to move back to the Core Concepts of Visual Basic so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
