hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another video for the new Boston now in the last tutorial we looked at left join and I used left join for this example where we're returning a name with a pet arm on the end so we're saying here down here with the result was from this query we've said Alex as a cat Alex as a fish and out as a dog now what happens if we go into pets here and we're going to delete the entry for Dale so people ID was Dale let's go ahead and delete that and let's run this query again let's paste it in there and we'll click go now you'll see that we've returned Dale add null it next to pair so this is useful the left join is useful for returning the name of the person because the the table we used on the left was the name and even if there are no values in pet so what we've essentially done here is said if there even if there are no entries in the right table which is which is pet still returned the name of the left hand side table which is named now the reason this is useful is because M PHP if we were to run this we'd need to know if the user had no pets at all this would save us using PHP num rows because we would just eat say if the pet equals null then obviously this user has no pets whatsoever so where we've used the left join for this now what happens if we were to use join on its own so let's go into SQL tab and let's go and paste this in here now instead of using left join I'm going to just use join let's go out click go and see how this differs now you'll see that we've removed the result Dale the reason that we've removed the result Dale is because we have reusing the join which will only return values that equal or that are found and based on this on here so we're saying if people ID equals pet store people ID so we're returning using the join only values that exist in each table so we're not saying does it only exist in the left table or does it only exist in the right table which does it exist in both tables so now what we're doing is we're only returning the data where the left table matches the right table so why could this be useful well we might want to inside of our PHP program eventually when we're executing this query or running this SQL query we might want to say we only want values where someone actually has a pet whereas before in the left join we looked at where Dale didn't have a pair we want to just say with the join only return results where user has a pet or where name has a pet the person has a pet so in this case we've returned two rows where Alex has a cat and Alex has a fish so now you can see the use of the join on its own as opposed to the left join where it where we're returning we're returning a value even if the user on the arm or the user doesn't have a value in the right hand table so this on is really important because what we're doing is we're making the comparison at this point so the comparison could be any operator but for now is people do ID equals pets people ID so we're matching from the left and the right and if we don't match we're not returning the values with the join
