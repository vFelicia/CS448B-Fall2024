alright guys welcome to your 46 C++ tutorial and this tutorial might be a little longer than normal I might even have to split it up into two tutorials because I'm going to be talking about a subject called composition and I'm going to need to build a few classes so anyways composition is the idea that you know whenever you build a class it has members aka variables and usually a class just has some regular functions in it and some regular integer variables maybe a couple string variables well aside from just functions and regular variables a class can also have objects of another class as its member so you can stick objects inside classes as well so you know like whenever we created an object we always created it in main right here well you can actually have it inside other classes so let's go ahead and take a look at that and again composition is what it's called so the first thing we need to do is create a couple new classes so file new class I know you can't see that but I already showed you guys before so what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be creating one class called birthday and that's pretty much just going to be storing a birthday which would be mine like twelve 2886 that's its only job so go ahead and create that and go ahead and press yes and okay so now we have a blank birthday class with nothing in it except you know the template so now what I want to do is build yet another class so file new class and I'm going to name this class people now go ahead and uncheck that and go ahead and press create and of course yeah I want to add it to my project and go ahead and whatever that thing said so what I'm going to be doing is every single person who's live has a birthday so wouldn't it be cool if inside this people class we can store a birthday or a date as one of its members so I'm basically going to be taking an object from a birthday class and storing it inside the people class and then running the main program for main so let's go ahead and get started first so in your birthday header file go ahead and delete protected because I didn't teach you guys that yet but in our private we're going to have three private variables in month which was the month of the birthday and and I said int in day and int year so that's man I cannot talk I keep saying for some reason anyways this birthday class has three variables it has a month a day in a year and what we're going to be doing is in can in our constructor we're going to be passing it in that information so let's just go ahead and pass in M for men and D for day and int Y for Year so we're going to go ahead and set the birthday whenever we create the object so now it's going to have one more function in it and that's void print dates and all this is going to do is print out the birthday on the screen simple enough so now let's go over to birthday CPP and it already includes birthday header but we already know that we need to include this stuff as well so go ahead and copy this and paste it right under here so now it includes everything we need it to include so of course the first thing we do is delete this comment because I hate comments and in our birthday constructor remember it takes three pieces of information a month a day in the year so let's go ahead and just actually steal this from over here copy that and paste it right in there so now it has three pieces of information that we passed in a month a day in the year so what we can do is use those values the set equal to the variables we needed we have a month variable add a variable in a year variable and all of those variables need a value so go ahead and for month set equal to the value passed in 4m fourday set equal to the value passed in 4d and for a year set equal to the value you passed in for y so as you can see now whenever we pass in our three pieces of information it sets em to month B for day white a year and this is going to be 12 equals month 28 equals day in 1986 equals year because that's when I was born so that's what I'm doing so aside from that we already know that we have to create this one extra function called print date and now this function does is print a date out on the screen so let's go ahead and make that right now void birthday print date it already knows that we need it and of course it doesn't take any parameters and all it does is print out something on the screen so C out month day and year and well might as well go ahead and add a end line for that so what it's going to do is print out the month slash day slash year slash and I know that this is formats kind of weird I think it's different in England and Great Britain but for those of you overseas yeah this is how we do things here in America we also measure like links with twelve instead of ten so yeah that makes it a whole lot easier like 12 inches in a foot who the heck decided there should be 12 inches in a foot is that it just you know 1010 would make things a lot easier but you know we have two stupid American system over here but anyways there's my little rant for the day now I can go ahead and work in my other class so after we're done working with birthday class and check it out we go ahead and we made everything here and everything here we are done with it let's hop over to our people class and the first thing that we need to do is include a couple of things um whenever I'm making a excuse me a people object I'm going to be giving it a name like Bucky Roberts so since we're going to be passing it in a name we need to be able to work with strings so include string and that will include the string class and aside from that we also need to include this birthday header file so go ahead and copy and paste and the reason we need to include this birthday header file is because as one of the members aside from just regular variables we're also going to be storing a birthday object in this class so if we don't have this birthday header file it's it would think we're just trying to make a weird variable or something and we'll get a error so that's why we need to include the birthday header file and aside from that we need the using namespace standard to get all our standard uh where you have people had her there you go all our standard crap so let's go ahead and start working on the people class so the very first thing why I should probably tell you guys is what information is going to be in this class well as I said before everyone has a name and everyone has a birthday so go ahead and put string name and go ahead and as a birthday we're going to go ahead and use a birthday object as a member of this class so whenever you want to use an object of another class inside this class you go ahead and first type the class name birthday and then you go ahead and give it a variable like date of birth so now this class people H every person in this class is going to have a name and a date of birth but we're not just going to pass it in the date of birth we're going to pass it in a date of birth object pretty cool huh so aside from that um we might as well go ahead and we're going to be passing in the constructor so we're just going to pass the name in is variable X and we're going to pass the birthday in as a birthday object so we'll call it Bo so whatever name we pass it in for X is going to set equal to name and whatever birthday object we pass in a Bo it's going to set it equal to the date of birth pretty cool huh so now let's hop over to people without CPP and you know I think I'm going to wait to do this until my next tutorial because this one's getting kind of long and I hate long video files they always mess up if they get too long so um in the next tutorial I'm going to show you guys how to write your people that CPP class and also how to tie everything together in main so the program works fine and smooth so thank you guys for watching that's all you get for now so hopefully I'll see you guys in next tutorial
