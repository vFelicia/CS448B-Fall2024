we come back to insert and we want to insert a new value in fact we'll do this in a query so we want to insert into users values so we've got our ID we've got ID our first name out but our using my password our first name in our last name so we've got Alex a password Alex and Garrett so let's click go now what you can see is oh ok alright maybe not so let's go back to operations hmm uh ok so I set it to zero it needs to be set to 1 sorry so click go let's come and delete this query I've just put in there and what that will do is now when we want to reinsert some data so insert into users values ID user name password first name surname if you set up this structure first what makes a lot easier to look at and say just enter your data so password Alex and Garrett let's click go now you can see that we've inserted it with a row ID hmm ok right ok um some reason this doesn't want to go back that's odd perhaps we need to delete before we do this so let's come into browse and click delete operations come and change this to one click go let's just check that's definitely been changed that's one yeah it has so let's um let's insert that again certainly getting lots of practice inserting how using this SQL so insert into users values OOP too many commas so we've got the username password again Alex and gap so let's click go okay so inserted row ID one so if you were to delete all the data in your table and you want to start ID one again then just click on the operations tab and you can do that from there so these are some of the basic queries if you like that we've performed to insert delete data and modify data and there's plenty more things you can do things that you can use joins with combinations of tables if you're struggling with this then just have a play around with it creating data deleting modifying just selecting from different places as well we also have things called ordering so we can order we can order things and limit things as well now let's just insert a few more bits of data so user name Billy password password and then Billy Karen let's insert some more say Dale password kara click go so we've got three bits of data in here so we're just imagining that we've got lots and lots of data for now we've got idea of one two and three now assuming that ID is one for Alex and ID is three for Dale Alex will have been created a lot earlier than Dale we've created Alex first then Billy then Dale because we're using the ideas and ordering system now it's probably best to use timestamps in this case and I have a tutorial on timestamps that you should go back and look at if you don't already know but when you're inserting data you should probably always use a field with a timestamp in it and therefore what you can do is you can order order your rows depending on when that row was created so when the row was created the timestamp will be will you know you'll be able to order it because it's just an integer just a large integer but for now I'm going to order using ID now what happens if I want to order this and display all users but in order of the last user first so I want Dale to be first then Billy than Alex now if you don't know what I mean I'm going to just going to show you if we go to select say um first name and the I could it's surname or last name let's just have a check at surname say first name and surname from users all that's going to do is select everything so let's just copy and paste that so we can use it later let's click go you can see that what's happened is is we've returned Alex Garrett Billy Garrett Dale Guerra now like I said I want to structure this so Dale is at the top then Billy there Alex for example you may have a page on your website that says the new like a member list and you want to structure your member list with the newest member at the top in this case this is ordered in descending we've started from the first user and we're just sending down what if we want it ascending we want to go from the from the last one and we want to go up to the top so what we do is we need to change our query in order to adhere to this so what we need to do is we need to do this order by and we want to order it by a specific column and this column as we've discussed is ID so order by ID now it's fair enough ordering by ID but how are we ordering now we can order by ascending or descending and it's written ASC or de SC okay so yeah de SC so I want to order by ascending first of all I'm going to click go and you can see that it's um it's a order date in ascending order now if I want to descend from Dale to Alex all I need to do is make a simple edit to my query and I want to say order descending in capitals so we can see what we're doing so I'm now ordering it in descending order so if we click go you can see that Dale's at the top then Billy then Alex so like I said this could be important for something a list that you want to order in a specific order you could be ordering by say a price or you could be ordering by a date that comment was made so if you had a comment system on your website you'd be storing comments in a table you'd assign the dates to a field called times and then you can order by that time so there's many uses for things like ordering so now what happens if I only want to show the first two recently registered users which in this case would be dial and Billy I can use this thing called limit the limit keyword so order by ID descending space limit and then a number so limit 3 limit to limit 1 if you had lots of records you can say limit hundred so I'm going to limit by 2 so simple as that limit space to remember your space after you're descending as well so we don't need any sort of commas or anything in between these we just need spaces so now what we're doing is we're order it with selecting the first name in the surname from users we're ordering by the ID in descending limits or the so from the most recently inserted row to the least M or the first I guess and then we're limiting by 2 so by clicking this we can go you can see that we're only returning the first two rows so I think that's about all for the most basic queries things like that that we're going to be using on a regular basis you will pick up more as we go along especially inside PHP when we need to do things like joins but for now that's basic queries and I've demonstrated this in PHP myadmin which is a really good place to mess around and try things out in an environment where you can visualize things rather than going straight into PHP so if you visualize this first and have a play around as soon as you understand it then we can proceed to doing this but inside PHP
