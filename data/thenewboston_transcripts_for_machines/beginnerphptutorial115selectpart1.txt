hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial we've already looked at or in the past tutorial we've already looked at connecting to our database now to make this a lot more efficient so we can include it where we require it I'm just going to get rid of everything in our index dot PHP file and I'm going to create a new file make sure this is enclosed in PHP tags and the reason I'm doing this is I'm now going to save it as connecting PHP now what I can do with this now is whenever I open up a new page let's say it might be index.php or something else dot PHP all I can do is at the top I can require connect dot PHP and this way we've required this file to be the first will exist because require will kill the rest of the page if this can't be found second of all connect connects to our database so now what we can do is under here we can start doing things to allow us to grab some data from our database okay so let's assume that we've connected to our database properly let's come into database and refresh from the last tutorial oK we've got nothing up so under here let's echo maybe okay out just so we know that it's working let's refresh okay so we've got okay so the first thing we know is that we've required the file correctly the file exists second of all we know that we've connected properly because we haven't killed here so this should always come at the top of your page so let's go to a PHP myadmin and inside this a database I'm going to insert some some data so oh well we need a table first I'm going to call this table food a number of fields I'm going to say let's say we need an ID field we need a the name of the food and I'm going to say the calories and whether it's unhealthy or healthy so I'm going to have four fields so let's create these fields we're going to ID with is going to be int we're going to have the indexes primary because this is a unique and AI which is auto increment it's going to be yes so we want this Auto increment next is going to be food and then we're going to say calories and then we're going to say I'm going to call this healthy or unhealthy I'm going to call it hu in fact let's make it a bit easier to stay healthy and healthy and this is going to be equal to I'm going to say a varchar' length one so if the foods healthy this value is going to equal H if it's unhealthy it's going to equal you the food I'm going to save our chart of let's say 25 and calories is going to stay an int because we're always going to have an integer number for the amount of calories in the food so let's go along down here and I'm going to click Save so let's hopefully we're going to return yet we've returned table has been created so let's browse we can't browse the data but we can see the structure got ID as a primary key in into food of avatar 25 calories in healthy unhealthy varchar' 1 so storing either an H or au for this ok so let's go and insert a row of data I'm going to put the food remember the ID can be blank because that's automatically gonna equal 1 the food I'm going to say pizza the calories I'm going to say a thousand an unhealthy or healthy I'm going to say u for unhealthy let's just uncheck this ignore mal insert another row food let's say salad calories I'm going to say 200 and I'm going to say it's healthy so I'm going to put an H so let's click on go that's inserted them two rows that's successfully done now we can click browse and view this data so we can see that we've got an ID which is unique we've got the food name the calorie amount and healthy or unhealthy so let's say I want to select all the data and display now to select all data we need to first perform a query as we've discussed the needs to select all the data so I'm going to create a variable called query and this is going to be equal to some string text so I'm using double quotation marks because remember we're using singles inside the inside the query so this query is going to be select now we need to mention the field names so select I'm going to say food and calories so food calories separated by a comma from up with a space so from and this table is called food so we need to mention that where in fact we can encase these in here as well so we're selecting the filled food and calories which is what we're going to display if we needed to display for example the ID as well we choose ID but we don't we just want to we just want to keep that hidden for now so food calories from food wear and I want to say in fact no don't say anything that's it we can specify an order bias we can say order by ID for example that's absolutely fine so order by ID now what we need to do is we need to actually perform the query as far as this goes we haven't actually executed the query within the database we refresh our page you see that nothing's happening we're not actually executing the query so query I'm going to say run equals now we're using this MySQL query function to actually run the query so you can either use the MySQL query function on its own and insert your structured query language in there or what you can do is just then pop that inside of it so we're popping this query in here and then this is running the query ok what we can also do is we can use this or Die but what I'm going to do is I'm going to say and so I've just deleted that I didn't mean to comment that I'm going to say if query run equals MySQL query query then run this block the reason I'm doing this is because if the query is successful this will evaluate to true and then we can continue with our code but I'm going to say otherwise query failed okay so echo query success now what we're not doing is we're not displaying the result of this query just yet we're just performing the query we can use some functions later on to display the results but for now what we're doing is we're just saying query success if this query makes sense and and return something and is structured properly otherwise we're saying query failed
