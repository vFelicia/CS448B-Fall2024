hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on the game so if you remember from the previous tutorial we created the button attack event and whatever you click attack it will attack the enemy so let's go ahead come up here to form one and we never form one loads we'll just go ahead and set progress bar Popeye dot value equals hero dot health and you can see that health doesn't show up by there so we need to come over here to the Popeye class and we need to create a public property so public property health as integer go ahead and and hit enter and if we just type set we get set and our get all these can be in any order you would like so in our case we have set before so whenever we get it we will return int health and whenever we set it value or no int health will equal value so now that we have our health property let's go ahead come back in to form one BB and you can see that this works fine so whenever they use their spinach what we want to do is we want to update this label right here so we'll come back into form one BB and once it takes out the spinach we will just type we will set the label so label spinach left dot text is going to be equal to spinach left and then we'll go ahead and add int spinach dot to string so we just convert it to a string to display it on the forum so if you remember remember from the previous tutorial if the health drops below zero we will get an error and if the program will freeze up and stop working because a progress bar bar cannot have a value of less than zero so we'll go ahead and use an if statement or not an if statement let's go ahead and use a try statement so try it's gonna go ahead and try to set this program progress bar and we'll go ahead and catch that exception so if we get an exception saying it's below then what we want to do is tell the user that they have one so we will just type message box dot show pop I has one and after we've shown that what we want to do is generate another enemy so it will just generate enemy there so that the user has a new enemy to fight once he has one so let's go ahead and try this out and see if everything works fine so you can see that we have both progress bars are at their fullest and let's go ahead and attack you can see that it takes away some health we can attack again we can keep attacking we can use spinach and you can see that says we have two left then we have one left and we have zero left and you can see that it says Popeye has one now let's go ahead and if spinach left equals zero and we'll just disable this radio button so we will go ahead and come down here to button attack and if it's checked and in spinach is equal to zero I mean greater than zero then we'll do that but else if in spinach equals zero then what do we want to do we want to type radio' spinach dot enabled equals false so we'll go ahead and run this we can use spinach so one two we've got one left we've got 0 left you can see that it's gonna disable it for us but it disabled it after so what we what we need to do is let's go ahead and copy this right here and we will put it as the first thing that happens when this button is clicked so if in spinach equals zero then what do we want to do well we will just go ahead and uncheck that radio button so radio spinach dot checked equals false so it's going to uncheck it for us and then we'll go ahead and disable it dot enabled equals false so we will take this out right here and now let's go ahead and run this and see that we've got new spinach we got two left we got one left we've got 0 left and then if we click it it disables it and unchecked it for us you can see that the enemy still has some health left so we keep attacking it says Popeye has one ok so now all we need to do is we need to have the enemy fight back after every time it has been attacked so we'll come over here to our toolbox and let's go ahead and add a timer so we'll go ahead and look for one here's a timer right here and we will minimize the toolbox so here's our timer we want to set the name to timer delay and we'll set the interval to one second or 1000 milliseconds so let's go ahead and double click on timer delay tick and so whenever they attack what we want to do is we want to start the timer so we will just type timer delay dot start so the timer's going to start every time they attack but when you do enclose this inside of this trycatch statement so that if the enemy has been defeated it won't start that timer so now whenever the timer click whenever the timer ticks what we want to do is make the enemy attack
