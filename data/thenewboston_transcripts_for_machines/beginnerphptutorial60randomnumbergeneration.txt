hello this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is another video for the new Boston now at some point when you program in PHP you are going to need to Generate random numbers now the first thing I'm going to do is show you how to generate a random number how we can specify a lower and an upper limit and then I'm going to talk a bit about why you might need to uh specif oh generate a random number so when we use the Rand function which looks like this we can either Supply no arguments at all or we can supply two arguments now we're first of all going to look at supplying no argument so if I was to just Echo Rand or in fact create a variable called Rand that we can use later on in our program then um now random number in PHP is automatically seeded so there's no need to do anything all you have to actually do is call Rand now at the moment because we haven't supplied arguments this is going to uh generate a random number between a minimum and a maximum amount and the minimum amount is I think Z or 1 and the maximum is a prespecified amount so let's just take a look at the preview of this in our browser you can see that we've now generated 3,150 now 10,631 180 so we're going lower towards the lower limit back up to the higher Li limits and we can keep refreshing and we'll have a random number now this isn't unique so every time you refresh it will automatically recede and we will be um we will be uh generating perhaps the same number twice now um if I was to uh look at this I can see that there's obviously an upper limit because we're not going into say the millions but there is a way we can find out this up a value uh so if I say Max equals and it's a get Rand Max function now what this will do is this will um specify the maximum amount of uh the maximum integer that this random value can be when we've specified just Rand on its own so let's uh put forward slash in there and then Max so essentially what we're seeing is the random number out of the maximum so let's have a look at what that's produced you can see now we've got 9552 out of 32,767 32,767 in this case is the maximum number that can be generated and the number that has been generated is 9552 so you'll see that as we uh refresh this value will stay the same however the random number that's being generated will uh will uh sort of increase decrease and change so what what happens if we don't want to use all this and we just want to Echo out a random number between a specific amount let's say you creating a dice game where you user had to roll a dice randomly so I'm going to come down here and I'm going to create a form and the action is going to be uh this current page uh which is index.php and the method is going to be post and what I'm going to do is I'm simply going to create one button and that's uh a submit button with the name roll and the value roll a dice or is it d uh I'm not too sure what say roll dice it's uh irrelevant here okay so inside PHP let's just get rid of all this for now we want to first of all check if this button has been pressed this is something by now you probably should know how to do so we're saying if is set dollar poost remember we're using a post variable here um roll and uh oh that's it actually that's all we need to do because we're clicking a button so if uh the button has been clicked we can say clicked just to uh test this for now clicked okay so let's uh refresh our page we can click on this and it will come up with click so you sort of get the idea of where this is going what we're going to do is we're going to generate a random number between 1 and six when we press this because a dice has six sides so let's um create a new variable called Rand and we'll call that equal that to Rand now we're going to Echo out u r a and then we're going to append on this random number now as it stands at the moment we have um clicking the button it's giving us a massive number which is irrelevant to a dice so the program is pointless however if I was to specify just two arguments in here we can specify a minimum and a maximum or a lower and an upper limit limit so we can say between 1 and six now so I've said one for the first argument six for the second now this is an inclusive value so we could we could be echoing a one we could be echoing a six but we're not going to be echoing anything less than a one or anything more than a six and obviously the numbers in between so let's have a look here let's refresh at the moment it says you rolled a four we can click it again you rolled a two you rolled a six you rolled a four you roll a three a one so we've pretty much had every value and we could keep clicking that and it will never go over six and it will never be under one so that is one um fun use if you like for the random function now what are the other reasons we might use it now when we're uploading files we might want to specify ify a random um a random uh array of if you like of um numbers and characters and letters and things like that anything really now the random function is really useful because it's going to produce a more or less random value every time which you can combine with other random values and letters of your choice and even md5 hashes which you can look at on one of my other videos so the random function is great for doing what it says and if you do need to use a random function all you need to do is call Rand you can specify a lower and an upper limit a minimum a maximum limit if you'd like to call it that or you can just leave it blank and you uh will be generating a number with a predefined upper limit so that's the random function in PHP
