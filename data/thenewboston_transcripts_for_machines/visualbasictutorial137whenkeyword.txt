hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and this tutorial we're gonna be talking about the win keyword now the wind' keyword is similar to the if statement so what it does is let's say you want to catch an index out of range exception only when a certain value has occurred so let's go ahead and create a for loop here so for index as integer equals 0 to 5 what we want to do is add each one of the items from my array to the list box and you can see that we have my array up here which is an integer array and it's got 5 4 3 2 1 and this holds 0 1 2 3 4 and once we hit 5 we have an index out of range exception so we want to catch this index out of range exception only when a certain thing has happened so we'll just type win and now what we can do is type whatever we want right here so let's go ahead and to be able to access index let's declare it outside of our try try catch statement so dim index as integer so now what we need to do is just get rid of this right here so for index equals 0 okay so now that we have index outside of our trycatch statement we can run this index out of right exception when index is equal to five so if index is equal to anything other than five and we get this exception right here it's not going to run what's right here so let's go ahead and run this we'll go ahead and click add all and you can see this it says do not access memory that isn't there then it's got I on the finally and it beeps right there so if we do when index is equal to six you can see that if we click at all the program freezes up and crashes because index is not equal to six it is equal to five is equal to five when the error happens and not equal to six so we can do is if we really want it to only run when index is equal to six we can add a catch IX as exception right here and this will catch anything that hasn't already been caught let's say we use the win keyword and it's not going to catch it we can go ahead and catch it down here so we'll just type message box dot show e x dot message so if we go ahead and run this if we click at all it says index was outside the balance of the array and this is not don't access memory that that isn't there because index is equal to five when the exception occurs and this only runs when index is equal to six and then we've got I am the finally now we can add as many win keywords as we want and you can use them when index let's say is equal to null so if we just put win index is equal to no and let's do let's do nothing okay so when index is equal to nothing if a no reference exception happens then it's going to show this message box right here so go ahead practice a bit with the wind' keyword and once you got that down what you know they try the catch I'm using different kinds of exceptions throwing your own exceptions they using finally and whatever else once you got that down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
