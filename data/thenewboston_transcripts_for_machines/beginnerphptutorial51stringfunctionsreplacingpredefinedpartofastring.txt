hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is another PHP video Tut tutorial for the New Boston now in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about the Str Str replace function now let's have a look at what this looks like it's St strore replace now you've probably already worked out what it does if not I'll talk to you uh a bit about that the St Str replaced um typically takes three arguments uh these are the required arguments the first one is a string uh that you want to look into the second is what you want to replace a specific word with and the last is um the words that you'd like to replace um no in actual fact it's uh the other way around for the string um it's the words that you want to look for so um looking for the words here uh what you want to replace and the last argument is uh the string that you want to look in so let's uh create an example of this we'll just get rid of this function here um I'm going to create a string up here and I'm going to make this equal to this is an example and um well this is a string and is an example okay so what we first of all need to do is create a new variable you can Echo out the function in itself but it's always good practice to create a new variable so I'm going to say string uh or no I'm going to create new string equals Str Str replace and then inside here we can start to put in our parameter our arguments so the first one is going to be the words that the word that you want to replace so I'm going to replace the word is inside of this now the next argument is what you want to replace it with and I'm just going to replace it with nothing then the last is is where you're looking so we're looking inside this string variable here uh which is equal to this value here so what we're doing is in this function we're looking through the whole string and we're removing the word is because we're replacing the word is with nothing so we'll be removing this we'll be removing this and we'll also be be removing this this so let's have a look and we'll come down here and Echo out new string let's tidy this up a it okay so let's refresh and you can see that we've removed the is from here we've removed the is after that and we've removed the is uh before the after the and and before the an so what happens if we want to replace um a lot of words so maybe we want to replace is with something and string with something and maybe even example with something now you could come down and um copy and paste this and say oh sorry didn't mean to delete that and we could say uh we want to replace string with nothing as well and then when we refresh you can see that that goes as well but you can see what's happened the ises have come back so um what ha what's going on here is that we it's a it's not a great way of um or actually we could change this here to New string and refresh so that's got rid of both of them so we're just using the uh the new string before however you can see that this is a really really horrible not very nice way of doing things it's going to be slower and it's just not going to look right so there's a simple solution um if you've already looked at arrays you'll know what arrays are how they work and what their uses are but this is a really really useful way um um to replace manyu so we're going to create a variable called find and we're going to make this an array now inside here we're going to create a few variables in the array or a few uh values of this array that we want to replace so I'm going to choose three I'm going to choose um is string and example so I want all these words in here to be taken out of here or replaced with something else so what am I going to put in this value here we've already selected selected the uh value is but simply I could just put find in there and what this function is automatically going to do is it's going to look through each one of these and find each one and simultaneously replace them with what you specify here so let's say I wanted to uh replace is with nothing string with nothing an example with nothing this function is now ready to work so let's refresh and see what happens you can see that that's deleted all three of the words so now what happens when we want to replace is with something but we want to place string an example or just string or just example with something else well it's exactly the same concept we can just create a new variable called replace and we can uh put the values that correspond to each one so I want to replace is with is in capitals string with string in capitals and I want to get rid of example so now what we can do is just simply put this replace in here and now we're all set set up with uh both arrays with the corresponding values that are going to be replaced so let's refresh and you can see that it's capitalized the is is in the sentence it's capitalized string and it's removed the word example so it's a really flexible way of doing things and it's obviously better to use an array now why is this function useful and why would you use it now the example I always give is that you may have a select few words that you don't want to appear in maybe some public post post on your website and the example and a good example for this is using uh a bad word filter or a swear word filter so we could have say um a list of um obscenities in a text document and we might want to read these in on a line by line basis we automatically then if we use the file function we read in um a text file with a line byline basis and they automatically put into an array so then you can automatically um replace uh or you can find within a certain uh string and you can automatically replace an array created by um uh different functions so this is a really really useful function in PHP that you'll probably come across at some point um otherwise for now practice with it um if you've already watched my tutorial on uh opening files um and opening up lines of files as uh an array then try and incorporate this into it and play around with it and see what you can come up with and even down here you could try and add some uh user input or uh or something that you know a user can input a certain amount of text and then we can uh Delete obscenities or star out obscenities uh corresponding to each value
