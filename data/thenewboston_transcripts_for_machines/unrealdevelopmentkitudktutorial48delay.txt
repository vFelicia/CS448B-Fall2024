what is going on guys welcome to your 48th udk tutorial and in this tutorial all I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be going through some of the more common actions in Kizmet because check it out if we go ahead and right click and try to add a new action let me just scroll through one of these um assigned controller actor Factory ex uh mitv activate what the heck is set scale control see a lot of those can get kind of confusing and you really don't have any idea because they aren't really described very well just from the title of them so what I want to do is I want to go over some of the more basic ones and give you guys a really good foundation of working with kisma and then whenever you're looking for something really specific you can get kind of a better idea of where to look and how it works but for now I'm not going to be going every over every single action and event but I am going to be giving you guys a really nice Foundation to work with so let me go ahead and tell you guys what's going on I moved back to this map remember this old map where you just go ahead and hit that switch and turn on the light well that's the map I'm going to be working with because it's a really simple system a trigger and something that happens it's a really simple example where I can demonstrate some of the more basic features of kismet so first of all let me clean this up by deleting the sound and might as well just go ahead and delete these by holding alt and clicking and now if I hold control and ALT and then control to move that around so now what we have is a trigger that light switch and the lights that can turn on whenever I hit this and off whenever I hit this so the very first action I'm going to be adding is something called a delay now use this a ton whenever you're making games so in order to use this just go ahead and rightclick new action and it's actually under miscellaneous and it's called a delay now delay works exactly like you would think but there's a couple weird tricks that I got to teach you guys about first of all whenever you have a delay I guess I might as well tell you guys what a delay is for those of you guys who just need a definition delay is pretty much a pause or a time period where you have to wait in your game so by default if you just go ahead and touch that trigger and start your delay it's going to wait 1 second by default it already has a second plug in there but we can change that if we want and whenever it's finished waiting a second it's going to go ahead and turn your lights on now like I said by default it's at 1 second but whenever you're watching this video one second may be hard to kind of determine so let's go ahead and change that to 3 seconds so let me go ahead and xit out of this and I'm just going to hit Play From Here and Now check it out whenever I hit my switch it's going to count one two three and then my lights are going to come on so that's all a delay is so we're saying all right what are those weird things that you needed to teach me well first of all it has some other settings here besides start and finish you also have a stop now whenever you want something to happen for you know a period of 3 seconds you can also program something to interrupt that for example if you ever played World of Warcraft or something and you know you had to skin an animal and it took like 3 seconds or if you were Conjuring a spell before you used it you know getting all that power together and it took 3 seconds but when you're in the middle of it some monster came and you know threw Apple at you your spell would cancel out well whenever whatever you were doing is stopped then it would not go to finish because the delay never finished that would actually go to aborted so you'd say all right if you back away from the light switch then this would stop and you know this would abort so you could do whatever you want then um pause is of course pause a delay you know what that means so you already know what finishing the board means finish means the delay ended successfully or bored means something happened where it ended early in this duration right here like I said you have the option of adding a delay right in the properties window right here but you also have the option of adding a variable now remember anything on the bottom of these actions are variables and what blue means you see that this one's a pink triangle this one's blue this one is pink and these are red blue means float now you just kind of got to memorize these but if you go ahead and add a new variable and a float a float is pretty much a number with decimal points on it so we can go ahead and give a duration this way by just adding you know 5.0 and now your delay is 5.0 so again you can do this either in the properties window or by adding a variable and by the way a variable is just extra information that your action needs so I was actually planning on covering something called a gate in this tutorial but I don't even know if I'm going to have time for that now so now that you guys are a pro with a delay pretty much a timer in the udk you're ready to move on to my next tutorial so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you then
