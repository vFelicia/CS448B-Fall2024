ok so now we're going to create a event handler on the end of this and this is focus so we go ahead and create a function inside of here and then we pull that down so this essentially means that we are selecting these input fields adding this attribute and then once this field here or the input type with email is selected or is in focus we want to do something so again this is only applying to all email fields so whenever an email field is in focus we want to do this so let's go ahead and write out what we want this to do the first thing we want to do is we want to check if the value is equal to the email default value and if so get rid of the contents of it for example if we were to go ahead and type let's just we were to go ahead and click this we want to actually get rid of all the contents unless there is any other content other than this original message in there so let's go ahead and do that now I'm going to create an if statement and the condition is again another selector is selecting this which only applies to the current email field so for example if you had two different email fields on the page this would only select the current one that's in focus so we want to say this if this dot Val is equal to email default so if it equals the original text as we click in ie enter your email address then we want to wipe it we want to wipe the contents so what we do is we say this dot attribute and again we choose the value attribute but this time you set this to nothing so now what's going to happen is when we click it it disappears but it only disappears if it's the original content for example if I was to go ahead and down type in Alex at PHP academy' org and navigate away and click back in it doesn't remove it if we hadn't of included this functionality here let's just go and get rid of that go and get rid of this here and get rid of this here what's going to happen is now when we click in yes it disappears but when we go ahead and type in a email address and navigate away then navigate back in it re wipes it in the field so we use this if statement to determine the count value matching the default value and therefore that's the only time we need to actually wipe it I'm going to go ahead and just down here append on another event handler and this is blur ie when the user moves away from the field so when a blur are cut occurs we want to handle or call back another function and this time we want to check it for nothing now the only time we want to re put this text back into the field you'll notice that at the moment when we click in click out we don't get this original value back in so we need it's been left as blank but what we want to happen is if we say type something in then delete it and then navigate back away from it we want the default text to be placed back in so again we need another if statement and obviously our block there now the condition this time is the same as the other one this dot vowel but this time is if it's equal to zero it's equal to nothing then we want to carry out an action so when we navigate away from this field by the clicking away or tabbing away from a field to another field or another element on the page we check if this value is equal to nothing and if the value is equal to nothing we want to go ahead and set the attribute value to back to the email default so again this dot attribute much like we did here but this time instead of removing it we want to put it back to the original value so value and this is email default so again if it's empty we're just changing the value of this to the you know default so let's refresh and let's click in and click away again you automatically notice that what we've done has taken it been taken into effect we click in and we click away now when I click in and type something and navigate away nothing happens because it's not eat the value of this is not equal to nothing when I click back in you'll notice that the nothing disappears because we've already checked this up here if the value is is the email default value then blank the field is not the default value so it doesn't blank and therefore we keep this email address in here so that's the input type selector you'll notice that if I was to go ahead and duplicate this email field so if I was to go ahead and duplicate this again so for example confirm email and we'll just change the well the type still email what's going to happen is is we have the same functionality for both fields now we have the same functionality for this one as we do for this one so we can go ahead and type in Alex PHP academy' de org navigate away nothing happens we can come in here again another gate away or we can go Alex PHP academy' org navigate away and we've got two email addresses with the message original message obviously disappeared and we're just left with these so using our L attribute selector like I said at the start of the tutorial we can use this for absolutely any element that supports this but for now I've just decided to create something that was a bit more applicable to real life as opposed to just talking about you know different elements we can select and I think this is a really good example of how to do this and also notice that we've used absolutely no code javascript code in main file we've used jQuery to handle all of this so we've eliminated the need for any JavaScript to be mixed in without HTML and like I said this is crosscompatible now so wherever you include selectors jeaious and jquery is this functionality will be available
