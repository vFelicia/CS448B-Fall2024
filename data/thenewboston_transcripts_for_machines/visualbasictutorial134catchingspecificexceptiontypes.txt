hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be learning more about TR catch statements now when you use the try catch statement you try the code and then if there an error happens this catches that error and then you can do whatever you want um if an error happens now you can also catch the exceptions themselves and um show the output of that so what I mean by this is let's go ahead and catch and then we're going to use a name for our exception you can name this however you want I'm just going to call it e and you can see here that it gives us a little help here it's got catch exception as and then exception type and then there's the win keyword uh which we will be learning about later on so we'll just call our exception ex as and we'll just do a simple exception so any kind of exception is going to fall under exception so let's go ahead and show an error has occurred and what we'll do is we'll add a new line so environment do new line and now what we're going to do is we're going to show that um error so we'll just access our error um object which is ex so if that error is caught it's created and we can show ex do2 string so let's go ahead and run this we will go ahead and click add all and you can see it says an error has occurred and it says system. index out of out of range exception index was outside the bounds of the array at TR catch. form one. button add click so this shows us the project this shows us the class this shows us the method uh in our CL in our case the button click event and it shows us the location of the uh where the program is run and it shows us the line number that the error is on now this is very useful when you're debugging your program and if you release a program you can have this in here and it will you can tell them to let's say email exceptions to them so that they can fix it in so that you can fix it in uh updates so let's go ahead and close out of this now we can also C catch uh certain exception types so we we'll catch an index out of range exception which is the type of except exception that this Tri block throws for us so throwing an exception is basically the what you would call an exception happening now you can also throw your own exceptions by using the throw keyword but we're going to learn about that later on so we're going to be catching an index out of range exception let's go ahead and run this we click add all and you can see that it gives us the same output here now let's go ahead and catch a different kind of exception here so let's go ahead and catch and you can see there's a whole bunch of exceptions that we can use so let's do um invalid time time zone exception so if we go ahead and run this click add all you can see that it crashes now the reason it crashes is because this catch statement is only going to catch invalid time zone exceptions it's not going to catch any other type so that is one reason to use just exception as a default type will will catch any type of exception now you can also have multiple catch statements so we can catch an index out of range exception and we can come down here below this right here and we can also catch other types of exceptions so catch ex as uh let's just say application exception even though this will not run so message box and we will just say an error has occurred in the application so now you'll know uh the difference between each one of these so what it's going to do is if this happens it's going to go ahead and run this code and if we get an application exception it's going to go ahead and run this code so this is very useful if you want to see what happens and then you want to tell them a way to fix it so if the index is out of range you can have a message box that tells them how to fix uh that problem or if there's an application exception you can tell them how to fix that problem there so let's go ahead and run this go ahead and click add all as you can see it catches the index out of range exception we'll go ahead and click okay and we'll close out of that so go ahead and practice this sum uh you can add multiple catch statements now if you catch an exception just a normal ex exception of a default and then catch another exception it's going to run that code uh twice because exception is there for anything and then let's say you have the index out of range exception after that whatever code is in between each of them is going to run so for example if I type exception right here and then application exception you can see that we get a warning and it says unused local variable ex um which that doesn't matter but it says catch block never reached because system. application exception inherits from system. exception so what that's saying is that this will run and then it will never get to this because this inherits from that and this is going to cover everything so we'll just go ahead and take this out right here so practice with some TR catch statements um use multiple catches um you can find out what uh types of exceptions they are by using the ex do2 string and you can add a catch statement for that so in our case it was an index out of range so once you're comfortable with using that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
