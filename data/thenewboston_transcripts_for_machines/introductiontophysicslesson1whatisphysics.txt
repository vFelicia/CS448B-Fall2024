what is going on guys my name is Bucky Roberts and welcome to your very first tutorial in physics now in these upcoming tutorials what I'm going to be doing is I'm basically going to be treating this as an introductory physics course if you were to take it in high school or college or anywhere else I'm going to be teaching you the basic core principles to get guys started in physics and by that I mean I'm going to be teaching you about mass force velocity you know the properties of matter all that fun stuff so that's what I'm going to be doing that's what you guys have to look forward to but before we started making any weird calculations or anything like that I think it's important to understand the definition you know the proper definition of physics and that is the study of matter and energy now there's no like one proper definition of physics but you know if you look around the web in all your textbooks this pretty much sums up what physics is studying matter and energy and how they interact with each other pretty much studying all the things that you can measure so you're saying all right so it's pretty much the study of like everything on earth whoa not exactly saying all right so what are some of the topics that physics doesn't touch on well we're going to be talking about topics like love physics is not going to cover passion I'm sorry but if you're here looking to study passion you're in the wrong place courageousness well I might touch on that a little bit but it has nothing to do with physics so those are some topics that you know we can't measure with physics what we can measure is like volume the speed of light you know all that boring stuff but by the way if you're looking for love and passion tutorials then I might be making some of those pretty soon by anyways that's what physics is that's the you know formal correct definition that's what you should write on your test so now let's go on to the next step and that is well whenever scientists are working with physics and they're working where these huge numbers such as you know how many atoms are in the Sun what's the speed of light well first of all I need to explain to you guys that these numbers are huge they're like you know billions and billions of billions of atoms inside the Sun numbers that I can't even really comprehend right now but we just can't write these numbers out like you know you to write how many brothers you have or how much you weigh because if you try to write the number of how many atoms were in the Sun it would take you like six years just to write it out on a piece of paper so what scientists did is they came up with a really lazy way to write really big in really small numbers and that is through the use of scientific notation now my definition of what scientific notation is is it's basically the way lazy scientists write big and small numbers now the technical definition is basically if you ever heard of power of 10 notation it's pretty much taking a number and timesing it by ten times a certain power and well let me go ahead and throw you guys into a nice example right here so let me go ahead and get my new stylus out what color am I going to choose blue looks pretty good so let's say we had a number like twenty eight thousand and seven hundred and we wanted to express that using scientific notation well what we would do is we would write two point eight seven and by the way I know my handwriting is really bad you guys are just going to have to deal with that so two point eight seven times 10 to the fourth power so this is basically the basics of scientific notation you have a number on the left here and you multiply it times 10 to a certain power and in this example the power is 4 but you can have any positive negative integer and you can also have 0 and I'm going to be showing you guys all those examples right now so all right how would we solve this problem so I told you guys that this number basically means the same as twenty eight thousand seven hundred don't believe me well I'm going to show you guys how to do that so you have two point eight seven times ten to the fourth power alright so we need to solve this baby right here so two point eight seven times 10 to the fourth power is 10 army excuse me it's one with four zero so one two three four so 10 to the fourth power is 10,000 and I'm not going to explain you guys how to do powers and you know exponents and stuff like that because I'm assuming you guys already know I don't think we need to jump back of that far so two point eight seven times 10,000 is twenty eight thousand seven hundred and by the way I'm going to show you guys a really lazy way to do a scientific notation and that's this let me go ahead and clear this so we can go ahead and make all those steps like convert 10 to the fourth power to 10,000 and times this by 10,000 but you know that's one extra step and like I said we are scientists now and we are lazy so let's go ahead and look at the easier way if you have that same problem two point eight seven times 10 to the fourth power and you want to figure out you know everyday terms what this number meant what we could do is say alright whenever we have a number that's like 10 to the fourth power all we have to do is take this decimal point and move it to the right four spaces so two point eight seven equals times 10 to the fourth of course equals one two three four and whenever we don't have anything we just go ahead and throw in zeroes and check it out this is twenty eight thousand seven hundred pretty cool huh so it kind of saves you a step you kind of draw these things that look like boobs kind of but you know oh well so let me go ahead and edit and clear that out and now let me show you guys remember when I told you guys that the exponents can be negative two well whenever they have a number in they times it by 10/2 like the negative fifth or something like that that means that you have a really small number so say you have something like let me go ahead and change my colors up um let me think of something five point two six times 10 to the negative 5 well the very first thing we need to do is 5.26 times and convert 10 to the negative 5 so again I'm not going to talk you guys through how exponents work but 10 to the negative 5 is point zero zero zero zero one so five point two six times point zero zero zero zero one is point zero zero zero zero four zeroes five two six so that's your answer right there I kind of drew over my decimal point so again if we want to do this the lazy way because remember we're scientists now have to do everything lazy 5.26 times 10 to the negative fifth equals five point two six and whenever we have negative just go ahead and move your decimal point to the left five spaces so one two three four five well I got to work on my curvature there anyways just go ahead and fill in those zeros where you moved it and check it out point zero zero zero zero five two six so that's kind of a lazy way of doing things but hey it saves us this step right here so now the last example I want to tell you guys is about that zero with exponent because remember I told you guys you can have a positive integer or negative integer for your exponent but you can also have zero so if you have something like six point nine times ten to the zero of power the very first thing we have to figure out is all right what the heck is ten to the zeroth power and if you remember from like fifth grade math anything to the zero of power is one so this pretty much means our a six point nine times one and again anything anything times one is itself so this answer is six point nine again I don't really have a lazy way of doing this because pretty much this is really lazy in itself any time you have times ten zero of power just get rid of all this and that's your answer right there six point nine so that is your very first physics tutorial I hope you guys liked it and again I'm going to show you the lazy way I'm going to show you like the technical correct way to do all this stuff and then I'm going to show you like you know the lazy way where you can get away with it so it's going to be real fun and yeah I'm going to work on you know moving my decimal places get them giving them a little bit better and up you guys stay tuned for the next tutorial is going to be awesome so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you then
