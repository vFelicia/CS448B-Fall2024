hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live camera for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna start working on a paint program similar to paint that comes on Windows where you can draw and start painting stuff out on the screen now this project is directly taken from a book called beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by Thea Ron I think that's right Willis and Brian Newsome I just wanted to give them credit for this because it's a very good program to learn from and it's very object oriented so you can create this whole program without even adding a single line of code to your form one class it's all done by using custom user controls and other classes so just keep in mind that I didn't make this project myself but I'm gonna be explaining it to you guys and teaching you guys how to do it so we'll create a new project will select a windows forms application and we'll just call it paint and also combine paint YouTube cuz I'm pretty sure I've got another copy of a paint program similar so go ahead and click OK and wait for that to load so here's our form 1 and what we want to do is we'll rightclick on paint YouTube and let's add a user control now what our user control is is it's pretty much a way for you to build your own user control so you can take a part of a window and you can add buttons and anything you'd like to it and it's premade for you so you can add that to your different forms so let's say you want to have something that's used a lot throughout your program and you don't have to copy and paste those buttons and rename them every time you can create a custom user control and add the stuff you need and then just put that control into it so the name for this one is going to be paint canvas so this is gonna be our paint canvas control that we're going to be painting to so let's go ahead and come over here and let's set the back color to white because when you're painting you want to be painting on something white so now all we need to do is we need to add this control to our form 1 dot V B now in order for us to do that first we're gonna have to come over here to paint YouTube right click and build it so now that it's built let's come over here to form 1 dot V B so now we can use our paint canvas control we'll come over here to our tool box and it will minimize how two common controls and you can see here that we got paint you tube components and we've created this paint canvas item right here so we can go ahead and drag this on to our form 1 and you can see that's a little big and it doesn't fit inside so what we can do is we can change the dock of this so we'll come over here to dock and it will click the middle button to fill the whole form so now our whole form will be filled with the paint canvas and we can resize the form all we want and the paint canvas canvas will still cover the whole thing so it will set the text form 1 to paint VB so that I'll just make it look a little bit better ok so now that we've created our custom paint canvas control and our and we've added it to our form 1 let's come over here to paint YouTube and let's add another class so let me shrink this down some here we'll select a class and we'll just call it graphics item so we'll wait for graphics item to load and let's go ahead and zoom in ok so we want to make this class must inherit so we'll use the public key word I only use public and then the keyword must inherit so that means that basically when a developer wants to use this graphics item class they cannot directly make an object of graphics item it forces them to use a different class that inherits from graphics item so let's say we've got graphics circled like what we're going to use later on graphics Urkel inherits from graphics item so we can create a graphic circle object but not a graphics item object because it cannot be used unless it is inherited by another class so now we need to add some variables that we can use in our graphics items class so we'll just do color so we'll just type public color as and we'll just do it of type color and it's an a RGB color which is alpha red green and blue and Visual Basic has a whole bunch of colors built into it that you can use now we'll just do public is filled as bulan and then we'll create one more so public rectangle as rectangle so is filled is basically basically gonna let us know later on if the circle is going to be filled because we're going to be drawing on our form or our paint canvas with a whole bunch of circles so we want to know if those circles are filled or if they aren't but we can easily change is filled equal to true or false to fill in circles or not later on and public rectangle is just going to be of type rectangle which has a width and a height now whenever you draw circles you have to have a rectangle object so basically what it does is it takes that rectangle and then it draws a circle inside of that rectangle so where all the edges of the circle are touching the sides of the square now or rectangle now this might be a little confusing but you know start to understand it later on so let's go ahead and comment this so let's just do public variables okay so now that we've started creating the graphics item class I know I have crammed a lot into this tutorial custom user controls we've started creating our graphics item class with the Sen Harry keyword so you may don't watch this over again if you're not quite grasping everything but if you do and you're familiar with custom controls or must inherit or if you just understand it right off the bat then go ahead and move on to the next tutorial I'm going to continue working on this program
