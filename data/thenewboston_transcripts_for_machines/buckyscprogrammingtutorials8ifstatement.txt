what is up guys is bucking welcome to your eighth C++ tutorial and in this story I want to talk to you guys about something called the if statement now the if statement is a way where we can have our program make very basic decisions what we're going to be doing is we're going to be giving our computer program a test and it's going to run that test if the test is true then it's going to run a certain bit of code if the test is false then it's not going to run any bit of code so depending on that test depends whether we run coda or not so it sounds confusing but it's actually incredibly simple so let me go ahead and I'll show you the syntax for if statement right now the syntax to make an if statement is I F you just go ahead and type the word F and then go ahead and add parenthesis now inside our parentheses is where we're going to be making our test now after those parentheses go ahead and add curly braces now this is called the body of the if statement and now here is where we write the code to run if the test is true so let's go ahead and make a simple bit of code let's go ahead and just write like C out armed lucky is awesome so if our test is true it's going to print out Bucky is awesome on the screen if the test is false it's not going to print out anything so let's go ahead and let me talk to you guys about the different types of tests the first test I want to show you guys is the greater than test and this simply tests if one value is greater than another value so if v is greater than three go ahead and run this code so 5 is indeed greater than 3 so this is true so whenever we build and run this it's going to say Bucky is awesome pretty cool huh so now let's go ahead and make something like umm is 1 greater than 3 so it's going to test this is 1 greater than 3 well this is actually false 1 is less than 3 so it's not going to run this bit of code so go ahead build and run this and as you can see it did not print out Bucky is awesome on the screen how sad so of course we have the greater than test we obviously have the less than test one lesson three well now this is going to be true so it's going to print out Bucky is awesome on the screen so let's go ahead and run this and indeed it prints out Bucky is awesome so aside from greater than and less than we also have these two tests greater than or equals two so whenever we tested whether three is greater than three this test is going to be false because three is not greater than three three is actually equal to three well if we want to test if three is greater than or equal to three we use greater than with the equal sign after it so now whenever you run it is three greater than or equal to three yes three is equal to three so print it out Bucky is awesome so aside from that we also have the less than or equal to so if you know is one less than or equal to three yes one is less than three so it's going to print out Bucky is awesome so again what I want to show you guys is that you have greater than less than greater than or equals two and less than or equals two so now those are called the relational operators we also have two more tests that we can do and these are called the Equality operators this is a really simple test it tests whether one value is equal to another value or if one value is not equal to another value so in order to do this go ahead and write is three equal to equal to three and you might be thinking all right why don't I just use one equal sign why didn't they make it that way well whenever we were creating variables such as like int x equals eight the one equal sign the single equal sign is assigned for creating variables and assigning values so that's why I decided that two equal signs was sufficient for testing so remember a common mistake is to put one equal sign in there and you're going to get an error or something terrible is going to happen so whenever you're testing you need two equal signs so let's go ahead and run this test is three equal to three well yes it is so it's going to print out Bucky is awesome I'll give it another test like is seven equal to three well no it's not so it's not going to print out buck is awesome so that is one test is called the equal sign equal sign or equal to test and there's one more test I want to go over and that's explanation point equal sign and this is the key word for not equals to so is 8 not equal to or in other words is 8 different than 8 well no it's the same so it's not going to print out everything is 10 different than 8 well yes it is so that's going to be true and it's going to print out Bucky is awesome so that is all the tests that I have for you guys and that's all the tests in C++ again to recap one last time greater than less than greater than or equal to less than or equal to equal and not equal so now that we know all those tests I probably should tell you guys this people typically don't in by people I mean computer programmers computer programmers typically don't just test two numbers against each other they usually have variables that they test against each other like int a equals 98 int B equals 76 and then they test something like is a arm greater than B well if we go ahead and run this 98 is indeed greater than 76 so of course that's true it's going to print out Bucky is awesome and aside from that you either have two variables to test or you have a variable and a value like is 98 greater than 5 something like that we can actually mix variables with values and that would be true as well so again you can either have two values in here two variables or variable on one side and value on another side pretty cool huh so that's the basics of again relational operators are the greater than and less than one and equality operators are the equals equals in explanation point equals so now that we know how to make a basic if statement again to recap one last time if your test and then the body and it's going to run the test and if that code is true is going to run the body that's the basics of a if statement now that we understand that we can begin enhancing our program a little bit more so in our next tutorial what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be having the user enter two numbers and we are going to be comparing those numbers and depending on what numbers they entered run a certain bit of code so now as you can see we're just building and building to our knowledge of C++ to make better and better programs so don't skip over if statements because it's a huge part of C++ so for now that's all I have for you guys so thank you guys for watching in the next tutorial we're going to be building that calculator thingy so it's going to be awesome so thank you guys for watching don't
