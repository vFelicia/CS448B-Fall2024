hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston now in the last couple of videos we've looked at aend and append two however now we're going to take a look at an example application which is going to use append to append things to a dropdown list uh an HTML dropdown list so essentially what we're doing is we're creating a series of links so Three Links and when these links are clicked the value of these links will be added to the drop down box to create each option as we go so this is an example uh of the script um when we click on uh bread sugar or tea uh so if we click on bread it will then become uh available in this drop down list when we click on sugar it will also become available in this drop down list because we're appending an option uh onto the end of the select element in HTML so let's take a look at uh the code now we have aend Js including Ed in our file that's extremely important we're going to be writing out the code inside of there it's extremely short but it's a much a better example uh than just showing a pending normal text it makes uh the you know overall use of this uh seem a lot more useful in uh everyday applications okay so let's first of all create our links so I'm going to create these just inside a paragraph tag we can copy and paste them uh so the first one I'll just put bread and the HF is nothing the class of this is going to be link as is all the others so we're going to keep the same class name but we're going to use uh the this keyword to reference each object so the next will be sugar and then we have t so we've used the class link and what this is going to do is it's going to identify all of these as clickable links we're going to call uh an event handler in append JS to check for the clicking of these links we're then going to use the text attribute to actually take the text uh inside from this link and then we're going to add it to a uh drop down box just here let's go ahead and create this drop down box I'm going to say um give it a name of list and then end the selection there now we don't need to provide any options in here because what's going to be happening is these op or these options that you would usually usually specify are going to be appended on for us So eventually we're going to end up with a list that looks like this with bread sugar and tea however we're going to let jQuery do this for us as we click the list so essentially what the user is doing is defining their own list okay so let's go ahead and look at the code we first first of all need to create an event handler for each of these links so we've called this link uh this class link so for each one of these links we can use do link and when we click on one of these links we want to carry out a function let's bring that down a bit so inside of this function we want to first of all take the value uh from the link itself so I'm going to create a variable called item now we need to go ahead and reference the um actual link itself however we can't use Link because I'll show you what happens let's go ahead and choose link and then we use the Val function to grab the value from oh no sorry we use the do text to grab the value from this link now you'll see what happens in this case when we click on an element oh let's uh see what we've done wrong here okay yeah so we need to alert out item for debugging okay so now that we've alerted that out let's go ahead and click on a link now you can see that we've got bread sugar and tea combined this is because we can't refer to this as do link because we have the same element name for each one or the element class for each one and therefore we just use this and this just takes the currently clicked um element so now what we do is when we click sugar we have the value sugar when we click tea we have the value tea when we click bread we have the value bread so now that we know that this item holds the currently clicked this item variable holds the currently clicked value we can go ahead and do something with it so obviously what we want to do is append this to the options inside of this select uh list so we're going to need to use the append um manipulator in jQuery so we're going to go ahead and say list remember we called our list list then we're going to say dot append and what do we want to append on well we want to append on the item however this isn't valid HTML if we were to use the list like this click sugar nothing really happens uh because we haven't chosen the option um tags around it so what we need to do is we need to create some option tags so we're appending on uh the item after this option tag here using the plus and then we go ahead and plus the ending option tag so earlier I showed you like this code here inside this code here and what we're doing is every time we click on a link this is app pending down until we have filled the list okay so let's go ahead and test this in our browser let's just bring that up a bit when we click bread now you can see that the element has been added or the option element has been added inside of here and we now have bread in the drop down list when I click sugar that's added to the list as well and then when I click tea That's finally added to the list we can obviously then go and add uh the same one over again however you could probably kind of try and come up with a way to check the current elements in there and then maybe put at times two on the end of it that's not for this tutorial but that's a more uh useful example of the append um manipulation in jQuery
