alrighty everybody welcome back and just a quick update from the last video what I decided to do as I was actually uh watching that last video is after I renamed this transfers app to pretty much rename everything to wires I decided instead of moving it to The Exchange app I'm just gonna move it under wallets and that is because these wires as I guess we'll start calling them they really have nothing to do with the exchange I mean of course everything's all tied together but um for example if we didn't have this trade feature at all then these wires would still like be part of this wallet logic so it didn't really make sense uh when I was like really thinking about things to move under the exchange since I don't know they're just like completely independent of one another in a way so anyways that's what I'm going to be doing and I also updated my ticket to move wires into the wallets app so in the new exchange app that we're going to be creating in the future we're just gonna have orders and some other models under here like asset pair trade so on and so forth and then under the wallets we're gonna have wires which is the current transfers and then transfers we're going to be creating uh in the future that's going to be like that internal transfer the one that doesn't hit any core at all so with that being said just want to keep you guys updated let's go ahead and hop into the front end and we'll start on this ticket 66 Mario Mia uh shop uh prep UI okay let me close all these always like to keep things nice and clean so actually let me first just make sure everything's synced up shop UI prep for my Branch naming I always like to have the number and then a little description hyphenated so 66 shop UI prep I'm going to create that and actually before I go any further so like I said what I'm going to be doing in this video is taking the trade in the orders elements and merging them under in an exchange section and instead of having these two tabs right here I'm pretty much going to move them to a top toolbar and actually let me see if I can steal any logic anywhere okay so before I even get to that I want to pop back to tnvos because I want to see how I structured a toolbar earlier because I want to have this toolbar sticky on top and have this main section be scrollable scroll a bowl so let me see I'm pretty sure that I'm going to be using CSS grid but I think that I did it maybe in my shop app yeah okay so this is what I'm talking about you see this top dark toolbar is sticky and then the content under here which is going to be the trade content or the orders content is scrollable I just wanted to see how I did that real quick so oh Flex that's interesting so a flex version column and then this one has an overflow okay so I use flex instead of grid I guess that makes sense okay so let's 100 okay cool so now let me close out of tnbos and I'll keep it open so now let me go ahead and start this and I can probably close out of this one so I don't get confused so now I'm on my local development and am I logged in just log out and log in again okay so I'm under local development and then what I'll do first is actually just go ahead and make this empty exchange page all right so under pages is where I have this and then I'm going to have to go to layouts authenticated and then my left nav is where I have these so first I'll say exchange make sure I spelled that right and then I'm going to create the styles for this and then the components which is just name index okay select me first kind of just get all the rough structuring so this is pretty much just an empty component right now however it's going to be much much more and then where am I text to okay I also so this is gonna I guess I can do this now so this is going to go to I guess it'll be right here an exchange page and the route is just going to be Exchange however I don't have my routing set up yet yep so I don't have my routing set up yet and where did I have that probably in here and Main area Okay so so import exchange and then whenever I hit the exchanger out I want to order or excuse me render my exchange component I'm sure everything's alphabetized the left nav looking good all right so course page wallets page exchange page that's all I have for right now that is good maybe I can steal some styling from the nbos as well so tnbos that was in the shop app and here is my top so hmm actually this is my container for it the container for my shop and this is going to be my container for my Exchange so my exchange page is going to be displayed Flex Flex Direction column have a height of 100 and width of a hundred and I actually do need both of those because I want the toolbar to take up the full width we already did this for now and then let's see what I had just the top toolbar and then the main area so for now I have a different top say main area top and Main area okay and then let me just that is looking good so far so now let me go ahead and style my top or do I want to call this top or top nav let me go with top nav and I'll just so top nav this is going to be of course the top toolbar and I will say uh styles all right so top now all right so instead this top div I'm just going to replace it with this top nav and that's good that's good it's good pretty that up and for its top styles you can just do this I think I want a left and a right or a logo that should be good for now make that a little bit lighter since it looks kind of goofy given that this is dark and this is dark as well now do I want there's a light let me tell you what we will just uh have something like this for now just to get everything structured and then we will work on making everything look pretty okay so top nav it's going to have two many items one's going to be trade and then One's Gonna Be orders so let's steal the styling from this as well so top and next you got your top and then your menu items you have your buy menu items and then for top menu item uh do we need all this on click I don't think we need to get this fancy okay so do I even need a new component let's not let's just say menu item yeah all right so top nav what is a menu item and I don't need this color because the menu item has a color font weight okay let's just get this rendered so I'm going to have trade and then what was the other one orders and of course this doesn't need to be spaced between I'll just have everything on the left display Flex that's good okay trade and orders now for these menu items um let's how am I going to do this maybe if I take the left and right padding off of here and I'll just stick out my menu items so for this I won't have any left and right so I'll have eight pixels on top and bottom maybe I won't have any padding at all is that crazy and then for the menu items I'll say top and bottom eight pixels actually let me just try Apex we'll see how that looks not bad but then okay so let me do this so on my main toolbar I'll have no padding top and bottom and then left and right I'll have eight and that'll give me this Decent Behavior actually do I want a little bit more padding on the top and bottom I think so so let's do four pixels for the toolbar actually I want to move that to our 8 pixels all around here and okay so I think this is good because then I just let the uh um menu items kind of dictate everything which is going to be good because that way if I have any hover functionality it'll look alright all right so I got my top toolbar looking good now another thing that I want to do for this main area is I just want to close these for now I just want to make sure that it's scrollable so I'm gonna go ahead and for this main area let me see what I'm working with here let me just go ahead and make component now directory components new Styles file and make a new main area comp all right so main area what are you doing here I don't think I need to set the background but it is going to be height 100 overflow hidden because I want that scroll but you don't need to show it and then for this let me just put a bunch of headings in here just so we have something scroll it should be enough and render it right here so I'll talk nav main area main area so on my exchange you can have my top navigation and my main area on bottom and then if all goes well this isn't scroll so overflow alright so overflow y scroll and there we go so I got my sticky header and I don't know if you can tell but uh this bottom section is scrolling and then when I actually we can do Auto because we just don't want to always display the scroll bar only when we need it so if the content fits no scroll bar and then if it's too much then we can go scroll in the left and the top they are still sticky beautiful okay so now we can go ahead and start moving this content under here in orders under here but first I have to go pee so I'll pause the video and we are back now let's see what we got going on here okay so we got our exchange built our exchange page trade orders now we need to replace these hey heys in the main area with something a little bit more useful uh exchange framework good for now and now let me go to my layout authenticated main area and kind of change these around so just like in here again this main area is this whole thing including this top bar but what I'm gonna do is kind of just borrow some this logic so I'm gonna say for these nested routes okay so in the main area of the exchange we are going to be rendering the orders and trade right tradein orders and then that means that we are no longer going to be rendering the tradein orders here and let me just temporarily move these from move those from Pages although I want to kind of reshuffle or reorganize these because they're not going to be Pages anymore but for now let me just go ahead and okay so the routes are removed and now in my layouts authenticated left menu I'm also going to be removing trade and orders from the main left menu since those are now can be nested Under The Exchange page and just make sure it didn't break anything okay so of course wallets exchange and then you're going to have tradein orders right here which are going to render right here and they're not rendering because I need to how am I going to do this so I'm just thinking of my URL structure so we can do something like this I wonder if actually does that work already no actually let me do this so first thing I want to move these from pages under main area yeah so right now the order section is under pages and I want to Nest this under the main area The Exchange and also that's going to be here and also the trade section same same that's going to be under there all right now for this pass shouldn't be broken but they're still not going to be rendering so I want to say whenever I click those menu items I want to render these okay so how do I I'm gonna need a bust out chat GPT for a second and also is this what I want to do we'll figure out what I want to do before I ask for help on how to do it so here is my exchange app I want to render okay pretty much change component that rendered at my orders and trade components rendered at route change say I want to add owner render my orders component at route exchange slash orders and my trade component at Route exchange dot trade I already gave my exchange components and then let's go top nav and then my main area as well should be enough okay however the exchange path is not handled yet make sure you're routing oh that's interesting okay exchange star that makes sense so Exchange star it's going to render my Exchange okay looking nice actually yeah so it's not just the exchange path but exchange and anything after it so I'm actually going to have to change this as well to trade okay change this and then both code means any sub route nested under which is what I want this and this is good and then okay so what I need to do now is just update my exchange element right here my left nav to be Exchange Trade oops okay so wallets exchange this is going to take me to exchange trade and now I just need to update my menu items and by eye I mean hopefully I'll take these to be um reactor router to those pages she was this a link menu item yeah menu link interesting well that is interesting I didn't use routes right oh that's interesting too huh I don't think I want to do that I think I want to use this menu item style then left nav yeah I think I'm gonna go customized okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so in this note top nav menu item I'm going to go ahead and make a custom component so menu item component and then this is going to have styles and then let me just structure everything first and then next menu item and then here let's see what we got going on menu link should it be named that actually menu item are menu link let's actually rename this to menu link that's a little bit better yeah that way if we have any other menu items like a logo or drop down or anything and we can structure that so refactor rename menu item is going to be called menu link and then what we got going on so menu link props not going to have any icon it's going to have a text then it's going to have a 2 which is a route so mini link is not going to have any icon it's going to have text and two say text oh hey now text to and then for this it will be pretty much the same use location or after Dome okay so menu link is this who to show you all that's in here we just have text in here now that's might be able to clean this up in a bit but we'll get to that in a second Styles the text just copy for now and then don't need any break points and then for two okay so we have is active menu link it's a styled character domlink Magnum style don't need it but that is active may want that eventually but we can do that later so this container is actually going to be it's nice and easy this container is just going to be a style link I don't need the mark and in that case class name let's do this install link is going to take it as active and we can just use all the same logic okay so for our menu link for our top nav bar we're going to be passing in text into so in this case we menu link top nav text equals tray 2 equals and that is in I don't know if I have to do it like this but either way okay so those are funky but trade orders trade orders looking good and of course since we updated some styling let's see this is the left now for the authenticated we don't need this anymore and all right so change this is looking height top nav styling for this menu item is going to be the styling for this and I don't even think we want this text right here instead we can just render it out like this and then menu item we replace that with the components and let's see what we got going on now so a trade orders trade orders and I think I want text decoration none so and that should get rid of my underline nope it doesn't and why is there on Hover do I need it yep okay so trade orders this is interesting as well so what would be nice is if I could keep this you see how um whenever you hover over any of these left menu elements then they have this little background also if it's active then you still get that background well whenever I'm on the trade page which is well the trade and the order section are both in this exchange like parent element um but only the trade one is activated because this route goes to the trade URL by default and I'm wondering you know what I'm just going to ask my boy chat gbt so let's do this so uh yeah authenticated left now menu item would be a menu link now how do I say this actually let me see if I can just do let me see what I'm working with here all right so let's keep it easy so this is my this is my location object and two is Exchange Trade so on orders hmm why is two oh because this is a menu item that's interesting oh boy oh boy oh boy all right so I think what I can do is I can just update this active logic because my path name is indeed changing but two okay so right now I'm passing in this two property and I'm matching it against my pretty much my uh URL to determine if this is active or not however that's not the exact logic that I want instead what I can do is I'm gonna pass in an additional property and I'll see root pass and I'll match that instead so my menu link for my left menu right here this is also going to take a root pass and then I'll say root path equals and most of the time it's just going to be the same as two I can just copy that root path is wallets and then for this one though I'll say the root path equals Exchange and that'll pretty much be the new thing that I match it up against so I'll say is active is equal if wait what's 2 yeah so if 2 includes root path let me see if that works okay that doesn't work at all hold on all right so two and then root pass okay I'm missing a little bit of logic here which is I still have to match the path name wait I must mash it up against the wrong thing so if path name includes root pad so if the path name that you're on includes the root pass then it means it's active so coarse wallets Exchange trade orders okay beautiful on the chorus this is active while it's active exchange because this root pass or excuse me because this entire relationship string includes this still active now another thing that I probably want to do is you see when I click on trades or orders I'm getting the right content that's rendering here but I also probably want to add an active state right here sends for example I don't know I just think it's nice to have a little indicator to uh know which page you're on even though you can you know probably tell pretty clearly but you know visual indicators never a bad idea but for now let me just clean this off um another question that I wanted to ask you is you see how like I had these paths and I have them pretty much hard coded in like in my menu link and then in my uh routing logic as well do you guys use constants for these or it always feels weird hard coding in those uh paths but anyways let me for the front end I renamed trade to exchange and then the URL is different as well Shane strain create a top toolbar for the new exchange section did that and that's the existing orders page under the new exchange section looking good and let me just see if I want to clean this up a bit ter dude get rid of my logs right yep okay so for this I think that might be good actually 24 or do I want to just make that nice and tight 16. yeah let's do that let's keep it a little bit tighter all right so under my pages The Exchange the main area and then the orders and trade for the orders container gonna just use 16 padding and for the trade container I also want to just use 16 padding now let me lent this up maybe I'm more on lint it's looking good and all right now should I do anything with the styling right now I think that's good testing everything out okay so I I know that I'm going to want to change the colors of this top toolbar but for right now I think it's good even though I want to add active stay change the colors I'm going to go through and uh probably separately make a like really work on the style guide get all my colors set but for right now I just kind of want to get all the logic working and on that though let me go ahead and push this up in should be good to merge it in so before I push it up let's see this is how I like to uh have my PR structured as well so the number of the issue and then the full title and that is not what I wanted to open and all right so just commit and push this all right nice and then don't need you for now just a little self code review and should be good to go so this and then I'll say closes number 66. of course I'm gonna code review my own code okay so on the left menu we added this root path and then we said if the URL includes that path at all then consider the menu link active and that was working properly and then from the left menu we removed trade in orders and replaced it with Exchange and that links to the trade page or in other words this first page by default now for the authenticated main area we are no longer rendering orders and trade because those are now nested under Exchange which we wanted uh the order style we removed a little bit from the top since it's like a subsection now and on a page beautiful The Exchange main area is just the Overflow whenever we need it it's that one more time yep and I don't even know if we can trick it this much but it was working good assuming it works good for orders once we have more and then moving over to stuff let me just see from the trade page we moved it into the exchange same thing removes on that top padding since it's now a subsection and for the exchange your main area we are rendering either the orders element or the trade element which we wanted change Styles we just have the top in the main area displayed Flex is a column height 100 and then width to have the toolbar take up the full width and then let's see what else we got the exchange top nav menu link a white font way actually this is one thing I do want to change I change top nav menu link styles uh uh change toppling mini link Styles so instead of font weight 600 what I want to do is I'm going to use my standard style guide so I'll say Styles equals I'll see if it looks better it's bold or semibold semibold is looking pretty good let's just try bold though just to see how it looks bold and not that great all right so stick with semi Bowl lint this shiz Niche again padding it was good like decoration none all right and then for my custom menu link I pass it in text and a pass and for this one I can say is active even though hmm okay so we're passing in the is active prop and we're not really using it for anything I'm wondering if I should just get rid of it right now yeah let's do that even though I'm going to be using it in the future it just feels a little bit weird having dead code and it'll be easy enough to add it in the future actually do I want to just do it now like why not so say let's just use this for now so if this is active have a little bit of background there you go and let's just bring this up a bit so again I'm going to be adjusting all of these Styles as well but right now I do have some is active logic I don't know if you could tell but when it's active it has like a slight background so again not the prettiest thing but just want to take care of the engineering right now that takes care of that background this is going to be a style guide eventually so that's good for now the top nav for the exchange this is pretty simple it just has display Flex padding and then you just have two mini links in there and then of course for the entire exchange page it's pretty simple you just have a top nav and a main area looking good so now let me just go ahead and length one more time push it up and merge it in push and I'll say uh adding is active logic commit push and where are yet is active logic looking good squash merge thank you spank you call tonight all right delete that take care of this issue and we're looking pretty good so now let me just go ahead and pull this down make sure nothing broke and then we can consider this task complete so I can also get rid of this branch all right so now from the beginning I log in I'm looking at my cores I'm looking at my wallets everything is looking good go to exchange trade is the default one again another thing that I want to do is Select some of the state by default but that's for another day I got trades I got orders and now we are prepared to add our shop app right there sweet all right so make sure everything is good to go and uh yeah next video next ticket I'll see you then
