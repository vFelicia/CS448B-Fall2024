hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to be taking a look at creating something like this where we have a couple maybe three or four forms obviously depending on how many you need and we're gonna be assigning a minimum limit to them now I've just labeled these five and ten but obviously these might be something like username or password or address you know any any kind of data so when we click on them you can see that we have this span that's added to the to the well next to the text field and what's gonna happen is as I type something into here when we reach the five characters required you'll see it disappears the same with the ten one but I've set the minimum length to ten and therefore we have ten characters required so as I'm typing something you see that it will disappear when it gets to the the ten minimum so we're gonna do this and we're going to assign this to all text or input fields with the type text inside of our page so we can go ahead and do this also some other functionality you'll notice is that when I click we I have this message when I click away and I haven't entered at least five the message world that well the message would disappear anyway but if I was to go ahead and say enter Alex and click away when I click back and I still get this five characters required when I then click away after I've entered the fire and click back in we don't get the message reappear so we don't want it to keep being displayed to our user if they've already entered five characters the other thing to note is that we are using blur so for example which is not just when we click in it might be when we say tab up or tab down to a particular field and we obviously tab away we use the blur and when we click in we use the focus event handler so without further ado let's go ahead and take a look at the actual code itself okay so over to index.php in my text editor which is the file that or the demonstration you saw on the page here we're going to be creating the actual form field elements on this page and we've obviously gone ahead and included jQuery as a JavaScript file and also an this file EXT which is also in the jas directory as a javascript file as well and this just means that we can obviously make use of jQuery query but then in ext Doge is we can go ahead and actually write our jQuery code to avoid inline scripting we'll keep everything external in this ext which means external file so the first thing I'm gonna go ahead and do is create an area with my input type or input field with the type text and we know I'm just gonna go ahead and give this an act reviewed min length which is obviously an attribute that doesn't exist but we're gonna use our jQuery code to pick up on this min length attribute so for the first one I'm going to choose five and let's just go ahead and just give that a label five and let's come down and do another one for this one we'll say ten and we'll set the input type to text and the min length to ten okay so now that we've done this we have something like this on our page we've got five and ten we now need to go ahead and start to write our jQuery code and we need to assign event handlers to these as we actually click into them so they come into focus when we come away from them ie they're blurred and when we're typing as well so obviously the key up function or the key up event handler so inside exp is the first thing we want to go ahead and do is use document dot ready as we would with all of our jQuery code just to make sure that the Dom is available and we can start to use start to a you know apply then handless to elements and take out tributes from our elements so the first thing we want to go ahead and do is actually use a jQuery selector to select all text fields on the page so all input fields with the type text so we do this just using standard notation for a selector and inside of here we choose input obviously this would select all input fields on the page but what we want to go ahead and do is in brackets specify type equals the text and this will select all input fields with the type text on the obviously you could go ahead and individually reference these for example you could use dot class and if these had a particular class for example class equals class obviously class here would be picked up here but I think it's important to go ahead and select all of them and if you don't specify a I've just removed a bit more than I needed to if we don't go ahead and specify a minimum length in our our application or our input field sorry won't be affected so the first thing we want to go ahead and do is apply the event handler focus to this and inside here we're gonna go ahead and create a function I'm just gonna bring that down a bit so on focus we want something to happen so let's go ahead and just alert something out just so we know this is working so working and this just basically means that when we click and bring this into focus we get this message up here same working so we know that that works and it's gonna do it a few times because we're still in focus so we'll just get rid of that okay so let's go ahead and just get rid of that and refresh our page okay so now that we know that the focus event handler is working what what we want to do is create sort of like a suit not a pseudo variable but a sort of variable called this violet and that's gonna equal to this and essentially this just reference is the current element that we're on and now we can use this underscore Val to reference the current text field that we're on that's essentially what we're doing there we then we need to pick up the minimum length attribute so I'm just going to pull this in here just tab this over so it looks a bit neater in fact no my text is not allowing me so I'll just have to space over okay so what we're gonna be doing for the min length we're gonna need to take the attribute that we've specified here which is called min length so we need to use the action in jQuery so I'm just gonna say this underscore cell remember selecting this here dot H which to obviously stands for attribute and then we specify the attribute name which is meaning length so now what I'm gonna go ahead and do is I'm just gonna alert out min length and we can see that when we select this we're taking this dot attribute min length and we're just alerting it out
