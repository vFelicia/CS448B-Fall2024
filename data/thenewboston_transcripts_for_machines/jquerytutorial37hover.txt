hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be looking at the jquery hover event handler and we're going to be creating a basic menu in which when we hover over the items we get a description of what the link will take us to so you've probably seen this in a variety of websites and in fact it's an extremely effective way to show your user what they're about to see and it's a it's a nice looking effect and it's done very very simply with jQuery so the first thing we're going to do is go ahead and create a basic menu and I'm just going to put a few different options in here so the first one is going to be videos the hyperlinks hash for now obviously you can choose the hyperlink if you're applying this to a website I'm going to give an ID to this and that's going to be menu underscore videos I can then go ahead and copy and paste this and I'm just going to paste this F make three references of it I'm going to put a slash after each one so I'm going to change these values just so we can get a bit of variety and then change the IDs that are associated with them as well so as long as we've done this and and we have a menu that we want to show for example videos code and forum you can see at the moment nothing happens the links don't go anywhere and nothing happens when we hover over them so now what we want to do is create an area below and I'm going to do this inside of a div and that's just going to be the menu feedback so what's going to happen is when we roll over a menu item in our browser we'll have the menu feedback display a short description about that link so the first thing we need to do with regards to the jQuery code is create an external file where we write our code so I'm going to create a new file in my text editor and inside the J's folder I'm just going to call this hover Jas so in here we can start to begin to reference these menu items and display the appropriate message the first thing I want to do however is create a reference to this JavaScript file I've just created so the type is going to be JavaScript text forward slash JavaScript and the source is going to be Jas /ha ver ax so now that we've included the hover GS script into our page we can go ahead and start writing the code now because we're using an event handler we again need to reference the videos code and forum I'm taking this short and easy way of doing this just for the simplicity of this tutorial and I'm actually copying and pasting the code down inside hover J s however there are more appropriate ways to write out the code so let's go over to our hover J s far and start writing this out like I said there are better ways to do this but for the purpose of the tutorial we'll keep it short okay so we need to reference our menu items individually so the first one I'm going to reference is menu underscore videos remember we gave the menu videos or the link and ID of menu underscore videos we're now going to say dots hover and then create some parentheses and inside here we can create the function that runs when we hover over this menu item so let's go ahead and write function I'll block and we'll just bring this down a bit here okay so we can start writing our code in we need to reference the menu feedback div and then place them at text inside of this so we reference this again and using the same method menu feedback and then we say dot HTML and inside here we can write some text so with regards to the videos we can write something like free video tutorials now when we hover over this link the menu feedback will contain this value here so let's go ahead and refresh when we hover over four woman code nothing happens because we haven't created an event for this year however when we hover over videos you can see that we have the free video tutorials text appear when we come away from this it stays however we do have another event handler for that as well so we'll discuss that in another tutorial so now let's go ahead and look at the code and the forum now the short way to do it would be to copy and paste this down the page so for the purpose of this tutorial that's what I'm going to do so we have the mint the menu code and we also have menu forum and we can then just change these values so free highquality code and a help forum so now that we've created an event for each of these menu items when we refresh our browser when we hover over each one it changes depending over the one that we've hovered so using the hover event handler we've created a description of links when we hover over them
