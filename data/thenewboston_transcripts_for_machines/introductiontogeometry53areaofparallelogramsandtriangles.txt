okay so now we're going to move on to parallelograms and triangles and these are a little bit harder to do than rectangles and squares but not that much you just have to make sure that you're substituting the right values in so for a parallelogram to find the area where we're going to do base times height in this height if you see right here is called the altitude and it's always perpendicular to the base that's why when we do a square we don't have to find a new altitude because this side is the altitude or a rectangle because this side is the altitude of a rectangle but because the parallelogram doesn't have right angles we have to draw in this new height and then our area is base times height and for a triangle it's pretty similar if you look if I were to draw in this diagonal of this parallelogram I would get a triangle that's why when we find the area of a triangle it's onehalf base times height because it's a half the area we would get if we had a parallelogram and in a triangle unless it's a right triangle because a right triangle already has a height because this is perpendicular to that unless it's a right triangle you have to draw in a height in here and then your area is onehalf base times height now sometimes you're going to have to draw your height outside the triangle or outside you shouldn't have to do it outside of triangle often but sometimes you have to do it for a parallelogram because this is the only place where it's going to form a right angle but you want to make sure that you use this piece as the base instead of this whole piece and then your height is still going to give you the right area so now we're going to do some examples to find the area of the parallelogram so they've already drawn the height in for us and they told us that the height is seven now the height is always going to be perpendicular to the side that we use as the base so for this particular try or parallelogram this is our base or this one but since in a parallelogram opposite sides are congruent it doesn't matter so our base is eight so the area of this parallelogram is 7 times 8 which is going to give us 56 and there aren't units on this one but say they told us that these were in centimeters our area would be fifty six centimeters squared now we're going to do one more example find the area so they give us our height and our height is equal to eight now if you look when we use our base we need this entire side not just this piece of the base so in order to find out with this but this part of the base equals we're going to have to use our Pythagorean theorem to solve for B so if you look right here inside this bigger triangle a right triangle is formed right here so we're going to use the Pythagorean theorem on this right triangle to find be so a squared plus B squared is equal to the hypotenuse squared eight squared is 64 plus B squared and if you plug that into the calculator you get 17 squared is equal to 89 so b squared is equal we're going to subtract the 64 over and I'll get 225 if you take the square root of that and put it into a calculator you get B is equal to a plus or minus 115 or not a hundred and fifteen just 15 now if you remember where this is a distance we can't have negative distance so we're just going to take the positive value of B so this is 15 so to get the whole base i'm going to add 6 plus 15 if you do that you'll get 21 so to find the area of this triangle we're going to take half the base which is 21 times the height now it doesn't matter what order you multiply in because multiplication is commutative so I'm just going to do the easier one first one half times 8 is 4 times 21 it's going to give you eighty four so our the area of this triangle is 84 and pretend the said inches inches squared so that's all with parallelograms and triangles make sure you come back and watch the next one where we're going to do areas of a trapezoid
