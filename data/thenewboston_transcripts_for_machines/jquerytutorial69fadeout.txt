hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in the last part we looked at jQuery fade in where we faded it in an image on our web page and we used a callback function to say when the the effect had completed in this tutorial we're gonna look similarly at fadeout but essentially this is going to do the same thing but backwards so we have our our displaynone on our image now let's go ahead into effect and actually get rid of the majority of about all of this code actually okay so we've got our image that is not displayed at the moment and we have our feedback div here let's go ahead and refresh the page and you'll see that we've got nothing on at the moment now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to use some event handlers to create this effect when two button two different buttons are pressed so we're gonna create a hide and a show button let's go ahead and create an input type button and the ID of this can be show and it's copy and paste that and we'll do exactly the same thing but hide let's give both of these a value as well so we know which ones which so show and value equals hide okay so let's go ahead and preview the page you can see that we've got this show button and it's hide button when I click on the show button I want the animation to fade in and tell me underneath when it's loaded and the same with hired I want to fade the image in and tell me underneath when that has been hidden as well so let's go ahead and over to our effects jas file we need to reference these buttons to be able to create an event handler for both of them so with show and the same with hide so the first one I'm going to do is show so I reference show and then I say dot click and inside of this I need to create a function and the block of code that's going to be run when we click this button so function I'll bring the block down so we can work inside of here and now I'm going to reference the image itself which i've given an image ID of image so let's go ahead and say image dot fade in now I'm going to give the fade in function two parameters the first one is going to be slow in fact let's just do three seconds and the next is the callback function to let me know when this animation is complete so function and then a block bring the block down and in here I want to add some text to this image feedback div so let's say hash image feedback dot HTML image has been loaded image has been shown okay so now that we've done that we can go ahead and test our show button let's click show let's just create a line break so that looks a bit nicer or paragraph I guess okay and we'll go back to our browser so man we click show the image fades in and then we're showing this image has been shown in the div that we created below so now we're going to do the same for hide let's go ahead into effect is so we need to reference the hide button to see if this has been pressed so hide dot click and inside here we need to create again a function with the block bring the block down and we need to do exactly the same thing but this time we are hiding it so image dot fadeout so we're using the fadeout function now which works in exactly the same way as the fade in function we give it the same parameters as well so we're going to fade out a speed of three seconds we're going to create a function which is our callback function and this is going to put some text into the image feedback div image has been hidden so we can against a dollar and in brackets sorry image feedback and then dot HTML and inside here image has been hidden so now that we've done this we can go into our browser and refresh the page we can click show which will fade in this image and we have the callback function create this text in that div for us image has been shown and then when we press the hide button it fades out and we have image has been hidden so these fade in and fade out effects are extremely useful for things like galleries displaying images however you can feel free like I said in the last part of the tutorial to use them on any particular HTML element
