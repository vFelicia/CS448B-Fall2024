now let's just take a look at the files how we've included them and where we've obviously included jquery.js we've included plugin. JS here and we've included ext.js so plugin is our plugin declaration and how our plugin works at the moment it just alerts something out and ex is where we're going to be calling our plugin uh or rather where we're going to be making use of our plugin okay so there's nothing really else we need to do on this page obviously you need a title attribute for the the link that you're going to be using uh but inside ext.js we want to go ahead and actually call our plugin to make sure it's working so to alert this out so the first thing we want to go ahead and do is make sure the Dom is loaded or IE our document is ready so we want to say document. ready so inside this event handler we want to go ahead and create a function and we'll just pull that down so it just makes it a little bit uh neater and uh easier to read okay so now what we want to do is go ahead and apply our plugin that we've created called hovertext uh to an element on our page so we need to use a jQuery selector and I'm going to apply these to all a tags because I'm going to assume that the only a tags found on a user's page are links uh themselves so what we want to go ahead and do is use a JC selector and just write a and this will select all a elements on a page uh and then we just do Dot and how we would usually use uh any kind of functionality in j query whether it be part of the standard Library uh or any other plugins that we've used so we just call the function hover text uh so we just use hover text like this afterwards and obviously our parentheses here uh like I said before we're not supplying any parameters uh but if we were they would go in there okay so now that this is done when the document is ready uh we actually apply this uh plugin to all a tags and therefore what's going to happen is we're just going to alert out working so let's go ahead and just take a look at that all you can see that we've got this dialogue box appear now so we know that our uh plugin is actually working because we have this alert out here uh however we're going to go ahead and get rid of that now okay so the first step uh that we want to take is actually apply the uh div uh to to the page we want to put this div that we've created in style. CSS to the page uh and we're going to do this after our link now it doesn't really matter where we place it because we're going to position it dynamically um but what we want to go ahead and do is reference this uh and this uh applies to this here so anything we call in our uh essentially what is a function in our plugin uh we apply it to the current element that we're using the plugin on so this will apply to all H H tags and we want to go and use after in jQuery uh to apply some HTML code to the page so we create our div here uh or we type out our div declaration in here and we want to go ahead and set the ID of this to hover Text Now setting the ID of this to hover text will obviously pick this up uh where we created it in style. CSS let's just go and open that once again so it will apply this here uh all these um you know options and values to our uh div here so now what we see on the page is when we refresh we get this little box just appear here now we need to make a change to St . CSS I I know I said we weren't going to use it uh but we do want to set uh the uh div to be uh invisible almost so we're just going to say display none so this just won't display on the page you'll just have uh nothing displayed okay uh also this won't interfere with any other elements on your page so you don't need to worry about this actually taking up any space because it's um visibility set To None or the display is set to none uh it essentially is not on our document so we've uh applied this here afterwards it's there but it can't be seen uh and it doesn't interact in with anything else uh so now that we've applied this div we can go ahead and later on apply some text to it and set the top and the left dynamically to follow the M Mouse now the next step is to go ahead and get the title from the um the element that you've selected and applied this plugin to so in this case it's going to be the title here because we've applied it to all a tags now the flexibility issue in this plugin is that if we weren't using uh the this keyword like this uh we would uh you know be displaying the title for all links because we've selected all links so we need to make sure we're using this instead now we could go ahead and say a do attribute title and what that would take do is take the title attribute from all a elements but because we've applied to that already we want to make this unique by writing this so it will only take it from the current current uh element that we uh uh applying this to so if there are three links on the page uh each attribute will be different by using the this uh selector or the this keyword so we've G to get the uh We've G to got the title we need to make sure that the title has actually been defined we don't want to display uh this div if the title hasn't been defined so we need to check if first of all the title is undefined and second of all the title doesn't equal nothing uh and by this I mean uh let's just give an example this would be undefined if we didn't have it actually defined within our a tag and if we had this set to nothing uh then in that circumstance we wouldn't want to Output this div and we wouldn't want to put any text in it because there's no real text to put inside so we need to make sure that we uh handle this within our plugin just to make the user experience a lot better so we want to create an if statement uh and we want to inside of the condition first of we check that the title is not equal to undefined uh and also or the title doesn't equal nothing so we've already established the uh Title Here by using the title attribute so we want to make sure it doesn't equal undefined or the title doesn't equal nothing so just nothing inside some tags there uh and this will just mean that we don't get this the same effect uh if uh you know what I demonstrated earlier here wasn't available so if it hadn't been defined or it was nothing okay so inside of here we want to go ahead and actually start to create an event handler for when the mouse goes over a link CU that's the only time we want to go ahead and actually display this div in the mouse position so again we use this to select the current link or the current element that we're uh over and we want to use the mouse move event handler now we do more or less exactly oh sorry that's just jumped over there
