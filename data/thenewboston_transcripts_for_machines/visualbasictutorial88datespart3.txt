hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com/scishow on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be creating our own dates and changing the values of those dates now if you remember from the last tutorials when we created created a date object we could only get the current date and time now we can set our own date and time in our object so let's go ahead and we will declare another variable so we'll call will declare it change date as date so now what we can do is we can type current date equals and to put our date in we use the pound character and then we put our data in using the month/day/year format now if you live over in the UK you use the day month year but in Visual Basic you always need to use the American Way I don't know why they do this but it keeps you from confusing them so there's only one way you can do it which is month day and year so we'll just go ahead and do October 20th let's do the Year 2300 and we'll go ahead and set the we'll just leave the date at 1200 a.m. so we could set the date if we wanted to so but instead if we just leave nothing there it'll automatically set that date so let's go ahead and display this date so message box dot show current date dot to string if we go ahead and run this if we click show date we get October 20th 2300 at 1200 a.m. now we can also manipulate these dates to add certain values to it now we can add days months years seconds and hours and whatever we want so let's go ahead and set our change date to a change to current date change so type change date equals current date dot add and you can see we get ad days add hours add milliseconds add minutes add months seconds ticks and years so let's just go ahead and add days here so how many days we want to add well the value that we pass to this sub right here is a double so let's just use a number let's just add five days to it and then we'll type message box dot show and we will show changed date dot and let's just do to long date string so let's go ahead and run this and you can see that here's our form and when we click show date we get October twentieth 2300 click OK we get Thursday October 25th 2300 so let's go ahead and change this to two string instead so instead of October on instead of October 20th we get October 25th so let's just run this one more time and we'll look at it with the exact same formats so click show date October 20th and we add days we get October 25th now we can also add years so let's go ahead and add some years to this let's add 500 years let's go ahead and run this show day we get the Year 2300 and this we added 500 years so we get 2800 now you can also use negative values inside of the parameters for add anything so if you want to add seconds or months you can do a negative so let's subtract 150 or 250 years from our current date which should give us the value 2050 so we get 2300 and then 2050 so on go ahead and make some date objects and set them to certain dates that you want remember that you have to use the month day and then year format and you enclose this inside of pound symbols and then you can add years or months or whatever you like to the date and you can also use negative numbers and the argument for that is double so go ahead create some days to manipulate them make your own dates play with those and then once you are familiar with those go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
