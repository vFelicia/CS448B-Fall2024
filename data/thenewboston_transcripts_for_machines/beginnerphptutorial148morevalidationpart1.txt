hi this is alex from phpacademy.org back with another video for the new boston now in the user system we have completed everything and we have sorted out the form validation now there's a few points that we need to address before we continue any further let's just go back to our code and have a look and then we're going to run the web page so we can see what the output of everything is okay so at the moment we have our form form here which is actually reoccurring our data that's already been submitted in the form which is fair enough so when the user submits a username let's say alex a password which we're not saving just for security reasons um and then a first name let's say alex and then garrett now what happens if they haven't submitted this data we're just echoing it out as a variable so we're just echoing our username and then we're just echoing out first name and then just surname we're not saying has this data being submitted or not and we also have another issue in let's just open core.inc.php we've got this http referrer here now obviously the http referrer is going to give us the page that we were referred from so therefore if we were to open up um our page and we were to go over to the register.php file just php you can see that we are given a variety of errors now the error at the top is to do the http referral it gives us an undefined indexed error an undefined index error and what this means is that we have this variable here equal to an undefined index this has not been defined anywhere because we haven't been referred from anywhere if we had say a link on index.php and we were linking to this register page then we would be able to um would be able to uh have a referral a referrer information would be sent so how do we go and solve this problem well it's quite simple all we need to do is we need to come down a bit and we need to use an if statement to check if this here is already set before we define it so let's just come up here and we'll say if is set much like when we were doing the form validation on the register.php page dollar underscore server and then http referrer so we're doing exactly the same thing we're just saying is it set is it has this been set then we wrap that in the block um we could also say um and not empty http referrer just for added peace of mind i guess it's this part here isn't important necessarily but it just means is it set and is it not empty remember we're using the exclamation mark for not then we set the variable so we only set this variable here if we perform these checks correctly and this block is run so therefore we're not going to receive an undefined index error because we're not setting a variable to something that doesn't exist because these checks up here do the existence check for us so let's go back and refresh okay can you can see that that error is gone let's go back to the index page that court is included in as well and you'll see that the error's gone as well so we've solved part of our problem now you've probably noticed back on register.php we've got exactly the same error message we've got here notice undefined variable username in and then it will tell us all about the information this is a php error but because we've echoed it out let's just go down because we've echoed out in the value property of our input type here or our input field it's given it to us with its html data we've got the same here as well notice undefined variable first name notice undefined variable surname so how do we go about doing this well we say the exact same process applies to this code here um then we've just changed this here so what we need to do is we need to say if and then we start a block so the block the the if the block if the um condition is true we're executing or running rather this block here so if is set um username echo that and then that's it that solved our problem so if is set username then echo username otherwise don't and we can't but the and doesn't equal it is not empty but it's not terribly important for now so let's refresh and you can see that that's disappeared from there so we've solved that one now let's just go down and correct the others so we're using inline php here we're saying if and then we're oh no sorry i've missed the echo there so we put that echo back in the right place there um then we need to obviously close our block so again if is set first name so the the type of error you you see you just need to look at it carefully and think undefined variable we have an undefined variable now why might it be that we have undefined surname just look through your code just examine your code and see what's happening obviously we haven't submitted the form so we've uh we've created these variables for ourself to be able to use username password now that we're using these this username first name and surname what it's doing is it's grabbing data from post that hasn't actually been submitted we're not posting the first name when we just land on register.php so we need to incorporate checks that deal with errors like this because the last thing you want to do is to be uh is to be dealing with um or showing these errors to your users
