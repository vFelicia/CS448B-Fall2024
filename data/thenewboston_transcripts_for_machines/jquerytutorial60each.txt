hi this is Alex from PHP academy' doll with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to take a look at some basic document traversing or basic traversing in jQuery and essentially what we're going to be doing is passing along which is essentially what traversing is passing along each input field on this page and there only happens to be two at the moment but essentially what we're going to be doing is taking the results from each input field on the page and we're going to be combining the two now obviously this isn't really well this doesn't really have its practical uses if you were to for example want to combine a name you'd probably uniquely reference each of these anyway and then just combine the values but we're just going to be looking at the each statement or the each you know function or whatever you want to call it in jQuery where we can pass along each element by a specific type and we're going to be choosing the input type with a an input field with the type text okay so let's go ahead over to our text editor and we'll start to write this out so inside index.php we've obviously got jquery included here as well as EXT dot j s which is just going to handle or have all of our jQuery code in I'm going to go ahead and create a couple of input fields and then I'm going to create a div area that's going to show the combined results so the first thing we want to do is go ahead and create two input fields with the type text which is pretty straightforward and I'm just going to go ahead and surround these in paragraph tags so we can keep them separate from our div that we're going to put down here in just a moment let's then go and create a button as well which is going to have an event handler assigned to it and this is just going to be a combined button so the the type is button obviously and the value we can just say combined we need to go ahead and give this an ID and I'm just going to call it combined or combined so we can obviously let's just go and refresh we can type something in here and here click combined and then we process the traversing of these two fields or many fields as we have on our page and then just down here we're going to display them in a div area so I'm going to go ahead and create a div and we'll go ahead and give this an ID of combined that just makes sense so combined and obviously it's not visible on the page but obviously whatever we put inside of here will be a you know be visible and we're going to be putting the text inside of here from the combined once we press combined so quite straightforward let's go ahead and get rid of this now let's go ahead overhead 2x tjs which I mentioned we have included in this page and let's start writing the jQuery code so the first thing we want to do is wait for the document to be ready so we use document and the ready event handler inside of this event handler we outline a function so we've got function our parentheses and we've got our block here and I'm just going to pull that down and anything inside of here is what's going to be executed when the Dom is loaded and the document is ready so the first thing we want to go ahead and do is actually set up an event handler for our combined button so we've got this combined button and we need to use a selector to select this and we're going to be selecting it by ID so our name is combined here so we want to go ahead and use a hash because we're using an ID selector and then combine the event handler it's just going to be click so once this button is clicked like this we run the function inside of this event handler so let's go ahead and outline that function and just again pull it down as we did with document and the ready event handler and we want to go ahead and first of all just initiate a variable that called combined text obviously we need somewhere to store our combined text before we place it into our div so I'm just going to save our combined text and because we're using dot sorry equals nothing save our combined underscore text equals nothing but we have string data here the reason that we do this is when we use each if we don't go ahead and create a variable beforehand the combined text variable will show as unset or is not set because we're going to be just using wig enimies using the plus equals operator to just combine the values on you'll see what I mean in a moment so now is the step of actually selecting all input type fields with the type of text so again we use a jQuery selector and on to the end of this we're going to use the each statement of the each function so inside of here we want to say input is current state that selected all input fields but in brackets we want to supply where the type is equal to text so any input field with the type of text will now be selected and what we want to do is we want to use each on the end of this and this will actually sort of loop through each occurrence of this selector on the page so we've got one here and we've got one here so inside of each we use a function once again now we can supply an additional thing in here we could say index if we wanted to and what this would do is if we were for example to say alert index you'll notice that when we refresh and click combined you'll see we've got 0 here which represents this one here and then we've got one here which represents this field here so we can use the index if we want we can obviously also use I think we can do index and then value and we can output index + and we'll just do a space plus value so we rependa ng on a space here as a post well apart sorry again with these index and value and if we look to go ahead and type say refresh Alex all right and click combine okay yes so we don't we don't have this here but I'm going to show you another way to do it so we'll just ignore that for now and we'll go ahead and ignore this for now we can also get the value by using this here which refers to the current input type that's selected so either the one index 0 or index 1 and then we can use dot Val on the end sorry dot Val
