hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we're going to look at an Ajax request in jQuery that lets you simply load uh another page into your current page and what we're going to be doing is we're going to be creating an external file which we're then going to load into a div on our page so the first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and create a button that's going to uh sort of initiate this loading so let's go ahead and create an input button and I'm going to give that a value of load now we need to go over to another page in our text editor so we'll create a new file in our text editor and I'm going to actually uh create some content that I want to be displayed from this page so I'm going to create some strong tags here this has been loaded in to another page okay so let's go ahead and in the root directory let's save this out as um let's just call it page. HTML okay so now that we've saved um page. HTML inside index.php we need to decide where we want to put it when we press this button so I'm going to create a div underneath here and I'm going to give that an ID of content the button I'm also going to give an ID and I'm just going to call that button so essentially what we're going to do is press this button and we're going to have this page. HTML loaded into this div area here so it's an extremely useful and simple technique in jQuery that allows you to perform what would usually take you probably about 15 lines to write in uh Ajax alone so let's go ahead and create uh an external Javascript file that's going to handle the clicking of the button and then the loading of the content into this div so I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to save this inside my Js directory and I'm going to save this as ajax.php page so I'm going to re um create another uh script tag that's going to handle the include of this file so uh we've got type is text / JavaScript and the file we need to include is JS ax.jpg inside this div so let's go ahead and create the event handler we need to use a selector and we are using this selector on this ID of button so we use a hash and then button and we say dot click so when the button is clicked we want to go ahead uh and uh carry out this operation to put this page inside the div so we need to create a function within this and uh a block as well using curly braces now I'm going to pull this down a couple of lines and inside here will be the one line of code which will include this page. HTML inside this div so it's extremely extremely simple to do so the first thing we need to do is find out where we want to put this page now that's in this div which I've called content so we can again use a selector hash content um and now we need to use the load function so do load now inside of load we're going to take one parameter or we're going to supply this with one parameter and that's going to be the name of the file you want to include so in this case it's page. HTML okay so now that we've done that we can go ahead to our browser and test this I'm going to refresh the page and we have our load button like we created earlier now the div is just underneath here and hopefully when we press this button we'll have page. HTML included inside our content div so we've loaded this page inside of our content so let's go ahead and press load you can see that the text that we created earlier inside of the HTML file with the strong tags because you can see it's been shown in bold has been loaded into this div area now we've included an HTML file but this doesn't actually have to just be an HTML extension let's go ahead and create a new file and we're going to call this um let's go back to the root directory I'm going to call this page.php P okay so I'm going to close page. HTML now we want to load the contents of page.php inside of this div so you may be wondering can we use PHP code inside of this uh in order to load it into our div well yes of course you can let's go ahead and just create a simple Loop um that's just going to count from a number upwards so we'll say count from one to 10 so we Echo our X so we've created a simple Loop that's going to Echo out um numbers from 1 to 10 and then we are going to uh display this inside of our content div so we're using H uh we're using PHP code um inside of this page.php and loading that into content so let's go ahead and click load okay let me just go back and check if there's anything wrong uh okay um I think over here yeah we'll use uh this here okay so so just a bit of the logic behind this because I did make a mistake uh X is starting at one uh the condition is then that X while X is uh less than or equal to 10 uh we uh increment X so uh the page did successfully load but the content didn't show because I had the logic mixed up let's goad and press load and you can see that we've now loaded numbers 1 to 10 so we've now successfully included a PHP file uh inside of um our uh inside of our content div now you may be thinking can I go ahead and include image files inside of uh my content div for example if I just open up my uh directory that I have here and let's look at all the files I've got an image called taran. jpg so what I'm going to do is I'm going to try and attempt to load this into uh my div directly so we uh load taran. jpg into our content area now this would be extremely useful if you wanted to load a file into a Content area however the problem with this is it's going to load the file contents as opposed to interpret it as an image what we would need to actually do is um change the headers on the document for this IM to be displayed correctly let's go ahead and see what happens now you'll see that uh a load of rubbish will eventually pop up uh this is just obviously the file contents for the image as opposed to the image directly so using this load method we can't directly load an image in however if you were to include an image on an HTML page uh you could then load that in so we've looked at including um a basic HTML file and then a PHP file with some PHP code in it uh obviously you can use other file extensions as long as the page can be interpreted by your uh your server um you can actually load um any page in you like uh with whatever web development language you choose to write in so that's essentially the load function which takes uh advantage of Ajax calls that would usually just include a page inside and like I said before we've uh used three lines here uh with with um Ajax we would probably use about 15 to to 20 lines
