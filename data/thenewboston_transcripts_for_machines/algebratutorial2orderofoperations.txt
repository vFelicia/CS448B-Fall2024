okay so today we're gonna discuss the order of operations and an operation is just what you do to the numbers so we follow the order PEMDAS or please excuse my dear Aunt Sally which stands for parentheses so we do with inside parentheses first so three plus five is eight and then excuse which deals with exponents where we would solve this second so to the to the third is 8 multiplication and division which come which go together multiplication isn't always before division what determines it is if I had 2 times 5 divided by 2 I would I start coming from the left and I do what appears first so I would do 2 times 5 just 10 divided by 2 which is 5 but if it came this way and it was 2 divided by 4 times 5 I would do division first 8 divided by 4 which is 2 times 5 equals 10 so these two sometimes you don't have multiplication so sometimes you have to do division first or sometimes multiplication comes up first so that's how we determine those two but we do multiplication or division after exponents so we'd get 2 times 5 is 10 and then 8 divided by 4 which is 2 and then the same thing goes for addition and subtraction it just depends on which shows up first which you do what which one you do first so in 4 plus 3 which is 7 8 minus 1 which is 7 and then so we're gonna use this order please excuse my dear Aunt Sally to solve some long equations so for each one of these we're gonna follow our order of operations so first we do parentheses but in this first problem there are no parentheses so we don't have to worry about that next we do multiple excuse me we do exponents but again we don't have any exponents so we don't have to worry about that next comes multiplication or division so we start coming we start here and since division shows up first we're gonna do that 2/5 or excuse me 25 divided by 5 which is 5 and then I'm gonna rewrite the rest of this I like to do it one step at a time at first because until you get really good at using your order of operations it helps keep everything straight in your head so next we're gonna we're still doing multiplication and division so 5 times 4 is 20 and we're gonna copy this down I'm still on multiplication and a division and since I still have one more multiplication I'm gonna do that first so 20 minus 15 times 8 which is 120 so 20 minus 120 gives me a negative 100 okay so for this next one we have these things out here which are called brackets and a bracket separates a part of an equation from another part of equation so what we do first for this one is the thing inside the parentheses so 12 divided by we're gonna leave our brackets up 8 divided by 2 which is 4 times 3 divided by 3 which is 1 and we leave those in the brackets so the brackets are just another form of parentheses which separates a whole part of an equation from another part so now what we do is what's inside brackets first so 4 times 1 which gives us 4 and now we can do our exponents but we don't have any so then we go to multiplication and division and the only thing left is division so then we do twelve divided by four and we get three so for this last one I have for you it's kind of tricky okay so when we solve this one we're gonna treat the top and the bottom like two separate equations and then our very last step is going to be actually dividing the top by the bottom so we're gonna do order of operations for the top and the bottom separately so for order of operations first for the top we have parenthesis but there are no parentheses and there aren't any exponents so then we go to multiplication and division so the first thing that shows up is multiplication so we do 3 times 2 which is 6 and then I'm going to read rewrite the whole top okay and I'm gonna do my order of operations on the bottom two our first step it would be parentheses which we don't have and next is exponents so 3 squared is 9 plus 2 squared is 4 plus 1 squared is 1 so then we're going to start with the top again what comes after our multiplication well division or multiplication depending on what comes up first since division comes up first we're going to divide 6 divided by 6 so we get 1 plus 2 times 3 divided by 6 over and our next step for the bottom is gonna be addition since that's the only thing that's left so and since addition is commutative we can do all this addition at once so 9 plus 4 which is 13 plus 1 which is 14 now I still got some work to do on the top I can't finish this completely yet so the next thing I'm still on multiplication and division the next thing that shows up is multiplication so 1 plus 2 times 3 which is 6 divided by 6 over 14 so we're zone multiplication and division and we're gonna get one plus 6 divided by 6 which is 1 over 14 if we do our last step on the top which is addition we're gonna get 2 over 14 and we're gonna reduce this fraction we're not actually gonna divide it and get a decimal we're gonna leave it as a fraction just because it's easier but I can reduce this by twos 2 goes into 2 once 2 goes into 14 seven times the final answer is 1/7 so that's all of our review for of operations just remember the phrase please excuse my dear Aunt Sally every time we're going to solve an equation but make sure you come back and watch your next video which is going to be on opposites and absolute values
