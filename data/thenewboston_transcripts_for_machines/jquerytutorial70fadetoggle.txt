hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked with a video tutorial for the new Boston in the past couple of videos we have looked at the fade in and fade out functions however the disadvantage to this is you don't have the option to use one button to toggle this effect we've already looked at toggling different effects such as showing and hiding things however there is a function in jQuery called fade toggle and this allows us to use two different states the first state will be well the option you give it and then the second step it will be a fade in or fade out and then the second state will be to obviously do the reverse so to fade in off to fade out so what we can actually do is start to create our image so I'll just include our image in here and this is tartan jpg oh I'll just give tartan we need to give this an ID as well so I'll give this an ID of image now what I want to do is create one single button which is going to fade in and fade out these simultaneously so if I go ahead and create an input type button and we'll give this a value of fade in/out okay so let's break up now in a paragraph there okay so let's go ahead and preview this in our browser you can see that we've got one button fade in our Anna and our image is currently displayed and because our images that currently displayed when we press this button it will actually fade our image out when we press the button again it will fade the image back in so now let's go ahead and create the functionality for this inside effect Jas I've already included this in my page as well as jQuery so let's go to effects Jas okay so first of all we need to create a event handler so an event handler for the button which we have named we didn't give it an ID so let's give that an ID first I'm just gonna call this say in out so the button in out we need to check for a click what we then need to do is inside we have this function and inside of this block here we'll bring that down and we start to use the fade toggle function so we reference our image so that's hash image and then we say dot fade toggle so this doesn't require any parameters such as like the hide the show function the fade in and the fade out function however let's go ahead and test it and then give it some additional parameters so let's click this you can see our image fades out and we click it again and you see it fade in now similarly if you wanted the image to be faded out beforehand you can use CSS to style this so I'm gonna just create a style attribute in my image tag obviously inline CSS isn't recommended but for the purpose of this tutorial I'm going to use it and I'm just gonna write display and then none so now what will happen is when we refresh our browser the image doesn't exist well it does exist but it's not shown when I click fade in fade out it automatically fades us in so it detects its visibility and then toggles it accordingly we can then again fade out and back in again now there are additional parameters for fade toggle we have either a textual representation of the speed for example slow will just simply slow the animation down you'll see there is significantly slower we can also then give it a speed so alternatively we can give it a speed for example 500 which is 5 seconds 5000 sorry which is 5 seconds we were to fade in you can see it takes significantly longer to fade in we also have the option to use a callback function well beforehand you can set the the animation type as well by default it is swing that's if you don't give it any parameter however you also have linear which doesn't make too much of a difference but this can be used in most animation effects so we also have the option for a callback function and this essentially will just do something once the animation has been complete so for example we can alert the user animation complete what's going to happen now is once we click the button we're going to toggle the fade it's going to be 5 seconds the effect type is going to be linear and this callback function here with this block in here will be run but only once the animation is complete so ie the image is completely faded in or faded out so we can test that now by clicking fade in you'll see that that takes about five seconds to fade in and once it has faded in we will have a alert box come up saying animation complete and then again that's the same with fading out if we press it we wait about five seconds well exactly five seconds for it to fade out and then we have the same dialog box up here so that's the fade toggle function in jQuery
