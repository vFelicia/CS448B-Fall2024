so what we've done is we've selected just the field that we want from the users table where the ID is equal to the user ID that's logged in then we're running the query and checking if that works and if that does Works we're work sorry we're returning the result and the result takes in the query that we've run we're guessing the first row remember it starts at zero even though our ID starts at one that's just a superficial value it doesn't mean anything it's just a data that's stored but in actual fact we're returning row zero and that's and we're grabbing the field name field that we specified okay so um let's um in fact we can improve this still but I'll do that in a minute I'll show you that it works first we could uh even enclose this in an if statement and return if it's not worked we can return um the value not found um so let's do that I guess we can do that now so if that so if this returns a value we execute something in here now we need to assign a variable to this so I can say query result is equal to that if it does work return query result so we're constructing our um query we're running the query if the query is running we or has run successfully without error we are executing this block in here we're then in an if statement setting a variable called query result to this if this query or if this function rather works we then return the value we've just set here uh using these that I've already explained so let's give it a go let's um say we'll just do it down here for now so I'm going to Echo get user field and I want to get first name so we applying now the field name that we want to get remember the field name first name will be equal to Alex in this case because we're selecting from where the ID is one okay so let's test to see if this works and then we can apply it to this use you've logged in sentence let's go back to our page and refresh hopefully that works yeah that's worked so we've got Alex being returned so now let's enter a field name that doesn't exist I don't exist and let's refresh now we've not returned anything um um that's because um this that's because this has returned as false if we just had this on it own we'd have a nasty SQL error in the middle of something so if we can't find a field we just don't display it rather than causing a big error inside our program so let's go back to where we are we to index.php what we can now do is if logged in we can say first name is equal to get user field first name oh no first name then we can say surname is equal to get user field surname and then we can incorporate these inside of this sentence so you're logged in first name surname oh remember we're using single quotation mark so we need to escape that for uh first name and then we do a space and we can escape that again and say surname so you're logged in escape this string um concatenate on the first name and then we do us another space concate on the surname and then we continue the string so now we can see that on index.php it's taking the information relevant to us so uh let's just put a full stop after that and refresh so it looks a bit better okay so you're looked in Alex Garett now let's try it when we log out and log in as Billy okay so you can see that it's now taking the data relevant to the user that's currently logged in and it's displaying it back to us so now we can supply any field we we want any field name we want inside here and it will display it back to the user so when you eventually uh use um these examples for yourself when you're learning and you want to create the registration form which we're going to do in the next stage um you can add as many fields as you want to your database and then you can just use this function that we've created inside here which will be available at any page that you want it to be um by just requiring it up here uh you can just use this function to select any field so if we now even go and add a field to this so we added say telephone number we can then just respecify that inside um using this function so that's basically how we are grabbing data about the user and displaying it onto our page
