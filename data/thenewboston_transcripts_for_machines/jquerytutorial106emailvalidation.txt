hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with video tutorial for the new boston in this video we're going to be taking a look at creating an email validation field which you could go ahead and implement into your foot into a form on your website if you require it the way it works is we click in here and we have this message saying go ahead type a valid email address so when we go ahead and start to actually type a valid email address we have this feedback here which is just a span area just feed us back some information about what we're typing inside this field so at the moment it says that's not quite a valid email address if I then go on and continue to type you'll also see that something like Alex at PHP academy' would be regarded as a valid email address for example it could be something like local host here this is just the way that PHP validates email addresses with the filter Val function however you could then go on adapt it to check for a TLD at the end although dog then still a valid email address so we're concentrating on the jQuery side of this and we are going to be using PHP to build the backend that's actually going to validate this form we're not actually using jQuery to validate it so we're using PHP essentially to validate and then feedback the response from you know the text that's been typed in here by the user back to the user so whichever way you choose to validate you can apply this to a variety of other different fields as well in a form obviously you wouldn't go ahead and just copy and paste the code that we're about to write but you could find a way to pick up on each of the fields and validate them separately maybe create a global type for a field for example text and then supply it with a specific amount of data however for the purpose of this example application we're looking at filtering an email address and feeding back information to the user okay so let's go ahead and start to build our basic form we also need to include Ajax j/s which is the file that's going to handle all of our jQuery then we're going to go ahead and a bit later on create a PHP file which is going to be you know the file that processes all this information let's just take a look at our directory structure we've got this folder called j/s where this ajax file is located this one here and obviously jQuery as well we've already included jQuery into our page however we need to go ahead and include this Ajax jas father I have open in my text editor and that's the jQuery that's going to handle the events and everything inside of our room inside of our page as well as handling the Ajax post requests so that's that we're going to go on later and create a file inside the our PHP folder which is going to handle the requests sent by our Ajax jes file so step one is to go ahead and include this Ajax file into our page so I'm going to go ahead and create some script tags type is text forward slash JavaScript and the source is js4 slash Ajax jas so now that's included we can start to create some jQuery code or writes and jQuery code inside this Ajax j/s file and that's going to handle the form we're just about to create or the field that we're just about to create so I'm going to create a label here just saying email and then I'm going to go ahead and create an input field okay so the input field type is going to be text we're just asking for the user to type text in we're also then going to give this an ID and that's just going to be email now just one point I'd like to make I am using html5 and you can actually give the type email so you can now specify email from html5 they've created a validation here however what's happening is you're validating on the front end and at the time of recording this video html5 is a touchy subject when it comes to browser support let's just open our browser and take a look at this example if I was to go ahead and type Alex at PHP and if I was to submit this form let's just go ahead and create a submit button ok so if I was to go ahead and submit this form with just say Alex in here we have this or we should do anyway because we're not using a form that's just there we are okay so when I click Submit you see this you know little div or whatever it would would be pops up just saying please enter an email address so html5 is now validating on the frontend now the downfall to this that I've already explained is that html5 you know is you know not entirely compatible at the time of recording this video so depending on when you're watching it html5 is you know one of them things that is not compatible with some browsers in some areas the other reason is is that backend validation is genuine generally more reliable and can be tailored with regards to you know what exactly what you want to look for if you were to do everything in JavaScript if you to do all the email validation in JavaScript you would you know users would be able to get around this so we need to validate in the backend somehow so that's just a quick explanation as to why this example is in place we're going to keep this as typed text just so the user can type some text in and if you are choosing not to use html5 then this method will be you know useful to you okay so now that we've done that let's just refresh we've already seen this somewhat now the first thing that we need to do is when the user clicks into here so when it becomes in focus we need to display some text here
