hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be finishing our customer program that uses structures and if you this doesn't look familiar to you go back to tutorial 68 and that's where we start building this program so um enough rambling let's go ahead and get started so um we created a structure we created an object of that structure and let's go and take this out just to make it a little bit more readable um uh we set the values of that structure and we called display customer and passed our object to it and so basically what display customer does is it takes a sorry about that it takes a c customer and it sets the text of the text value text first name uh to custo customer. first name so now what we're going to do is we're going to fill in the name field so the way we're going to do this is we're going to use a um a readon property now if you don't know what properties are then go back and uh to one of the earli tutorials um because this will just confuse you now one thing about structures is that you you don't um you aren't constrained to only use uh variables and values inside of your structure you can also use methods and properties and other stuff so in our case we're going to create a property so we'll go ahead and type public now we don't want the property to be able to set a value value uh because there's no need to so what we're going to do is we're going to type readon property so what this says is um make a property but don't let us make a set function so it will let us use a get but we cannot use set so now what we're going to do is we're just going to give a name for this and we'll set it equal to name for the uh name field right here and now we need to specify a data type for it so we'll just do as string and now you can see that when we press enter it adds the get and end property for us you can see it doesn't add the set for us because it because it is read only so now what we need to do is we need to add first name and last name to each other so we will just type return first name and then we'll just add a space in between that and then last name so what this is going to do do is the property name is going to be equal to first name plus a space plus last name so now what we need to do is we need to set the um we need to put that inside of this text box right here which is text name so we'll scroll down here and we will find our display customer sub so you can see we set text first name. text text last name. text and text email. text okay so now we come up here to the first first line of display customer and we're just going to type text name. text and we will set it equal to cust do name now name is read as a value uh you can see that it gives us uh instead of the Blue Square we are going to get this little um pointing finger right here to a list and that just represents a property Um this can also represent constants and other things inside a Visual Basic once you learn what these icons mean um you'll be able to see things really fast and know what they are and it it may not seem like it but it helps a lot when you're um programming anything so um now let's go up here and we will run this and if we type list customer we get Jim Jones first name is Jim last name is Jones and we've got the email jones. Jim live.com so now let's go ahead and I'll just show you that we can create more than one customer so we'll just type private object new customer as customer now these two are completely independent of each other and they are independent of the customer structure because we are creating what's called an object of it which creates one of them so um we'll go ahead and come down here and we will set the values for object new customer so object new customer do first name let's equal that let's set that equal to Sam and then object new customer. last name and I'm not going to put my real last name on here let's just do um hello that'll be my last name sounds like a good last name and then we'll do object new customer. email equals let's just do um my email at programmer. okay so now we can just go ahead and instead of using object customer we will send object new customer and we'll go ahead and run this and you can see that we have our normal form and if we click list customer we get Sam hello first name Sam last name hello and email my email program.com so that was just a little demonstration to show you that um you can create as many structures as you want and they are stored as objects and they are completely independent of each other and each can have different values for the variables and they won't affect each other so um we also talked about readon properties uh which was the main focus of this tutorial there's also such thing as write only properties which um instead of giving you only Git You you only get the uh the set function uh which we'll be covering later on a couple couple tutorials after this because we don't need that in anything else so um thanks for watching guys and stay tuned for the next tutorial
