alright guys welcome back to your fifth C++ tutorial and in this tutorial since we now have the knowledge of variables within C++ let's put that knowledge to use so let's go ahead and make three variables right now but I'm going to be making them a little bit different than before so in the last tutorial we had a variable like a and you said equal to the value like 54 simple enough but I want to tell you guys that whenever you first create a variable you have the option of assigning the value then or assigning the value later on such as a equals 54 this is perfectly fine and you can do it this way so whenever you first create a variable and you don't assign the value this is called declaring the variable declaring is just another name for creating the variable so let's go ahead and create three variables and by the way I'm going to be making a basic computer program where the user enters two numbers such as like 2 & 3 and the computer is going to add them together and it's going to give them the answer which would be 5 so int a I'm going to have a variable called a and I'm going to have another variable called B and what we're going to be doing is we're going to be calculating the sum or in other words when you add the two numbers together the answer of that and storing it in a variable called sum so we don't have any of the values yet so that's why we can't fill them in the users going to be entering the values for us so the first thing we want to make in this program is just a little prompt on the screen the tell the user to enter a number and we do that using C out and we just write enter a number pause and then let's go ahead and write newline and now we need a way for the user actually to input information from their keyboard so here's a neat little thing I can tell you see out took information from your computer and output it to the screen but anytime you want to take information from the computer or excuse me from the user and give it to the computer you need to use C I n so C out basically takes information from the computer and gives it to the user cien takes information from the user and gives it to the computer so if you're right CIN and by the way if you're taking the test this is technically called the input stream object and the little greater than greater than sign is called the stream exaction extraction operator so you know make sure to fill that out on your multiple choice if you're watching this in the C++ class or something so anyways you can see that this is different from the C out for two reasons first of all it's C in instead of C out and also your arrows face the opposite way that's because you're giving information to the computer instead of the computer giving information to you so now what we can do is we're going to enter a number and whatever number we're enter we need to give it a place to store that number well we already have a variable right here so let's go ahead and use that and use the variable a so check this out it's going to allow us to enter enter a number and whatever number we enter it's going to be stored in the variable a so for example if we enter the number three a is going to be equal to three simple enough so now that we have that variable taken care of we basically need to do the same thing again with the other variable B so C out will say enter another number and just go ahead and we'll just make a new line to make the program easier to read and use that C n again but now when they enter a number we want that value to be equal to the variable B so they're going to enter two numbers one's going to be equal to a the other is going to be equal to B so now for the sum we don't want them to you know enter value for the sum we want to calculate that ourselves so in order to do that just go ahead and write sum equals a plus B and now what your computer program is going to do is it's going to say RA I'm going to grab the very excuse me I'm going to grab the value you put in for a and I'm going to grab the value you put in for B and going to calculate that and I'm going to store that in the variable sum so for example if you wrote ten and fifteen it's going to say alright grab ten grab fifteen calculate the sum of it which is 25 and store it in a variable called sum so now the sum is equal to the answer and all we have to do now is print it out on the screen so see out will just write the sum of those numbers is is it the sum of those numbers are or some of those numbers is I think it is because it's one song and again anytime you want to add more than one line of text you could do it like this you could write a new line and then print this out on another line but I want to add on the same line so I'm going to go ahead and add another insertion operator just like that and just go ahead and write sum and then add another one and just go ahead and write end line just so our program looks nice and neat so basically well let me go ahead and run this and I'll talk you guys through it after I run it our computer program says enter a number Huss I'm going to enter 50 and then go ahead and press Enter once I press enter 50 is going to be stored in the variable a it says enter another number I'm going to enter 32 then I'm going to press ENTER and that 32 is going to be stored in the variable B then it's going to make our calculation and print it out on the screen the sum of those numbers is 82 50 plus 32 is indeed 82 so remember what we did is basically this we made three variables that we're going to be using later on the first thing it said is just basically a prompt enter a number then we entered 50 it stored 50 in the variable a using CN again CN is a way that the user can give information to the computer program instead of the other way around so now a is equal to 50 it gave us another prompt and we typed in 32 now B is equal to 32 so in order to calculate the sum we took the sum variable and set it equal to the sum of 50 plus 32 so now some holds the value of 82 or 83 whatever I typed in I can't remember and then all we did is we printed it out on the screen and again we could have wrote three different statements for this one C out for this one C out for this one C out for this but in order to save us some time we can actually use this operator right here and print everything out on one line so that is why our program ran the way that again let's go ahead and run it one more time enter a number 44 and 76 hit enter that some of those numbers is 120 pretty cool huh so that's how you build a basic calculator in C++ using variables and C out so now that you got that done on we can begin moving on to the next topic which is I don't know but trust me it's going to be amazing so um you study this and once you understand the basics of variables and CN you're ready to move on to next video so for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in the next tutorial
