already houses welcome back and in this video we are going to be talking about titles so another great place to include your keywords is in the titles of your webpages so let me just type in the movie Boston alright so most of the time whenever you type something in Google this big bold thing that appears the main heading for each search result is going to be the title of that page so this says the New Boston free educational video tutorials that's what this is right here and in HTML let me pop up this alright art so this would go in between the title tags right there now a couple things that we have to look out for is first of all your title should be a descriptive and detailed overview of each webpage so a really bad idea whenever you're making let's say you're trying to make the New Boston if you just stuck the New Boston and that's it for the title of every single web page then Google is going to have a really difficult time telling difference between the homepage in the forum and the profile pages so in your title when every year at someone's profile put the New Boston profile the New Boston videos if you're the videos page and just not some generic you know like my store as the title on every single web page now another thing we type in like alright so another thing I want to point out is you should probably keep your titles limited to under 65 characters now the reason for that is like I said this is the main thing that the user is going to see whenever they are looking at your search results so they're going to read this and if it's too long for example this one down here corn vegetable directory watch your garden grow it gets cut off you see that there is that little ellipsis and it doesn't have room for the full title so you always want people looking for your webpage to be able to read the full title and watch your garden grow whoa watch your garden grill we'd watch your garden grow to enormous sizes and eat you I don't know what is it so again just keep your titles limited now another thing I want to point out is this it's better to have your specific keywords closer to the beginning of your title so for example on my website I wanted the New Boston in every title no matter if it was the videos pages the profile whatever so on this one it's the New Boston free education on this one it was let's see the New Boston videos whatever now on my profile right here I actually took the New Boston and before it I wrote Bucky Roberts because whenever someone is looking for Bucky Roberts the new Boston I don't want the new Boston to appear first because they're looking for me so I want the first thing that they see is Bucky Roberts now when words are closer to the beginning of your title this tells Google that these words are more important so again the further you go I don't know maybe if it's the 30th word of the title it's really not that important so again stick your important keywords if beginning and by important I mean the key words that are specific to this single page now the last thing I want to point out is I like typing in buy stuff so bye bye nothing that doesn't really hurt by a star re there we go in by the way now that I'm just talking about this I heard that you can never really buy a star like this is kind of some big scam so basically no one can just like own a star because on I can't so anyone can just back pages by star we're gonna print out some certificate and mail it to you but you know it's not like legal or anything like that so guys don't buy stars I don't know I saw it on reddit and I'll pretty much believe anything that's out there so let's get getting sidetracked again come on Bucky let's focus here all right so what I want to say is the title of your webpage he isn't just for search engines I know you're going to have a lot of juicy keywords that you want to target a lot of phrases that you want your webpage to appear at the top of the results so you think all right if I want to make buy star I'm just going to name my title biased our purchase our own new stars naming stars whatever so you can do all of that but who's going to click a title that pretty much just has a bunch of random words in it these titles are also for users so whenever a user is looking at this not only do you have to have a title that is going to appear at the top of the search results but you have to have a title that makes sense that grabs their attention that makes it something that they want to click and this is kind of a marketing technique where you just can't have like a bunch of random keywords that's not even a sentence so not only do you have to make a title that is going to be juicy with keywords but make sure to grab a person's attention we're building these pages for humans not search engines and lastly since I have some time I'll talk to you guys about the meta description so basically we know that let me type in something else this is annoying me for something buy a house actually buy a domain that's kind of computer related all right so bio domain we know that this big blue thing is the title of your website the thing that appears under it in green is the URL now this right here the text that this is is the Meta Description now if you're ever making a website the Meta Description is this right here kind of looks like this so any meta tag this is data about your website but it doesn't actually display on your website anywhere it's basically just background information about I don't know maybe the browser or maybe for search engines it's data that you don't want the user to typically see now this description right here what it is is basically how can I say this it's a slightly longer description of your page so I pop this back up where the heck is it there was art so this is going to appear under the title and by the way if you just don't have any Meta Description at all whenever you're making your website then what Google is likely going to do is it's just going to grab the first chunk of text and use that as your Meta Description so that's what that's what it's going to appear or display right there now it's a good idea to stay under 160 characters for the same reason is the title so you see that this is a good description it's not too long you can read the entire thing this right here is a little bit too long so it's it gets cut off at the end right here and again whenever a user goes to GoDaddy they never see that description so why would you ever have a description that's not going to be seen by anyone essentially I don't know who knows so again whenever you're making your titles and your meta descriptions make sure to add keywords in those again don't add your keywords like 800 times a good point of focus I guess or kind of a target is to include a keyword once in your title and once in your description and also make sure that neither of them are too long attentiongrabbing and readable for humans not search engines so there you go hopefully you guys learned a little something and yeah again like you can see right here register domain or Cir domain hey include your keywords in the description and you'll be one happy guy I'll see you guys next time
