So today we're going to learn the two other ways to solve systems of equations so the first way is by elimination so given two equations add a multiple of one to eliminate a variable so you're going to take the smaller equation or not the smaller equation but see how X in this equation is positive and this 2x is negative if I add a positive and a negative together they're going to cancel each other out so we want to take the x that has the smaller coefficient which is this one because this only has a coefficient of one we want to multiply it by something that'll allow it to cancel with this 2 2X so we want to multip ly this whole equation by two so we're going to multiply everything by two so we get 2 y = 2x + 4 and we don't do anything with this one so now what we're going to do is we're going to write this equation right underneath it and we're going to add these two equations together so 2 y + y gives you 3 y 2x + a 2X gives you 0 x and 4 + 1 gives you pos3 so now we have 3 Y is equal to 3 if you divide by 3 you get Y is equal to 1 so now we have to take this Y and plug it into either one of these equations and we're going to do it into both of them just so you see that you'll get the exact same answer so y y is = x + 2 since we know Y is equal to 1 we're going to plug it in for y you get x + 2 if you subtract the two over you get x = 1 and if you plug it into this equation you get 1 is equal to 2X minus one if you add the one over you get 2 is equal to 2X if you divide by 2X you get X is equal to 1 so either way you're going to get X is equal to 1 and Y is equal to 1 and we always write this Final Solution as an ordered pair Okay so so now we're going to move on to the last way to solve system of equation so if you're given two equations you're going to put the coefficients into a matrix to solve so the coefficients are these numbers right here in front of the x's and on both of these y's there's an understood one as a coefficient so we're going to put these into a matric where we're going to put this coefficient right here so1 then we're going to put this coefficient right here and then we're going to put this one and then the same one right here over a matrix of two this first coefficient this coefficient again and then this one and this one so 1 1 and then you're going to get when you multiply majes you multiply this way so you're going to get 1 * 1us 1 * 2 over you multiply across when you solve matrices 2 * 1 1 * 1 for your X matri so 1 * 1 is1 1 * 2 is 2 over 2 * 1 is 2 and then 1 * 1 is 1 so it's going to be+ pos1 on the bottom so if you add 1 2 you get 3 over 3 so you get negative 1 for x and then we're just GNA plug this x into this equation so 2 * 1 + y = 1 2 + y = 1 add the two over you get Y is equal to 1 or you could put it in another matri for y you would do the same thing except it you would start here and then do this one so I'm going to show you how to do the y coordinate in a matric just so you know what to do okay for y we have we're going to start with this first coefficient here so two then this constant right here1 over this first coefficient here1 and this constant here divided by the same first coefficient this coefficient and then these two coefficients 1 and one and you once again you cross multiply so you get 2 * 2 1 * 1 over 2 * 1 1 * 1 so here you get 4 1 * 1 gives you POS 1 so pos1 over 2 1 * 1 gives you 1 and when we minus a negative we actually add a positive so 2 + 1 so then we get 3 over3 and as you can see we get one just like we did when we plugged it in so either way you can do it I just wanted you to know how to do it both ways so that's all that's all we have for today and this is our last lesson on solving systems of equations in the next next video we're going to start talking about circles
