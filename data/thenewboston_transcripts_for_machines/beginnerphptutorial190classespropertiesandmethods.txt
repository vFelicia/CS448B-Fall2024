hi this is Alex from PHP academy' and welcome back to another PHP tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to be looking at objectoriented programming and I'm just briefly going to be explaining and demonstrating classes properties and methods so we're just going to be outlining a structure of a class that we're going to create so class is like our object we can do things with it and we can store different things inside of it we can also use and we can also interact other objects with other objects so for now let's just focus on creating a class creating some property or creating a property and a method inside of this class we're not going to be able to do anything with it at this point and but this should give you an insight on the skeleton outline of of creating a class so the first thing you do is use the class keyword and we need to give our class or our object a name so I'm going to call this bank account and you'll see that I've created it much like a function so I've got some parentheses in here and I've got some curly brackets in fact my mistake we don't actually need these parentheses in here that's for the method when we do declare our methods inside of our class so we've created our class now let's go over to our browser and refresh obviously nothing's happened at this point because we don't have any properties or methods inside of our class but we also don't have any output so there's no way at the moment we're outputting everything I'm just going to be refreshing to make sure that we don't have any errors as we go along so now we've created our class this class is called bank account so we've got a class called bank account now inside we might want to specify some different properties inside our arm inside of our class now properties are much like variables we can create them either variable so that we can change things with inside our class so we can change the properties of our class or we can create them static so we can create a static variable that way change so things like static variables you'd want to say things like the value of pi' in mathematics or for a variable you'd want to say the balance of a bank account so I'm going to use this example in here we are going to create a variable and then I'm going to tell you how we need to change this to either add to change the type of the property so let's say balanced and at the moment we'll equal it to zero let's say this bank account has just been opened so balance equals zero now there's something we need to add in the front and this is either a public a protected or a private so we make we change the visibility of this of this variable now public means that this can be accessed anywhere inside of your code protected means it can only be accessed within your class itself so methods can access it and private means that it can't be accessed and outside of the class whatsoever so protected in private a somewhat similar but we'll be going into the differences between them and why we should use them a bit later on so for now I'm just going to create the balances public so we can use it outside of our class just for example purposes so now what we've done is we've successfully created our class and we've successfully created a property within our class and this property is called balance and it's equal to zero so we've created an integer variable which is a property of bank account so we have a bank account and our balance now is zero for for this bank account so let's say under here we're not going to do this now but we wanted to create a new new bank account for someone as soon as we create a new instance of this class what we've automatically done is set the balance to zero and the methods are going to allow us to do things like show the balance and deposit and withdraw funds so let's go up here and let's create a new method now a method is structured somewhat like a function however we also give it a public protected private key word so I'm going to create this public as well I'm going to say public and we create exactly like we would do a function so we want to say so we say public and then we say function now now we give a name to our function as we usually with procedural PHP so public function and let's go for display balance we do exactly the same with the parentheses at the end and then our curly brackets or curly parenthesis now in here what we can do is we can I mean the idea of display balance would be to display the balance of the of the bank account so what we've done in this tutorial is we've looked at our overall class so the object bank account which we can later on reference and say yeah this is a new bank account create this into a variable and then we can start doing things with this and we can create a few instances of this because all we need to do is set each instance of this plus bank account into a new variable and then we can reuse the code so you'll start to see later on how useful this can actually be but for now we're going to be using this bank account example and we're going to create our methods and and change our balance dynamically as we call different methods inside of this class so this is the overall structure of a basic object we've got an object called bank account which is a class and we've got a balance inside which is a property and we've got a method called display balance so as long as you understand these terms later on when you learn you're on you'll pick up a lot quicker because you'll understand what these methods are what these properties are and what a class is over
