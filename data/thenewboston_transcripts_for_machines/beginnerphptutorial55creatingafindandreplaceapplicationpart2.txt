so we use the is set function let me say if is set dollar underscore post the first one to check is text then we use a logical operator and and say if is set dollar underscore post and search for remember we're just referencing the variables from here and we use another and logical operator to now such or check sorry if the replace with is set okay so now we need to check where the users have actually typed any data in this line here will check or this statement in here will check whether the form has been submitted if that evaluates to true we can start to check if the data is empty or not so and before we do that actually we can actually create a shorthand way of using these variables and this must be done inside this if statement because if we try to create a variable first and these can't actually be found we're going to end up getting an undefined index error so text equals dollar underscore post text if you're unfamiliar with this terminology here if you go back and look at the post and get tutorials you'll understand what we're actually doing here we're taking data from the form and putting it into this app these are variables here and then we want search equals dollar underscore post search for and it hasn't got underscore in there and then we want replace equals dollar underscore post and that is replace with so let's just echo these variables out to make sure that they that everything is working up until now these will be with no spaces in between so if I just put one in there two in there and three in there that's a really way to check because if we click find and replace see that one two and three have both been submitted through we've checked for the form submission if we click it and the fall hasn't submitted nothing happens but if we do we return this data so let's get rid of that that and that now what we can do is check whether they have actually typed anything in so if not using the exclamation lock empty text and not empty search and we use the last hand not empty replace and do something otherwise we want to say please fill in all fields of the fields so let's just type something here to check the list check is working and when you're going to type okay with capital letters let's return to our index page and type while in here we in here and not three in here and let's see what happens so you can see now we've got this error message that we've predefined let's fill in one two again and three again and we'll see what happens here and we're returned with okay so we know at this stage that our form validation is working so inside here we can write the code that actually is actually going to process and return this so this create a bit of space in here for ourselves okay so the first thing we need to do is we need to predefined a variable up here called offset and this is important with the substring function because we once we find an instance of a word inside our string the offset is where we're going to search from once we found one for example we may have the cat sat on the cat if we want to search for cat and replace it with say dog or monkey as I used in my last example it's gonna it's going to find cat here and it's going to make the replacement then it's going to need to start from after this and also replace the last instance of it and our while loop is going to help us ensure that we only loop through this string until no more values have been found that have been specified here so that's what's going to happen now let's do it so let's create our while loop remember a while loop always performs this check going into the loop as opposed to a dowhile loop which will search for the condition at the end of the loop so we need to say while substring I'm just calling this giving this I felt my M variable named substring while substring equals substring so now we're you making use of the function inside this while loop substring will return zero if it can't find anything therefore this will evaluate to false so we need to search inside text and we are in fact I've completely messed this up because we're not actually using the substring function like I got a bit confused so we're using the STR pause function obviously the STR pause function is going to return us the offset or the location of a specific string where it is so STR pause equals the function STR pause researching in text we're searching for this search value and we're going to give we're going to specify the offset here now because the offset originally starts at zero we're searching from start of this text variable which equates to this text here what we're then doing is searching for what we've specified in the form here and then when it reaches let's say we were searching for cat inside the cat sat on the mat when it reaches the word cat and finds it this STR pause variable here will be equal to the location then what we can do with the location is we can say well I want this plus the amount of characters in our search term let me just give you an example up here so we know what we do
