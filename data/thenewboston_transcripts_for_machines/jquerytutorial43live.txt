hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video I'm going to go ahead and solve a problem of duplicating a particular button we're going to be creating a button on the page so just a simple button around here when we click it I want a message to be displayed but then I also want this button to duplicate now with the duplicate I'm not going to be using clone I'm just going to be creating a new element using after and I'm going to be placing the code for a button so the input type equals button with the rest of the properties and in particular class next to that I then want that same class to be clickable and for it to you know produce another button and repeat the process essentially so I'm going to go ahead and inside of my text editor write out the button so we'll go ahead and say input type equals button value I'm just going to say click and I'm going to give going ahead and give this a class and I'm just going to call this duplicate okay so when I click on this I want a message to appear a dialog window to appear and then I want to duplicate the button so just a quick overview of what files were using obviously we've got jQuery Jes included and we've also got exe ojs which is the file that we're going to be working in to append the event handler to this and we're going to go on to use the live event handler or the live event handler however you want to pronounce it or say it and we're going to be solving the problem you know as we can't do this at the moment so inside ext ojs let's just wait for our document to be ready so I'm going to say document dot ready and then in here we're going to go ahead and run the rest of the code inside here okay so what do we want to do first of all well we want to go ahead and append on an event handler for any class of duplicate so let's go ahead and say dot duplicate as our selector to look at as our selector and then I'm going to say dot click and then inside of this I'm going to go ahead and run a function so what do I want to happen when any class duplicate is clicked I want to go ahead and I want to alert you have clicked ok so now when i refresh the event handler clicked is called i guess or we found this click event and it says you have clicked fair enough but now what I want to do is go ahead and I want to duplicate this input field here so what I'm going to simply do is I'm going to say this dot after and then I'm just going to rewrite in the code so I'm going to rewrite the input class type and the value so we're going to say input type equals and that's obviously a button the value I want to say click and I'm going to keep the same class as before which is duplicate now the main aim here is we've clicked the duplicate button the first one of the instance of it on our page then we're alerting something out and then we're placing the same code for the same button using the same class afterwards but the problem that we'll find is this then will will not be able to select our new button and I'll show you and then I'll tell you why so I'll click on click it says you have clicked you can see it's added that code that we specified in here after our current button when I click this nothing will happen and the reason for this is it's been created on the fly essentially using jQuery and therefore it's not really you know part of the page like if we view the source of this page you can see that it only shows one button on here so what we need to do is we want to use the live event handler that will actually take into account both prewritten you know page elements and also elements that have been added during our jQuery execution on our jQuery you know running of our code if you like so we'll make a few simple changes I'll go ahead and just get rid of this in fact I'll get rid of all of it what I'm going to go ahead and do is and this is an extremely simple explanation of the live event handler there are loads more options so if you go over to jQuery comm the documentation will sort of show you a lot more
