hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is another video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video we're going to go through some basic setup and then some code in order to detect the user's browser however the first stage of this you need to obtain a file that needs to be placed inside a directory preferably inside your exam setup or whatever a distribution you're using of a PHP package of PHP Apache package and you also need to modify your PHP ini file so before you do anything even if you think this file is uptodate we need to find a file called it's called browse cap dot ini so if you haven't got this file inside your I mean I mean I'm in xampp here and then in PHP you need to you need to have this file somewhere existing so you can redownload it if you google for it you'll be able to find it at some somewhere available to download just make sure it's the file for for PHP and not for I thought for PHP so okay once you've obtained this file copy it over to a directory and that you can access and you can specify in your PHP to i/o nice for file so once you've found this file we go to PHP to ini let's find that down here okay we're going to open this so I already have this open and I've searched for browse cap and I can see this here and I've got browse cap equals something so here we're going to specify where this browse cap file is kept and in my case it's C colon backslash xampp and then it's in PHP and then we need to specify the file name itself so once you've done this you can go ahead and file save now what we need to do is we're going to open up our control panel for xampp and I'm going to stop our Apache service I'm going to click stop now that stops and I can restart it now so our PHP a night dire knife settings have been initialized by our reset of this now what we need to do is come into context and I'm going to introduce you to a function that's going to allow us to get data about the browser so now if you've correctly downloaded browser copter and I put it inside a directory and changed your PHP dot ini to point to that file this should work if it doesn't work then I check you've it done absolutely everything right and you've restarted Apache as well so inside context I'm going to create a new variable called browser and this is going to be equal to a function get browser now this function takes two arguments the first argument is the user agent which we could obtain from the dollar underscore server HTTP user agent however we're not going to do that we're just going to specify the value of null now the second the second argument that we need to provide is whether we want this to be returned as an array and we do want this to be 10 returned as an array because that's how we're going to use it later on so you just simply put true here can put 1 if you want it's probably just better to put true so how are we going to echo out all of the array contents well we're going to use the print off this and we're going to obviously put the browser reference to the array in there so now let's refresh the page and see what happens right ok so you can see that it's returned quite a few bits of information about my browser now you can see things like Chrome in here Chrome 10 etc as well as some other information if you're not receiving any of this information like Chrome Mozilla anything like that then you may have incorrectly downloaded or incorrectly reference this browse CAPTA ini so again make sure that's correct you major C's of star under this browser name regex or something so if you have the following information in front of you you will be good to proceed so this is the first stage to using this get browser function and in the second part of this tutorial we're going to look at how we can extract information from this I'm also going to test it with a couple of other browsers to make sure this information is correct before we start praying if statements to detect the user's browser now just before I go in this part I want to talk about why we might want to detect the user's browser it's always an important part of when you are viewing a web page to format things correctly for users and also you might want to notify users that using another browser might be better to display your web page so when you are when you are creating a web page it might look slightly different in other browsers and if you want to say say to a user download download Google Chrome it's this is going to work a lot better then you can recommend say Google Chrome to your users in order for them to switch their browser in order for them to view your page lot better so how are we going to work out what we're going to say if they're say using Firefox or Internet Explorer we might want to say to them you're using this browser please change to Google Chrome to view this website correctly and viceversa as well a web page might be better displayed in in Internet Explorer or it might be better displayed in Firefox as well as a host of other browsers that you can use so including the State Opera or Safari so in the next part of the tutorial we're going to look at how we can extract some of this information and detect the user's browser and just print a message to them telling them what their browser is but we're not going to give them any of this rubbish information we're basically going to give them it a single a single string so we're going to give them Chrome or Firefox or Mozilla or Internet Explorer do you know what I mean something like that so we're not going to be giving them chrome 10.0 or chrome with the platform a sari or chrome like this we could just going to give it in lowercase and we're going to use this some of this information to detect what browser the user might be using
