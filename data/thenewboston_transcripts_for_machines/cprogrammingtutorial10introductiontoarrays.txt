what's up guys welcome back to your 10th tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to be covering something called an array a r r a y that's probably going to be at the title at the top of the screen but you know I like spelling things so there you have it so you're saying all right Bucky that's a pretty cool word but what the heck is an array well let me break it down to you guys real simple don't even read any definitions online or else they're just going to confuse though with all their technical talk all in Array is it's a variable that holds multiple values so for example before we said like int X was equal to 17 well now what we can do is instead of just one number in there we can store multiple numbers or values in there pretty confusing huh so let's go ahead and let's see an example right now let me give myself some space and let's go ahead and make an integer well before before I even start typing let me tell you guys how to create an array in order to create an array they're all made basically the same way the first thing you do is type what type of data you're going to be storing in this array let's just keep it simple and store integers in it whole numbers next you give your array a cool name and we're going to give this array the coolest name of all which is bacon you know besides from Bucky because that's pretty dang cool and after you write the name of your array in square brackets you write how many values you want that array to store so let's go ahead and make a relatively small one we're only store five values in here won't uh take too much of a toll on our processor so go ahead and just like variables set it to equal sign and now we need to set it equal to multiple values so what your computer needs to do is it needs to recognize where these values are so go ahead and go ahead and put these I don't even know what the heck these things are called Curly brackets or curly braces I think uh I don't know whatever those things are called and and your line so inside these curly braces this is where you write your five values integer values separated with the comma so let's go ahead and type in any five values 12 uh 43 54 3 and 800 97 so check this out again to recap in order to create array here's what you do what type of data is going to be stored in it these are integers what is the name of your array you can name it whatever heck you want I just name this bacon and how many items are in it and by the way the technical term for these items are elements I call them items some people call them elements technically they're elements but whatever I'll use them interchangeably deal with it so check this out you know how before whenever we wanted to use a variable like C out we would just print out the variable's name like this bacon well how on Earth are we going to reference this array and get to the values in it if it has like multiple values wow this is going to be super confusing right wrong check this out anytime you want to access any element in Array all you have to do is type the name of the array and write what index it is so let's go ahead and see an example and you're going to see something a little weird but stick with me let's go ahead and put bacon 2 and print out and see what we get run this and we get 54 now let's scroll this down and check this out all right 12 is first 43 is second and 54 is third so how come when I type two I got 54 instead of 43 well check this out in computer language they love to start with zero you know binary code is all zeros and ones whenever you learned counting as a kid you started with one but whoever the heck built computers whenever they learn counting as a kid they evidently must have started at zero because in computer programming whenever you count anything it always starts with zero so that is why when you reference two that this is actually the second index because it goes like this 12 is 0 43 is 1 54 is 2 three is four or excuse me three well that's confusing three is three and 897 is four so let's go ahead and change this to um four and remember since it starts at 0 0 1 2 3 4 this is actually going to print out 897 right here check it out 897 so how cool is that so anyways that is what an array is pretty much a variable that can store multiple values and how to access each individual element in the array is you type in the name of the array which is bacon and then you type where what index you want to print out so zero would print out out 12 let's just go ahead and see that 12 and if we did something crazy like um five let's go ahead and build and run that and we get some weird error and this is uh actually looks like a number but this is actually a space in memory it's pretty much an error so that is because it goes 0 1 2 3 4 and five doesn't exist so it's going to just print out the memory location of it but that's like in that's like like 40 tutorials away from now just notice that whenever you go outside of rray you get error message so anyways that's the basics of an array in the next tutorial I'm going to show you guys a different way to build an array other than this so you definitely want to stick around and I know just printing out variables on the screen right now is going to seem really useless but trust me whenever we come across building a program that uses an array in a useful manner you're going to see how useful these things really are it's actually incredibly amazing trust me you guys are going to be amazed so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget subscrib and I'll see you guys later
