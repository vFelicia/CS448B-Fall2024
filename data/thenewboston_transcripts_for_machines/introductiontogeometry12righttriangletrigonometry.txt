today we're gonna talk about right triangle trigonometry and we are gonna use these six trig functions to talk about the angles of a triangle so say we have this triangle ABC and we have this angle right here which we're just gonna call theta theta theta is just a Greek symbol that we use to represent an angle so just like we'll use X to represent a side we use theta to represent an angle so we have six trig functions sine cosine tangent cosecant secant and cotangent and I know it sounds kind of crazy but it's really it's just talking about the sides of the triangle and their ratio to one another so sine is equal to where and we're talking about this angle right here opposite which is the side opposite this angle which is a over the hypotenuse and this is the hypotenuse of the triangle so when we talk about sine of this angle it's equal to a over C cosine is we're talking about this angle the adjacent side which is the side right next to it adjacent which is B over the hypotenuse which is still this side so this is B over C tangent talks about this angles opposite side which is still a over it's adjacent side the side next to it side B so a over B cosecant is the inverse of sine in the inverse is just 1 over something so cosecant is 1 over sine so if we took one over a oversee and we used our little keep change flip rules where we keep the top of the fraction change the sign to multiplication and flip the fraction to C over a multiply that we get C over a that's why this is equal to C over a you can also think of it as see how this flips the fraction well if you just flip this and say that this is hypotenuse over opposite that's another way to remember it secant is the same thing it's just 1 over cosine instead of 1 over sine but the same rule applies so that's why this ends up being the opposite of cosine because this is cosines inverse for secant it's that's what I just talked about for cotangent it's just the same as 1 over tangent tangent is B over a so this or tangent is a over B so the same rule applies where we just flip them and this becomes B over a which is the same thing as adjacent over opposite and we're gonna use these little formulas to talk about the angles of a triangle so we have this triangle right here and we're gonna find the six trigonometric functions of this so all we're gonna do is fill in what what all these equal the first thing we need to know is what x equals so using our Pythagorean theorem that we learned about last time we're gonna take 3 squared plus 4 squared equals x squared so 9 plus 16 equals x squared x squared equals 25 square root both sides x equals 5 so now we can talk about the triangle because we know every set one of its sides so we're talking about this angle right here so sine of this angle is equal to opposite over the hypotenuse so we're gonna put four over five side four is a cross from this angle and X which is five is the hypotenuse of this triangle and the hypotenuse is always across from this right angle so cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse so next to it is three over the hypotenuse stays the same because this is still the hypotenuse of this triangle tangent is opposite which is four over adjacent which is three cosecant is one over four over five because this is what sine is so one times five over four so cosecant is five over four or you can think of it as hypotenuse over opposite so the same rule applies for secant except we do this with cosine so one times we're gonna keep this change the sign flip the fraction and get five thirds or hypotenuse over adjacent we do the same thing with cotangent so one over tangent keep the top change the sign to multiplication flip the fraction and get three fourths or adjacent over opposite so those are the six trig functions of right triangles now these functions only apply to right triangles so you can't use these rules unless you know that there is a 90 degree angle in that triangle so now that we know how the angles relate to one another we're gonna go on to talk about transformations of triangles so we can describe how triangles relate to one another
