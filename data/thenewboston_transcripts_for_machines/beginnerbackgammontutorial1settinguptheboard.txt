what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome to your very first backgammon tutorial now I know a lot of you guys know me already and know me for my computer programming tutorials but what you didn't know is that I love playing backgammon I've been playing in my whole entire life I'm addicted to it absolutely love it so since I love backgammon the other day I was bored so I went on YouTube and I look for Beckham tutorials in backgammon videos in every single backgammon video I saw was absolutely horrible all the tutorials were horrendous so I felt as a tutorial McClurg on YouTube it was kind of my obligation to teach you guys how to play backgammon since I mean these tutorials were some of the worst tutorials I have ever seen they explain it so terribly so it's my job now to teach you guys how to play backgammon and make a decent beginners tutorial so in this next video that's what I'm about to do so for all of you who are hoping for computer program tutorials check out my other videos this is for backgammon so let's go ahead and get started now here is the basics of the game I'm gonna assume you this is the first time you ever see in the back end board the basics of the game is this it's played between two people in these tutorials I'm gonna be white and you're gonna be brown or it kind of looks like black on the camera to me right now so each player gets 15 checkers each you have 15 checkers and I have 15 checkers the goal of the game is to get all of your checkers off the board before the other person can get all of their checkers off the board now the board is set up like this you have 24 narrow triangles and these are called points now what I went ahead and did is I wrote the numbers of your points on the board but typically when you buy a backgammon board or if you're playing in a tournament or something these points aren't gonna be written on the board I just went ahead and since we're first learning and I say like 9 point you can see that this has a nine right there so it'll just help you follow along but like I said whenever you buy a backgammon board don't expect to see the points so anyways the board consists of 24 triangles called points now yours go in let's say let's see this is clockwise order from smallest 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 and then hops over here and it goes 13 through 18 in 19 through 24 so we separate these in six points each and these are called quadrants one quadrant two quadrant three quadrant four project one through six your one through six is called your home board your 7 through 12 is called your outer board my 1 through 6 is called mine home board my 7 through 12 is called my outer board so whenever I'm saying all right move a checker into your home board I'm talking about somewhere your 1 to 6 right here I just wanted to give you guys the definitions and you know all the technical words before you know I started saying something and you guys don't know what it means so anyways that's all the terms right now let's go ahead and just start setting up the board now oh one more thing this piece in the middle this is called the bar now typically you don't want your checkers to end up on the bar but whenever I refer to the bar this is what I'm talking about so anyways like I said let's go ahead and set up the game right now in order to set up the game you need to put all of your 15 checkers on the board now you just don't put them randomly around like that you need to set them up in some special way so here's how you do it go ahead and take five of your checkers and put them on your six point just like that go ahead and take three of your checkers and put them on your eighth point simple enough go ahead and take five of your checkers and put them on your thirteen point just like that and go ahead and take your last two checkers and put them on your 24 point and by the way since your 24point is here and your one point is here you're going to be moving from highest to lowest so this is your direction of play you're going to be taking your checkers and moving them around here down here and finally off the board here so you know you can't move checkers this way it's invalid so anyway so you go from high to low now for your opponent to set up their checkers here's what I do I make an exact mirror image of your checkers so wherever you have five checkers across from that I'm gonna put five checkers so you have five checkers on your six I'm gonna have five checkers across from you so since you have two checkers right here I'm gonna go ahead and put two checkers right here you have three right here I'm going go ahead the three right here and you have five right here so I'm gonna go ahead and put my five right there nice a alright we know it's setup right because my checkers are a perfect mirror image from your checkers never saying all right this is a little weird because my checkers are on your 19point and it should be my six point well check this out whenever I'm playing I'm gonna be playing in this direction right here remember I'm white so this point your one is actually my 24 point this may be kind of hard but flip your computer monitor upside down and you can see what's going on so one two three four five six this is actually my six point and one two three four five six this is your six point two so while you're playing in this direction I'm gonna be playing in this direction in our checkers since we're playing in opposite directions are gonna come into conflict with each other and that's where the game gets interesting so anyways I just want to tell you guys that this is a basic start up so if you're playing along pause the video right now and set your board up like this
