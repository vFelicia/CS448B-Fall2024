hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on that gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about polymorphism now this is probably one of the scariest terms in programming but it's actually very simple and we'll be learning about it in this tutorial so come down here and let's do it run for the form one load sub will just create a method or a sub so private sub show car info and now what we want to do is we want to pass a car to the sub that we're creating so we'll just call it argument car as car or we'll do as all cars let's specify the name space dot car and we'll go ahead and hit enter now the reason we had to specify the name space is because that it is outside of the name space that is used for our project now if we didn't have this nested inside of a name space then we wouldn't have to specify that but since we do and we're going to have to specify it so whatever whenever they pass in the car to this method let's go ahead and show the info of it so we'll type our card dot to string we'll go ahead and minimize that let's come down here to button show car info and we will type show car info and we will pass default car to that now up here this is not going to do anything for us so we need to show that in a message box so a message box our show and we're going to convert that to a string and we'll just set the title to info we'll go ahead and close that off okay so now that we've shown the car info let's go ahead and run this and see what we get now let's go ahead and click show info we haven't set the name we get the car name we get the color red the number of doors 5 and the car speed is equal to zero now this all works as expected because we passed a car object to this it is called the two string function that is inside of this class right here which returns all the info we need about our car now let's go ahead and come to show car info instead of showing default car ledge so default sports car now we'll go ahead and run this now let's set the name of our sports car to Mustang GT 500 go ahead and click OK it will set the color to black doors is 2 we will accelerate it to 80 miles per hour we can look at the powertoweight ratio which is default because we set that one form1 loads and now if we show info you can see that we get the name Mustang gt500 the car color is black the number of doors is 2 and the car speed is 80 now you might want you might be wondering to yourself why does this work well polymorphism basically means that you can create not create that you can use use one type as another type so if you have an object our car right here or the object that you pass to a default sports car that can be treated as a car object because they fall sports car the object that it has the class that comes from inherits from car now polymorphism it comes from the Greek word and it means many forms now you can you could pass a sports car to this and have it be used like a car but you cannot put sports car right here and pass a car to it because the car car does not inherit from sports cars so whatever sports car has in it Carr will not be able to use it so any stuff that you have defined yourself in sports car it's not available to card because it does not inherit it from sports car so I hope that gives you guys a basic understanding of polymorphism it's a quite simple concept and once you've used it a couple times you will get used to it so we'll just go ahead and do this one more time we can show the info and you can see that we get all the stuff we need and we don't get any errors even though it passed a sports car object to a a method that uses a car argument so go ahead type this corner if you have in practice a little bit with polymorphism you can create classes parent classes and subclasses and once you got that down go ahead and we watch in the next tutorial
