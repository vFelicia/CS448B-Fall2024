hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the bind event handler and how we can make use of it to make life uh or code a lot more efficient so let's take an example if we have a link on a page I'm going to go ahead and just outline a uh link it's not going to go anywhere and I'm just going to call this a link so let's go over to our browser and take a look you you can see that we've just got a link here uh it doesn't really do anything at the moment so what I want to do is when I hover over this link I want the text to change to bold so there are other ways of obviously doing this but with jQuery we can use the uh the bind event handler to actually handle for example all links on our page you might want all links to be underlined when they're click uh when they're hovered over or in in an actual fact you might not want them to be underlined so what we can do is we can go ahead and assign a particular class to this uh when we hover over or when we use the mouse over so we're going to be use the mouse enter and the mouse leave event handlers to actually go ahead and make this bold and add a class to this particular link so the class that we want to create is just going to be called bold uh and I'm going to just say font weight bold so wherever this class is is applied to a particular element in this case uh an a tag or an a element or a link element uh if you'd like to call it that the text inside will turn bold so let's go ahead and create a file that's going to handle our events so I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to save it inside the JS directory remember we're working with index.php in the root directory I'm going to go ahead and save it in JS as events. JS and in here we can start to write code that's going to handle the mouse enter and the mouse leave uh events so for example I'm going to go ahead and select all a so I'm using a selector and all a a elements on the page now I'm going to say mouse enter and inside here we need to create a function so the function will just be outlined and we can pull this down uh so we can start working inside now let's go ahead and just alert something out to test the usage of this so um over for example or enter would be more appropriate so inside of our browser let's go ahead and mouse over this oh it didn't do anything and that's because we haven't included the script on our page so let's go ahead and include the script so the type is text/javascript and the source remember inside our JS folder events. JS so back to our browser to test this I'm going to hover over or mouse or Mouse enter and it says enter so we know that this event is working now with this event this particular Mouse enter event we can then go ahead and add a class to this or or this a tag and that class is bold so uh we would normally say um this do add class and then we specify the name of the class which is bold so now what's going to happen is when we hover over the link this changes to bold because we've added a particular class to it obviously when we hover uh or our Mouse comes away from this um it we don't get the same effect so we need to use the mouse leave event to actually handle this as well so I'm going to go aad head and do this the long way and then we're going to take a look at bind in order to shorten this functionality so I'm going to at the end of this remember our fun our um outline starts here our Mouse enter here and then we've got a function inside but at the end of this I'm going to go ahead and append another event on and that is mouse leave so now inside here we can create another function and the code in here will be that of when the mouse leaves this particular element so we can again say this dot add or remove class sorry bold so when the mouse enters this a element so any link on the page or any a on the page we add the class bold to the a when the mouse leaves we then remove the class bold from the a so it sounds quite logical and the code is quite short uh let's go just go and take a look at functionality when we hover over or Mouse enter and when we Mouse leave the class is removed so we now have the functionality that we initially wanted for our links however if we go ahead and just get rid of this we can do this using bind and it will make the code a lot shorter uh and obviously a lot easier to uh to get our head around so I'm going to go ahead and again reference all a elements but this time I'm going to use the bind event handler now this is going to take two parameters as opposed to just creating a callback function inside of it as we normally would do we specify first uh the event that we want this to happen on and then we specify the uh action that we're going to take so this in here is the action and this in here is the event so on an event we're going to perform a particular action and this event is going to be Mouse enter and when the mouse Mouse enters we want to go ahead and apply the Bold class to this so we just say add class bold so now uh when we enter this a object we perform this function so much extremely similar to how we were doing it in the first place so let's go ahead and mouse over you see we have the same functionality however obviously when we Mouse uh out or when the mouse leaves this particular element uh the Bold class isn't removed so now instead of then appending something else onto here uh you might think that adding bind and then Mouse leave and then another function here would do the same job which it will do if we were to say remove the class so we we're using like the same thing but this doesn't really cut our code down or make anything more efficient uh it works the same way uh but obviously there's always better ways to do things so instead what we're going to do is with the bind uh event handler we can specify a series of um events that we want to use so for example Mouse enter and mouse leave so now on Mouse enter and on Mouse leave we add a class to bold now obviously this isn't going to uh work it doesn't really make sense when we Mouse over and mouse leave we're just adding the class once again however just taking a minute to research different um you know different things class functions we know that there is a toggle class function and what toggle class will do is it will check if a particular class is applied and if it is it will remove it and if it's not applied it will add it so much like the toggle as in where you would show something show a particular element with jQuery what we're now doing is on Mouse enter and mouse s we're toggling this uh bold class so now what's going to happen is when we go in in the toggle class obviously saw that uh the Bold class wasn't applied to this element so it applied it but now when we Mouse out again which is this part of here Mouse leave we remove the class because it was already added to that particular element so using bind has cut our code down dramatically from I think six lines to three lines and we've also created something that's more you know except able to um how you would usually write something you know what's the point in writing additional code when you can write that code in these three lines uh what's essentially regarded as the correct way so just using bind you can go ahead and use it obviously with any other element and any event that would be appropriately associated with that element so we can choose to use lots of different uh events and lots of and and apply that to lots of different of elements and we have toggle uh found in a variety of places as well so we can use toggle if appropriate so that's the bind uh event handler in jQuery and how useful it can be
