welcome back everyone I'm Sarah and in this video I'm going to be covering glycolysis this is about the 10th time I've tried recording this so hopefully this time I'll get it right I had to stop a couple of times because I noticed I made some mistakes blah blah blah blah blah blah I haven't had any caffeine today so I'm struggling I'm I I'm addicted to energy drinks it's bad but I'm a normal college student 22 I mean I'm taken 18 hours and I'm double majoring in Biochemistry and microbiology so my days are not easy but anyways enough about me let's get started on some cellular respiration cellular respiration is how cells produce energy energy is normally stored in a molecule called adenosine triphosphate I can't even talk today anyways ATP adenosine triphosphate this energy is stored in a phosphate Bond at the end of this molecule you've got these three negative charges here some normally these two are stabilized by magnesium ion you don't need to know that but these three negative charges here don't like being next to each other so it's it's a very high energy Bond and as soon as this last phosphate gr can get kicked off it's going to get kicked off another molecule important for cellular respiration is called nicotin amide Adine dinucleotide it carries electrons it is a Redux molecule which means it Redux means oxidation reduction oxidized the molecules have less electrons reduced molecules have more electrons you might see me write this as nadh this is the reduced form which means it has two more electrons NAD is the oxidized form which means it has to less electrons glycolysis is a form of anerobic respiration meaning that this does not require the presence of oxygen you can do it without oxygen so it occurs in a heck of a lot of organisms occurs in the cytoplasm it can happen in bacteria who live in like hot springs and swamps places where there's little to no oxygen or it can happen in animals plants fungi protest what have you it happens in pretty much everything the first step of glycolysis is when the molecule glucose is converted to glucose 6 phosphate using the enzyme hexokinase and this is going to use one molecule of ATP produce one molecule of a DP this enzyme is going to take that last high energy phosphate bond from from ATP and it's going to stick it on the sixth carbon here of glucose as you can see glucose 6 phosphate is converted to fructose 6 phosphate by a enzyme called phosphoglucose isomerase glucose is a six member ring you can see here fructose is a five member ring so this enzyme is just going to switch one of these bonds over the first carbon kind of kicks out doing its own little thing but the phosphate is still attached to the sixth carbon of the molecule phosphor fructokinase is going to take another phosphate group off of an adenosine triphosphate and stick it on the F fructose 6 phosphate to produce fructose 16 bis phosphate so unlike fructose 6 phosphate you can see here fructose 16 bis phosphate has this extra phosphate group sitting on the first carbon of the molecule fructose 16 bis phosphate is broken down into two three carbon substituents by the enzy enzyme alalas these two three carbon substituents are glycer alide three phosphate and dihydroxy acetone phosphate and these two molecules can be interconverted by the enzyme trios phosphate isomerase so from here on out all the the rest of the steps in glycolysis you're going to have two molecules being reacted instead of one so you're going to get double the product but anyways you can see your glycer alahh 3 phosphate phosphate stuck on the third carbon here and you also have dihydroxy acetone phosphate right here you're going to have your glycer alide three phosphate molecules remember you have two of them now because your dihydroxy acetone phos phate is converted into glycer alide 3 phosphate so you're going to have your two glycer alide 3 phosphates converted to one three bis phosphoglycerates using the enzyme glycer aldhy phosphate dehydrogenase for each molecule you have for each molecule of glycer alide 3 phosphate you have one inorganic phosphate and one oxidized form of nicotin amide Adine dinucleotide this is going to be converted into the reduced form of NAD and 13 bisphosphoglycerate the inorganic phosphate is going to be stuck onto the first carbon here of this phosphoglycerate your two molecules of bisphosphoglycerate are going to be converted into two molecules of three phosphoglycerate the extra phosphorus or excuse me phosphate group from carbon one is going to be stuck on to adenosine diphosphates ADP to produce ATP this is what you want the cell wants energy the cell needs energy here's your energy so you can see here you got your 13 bis phosphoglycerate with the phosphate groups on both carbons one and three three phosphoglycerate is only going to have the phosphate group on the third carbon your two molecules of three phosphoglycerate are going to be converted into two phosphoglycerates by the enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase this just means that the phosphate group from the third carbon is going to be switched over to the second carbon and this hydroxide ion here or hydroxy group rather here is going to be switched over to the uh third carbon so you got your phosphate group on the second the hydroxy group on the third quick switch your two phosphoglycerates are converted into a molecule called phospho enol pyate by the molecule enolase it's going to remove some water from your second and third carbons here you got the hydroxy group here this hydrogen here it's going to stick in a double bond right there and the last step of glycolysis is going to be the conversion of your phospho enop pyruvates to pyruvates using the molecule excuse me enzyme pyate KY you're going to have 1880p per molecule phosphopyruvate converted to one ATP giving you two more atps also makes us so happy you want energy you got energy but yeah this phosphate group is going to be taken off the double bond disappears actually goes back up to this oxygen get another hydrogen on there everybody's happy so the overall process is for every one molecule of glucose two molecules of NAD two molecules of ADP and two inorganic phosphates you get two molecules of pyrovate two reduced versions of NAD two protons or hydrogen ions two molecules of water and two molecules of ATP the biggest thing you need to remember from this is glycolysis produces 2 ATP and I know some of you might be asking why only two you're supposed to get four because you get two from each molecule this is true but you have to use 2 ATP to get the 4 ATP so the net yield is only 2 ATP but that's all I have for glycolysis I'll do my next videos on on oxidative phosphorilation or anerobic or excuse me aerobic respiration and probably photosynthesis sometime soon after that
