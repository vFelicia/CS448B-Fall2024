so we're gonna move on with other kinds of factoring and today our focus is factoring the difference of squares and I know we talked about this some when we talked about multiplying binomials but a difference of square equation is a lot easier to factor because the middle terms that usually are there when you multiply binomials cancel each other out so anytime you see a difference of squares which just means that the first term is a perfect square and the second term is a perfect square and there's no middle term you're going to factor it like this you take the square root of the first 1 plus the square root of the second one and multiply it by the square root of the first one minus square root of the second term because if we were to foil this back out we get a squared minus 6 a plus 6 a minus 36 and the negative 6a and the positive 68 cancels and we're just left with a squared minus 36 so now let's do a few examples so first we have to make sure that this is a difference of squares well this right now it's not a difference of squares because 3 is not a perfect square but if you remember what we did last lesson finding the GCF you know that we can if both terms are divisible by 3 we can pull that 3 out well 48 divided by 3 is equal to is equal to 16 so that means we can pull that three out and this becomes x squared minus 16 and now it looks exactly like a perfect square so that three stays out in front we take the square root of x squared which is X the square root of sixteen which is for the square root of x which is x plus the square root of sixteen which is four and now this three you only need to put it out front because you remember multiplication is commutative so eventually all three of these things are going to get multiplied together and it's going to look exactly like it did up here okay so this next one might not look like a perfect a difference of squares but if you change the order around so that the variable is on the left side this becomes 2x squared minus ninety eight and just like we did with the first one we're going to factor out that too i get x squared minus 49 and now they are both perfect squares because the square root of x squared is X minus the square root of 49 which is seven and then X plus 7 and you can always double check that you factored it correctly by foiling this out if you would get 2 times x squared minus 7x plus 7x minus 49 those cancel and then if you distribute that to get 2x squared minus ninety eight which matches our original equation so we have a couple more examples to do so this time you can see that we are not going to be able to factor that nine out but that's okay because if you look at it nine is a perfect square X to the fourth is a perfect square and four is a perfect square so we're going to factor it just like we would any other difference of square equation we're going to take the square root of the first one and remember when we take the square root of a monomial we take the square root of the coefficient times the square root of the variable so this becomes 3x squared because remember if we square x squared we multiply our exponents and we'd get X to the fourth so we take the we take this which is the square root of this first term minus the square root of four which is two plus two only one more example then we're going to do and again if you look at this next term 16 is a perfect square + y squared is a perfect square so we can factor it like normal take the square root of x squared which is X 0 this is supposed to be of subtraction sign I'm sorry because if it's a if they're if there's a plus sign in the middle it's not difference of squares and you can't factor it correctly so I'm going to take the square root of the first term X minus the square root of the second term is for Y and then x + 4 y and if you wanted to foil that back out you get x squared plus 4x y minus 4 XY plus 16y squared those cancel we get x squared plus 16y squared so that's all we're going to do with difference of squares make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to deal with perfect square with factoring perfect square trinomials
