hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be looking at a couple of ways to format strings so let's go ahead and get started here is our program we have our main sub and we're going to go ahead and type in there so we're going to create a variable called my string now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt the user to enter in a string so console dot write line please enter a string now we're just going to get whatever they entered and store it as my string now what we're going to do is we're going to ask them for a double value so console dot write line please enter a decimal value now we're just going to get whatever they typed in and store it as a double so dim my double as double it's going to be equal to whatever they type in okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to format those strings so we're just going to go ahead and do console dot write line to give us some space and now we're going to format our string inside of the arguments of console dot write line so console dot write line we're going to start by typing the string keyword and then we're going to use a dot separator to see what kind of methods there are and what kind of subs that are available for us to use for string so here's the format one that we want to use and it says replaces one or more format atoms in a specified string with a string representation that was specified objects now that might be a little confusing to you you don't really have to pay attention to that description right now let's go ahead and type format and we're going to have to have some arguments for this now first argument is going to be enclosed in quotes and this is what we're going to use to tell Visual Basic how to format our string so we'll just start with a zero colon in two and go ahead and close your braces there and then we're going to add a comma and after the comma we're going to especially specify which string to format it and we're going to use my double so basically what this does is it takes my double format it and converts it to a string and you may be wondering what this means well this means take any take all of the numbers on the left side of the of the period and show them but only show two spaces to the left side of the period so they type a really long decimal number it will only show the first two decimal places so now what we're going to do is we're going to show you a couple of ways to format a string so we'll just do console dot write line and we're just going to take their string which is my string and we're going to do dot to upper and this is going to take their string and convert everything to uppercase now we can also do console dot write line my string dot to lower and now if we just add console dot readline to pause the program let's go ahead and run this and see what happens so it's going to ask us first string so we'll just type on live gamer and we'll ask it asked us for a decimal value so we'll just type a really long decimal value and you can see that it formats the decimal value to forty three point two three it takes our string and converts it all up to uppercase and then it takes it and converts it to lowercase now I'll run this one more time to show you what happens when we convert something to a lowercase so we'll enter an all caps string and we'll enter a decimal value and here you can see that it formats our decimal value and it adds a comma right here just to make it look better so 2340 2.23 and you can see here that it took our string and converted it all to uppercase and since it already was uppercase you didn't you don't see a change here and you can see that it takes it and converts it all to lowercase now this was just a few simple ways to format strings and decimal numbers and once you got that nailed down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
