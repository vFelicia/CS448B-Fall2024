hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video tutorial we are going to be looking at the headers function or the header function in PHP so to modify the headers that are sent to our browser now why would we need to modify headers that are sent to our browser now there are lots of different reasons for this you may want to say enable or disable caching of pages you also might want to change the document type so you might want to change it to say a JPEG image or a PNG image or something like that in order to process an image on a page if you were using say the PHP GD library which is something you can look at later however in this tutorial because we're just talking about functionality of this we're going to be using this header function to redirect our users to another page now before we start it's really important to let you know that the header function which looks like this cannot be used after output has been sent to a page so for example if we have a header called or some header tags this is a HTML output therefore we're using PHP afterwards to using the header function however this won't work because we've already sent data to the page so if you are to use the header function you either have to use it after our content or we need to talk about output buffering and starting output buffering on a page which is another tutorial so where you can have a look at that in regards to headers so let's just say we have a PHP a blank PHP page I'm going to create a variable called true in fact I'm going to create a variable called redirect which is equal to true now I'm going to create a simple if statement to redirect us to a specific page if this variable is true so obviously this is an example but later on if you have let's say want to log a user in or log user out you might want to redirect them back to a specific page so we start the header function like this and inside we specify the location and to do this we always use the predefined text location and then a colon and after this we specify the page we want to read directly user to so I'm going to say redirect page equals HTTP colon forward slash forward slash Google Code UK so now what I can do after this is I can append redirect page so this is essentially the same as typing header and then the location inside and then writing writing it like that however I'm using variables just so we can get used to the idea that this page may change so at the moment this this should redirect us to Google as we enter the page so let's refresh and you can see what that's done is it redirected me straight over to Google code at UK so let's likely modify the script I want to say if redirect equals true redirect the user otherwise down so at the moment redirect is equal to true but I can change this to redirect equals false and we can go back headers and we haven't been redirected however if we were to change this here to true I'm able to redirect to a specific page then we refresh and we are redirected so just by demonstrating the use of the function with regards to redirecting user you can see that how useful it is in changing page and Meishan like I said now this is the this is an example to redirect to user however if you research this function um enough and watch some of my other tutorials as well because we will be using this function later on you'll understand that it's not just for for redirecting a user it's actually just to modify the header information with your your client your browser so bear this function in mind the location feature of it is very important and it's a great way to sort of quickly redirect your user without using any meta tags so HTML meta tags and just remember that we can't have any output any HTML put before this so I've created header tags my page with the h1 tags now let's go back and go to headers now we've got my page displayed that's absolutely fine but now we have a warning it says cannot modify header information headers already sent on line 8 so this is the where we're getting the error you can see this is like 8 but headers already sent however if we were to have this below here we're already modifying the pages headers so we're rescinding header information but we're never going to get to see this so what happens if you want to have a page that already maybe has some output but you need to redirect the user at some point there's a simple option and that's OB which stands for output buffering and we'll discuss that in another tutorial which will be the next in after this
