hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the droppable interaction in jQuery UI and we're going to be creating a simple box which will be a div we're gonna star this using style dot CSS and allow particular elements to be dropped into this box we're also going to take a look at a few of the options that are available as well as the events as we did previously in the draggable tutorial okay so the first thing that I'm going to do is create a span and we're going to take a look actually dragging something into another element so this is going to be just dragged me as we saw in the previous tutorial and I'm going to give this an ID of drag okay so I'm going to come down and I'm gonna create a div and I'm gonna give this an ID of drop now I'm gonna style this div using my style dot CSS file which I've included in my page here and the reason for this is a bit later on we're going to be changing the class of this div with classes that we predefined in star dot CSS for when the element has is hovering over so if you're unsure what I mean now you'll understand a bit later on when we take a look at the hover class option okay so with this code here at the moment we just have dragged me here which isn't doing anything at the moment because we haven't created the code for it the jQuery code for it the div ID with drop we need to style so we're gonna go ahead and style drop I'm going to give it a height of 200 pixels a width of 200 pixels and I'm gonna give it a background color of F 0 F 0 F 0 which is a very light gray okay so let's go ahead and look here you can see now we've got this element here list span here and then the div which is 200 by 200 and a nice gray background now the idea of this is to be able to drag this drag me text into this box and then we're going to just give an alert when we've actually dropped this element in there so we're going to be looking at the drop event first and then looking at the options then going back and looking at other events we can attach to this this droppable functionality in jQuery UI UI so I've also got you ijs open which I've included in my page again along with the jQuery UI our UI library and the jQuery library so when you ijs we need to when the document is ready so document dot ready we need to run code inside of here in a function we'll just pull that down and this is where our code is going to go so the first thing we want to do is make our span here draggable so we want to ensure that we can actually drag this and then we're gonna set a few options to it just to ensure that everything you know it's working correctly for example we don't have the element being able to be dragged outside of the document and we are also going to create a revert option so it goes back to where it first Balat belong okay so let's go ahead and reference the span here which is called drag that's drag dot draggable and inside here we're gonna specify some options so the first one as I said is the containment of it and this is going to just be document and this just means that it cost it can't be dragged outside of the document itself so if we just test this you can see that we can now drag it however it won't last drag it outside of the document so that's a useful we're then going to set a revert option on it to true and this will ensure that when we leave it somewhere else on a page it will revert back to its original position so the same as we looked at in the previous tutorial okay so now on to the above a side of things we're going to make this drop div droppable so we do exactly the same thing but we reference drop and then we say droppable now this will make this div droppable so when I drop something on to it that has been dropped however we need to create some kind of event to handle when this has been dropped so the same thing as the draggable we can specify different options inside these curly brackets so the first option I'm going to supply or not really an option and event is drop so the drop event is going to be a function and we can pull this down here and inside of here we are going to just create an alert box so I'm going to say dropped so now what's going to happen is when we drop something onto this div we run whatever it whatever is in this function which is an alert box and dropped so now if we refresh the page and drag that and drop there you can see that we get a dialog box saying dropped so we've now successfully created an event on to our droppable div if we drop it anywhere else it doesn't work just onto this div we get an alert box saying dropped now this is obviously just an example so it's not extremely useful however let's go ahead and first of all look at a few other options and then we'll look at creating some more events for this the first option we're going to take a look at is the hover class and inside of these single quotation marks we want to specify a specific class that we want to be applied to this element when we have something hover over it so at the moment nothing's happening it just stays the same however this doesn't show that something can be dropped onto it nothing really changes the user would have to know that you have to drop something inside of here to be able to actually drop it
