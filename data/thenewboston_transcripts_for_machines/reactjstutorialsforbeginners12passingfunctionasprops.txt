alright check this out sauerkraut so in the last video what we did is we made these functions to essentially remove comments we can call this function whenever we need to edit a comment give it a new text and the array item so now all we have to do piece of cake is whenever we click these buttons hook them up to these functions all right so the buttons were in this comment so essentially whenever I click Save right here I want to call well what we'll wait a minute oh crap we got a little problem here so check this out you see this button right here all of these buttons they belong to the comment component however the functions that we want to use are in the board component so how the heck are we supposed to call these functions from an entirely different component well the answer my friend is to use properties properties I thought that was for like customizing a component well check this out it's really cool whenever use properties what he can do is instead of just passing numbers and strings to comment you can actually pass entire functions so in other words we can have a property that's equal to this entire function pretty sweet eh so in the comment whenever we make one let's just go ahead and add a new property and just to show you guys that it's different um let's say the first thing we want to do is we want to pass in this function right here so I would call a property uh update comment text and you can name it whatever you want and this is going to be equal to this this dot Update comment so again later on whenever we run this program comment is now going to have a property called update comment text and this is going to be equal to this function its owners or the board's function pretty sweet a so now the last thing we have to do is just make it for this comment right here so we can actually delete the comments so I'll just say I'll make a new property called delete from board and this is going to be equal to this dots remove comment alright so whenever we create a comment what information do we need to give it we need to give it a key in index we're going to throw it this function and also throw in this function and of course the text so it has some text to display right there alright so now that we got that taken care of let's go ahead and back up to our comment component and hook these up so we already have event handlers for editing removing and saving again edit is whenever you click this save is whenever you click this and remove is whenever you click this right here so we got all the hard work taken care of and actually a lot of this stuff we're just going to keep in for example with the editing we're also going to change that the true/false we're just going to kind of include two more things so let me just go ahead and take care of remove first so in other words whenever we click the remove button on this comment then what are we going to want to do well we're going to want to call this dots props and remember we passed in let me make sure I don't copy this wrong we passed in a property called delete from board now this delete from board is equal to this function right here so we have to remember whenever we use this property we also need to pass in the index I'll show you guys how to do that so whenever we call this delete from board we also need to prep s in the index of this comment how do we do that well it's easy since we already passed the index in as a property we call this dots props dots index pretty cool way so that is the way that you can pass in an index which is an ID number you can pass in a function from the owner or the parent and then it can pass that back up to the parent so there you go and words my other one edit is it for editing and saving right here so same thing was saved and I can probably let me get rid of this and tighten all this up so it's a little bit more compact alright so whenever these are leaves a comment like my name is Bucky and they hit save then what do we want to do well all we want to do is we want to call this dot props and I forgot the function name already update comment text now remember whenever we use this then it requires the new text and the position in the array so this dot drops update comment text now the new text is equal to Val and actually we don't even need that variable since we're only using it once so we can actually just use it like that and the index is this so this is the new text and this is the ID of the comment boom roasted there you go so now I think everything should be working correctly so let me go ahead and refresh this and I won't put my logs out because we'll see if it works all right so I like bacon let me go ahead and change this to my name is Bucky and hit save and check it out pretty sweet eh now if I want to delete want to get ice cream I hit remove and it deletes it how stinking awesome is that so just to kind of recap and give you guys real quick overview so this kind of sticks in your brain whenever you have information and you want to pass them to a child component you can use properties now a property can be something simple just like a number as we saw right here or if you want to take one of these functions and allow the child to use it you can actually just pass the entire function in as a property and again you can name these properties whatever you want you can name it bacon and it work it really doesn't matter now since you do that the child will now have access to the parent function via a property and remember whenever you use these functions just make sure to get your parameters correct since they never really auto populate so there you go that is how you pass that at a children and how you can also pass data back up to the parent using functions so now we got everything working beautifully and yeah I'm gonna go admire this for a second and in the next video I'll show you guys how to add new comments it's actually really simple so yeah I think that's for watching I will smell ya next time
