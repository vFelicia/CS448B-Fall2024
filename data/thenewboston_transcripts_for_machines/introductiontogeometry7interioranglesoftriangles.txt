we're going to be talking about interior angles of triangles so for any triangle x + y + z is equal to 180° so this is just saying that the measure of angle X plus the measure of angle y plus the measure of angle Z is equal to 180° so using this information we're going to do an example so we know that the measure of angle a b c is equal to 30° and the measure of angle b a c is equal to 45° and the measure of angle ACB is what we're trying to find so we're just going to call it X so we're going to add all of these together with X just counting for this angle and set it equal to 180° if you add those up you get 75 and if you subtract them over you get xal 105° so the angle of ab ACB is a 105 deges so now we're going to do another example we know that the measure of angle e GF is 30° is 30° and we want to find out what the measure of this angle is well if you remember when I said that we put this little square sign here that means that this is a right angle and a right angle is equal to 90° so we're going to add x + 90 + 30 and set it equal to 180° if you add this up you get x + 120 = 180 you subtract it over you get X is equal to 60 Dees okay now that we know that property we're going to look at the exterior and interior angle Les of a triangle and see how they relate to one another so for any triangle x + y is equal to the measure of Z so the measure of angle X plus the measure of angle Y is equal to the measure of angle C so now we're going to do an example so we're going to do an example where we're trying to find out what the measure of angle K is that's what we're trying to solve for so since we know that the sum of these two angles right here equals angle K we're going to add 38 + 45 and set it equal to the measure of angle K and if you add those up you'll get 83° is equal the measure of angle K so that means that this angle right here is an 83 degree angle so now that we know some basic properties of triangles in the next video we're going to do some triangle comparison
