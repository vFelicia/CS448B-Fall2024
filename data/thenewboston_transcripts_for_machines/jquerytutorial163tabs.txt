hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we're going to be taking a look at the jQuery tabs PlugIn or uh jQuery tabs widget uh found in the jQuery UI now we've already included uh all of our files so ensure you have the uh stylesheet associated with the uh chosen theme uh all available in the development bundle that's downloaded uh most importantly the jQuery ui. JS file and we also have our own custom external file ui. JS which we haven't written anything in yet we've also got style.css which we're going to be styling the uh tab section with in just a moment now the first thing to note is we want to go ahead uh go over to our browser and actually uh create this uh tab effect first and then we'll go ahead and implement the tabs widget so we'll just go ahead and open up our browser uh you'll see that there's nothing there at the moment let's go ahead and start to create our tab section so I'm going to create a div which is going to surround everything so this is the div that you're going to apply the tabs widget to and I'm just going to call this tabs now inside for the tabs at the top you're going to need an unordered list so I'm going to choose UL come down and end the UR inside here we want the list options just uh available to us or available to the user um so the first one uh we need to create a link inside so let's just change that to href uh and this is just going to be for example about me uh and I'm going to actually have to give this a name which is going to refer to the tab that you want to open or the content you want associated with this tab so I'm just going to call this about hyphen me uh then we can go down and create the rest of our menu options so again we create a link just in here and this time it's going to be hash portfolio and then in here just write portfol fio so this is the label uh and I'm going to do a third one as well just so we get a good idea of how this is working so again a link in between here with the name so I'm just going to say contact and in here just contact so at the moment this looks a bit like uh let's a look uh there we go so this looks about a bit like this so it's not really doing anything yet we haven't applied tabs to it now let's go ahead and create the div sections that we require to open when we click these different links so we're going to create divs in between here and the ID of these need to correspond to the links that you've given them so for example the first div is going to be uh let's just put some paragraph tags in there um a short paragraph about me now this now needs to correspond to Hash about me or sorry it just needs to correspond to about me and that way jQuery we will pick up that when we click on this about me tab uh the corresponding div will be shown so we do this for each one of the tabs that we create uh again putting the ID in here of portfolio and in in here we can put the content so for example this is my Port Folio uh and the last one uh we're just essentially recreating what we've already done so contact some paragraph tags just in there and my contact details so now uh let's just open our browser it looks a bit like this we've got each link here and each paragraph that represent the tab that we're going going to click at the moment it does nothing so assuming that we've included everything correctly we can go over to ui. JS and actually apply tabs to this so remember we called our uh div here our main div our container div for the for uh everything here we call it tabs so we select this and then we just apply the tabs uh widget to that now when we open up our browser and refresh you can see that tabs have been created uh and they correspond to each uh paragraph we created as well so extremely easy to implement in this sense okay so now what we want to do is take a look at uh changing the width of this um I'm also going to change the overall font size on the page uh so this looks a bit nicer so the first thing I'm going to do is is set the body font size to 12 pixels and then I'm going to come down and I'm going to change the size of our overall div so I'm going to uh again reference let's go back to here tabs so reference tabs and I'm going to set the width to 400 400 pixels and then when we refresh the text is a bit smaller and we have a nice small area uh for our tabs and our content so that's how we would go ahead and actually style everything up now I'm going to tell you about including uh external files within this href so we're calling an Ajax request now if we were to go ahead and create another menu item uh we do exactly the same uh we create a link here and I'm going to call this one Loop and in here instead of specifying a tab to go to I'm actually going to specify a file that I want to be loaded into the cont content area so when I click this Loop tab that will appear here when I refresh in a moment I want the contents of here to be loaded from an external file so we can specify this and I'm going to specify loop. PHP which we haven't yet created uh which will be found in the PHP folder so at the moment I'm going to refresh click on Loop and nothing appears that's because this Loop file could not could not be loaded we haven't actually created it yet so once we have created it the contents will appear now we can set Ajax options within our uh tabs here so remember the options go in our curly brackets we can set Ajax options to check if this file uh is available for example we might return an error uh trying to find this file
