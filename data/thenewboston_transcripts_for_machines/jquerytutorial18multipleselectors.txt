hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at multiple selectors and how we can select two elements on a page if we want to assign for example an event handler to them now as an example I'm going to go ahead and create a button and a paragraph and both of these are going to take the same action when we click on them when we click on the button we're going to show an alert dialog and when we click on the paragraph we're also going to show another dialog however we're going to use multiple selectors to bind the two elements or select the two elements and perform the same action now I'm going to go ahead and do it the incorrect way first of all and then I'm going to go ahead and adjust this and do it the correct way using multiple selectors so the first thing we're going to do is go ahead and create a button so the input type is button going to give this a value and this is called click me or press me more appropriately I'm going to go ahead and assign an ID to this and this is just going to be button and I'm going to come down I'm going to create a paragraph as well and I'm going to give this an ID of paragraph so inside here I'm going to say click me now if we go over to our page and refresh you see we've got a button here which we can click and a paragraph which we can also click once we've assigned event handlers to both of them so we're going to go over to selectors j/s which is an external file that i've created where we're going to write our JavaScript code and we're going to write jQuery inside of here however I'm going to go ahead and need to include this on my page first of all so I'm going to use a script include here to include the source of a javascript file obviously it's always better to keep a JavaScript code external and in different files so I choose this selectors J's file and that's type text forward slash JavaScript exactly the same as we include jQuery so we've now got the use of jQuery and this selectors JS file which is currently blank so we need to go ahead and first of all a assign an event handler to this button so we're doing we do that using normal selector remember we have an ID of button so we in here we use a hash and then we give the name of the ID or the value of the ID and then we assign a click event handler to this now inside here we're going to go ahead and create a function just bring this code down so we have all this line here down so we have the space in here to write this out and indent it looks a lot nicer and I'm going to go ahead and alert something out so let's say something was clicked or something was pressed clicked so now we have this a click event handler assigned to this button ID we can we go ahead and alert something out so let's go ahead to our page and test this when I click press me you'll see something was pressed forward such clicked so we have the correct alert box now with regards to the paragraph there's no event handler bound to this so we need to go ahead and add this event handler now this is the incorrect way to do it so don't take this as you know the advice I'm giving you but we would go ahead and if we were using the paragraph we're doing in exactly the same way so we'd use a hash to reference the ID paragraph so we go ahead and type in paragraph and then we use the same event handler just here with a function inside of it with our block of code here which we can bring down and again we do exactly the same thing so alert something was pressed forward slash clicked so now what's going to happen is we've bound this event handler to our paragraph so now when we click our paragraph we have this message here which we defined just here now if we wanted the same alert box to happen for both of these elements what we've actually done here is unnecessarily duplicated code so we can use an unlimited amount of handlers inside of one selector so let's go ahead and adjust this accordingly now we've already referenced hash button so the button that has the ID button now what we can do is comma separate the values that we want to use in each selection so now I can just add in paragraph here and what jQuery will do is it will select both of these elements and apply this event handle to it so now when we go over to our page we have the same result when we click the button and we have the same result when we click the paragraph as well so now that we've bound this to both of our elements we have the same action performed for each paragraph now what happens if we want to go ahead and only assign this to example only buttons on our page we can use the button selector so its input and then a colon and button so this will select all input types with the valor with the type button all input fields with the type button as well as any IDs with paragraph however we can also go ahead and change this and just use P so we don't just need to reference using IDs we can now remove these IDs and what this selector is now done is selected all buttons on the page or all paragraphs on the page so if you had a few buttons that you wanted to log an event for example for each button that's pressed on your entire page you can go ahead and just use this input button selector so as well as using multiple selectors I guess now we've learnt that you can use a type selector rather than referencing it with a hash and it's ID so all paragraphs and all input buttons or input fields with a type of button are now going to be assigned this event and we'll alert the dialog when they are clicked so let's go ahead to our page and just test that press the button and we see the button has been pressed and we have this alert box and when we click the paragraph we also have the same alert box as well so we can go ahead and we can assign an unlimited amount of event handlers just here inside of our selector so that's how we use multiple selectors in jQuery and how you can dramatically reduce duplicating code using this method
