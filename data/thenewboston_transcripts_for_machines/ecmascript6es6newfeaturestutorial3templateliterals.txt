all right hostas welcome back and in this video I'm going to show you how to use template literals so you know before whenever we had some variable and we wanted to include it in a string what we would have to do is something like this so let me just go ahead and log something out so I'll say console.log all right so I'm trying to say um like my favorite person is Bucky because he smells good so my favorite person is Ari so then I need like a space and then I need a name is that right yep all right so there's no space here so I had to have another space you know sage because he smells good all right now hopefully whenever I run this Ari everything is looking good well this is kind of a pain in the butt because I mean shouldn't there be an easier way to use variables inside a string well that's what the developers of es6 thought too so they gave you one and it's called template literals so the first thing that you need to do is instead of using single quotes or double quotes anytime you want to use this new syntax you actually use backticks now this is to the left of the one on your keyboard right above the tab if you have the same keyboard as me so again I know you guys probably can't see the difference between a single quote in these back ticks on YouTube but make sure that you are indeed using back ticks so just like before you write my Eddie I Giada all your other stuff just like this but whenever you want to use a bit of JavaScript instead of having Plus whatever that all you do is this use dollar sign curly braces and then whatever variable name you want right here so isn't this a much more beautiful syntax I think so so same outcome but your code is a little bit cleaner a little bit more condensed now another thing I want to point out and I don't even know if I probably should but say this so I'm going to say let's a equals five and let's B equals seven now you can actually use JavaScript expressions in here they aren't only limited to um you know variables like a B and name you can actually do something like this my favorite person is a plus B and it would calculate 212 so in other words it would find the result of this expression and then output it into your string now I say you really don't want to do this because most of the time you want to separate out your logic from your formatting in other words you would want to make some variable called a result and set this equal to a plus B and then just output result right here but for the demo I'll keep that in there just to show you guys that any valid JavaScript you can indeed have in there even though I wouldn't recommend it so anyways that is template literals basically a way that you can include snippets of JavaScript inside strings all right so let me start my recording because I forgot to mention something I actually stopped the video and that was like aw crap I forgot to mention something kind of important so before if you ever tried to kind of make a string and have across multiple lines in JavaScript it would be a real pain in the butt but now all you have to do is this whenever you write a new line in your code in JavaScript if I go ahead and run this little example it'll actually interpret that as a new line so instead of just having like plus and then adding a new line character and then writing the rest of your code and trying to concatenate them in some kind of weird way whenever you write a new line using template literals it's going to interpret that is the new line character so you see that this little string and this little string we're indeed on separate lines so there you go that's what a template literal is then guys for watching I'll see you guys next video
