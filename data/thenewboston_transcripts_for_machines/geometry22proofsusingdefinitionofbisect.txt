okay so today we're going to talk about more proofs and specifically we're going to use the definition of BCT to prove things so first you have to remember what BCT means so if you bict something you split it into two congruent parts so if I said Point D bisects well not Point D if I said line CD say it was this line right here bisects this line AB that means that AB or say at Point m a m is congruent to MB now that works for lines as well as angles so if I said that this Ray Ray C if Ray BC bcts this angle that means that angle ABC is going to be congruent to angle CBD so using that information we're going to going to do some proofs so given that a i e bisects k v and that I E bcts K angle K IV prove that k e is congruent to V and KR or excuse me Ki is congruent to VI okay so first we're going to write down our given i e BCT angle k e v and angle K i v and that's given okay so what I just said remember was when you when an angle whenever excuse me when a segment bisects an angle it splits it into two congruent parts so if this line bisects this angle that means that this angle is congruent to this angle so angle e sorry angle NE e k is congruent to angle NE V and we can do the same thing down here because if this bcts this angle that means this angle is congruent to this angle so angle n i k is congruent to angle ni IV so if BCT an angle split into two congruent angles so next so we have these two we have two pairs of crr and angles and we're trying to prove that this is congruent to this and this is congruent to this so the best way to prove that is to make these to prove that these triangles are congruent and if you look we have an angle a shared side right here which is congruent to itself and another angle so the best way to do that is say that triangle e Ki is congruent to Triangle e VI I and oh I'm sorry I almost forgot got a step first I'm just going to insert this right here this will be 2.5 first we have to say that EI is congruent to EI and that's reflexive property and now we can say that the triangles are congruent by angle side angle and now that must mean that K is congruent to V and k i is congruent to VI because if triangles are congruent then the corresponding parts are also congruent so that's all we're going to do today with um proving things using the definition of bisect but make sure you come back and watch the next video cuz in that video we're going to talk about using the definition of bisect to prove that lines are perpendicular so make sure you come and check that out
