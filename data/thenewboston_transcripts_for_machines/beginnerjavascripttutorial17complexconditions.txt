what is going on guys welcome to your 17th tutorial and I actually just made this tutorial but when I got done with it I accidentally hit delete at the end of it cuz I'm an idiot so now I have to make the entire thing again but I mean at least I had practice making it so all right let me take a deep breath and let's do this again but for you guys it would be like the first time so anyways what I want to talk about in this tutorial is complex conditions so in the last tutorial we saw that if we wanted to test more than one condition then what we had to do is embed an if within another if so basically if we wanted to test my first name was Bucky then we go ahead and we made an if statement and then we wanted to test my next my last name was Roberts so we go ahead and we stuck if statement inside of that but actually I want to let you guys in on Little Secret there's an easier way to test more than one condition and you only have to use one if statement so let's go ahead and make make two variables I'll go ahead and make first and I'll set this equal to Bucky and I'll go ahead and make another variable and I'll name this last and I'll set this equal to Roberts make sure I spell my last name right though Roberts and now let's go ahead and make a if statement so before we needed to make two whenever we want to test two conditions but now I told you guys you can test two conditions using one if statement so in in order to test two conditions the first thing you need to do is this go ahead and put each condition you want to test inside parentheses I call them curly braces sometimes but I mean I'm not lying to myself I know they're parentheses so the first thing I want to test is that first variable is equal to the name Bucky and now go ahead and stick the next condition you want to test in parenthesis so now I want to test that that last variable is equal to my name Roberts so Roberts so you're saying all right that's simple enough you have two conditions in here that you want to test simple enough but you're not done yet the last thing that you need to add is in between them go ahead and above the seven there's a key called Ampersand go ahead and hit that twice what this is going to tell JavaScript is all right you want to test this condition and you want to test this condition and I'm only going to execute this code let's give it some code real quick to execute document write and write something stupid like hey good job buddy here's a cookie whatever I spelled every word with a typo but it doesn't really matter so anyways like I was saying whenever you use the special double Amper saying it means all right I know with one if statement you usually use one condition but in this case scenario you want to test this condition and this condition right now and if they're both both true then I'm going to execute this bit of code right now so let's go ahead and save it and refresh and see what we get hey good job there buddy yada yada yada so anyways like I was saying when you use the double Amber sand this needs to be true and this needs to be true if one of them is false or if both of them is false it's not going to run so let's go ahead and change its first name to like Tommy name my cousin and go ahead and refresh it and it's not going to work since one of those conditions was false so that is how you test two or more conditions in a single if statement and we're saying all right so how would I test three or four well if you want to test more then just go ahead add more Amper signs and another condition right here simple enough so now that I told you guys about that special and let's go ahead and delete this and I want to teach you guys about another way that you can text test complex conditions and that's using the or so let's go ahead and make a simple if and and let's go ahead and document right whoa wrong symbols there um let's write bacon it really doesn't matter what you write in there and now say you come across this scenar all right I want to test two conditions but only one of them needs to be true for me to execute the bit of code for example if your name is Bucky or if your last name is Roberts the code is going to get executed not both conditions have to be true but one or the other well let's go ahead and I'll show you how to do that just like before you go ahead and write your two conditions in here if first is equal to Bucky and last is equal to Roberts and now you're saying all right go ahead and put those double and signs well when you're using or you actually use this sign it's called I think it's called the pipe symbol or something it's above the enter key or the return key on your keyboard and I guarantee you just look there right now so don't lie I know you just look there you can't resist so anyways when we use the or sign let's go ahead and run this and see what happens it says bacon but you're saying all right well we said if first is equal to Bucky and first is actually equal to Tommy so why would this run the reason it ran is because this last name was indeed equal to Roberts so again only one of these conditions has to be true in order for this code to run if both of them are false if if first one equals Tommy and last one equal Hanks Tom Hanks then they're not going to be equal to Bucky or Robert so whenever you try to go and run this nothing happens so again with or either this one has to be true or this one has to be true and if they're both true Tommy and Hanks it's going to run so if they're both true or this one or this one it's going to run it's basically saying it as long as one of the conditions is true I'm going to go ahead and do the code you told me to do so anyways just like before if you want to add more just go ahead and add more pipe symbols and more conditions right in here but that's the basics of this tutorial and um testing complex conditions it might save you some time from nesting a bunch of is statements again if you want to test one or more condition and they all need to be true then use the double and sign just like that if you want to test two or more conditions and only one of them needs to be true then go ahead and use those or signs or pipes or whatever the heck you call them just like that so that's the basics of that and don't forget that it's not only two but you can add an unlimited number of tests just by adding more signs and more break or what they call parentheses so that's all I have for you guys for this tutorial hopefully whenever I stop this tutorial I'm actually going to save it this time and not delete it because well I guess if I delete it this time then you guys would never be hearing this but anyways um thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next video
