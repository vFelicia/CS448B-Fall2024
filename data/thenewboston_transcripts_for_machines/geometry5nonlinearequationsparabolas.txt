so now we're going to move on to equations of nonlinear graphs so the first type of nonlinear equation we're going to talk about is called a parabola so and the most basic form of a parabola is y = x^2 so we're going to graph this equation right here so if I plug in zero I'm going to get y y = 0 so I have 0 0 if I plug in one I'm going to get one y = 1^ 2 so y = 1 so I have 1 1 if I plug in1 if you remember any number squared is going to be positive so I'll get ne1 1 if I plug in two I don't know why I wrote it like that that I'm get y = 4 so 2 4 same thing if I plug a negative 1 and this is what a parabola looks like miss my DOT right there it's like a like a u so now we're going to graph Y = 2 so y = 2x^2 we're going to do the same kind of thing plug in points so Y = 2 * 0 so 0 0 Y = 2 1 Y = 2 same thing's going to happen if I plug in1 2 2^ 2 so 2 * 2^ 2 which is 4 is 8 oh this is going to be off my little chart I'm just going to put it up here and then same thing if I plug in 2 so when we put a big number out out front the graph's going to get skinnier and the way I like to think of it when you have a bigger number in front of an X you have more exercise and if you have more exercise you're going to be skinnier so whenever you have like a four out front you're going to have a skinnier graph but if you had like a 1/ half out front you get less exercise so you're going to be wider okay now we're going to dox2 okay so here if we plug in negative if we plug in one we're going to at y = 1 so one same thing's going to happen if we plug in positive one and if you keep going you'd get the same Parabola it's just reflected across the X AIS so when you have a negative out front it's going to you're going to have a downwards Parabola if you have a positive out front it's going to be up all right and now we're going to do two more ones okay so each Parabola has its vertex which is where there's just one point and then your graph goes like up from that one point like that so so far every one of our graphs has had a z0 Vertex but if you plug zero into this you're going to get 0 + 2^ 2ar so y = 4 so 0 1 2 three 4 it's going to actually forget about that okay so whenever you have a number inside your parentheses if it's a positive it's G to shift your graph two to the left if it's negative it's going to shift your graph to the right so your um your Y intercept if you set y equal or your x intercept if you set y equal zero get 0 = x + 2 x = 2 so 2 okay so if you have a A plus two here it's going to shift your graph two to the left so your vertex is going to be 0 one 2 so then your graph is going to look something like this just shift it over if you haveg 3 it's going to shift it to the right three and that's all we're going to do with parabas um make sure you come back and watch our next video where we talk about circles
