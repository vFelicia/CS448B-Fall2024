what's up everyone it's sarah and in this video i am going to be covering the Calvin cycle it's the carbon fixation step of photosynthesis in the calvin cycle ATP and nadph from the lightdependent phase are used to make carbohydrates and they uses carbon dioxide as the carbon source so carbon dioxide incorporation requires a massive amount of energy like a freakin boatload of energy more like a freakin fairy load of energy so for every six carbon dioxide that is incorporated 18 ATP and 12 NADPH molecules are used so like I said it's a crap ton of energy but anyways carbon dioxide incorporation is going to produce glyceraldehyde3phosphate which is a three carbon molecule there are three phases in the calvin cycle you first got your carbon fixation where carbon dioxide is incorporated in to ribulose bisphosphate using the enzyme rubisco and then the six carbon intermediate is going to split into three phosphoglycerate two molecules of 3phosphoglycerate the second step is the reduction and carbohydrate production where ATP is used to convert 3phosphoglycerate into 13 bisphosphate go straight NADPH reduces it to glyceraldehyde3phosphate and the net reaction is six carbon dioxide's are going to form 12 glyceraldehyde3phosphate the last step is the regeneration of ribulose bisphosphate you got 10 molecules of glyceraldehyde 3phosphate combining with six molecules of ATP to produce six molecules of arrival OHS bisphosphate alright so here's how the cycle works you've got your 6 carbon dioxide which is a onecolor carbon molecule and you've got your 6 ribulose bisphosphate or rubp molecules which are 5 carbon molecule rubisco is going to combine these two to make 12 3phosphoglycerate you can see here the structure is just a three carbon molecule with a phosphate on the third carbon after this 12 ATP's are going to be hydrolyzed forming 12 adps the form 12 13 bisphosphate glyceride molecules also a three carbon molecule this is the structure of 13 BPG right over here you can see it just has an extra phosphate groups stuck onto the first carbon right there after this is going to go through some more stuff and 12 NADPH azhar going to be reduced to 12 nadp+ a's and 12 inorganic phosphate groups are going to be kicked off so form 12 glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate molecules also a three carbon molecule here you can see that carboxylic acid up there has been reduced to an aldehyde but you still got your phosphate group on the third carbon right here so two of these glyceraldehyde3phosphate are going to be used to reduce a glucose and other sugars the other ten are going to be used to produce ribulose bisphosphate to continue the cycle again but so 10 of these are going to go and 680 PS are going to be hydrolyzed to form to reform the six of ribulose bisphosphate so you need then the cycle starts all over again you can see the structure of Regulus bisphosphate right here if you want but that's all i have for carbon cycle the calvin cycle rather but in the next video i'm going to go over some alternative pathways that plants use such as photorespiration and the incorporation of four carbon constituents and set five carbon the constituents own and cam plants
