what is going on guys it's Bucky again and welcome to your second physics tutorial now before I even get started in this tutorial telling you guys what I'm even going to be teaching and I want to say this I have a new microphone that I'm using in this tutorial so go back and listen to my last tutorial then listen to this one and whatever you guys vote is the better microphone is the one I'm going to be using for the rest of my tutorial so it's up to you guys to decide on my future of what microphone you guys want to listen to and what microphone I'm going to use so that being said I want to talk to you guys about some alternative or basically different variations of ways we can write scientific notation now the reason I need to teach you guys about these different ways we can write scientific notation is kind of a stupid reason but I'm going try to explain it you know back in high school or maybe you're in high school now different teachers have different requirements for like writing a paper your English teacher might be like all right make sure you write this paper in cursive and your computer teachers like all right make sure you type this paper out on the computer and another teacher is going to be like all right make sure you you know just use basic handwriting when the truth is it's like dude come on does it really matter how I write my paper you can read it any way I write it so why you giving me these stupid rules well that's kind of what I have to teach you now different scientists and different teachers depending you know how they grew up what country they lived in how they practiced physics they they are so anal about writing scientific notation a different way than you probably learned so I'm going to be teaching you all these weird little variations and then no matter what textbook you read no matter what tutorial you're watching you're going to be able to understand what all these little weird symbols mean so the very first thing I want to teach you guys about is something called alternative form now all this means is some scientists are so anal where they make sure the number to the left of the decimal point is zero so you know how we had numbers like one let me go ahead and switch to the right layer we had numbers like 5.26 * 10 4th where they saying all right here's a decimal point right here and this number is not a zero so that is invalid so what they would do is they put a big old line through this and say wrong so what alternative form is is it's basically saying all right the number to the left always has to be zero so you would have something like 0.362 * 10 to 4th that's good 0.8 61 * 10 5th that's good so basically all you have to remember whenever your teacher says make sure you're writing in alternative form make sure that this number is always zero and that's it that's good to go so the next thing I want to talk to you guys about is the multiplication symbol so in our last tutorial I wrote scientific notation like this um let me give you guys a quick example yeah that's probably going to happen a lot so so you guys are probably just going to have to deal with it 5.8 oops 5.81 * 10 to the 4th power and again as you can see I use the X for multiplication but some scientists like I said said and some teachers are so anal they make you write a DOT instead of the multiplication sign so it would look like this 5.81 times and your time sign would look like that 10 to the 4th now this thing right here this way of writing it and this way of writing it is the exact same way however some teachers make you write that dot rather than the x and by way in my upcoming tutorials I am never going to write the dot and I'll tell you why whenever you have a number written in scientific notation like 5.81 * 10 4th it can get really confusing sometimes this Dot and this dot especially if you don't move it exactly middle and this one isn't sitting exactly on bottom right there so I mean one dot is enough I don't need two floating all around my numbers so that's why I use use x it's a lot easier than writing a bunch of dots however if your teacher say use a DOT whenever you're showing your work then that's what you got to do now aside from that some other teachers make you use an Asis which just throws a whole another wrench into your problems so you'd have something like 5.81 and then you have to make a stupid Asis like that 10 to the 6 power so again it all depends on you know I needed to go over all these signs because I didn't want you guys to get confused whenever you saw an X and a DOT and an asterisk I didn't want you guys to think that those were all different meanings they all mean the exact same thing it just depends on your preference and your teacher how stupid they are so the last thing I want to talk to you guys about is plain text notation now what plain text notation is is basically this scientists long ago back you know tens and tens of years ago they wanted to send you know scientific notation across emails and they wanted to be able to type it in typewriters well I don't know if you guys ever used the computer before but if you try to do something like this 10 to the 5th there isn't really an easy way you can type that you need to type a whole bunch of like combinations to get exponents to show up whenever you're typing so they made an easier way to do that and that's through the use of plain text notation so plain text notation pretty much means How can I I type scientific notation or write it on a typewriter easily and for that they used no exponents whatsoever so I threw a couple examples up here right now 3.58 E6 is example of plain text notation what this means is 3.58 * 10 to the 6 so it's pretty much e = * 10 well you can obviously see I don't need to explain to you guys what it means so 7.14 e to the8 pretty much means 7.14 * 10 to8 so basically that's what it means so it's basically just a way of writing scientific notation that's easily noticeable whenever you're looking at it on a typewriter or email or calculator something like that and this down here is just an alternative version of plain text notation and the reason I wanted to go over these little carrot signs and by the way that's the symbol above the six on your keyboard the reason I want to go over that is because a lot of scientific calculators you use nowadays they you can't like throw an exponent and they can't display it on their screen like this so instead what they do is they type it like this so you see this a lot whenever you're working with calculators because again they have the same problems that computers do it isn't really easy for them to display exponents so they need you know a simple plain text way to display them so that's why we have plain text exponents AKA plain text notation whatever you want to call it so now that I go over excuse me now that I went over all these alternative variations of scientific notation no matter which one of these things you see whether it's PL text notation various multiplication symbols or alternative form where you need the zero to the left of the decimal point you guys should be able to understand what these numbers mean and how to use them and how you can convert them to you know something that you feel more more comfortable working with so with that being said thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you guys in the next tutorial
