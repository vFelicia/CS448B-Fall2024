what is up guys is Bucky and welcome to a quick update video I haven't made a video in a while so I thought hey it's probably a good idea to make a video so the first thing I want to say is happy Valentine's Day to everyone I hope your Valentine's Day is going awesome I don't so happy Valentine's Day the second thing I want to mention is you guys ever get this crusty lotion at the tip of your lotion bottle because I do and it's kind of grossing me out and I don't want to touch it so I'm just kidding that's not really what I wanted to talk to you guys about this video what I want to talk to you guys about is a quick little update on my channel and that is the fact that the new Boston has finally hit a hundred thousand subscribers so thank all of you guys who have ever viewed rated or most importantly subscribed my channel without you guys none of this would be possible so from the bottom of my heart I thank you and for you guys who were just watching this video because you clicked on it because you thought I was child above common mistake but what the new busting is is it basically started out as a hobby a couple years ago I started making videos on how to make a website and then a lot of people started watching it and they started asking me for other tutorials like computer programming so I made some other tutorials and more people viewed it and more people started joining the community and now it kind of developed into this huge community of computer programmers and people interested in computer related topics and it kind of just exploded recently and I mean to be honest people from different countries are messaging me every day asking me about computer related stuff I've had strangers come up to me in public asking me about the channel I've had universities email me asking me to speak at their college radios are what they call radio stations are calling me asking me for interviews and it's not only overwhelming but it's kind of exciting at the same time so I'm definitely looking for more than to the future of the new Boston can't wait to see what's in store for it so backing up a little bit whenever I saw that the new Boston was gonna hit 100,000 subscribers it made me realize the potential that we have is a community Inn as a channel not only are my goal is to you know get as many people as I can to watch my videos but it kind of made me notice that I'm starting to give it education people not only who have no time to you know enroll in the college course but maybe they can't afford the textbooks and you know people are beginning to get an education superior to what you would get out of college without ever having to spend a single dime on any materials the only thing you need is access to a computer and the willingness to learn so this is probably the thing that I'm most proud of beyond everything else and to be honest to let this thought just kind of pass me by wouldn't only be selfish of me but it would be kind of idiotic because I mean I'm just now beginning to realize just the huge potential and the huge impact that I can have on education as a whole to kind of be the leader in free education and hopefully you know I can become one of the largest Institute's you know bigger than any University bigger than any organization in I want to do this and I want to keep giving away my tutorials for free and I said that because in the past few weeks you guys have noticed that I haven't been making a lot of tutorials and there's a very good reason for this I've been doing a couple things I don't want to spoil it but all this month in February I'm gonna be doing a couple things setting up for March and again like I said I don't want to give you guys too many details but in March they're gonna be some huge changes to the new Boston all for the better it's gonna be basically an education revolution if you thought the New Boston was awesome before just wait till you see what's in store for March so anyways I think I'm gonna leave you guys at that but definitely just sit tight I'm not gonna be making a lot of tutorials for like the next two weeks but I am gonna be working my butt off and just hold on sit tight it's definitely gonna be worth it you guys just wait so like I said before we finally did a hundred and can't wait to see what's in in store for the future ticking me off the dumb screensaver so thank you guys so much um I can't express my gratitude enough so again thank you guys so much sit tight and uh I'll see you guys later
