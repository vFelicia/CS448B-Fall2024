hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston in this tutorial we're going to look at creating a very small sample application based on what we've learned about jQuery selectors we're going to be creating a form which allows the background color of each field to change when it's in focus and then when we are out of focus the background color will change back to white so we're creating this and showing I'm essentially showing you how easy it is to create something like this with jQuery selectors and referencing text types so we'll first we'll go ahead and build our form and then I'll go through a bit more about how this works and what we're doing so I'm going to create a form action and I guess the method doesn't really matter and then I'll end the form just here ok so inside I'm going to create a few field so I mean first we're going to say name and we can break down and that's just against around that in paragraph tags so just building up a form that you might usually use on your site now this type is text and that's the selector that we're going to be using in jQuery so let's go ahead and create some more fields will create about three fields we'll say name email and input type equals text and we'll go down and we'll create let's just uh no we'll just leave it at that so almost like a a newsletter submission form I guess so we create our last element which is a button and we can go ahead and give this an ID of news letter button okay so now that we've done this we can go ahead and preview this in our browser let's give that button a value before we go any further so we'll give this a value as sign of sign up okay so now we're in our form there's two things we want to happen we want our text field to change as we either tab down tab back up to them or simply click on them or click on another field and when we click sign up we want this button status or the value of this button to change and then what we want to happen is so the button is disabled so let's go ahead and look at the form fields first now we need to create an event and not an event well we only need to create two event handlers and the first one is focus in and then the last one is blur so we're going to use the blur to change the background color back to white and the focus in is going to change the background color to say yellow for example and we're going to be doing this using the CSS manipulator so inside selectors j/s which we have included down here we want to go ahead and start to create our focus in now we're going to choose the type of text so for every text field on this page which includes this one and this one as well we want to go ahead and change the background color once we've focused in so we use the focus in event handler and then inside here we create a function we pull that just down a bit and then we can start writing the code when we focus in so we want to select this dot CSS remember this will refer back to the current field itself if we were to for example do text then despite the fact that we may be clicking on this field both of them would then apply the CSS action we've specified here so we only want it to happen to the current field that we are and we have clicked on or the current field that we've tabbed down to so the current field that we focused into essentially so we supply the CSS function with two parameters the first one is the part of the element that we want to change so background color
