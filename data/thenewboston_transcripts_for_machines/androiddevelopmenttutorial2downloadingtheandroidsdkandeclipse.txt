what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your second Android development tutorial now in this tutorial what we're going to be doing is downloading some more stuff we need in order to develop on the Android so the first thing that I'm going to have you guys download is called the Android SDK now the Android SDK is pretty much a package that includes things such as the libraries the debugger um some sample code documentation and also the emulator which is pretty much uh simulator so we can run Android programs on our computer so in order to do that go ahead and open Google and go ahead and type in um download Android SDK I don't want to give you guys a direct link because you know how they're always changing things the website's probably going to change but anyways go ahead and click on the first thing that pops up and this is going to take you to a download page that give you guys a bunch of different options of sdk's download now the first thing you're going to want to look for is what platform are you developing on make sure for most of you guys that you're on Windows and that is of course I'm assuming you're not running Linux or you're on a Mac but anyways and once you get under this we have two options right here we have a zip folder and we have an executable file what I'm going to recommend and evidently Android is too is just downloading the executable file the executable file is pretty much an easy wizard to guide you along the installation so go ahead and click this and the file is going to start to download I'm not going to click it because I already have it download but anyways that's how you do it so anyways once you click it and you have your file downloaded go ahead to wherever you download that file and double click it and this is going to start the wizard now once you're in the Wizard you just got to hit next next next install next and once you're done installing that that it's going to give you a program and this program should automatically open called the SDK manager and if it doesn't automatically open just go to you know SDK manager in your programs and you can open it this way hold on got to itch my ear oh yeah that's a spot right here all right anyways moving along so anyways at the end of your installation this program should automatically open but if it doesn't automatically open for some reason then just go to your programs where it was installed and uh just open it like you would open any other program so anyways whenever you see my program opens right here you see that I have a bunch of stuff under my installed packages well the first time that you open this program you're not going to have any of this stuff installed so you're going to need to install all this on your own now to install all of these packages all you need to do is hit the accept all button and then go ahead and either click download or install or one of those buttons and then your download or installation is going to begin now you guys need to be patient because it's going to take like 20 minutes to install all these packages and if you get an error a lot of people have been getting errors just go ahead and um cancel out of it and try to do it again so anyways it's pretty much I know it sounds confusing but it's pretty much going to guide you along all you have to do basically is hit next next next accept all next next next and it's going to do all the work for you so anyways once you have everything installed and everything's downloaded you're good to go just go ahead and cancel out of that and now we have the Android SDK downloaded again it's a lot easier done than said yeah I said it so anyways we have the Android SDK downloaded at this point the only thing we have left to download or only big thing is a program called Eclipse now if you don't have Eclipse download downloed on your computer then what it is is pretty much the text editor we need in order to develop Android applications so go ahead open up Google again let me go to Google so you guys don't get confused and by the way do you guys ever do this with you guys with Google Chrome um is it even called Google Chrome or just Chrome I don't know but anyways I done this for the longest time whenever I first got this instead of uh just typing whatever I need like download Eclipse right here I would always go to google.com and type it in right there so instead of just using this little shortcut bar I always went to Google bad habit but you know whatever so anyways now that you put up with my little Side Story here's what you need to do download Eclipse go ahead and type that in Google and click on the first link that pops up now this is going to give you a list of like a thousand eclipses to download download but the one we're looking for is this Eclipse IDE for Java developers and we're going to want to download the 32bit version now I know a lot of you guys are running a 64bit operating system but either way download the 32bit version and the reasoning behind this is whenever we download the jdk in the first tutorial that was 32bits so in order for this program to be compatible with that we need to download the 32bit version of eclipse so again like I said if you're getting an error message even though your computer might have a 64bit operating system you need to download 32bit um Eclipse so anyways go ahead and click this link right here and this is going to take you to the downloads page what I found is you can either um click this one right here and this is going to give you the file but some of these mirrors are actually faster and a mirror is pretty much just a a different place place to download from so um you can download you know from Harvard but don't download from there there a bunch of preps there probably Indiana University looks like a good one to me but I'm just kidding you can download from any of these ones just make sure it says HTTP for your uh best bit so anyways once you have that downloaded it's going to give you a file on your computer let me see if I can find it for you guys Bucky download and it's going to look like this well yours might look like a little folder with a zipper on it but I got windzip so it's it's going to give you a zip file and what you need to do with that zip file is go ahead and rightclick it and it's either going to say open with windship or extract or unzip or something like that pretty much you need to decompress it and once you extract everything from it it's going to give you a regular folder right next to it so once you have that folder extracted let's go ahead and click the regular one and go ahead and open Eclipse and it's going to give you a bunch of different files in here what we're looking for is this application file right here called Eclipse it's going to be the one with a weird icon next to it this purple planet looking thing so what you can do anytime you want to run this program you can either go to this directory uh navigate through your folders and go ahead and double click eclipse or what's going to be a better bet if you just right click it and press send to uh desktop right there create shortcut it's going to give you a handy little icon right on your desktop and since we're going to be using this program a lot hopefully um that's your better bet so go ahead and once you got your icon on your desktop just go ahead and double click it and go ahead and press run you need to do this every time probably and it's going to ask for your workspace just go ahead and keep your default workspace press okay and now eclipse is going to open and by the way if you get to that point and my computer's freeezing that is just great that just effing great let me close this close this program I'm about 3 seconds away from drop kicking my computer right now uhhuh um this is nice so hopefully your program shouldn't do this but I think it's because I'm uh recording with Camtasia and trying to pump like a thousand different processors into my computer but anyways if you guys get a air before that I just say air error before that then uh that's because you downloaded the wrong version of eclipse so anyways you know what I'm just going to stop here because you know I don't feel like talking anymore I think I'm going to bed so anyways that's what you need to do for this tutorial make sure you download the Android SDK and also eclipse and if you have any problems just go ahead and shoot me a message on YouTube messaging and uh actually you know what I'm probably not going to look at those ever just go ahead and ask on my forum and someone will help you so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next tutorial
