hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a PHP video tutorial for the new Boston now this is a quick introduction to XML now some of you may have heard XML some of you may not but XML is becoming an integral part of the Internet in how we transfer and pick up data from different websites and also how we can transfer data from say a database to another database using custom tags inside an XML file now XML stands for extensible markup language and it is a markup language so it's similar to HTML in the way that we use markup tags so let's just give you an example here in HTML we would define our HTML tags like this or in XML what we can do is we create custom tags that allow us to specify data and pick up data using different tags so for example I might have a name tag and we end it exactly the same as we do and this name tag might be Alex and we might have this inside producer tag and then what we might have is many producers so we might in fact have a few names down the list and then we might have an inside these inside these different producers and information about different producers so we might have this outside taggers producers and inside we might have let's just get rid of everything we might have producer and then that there and then inside we might have a name and then we might then what we can do is we can duplicate this and have another producer and another producer so we can change these values here oh now this may all look odd and may not make sense at first however what we have done here is we've created a structured way of displaying our data now if I was to say to someone if you open up an XML file at the moment I'm working with the PHP file so pretend this is dot XML if this was next in our document and I said to someone okay well and bring up the second and third producer what would be able to is access these tags so we'd be able to access the producers take first of all and then coming through and say we'd have say feed this into an array and we'll be able to select just this information the name in the age of the two producers two last producers so it's a great way to transfer data around the web and in a format that's recognizable depending on what tags you've used so you can have an agreement of what tags are and which tags are required or not so this XML data we can read it in through different web applications and software applications however why is it useful to us as PHP programmers now you may have noticed that or may know that Facebook things like Facebook Twitter YouTube all have preset XML files for different users so for example let's just bring up an example of a YouTube XML document now it's not correctly structured in terms of indenting and things like that if we go down we can start to see information about about videos from this will the user PHP academy' so we've got if you look carefully you can see things like have a look okay you've got here you've got a description so you've got a description there of a video and if you come down you've got some more information and you can see that we've got these media tags here you've got let's just go up should be some more around it's quite hard to see this because it's very yes so that we've got author there this is just general information from this a PR document but if we go down we can see this is an extensive amount of data in here but it all can be read in using PHP now what we're going to do is we're going to work with creating our own simple XML files and reading them in and learning how to read them in and then what we're going to do is we're going to take an example of a data feed from either youtube or another or another social networking site that we can access i uses feeds for example from twitter and things like that and we are going to read in things like that so now that you know what xml is you can go away and fiddle around with different websites and how they produce their xml have a careful look at it some might be structured some might be not like this and then in the next lessons we can start reading this data in and in fact then we can start storing this data and once we know the structure of over xml document and we can simply write an xml file using file handling so we can output different lines to the file depending on the tags that we've specified so I won't be going through how to write your own XML file but we will be looking extensively at reading in XML files and then how to read in data like this
