okay so today we're going to deal with solving word problems using equations so what's going to happen is we're going to get a statement that describes a situation in words and what we're going to have to do is create an equation that represents that sentence in order to find out what a number is so for this first one it says the sum of twice a number and 21 is 83 so we're going to take this piece by piece in order to set up an equation so the sum means we're going to be adding two things together so what we're going to be adding is twice a number oops and the number 21 so when it says twice a number it's hinting at a certain operation and it it's hinting at multiplication so twice a number would mean two times a number and and we're going to use n and you always have to write what your variable represents so N is a number so twice a number 2 N and it says here the sum so sum means addition so we're going to be adding 2 n + 21 and it says is 83 well in math is is means equals so when we say that it is 23 it means that this equation equals 83 so now we're going to solve it like any normal equation and what most people find is that setting up the equation is the hardest part because once you go once you do that you can solve it like you would solve any other equation so we're going to subtract 21 from both sides you get 2 N is equal to 62 IDE by 2 and N is equal to 31 now the tricky thing about word problems is you always have to make sure you solve the equation correctly and answer the problem so this one just tells us to find the number but some sometimes the word problem is going to ask us for something different and we have to make sure we are answering the problem completely so we're going to do a couple more examples 6 * a number increased by 3 is 27 find the number so 6 * a number so n is going to be our number again n is a number so 6 * a number 6 n increased by three now increased is another word used for addition so if we increase this by three we're going to add three to this and once again we have is which means equals so equals 27 going to subtract three over we get 6 n = 24 divide by 6 n = 4 and once again it says find the number so this is our final answer we can stop there so we have one more problem we're going to do four fifths of the class went to the zoo if 64 kids went to the zoo how many kids are in the class so this one's a little more complicated and we're what we're going to use is we're going to use C to represent the class so we're going to take so since four fifths of the class of always is going to signify multiplication because you're saying we have this many of something else so in order to find out how much we have we're going to take the fraction times the number so we have four fifths of the class which we're going to write as C went to the zoo and we know that 4 fths of the class is 64 because it says 64 kids went to the zoo so now we're going to multiply both sides by 54s and this is going to get a c we can reduce by fours this becomes one this becomes this becomes 16 and 16 * 5 is equal to 80 so if you set it up this way and make sure you put you units and that means 80 kids so if you set it up this way you're going to get your final answer and since they want to know how many kids went to the are in the class and this tells us how big our class is that's how we know we completely answered the problem but I'm going to show you another way to set it up and if you set it up this way you have to do an extra step to make sure you answer the problem completely so you remember when a while ago we talked about proportions well if we were to write this as a prop proportion it would be 4 FS is equal and since this is the smaller number and this is the total we're going to put 64 over X and if we cross multiply we're going to get 4X is equal to 6 4 * 5 and X is going to give you if you plug that into a calculator X will also give you 80 so see how we we had to do this extra step right here but you always want to make sure you answer the question completely using the correct units so that's all we're going to do with word problems today but make sure you come back and watch your next video where we're going to talk about inequalities
