hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be using some of the things that you've learned in the last tutorials to make a simple calculator program so let's go ahead and get started we're going to go ahead and give some space down here in our main sub and we're going to prompt the user to input a value so we'll use console dot write line please enter the first number now what we're going to do is we're going to declare a variable and we're going to use console dot readline to store the information in that variable so we'll use the dim keyword so dim num1 as double and we'll just set it equal to console dot read line so if you want to read a value from the line or if you want to get the input that the user is putting in you can declare the variable and assign it to console dot readline at the same time you can do all this in one line which saves you some coding time so now that we have our first number we're going to use console dot write line and we're just going to tell the user what their first number is so that they know that the program received it correctly so I'll do first number and we'll just use the + sign and we'll print out num1 now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt them to enter a second number so we will use console dot write line please enter the second number now we're going to create another variable so we will use the dim keyword will do dim num2 as double and we'll set it equal to console dot readline so this does the same thing that we did up here in declaring num1 and we use console dot readline and instead of number one down here we're going to want num2 okay so now we're going to print out the answer but first we're going to tell them that we receive their first number correctly so console dot write line second number and now we're going to create a third variable with we will dim it and we'll type answer as the name and we want to make it a double and we'll set it equal to num 1 times num2 so now we're just going to print that out so console dot write line answer and we'll set that equal to answer or will add answer to that and we need to use the + sign right here so now if we run this program it will say please enter the first number so if I type 32 and press ENTER it's going to tell me the first number is 32 and it's going to ask me for the second number so let's do 45 and you can see closed on us right there so we need to add console dot read line okay so we'll enter the first number 34 it says first number 34 and we'll enter the second number 45 and when we press ENTER it will tell us the second number and it'll tell us to answer so now let's go down here and let's just specify what the calculator did so we'll do the numbers multiplied is and it's going to give us the answer now what we can do to save time is we can get rid of answer all by itself and instead of printing up printing out the answer we can do num1 times num2 so what this does is it takes on number one and multiplies it by num2 and it only does that in the arguments of console dot write line so it's not sorted as a variable it's just going to print out that number and then it's not going to save it anywhere now you can choose which one you want to do if you want to use answer later on then I would suggest declaring that variable and storing it in there because if you want the answer later on and you didn't declare a variable for it you won't be able to get the answer because the only time that you have the answer printed out on the screen or stored anywhere is when it writes this line and it multiplies them together so you can go ahead and play around with it you can make it multiply you can make a divide you can make it add whatever you want and then once you've got that nailed down move on to the next tutorial
