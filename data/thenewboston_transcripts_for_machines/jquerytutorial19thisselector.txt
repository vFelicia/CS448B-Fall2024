hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the this selector now I call it at this selector however is not categorized as an actual selector but what it does is it allows us to reference a particular object that we're currently working with or inside so for example if we were to create a button and wanted this button to be clicked and then the text on it on this button to be changed we can do so by referencing using this and this saves a lot of time with using selectors to reference a particular object we're in actual fact we only need to reference it once and inside a particular function we can use this so if you're unsure what I'm talking about I'm going to go ahead and give you an example so I'm going to go ahead and create a button on my page so an input type button and I'm going to assign a value as click me now when I click this button I want the value to change to please wait or something like that you'll probably notice that on a lot of websites when you click a button for example payment buttons the text will change and it will disable the button and this is just so the button can't be clicked twice now we're only going to be changing the value of this we're not going to be disabling it but obviously you can go ahead google around for how you would disable a button now I'm going to give this an ID and I'm just going to call it button for example and we use this ID to select this button so let's go over to our browser and just take a look at that you can see that we've got our click Me button here when we click it we need to assign an event handler for something to happen now let's say we had this click Me button we could do absolutely anything once we've assigned an event handler to it we can display a message we can submit a form we can load a different page it's entirely up to you how you use this however let's go and focus on how we can use this okay so i've already included this selectors JS file into my page as well as jquery because obviously we're making use of jquery however the selectors j/s file is just simply an external javascript file that we're going to be writing our code in we keep our JavaScript in an external file so we can go ahead and use a selector to reference this particular button and then perform an action and this action will be to change the value of this button so let's go over to selectors j/s and let's go ahead and use a selector to reference button now we've used a hash because we're using an ID here and the name of the button is button this value here is not to be confused with this type here for example if I call this button click I would then change this to button click and I think we'll leave it at that okay so now we want to use a dot to bind an event handler and this event handler is click and inside here we need a function now let's go ahead and do this the wrong way how we shouldn't really do it and then we'll go ahead and look a look at changing this to make use of this keyword okay so when this button is clicked let's go ahead and test the functionality and I'm just going to alert out a dialog box saying clicked so when I click this button now you see that we have this alert dialog sign clicked so we know that the clicking of our button has worked but what we actually want to go ahead and do is change the value of this so we can use the action in jQuery which stands for attribute and we would normally go ahead and say button under saw underscore click dot H and what this will do you can specify a value in the first parameter which is value essentially what we're doing is we're changing an attribute of this button and the attribute we want to change is the value which is currently set to click me now if you want to go ahead and change this to something we can so I could say please wait so what's going to happen now is when we click on our button we're again selecting our button and changing the attribute value to please wait so let's go ahead and check out how this works when I click this button you see it changes to please wait so quite an easy piece of code and quite effective however if you're using a reference to a particular object with inside a function a lot you can go ahead and eliminate the need to re reference this or reselect this button and you can do that using this selector now like I said it's not an actual jQuery selector however the reason I'm doing this tutorial is just to demonstrate the functionality of this now what this will do is it will pick up the current element that we're working with so essentially by replacing it with this JavaScript automatically replaces this with button click so it's a good coding practice to get into by using this as opposed to keep re referencing a particular element on your page so now when we refresh you can see that it works in exactly the same way just by using this so like I've said this is a better way to write your code in terms of you know in terms of using this keyword here as opposed to re referencing this over and over again now the reason for this is let's just say you had lots of references back to this button inside of here you might have for example some more code down here that did something else what happens if we go ahead and change this button ID we might just change it to button for example now what we would have to do if we had constantly it applied this text here this selector here is we would have to go and change every single thing on our page so some more code down here might make use of this selector so by using this we can automatically just determine which element that we're currently working with so you can see it'd be a lot easier to change if you had you know say two 300 lines of code and you were using a selector each time so by using this you're creating a static version of this select original selector so that's the this selector in jQuery or just in JavaScript an extremely effective way to program
