hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and I'm back now with another video for the new Boston this time we're going to be talking about databases now in this video I'm not going to teach you how to set up a database how to write data to etc etc but we're just going to talk about why a database is important in most real life um application situations um we're also going to be talking about a bit about the mySQL database now this is also called MySQL uh you may hear people call it my SQL but for the uh duration of these tutorials I'm going to be calling it MySQL okay so why do we need to use a database now you may have come across databases before in the format of say Excel um not Excel sorry access um and other database applications where you can store values with specific column names and you can store these values as a row I mean you can do that in Excel as well but okay so let's just get rid of these PHP tags and I'll take you through why we might want to store data in a database now if you've already looked at file handling you'll know that we've stored things we may have stored things like hit counter value in a file and then what we've done is we've opened the file up we've read the value in we've closed the file we may have then open the value uh the file up again to rewrite another value now this puts a huge amount of strain and complication as well on the whole process now let's say we wanted to write a value to a um to a file what we're doing is we're opening up that file so we're reading file data we are then um writing a value to a file what happens if we want say to include a username a password um a first name a surname and other data let's just say um website so you may have hundreds and hundreds of records with people a username their password and you may want to create some kind of login system for this now you're not going to do very well if you're using files to store this data you can by all means use files to store this data have however it's a lot more secure and it's also a lot quicker to use a database and in this case we're going to be using MySQL because it is one of the fastest databases available to use now MySQL is hosted on a server so it will have um it will have its own port number if we open up the xamp control panel you can see that I've got this process MySQL and it's running at the moment and I think it runs on by default let's have a look can't see uh let's stop it and then restart it so it's it's running on Port 3306 now from PHP you don't need to worry about this too much you don't need to worry about accessing it you know as a server but we do use um some functions to connect to our database and then we SE or connect to our server and then we uh use another function to connect to the database itself so you can have a variety amount of a variety of data databases within um MySQL and then you can have a variety of tables inside them databases now a database would be say users so this is my users database here I've got username so I'm going to say Alex password I'm going to put pass one two 3 first name is Alex surname is Garett and website PHP academy.org so I've already put one record in for myself now this could uh this uh table we're looking at here this is be a table could contain other data so we could say Billy again the password might be pass uh 456 Billy Garrett and uh we might not have a website so um we are storing essentially data in this way now the way we can access it access this is we can select our table what we can then do um yeah so this is our table our database name uh we'll just say table users our database name might be called um uh PHP Academy for example um and our table might be called users so now what we can do is let's say uh We've stored uh you know we're storing users we can do this on the fly but what we can do now is we can select different values so I can execute something called a query which will select a specific amount of data from a specific row now usually you'd have an ID field um on the start of a row um and this this is this will be uh created something called autoincrement so you know what incrementation is it just increments every time so for each record created it's automatically um increments and this uh adds to the unique property of it and we can define a PR primary key for this ID and the primary key is just the unique field uh or the new unique column name in your database
