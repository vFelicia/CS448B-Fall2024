okay so we're going to talk about parts of congruent triangles so we have this triangle ABC and we're told that it's congruent to triangle d e f now the way you name your triangles is important because if these two are congruent then all corresponding sides and angles are congruent so angle a right here has to be congruent with angle D right here which if you look they are so angle B has to be congruent with angle e which we know is true because angle B is a right angle which is 90 degrees and the angle e is also a right angle which is also 90 degrees and angle C this last angle has to be congruent with angle F which we know is true so not just the angles corresponding angles are congruent that the corresponding sides are also are congruent if these triangles are congruent so a B is congruent to de BC is congruent with e f and a/c is congruent with D F so now that we know how which angles have to be congruent to which we are going to do an example naming which angles are congruent so if we were to name this triangle according to how its congruent if we start with T we know that triangle T we're going to go t.v you is congruent now we have to name them the same way so we went from 11 arc mark 23 so we have to go from one to three so triangle why W X we have to name them the same way because corresponding angles and corresponding segments have to be congruent so this means that angle tea should be congruent to angle why based on the way we named it and this has one and this has one so that means they are congruent so angle V has to be congruent with angle w which that's three that's three we're good there an angle you has to be congruent to angle X so we got two we got two we're good all right so now we have to make sure that their sides the right sides are congruent so side TV right here has to be congruent with YW right here which is right because they're both marked the same way segment vu has to be congruent with WX 22 we're good and that means that you t or t you either way is congruent to Y X which tu is right here YX is right here so we're good and we're going to do one more example at but we're going to name we're going to do it by naming the triangles that are congruent and we're going to name them according to their corresponding parts so for the first one we're told we want to say the triangle h g I is congruent to another triangle so we have to look at which sides and which angles are congruent so that we can name them correctly so if I start with angle H this is two marks so I need to start with the angle that has two marks which is right here angle k so we're going to start triangle k and then i need to go in the same direction that i went last time so i went h2g h2g which is this 10 inch side so i need to do the same thing on this triangle i need to go to the 10 inch side and go to el which makes sense because angle g and angle l are congruent and finally I'm going to go i went from g2 I so I have to go down this six and side on the other one as well and go Jay which makes sense because Jay an angle I are congruent so we're going to do the same thing but in a different but for a different triangle and these are all the same triangles it's just the way we name them is important to talking about they're congruent see so triangle jkl jkl is congruent with so if i start with j I have to start with I right here so triangle I and then I went to K so I have to go to angle 8h right here and then I went to angle l over here so that means i have to go to angle g over here because lng or congruent same thing but i'm starting with I and I'm going to G and i'm going to h so i started with I so I had to start with J on this one then I went to G so I have to go to El on this one and then we went up to H so I got to go up to k on this one and then one more we have L j/k so I started with L so I have to start with G on this triangle I i went to j LD j so I got to go g to I and then I went up to k I went up to k this way so we gotta go up to H this way and that makes sense because if you look at it hg I is really just is really reflected over to get que je l because we still have h up here then I would be over here G would be over here so that's why these are reflections of these so now that we can talk about which parts of of triangles are congruent we're going to talk about some theorems to proving triangles are congruent in our next video so be sure to watch it
