hi this is alex from phpacademy.org with a video tutorial for the new boston in this video we're going to be creating our own jquery plugin uh so let's just take a look first of all at the index.php page and just how uh well what i've done with this function and also how i've included it now you see that i've included three different files the first one is jquery.js which is our jquery library which obviously we need we've then created our plugin inside plugin.js and we're using this plugin or calling this plugin making use of it using ext.js so essentially what the plugin is going to do is it will take all of the links on a page as long as you actually call the plugin and it will apply target equals underscore blank so at the moment you can see that we've just got our normal link we can use target equals underscore blank so we can use this target attribute to set where we want the link to open in now let's just say you wanted all of your links across your entire page to open in a new window now it would be quite uh annoying using target you know equals underscore blank and i'm sure there are probably easier ways to do this without jquery but you know that's the example of the plugin if this doesn't exist so if dot blank oh sorry target equals underscore blank doesn't exist or the target is equal to nothing we will add automatically add using jquery target equals underscore underscore blank now if it equals something like underscore self uh we won't be applying uh the underscore blank obviously because the user might have predefined that they want it to open um in the same window so we're creating this plugin you know just as an example but it can have uh useful um you know effects you can be you can use this and it would uh i guess do a job that you might have to do manually so um let's take a look at it in action on our in our browser as you can see i've created this google um link which you can see here i'm going to go ahead and set target equals underscore self now what this will automatically do is it will open it in in the same window now let's go ahead and get rid of this and just show nothing inside of here you'll see that it automatically opens in a new window so we've used this plugin obviously this is all done with ext.js to add underscore blank in here now if i was to go ahead and not include anything this will add the whole attribute on for us so it still opens in a new window and we've called this in ext.js i've called the plugin target blank so i've applied this using a selector to all a tags so we're essentially just saying you know any tag that has an a we apply this this uh plugin too so that's essentially what the plugin does it's quite a simple concept but it means we can now use this basic idea to go ahead and create our own jquery plugin and you can obviously go ahead and use this information to expand and create your own plugins if you have a really good idea that you'd like to actually create as a plugin rather than an external file that you want to that you want your users to um just you know simply include on the page it makes it a lot uh better and well easier for a user to just call this particular plugin name so let's go ahead and look inside plugin.js and we'll start to actually write out this plugin okay so i've gone ahead and blanked this document also we have plugin.js which is empty as well i've still kept the link here because this isn't too hard to create so i'm not going to waste time by typing it out but let's take a look at what we need to include once again obviously the jquery library plugin.js is where we're going to define our function or our plugin and actually allow it to be used and then ext.js is just going to take all links on the page as we've already seen and apply the plugin to it so inside plugin.js we need to go ahead and outline the structure of how we're actually going to go ahead and create this function so let's go ahead and start doing this now now the first thing i'm going to do is i'm going to say function and then dollar sign and this gives us the ability to use this correctly as we normally would a jquery plugin sorry that should just have a parenthesis there and parentheses there so essentially we're starting out with parentheses like this and then we're creating a function with the dollar sign and then we're doing this and just pulling that down so that's just how you might normally view this now after this we need to use jquery and essentially this means that we can use the dollar sign instead of having to keep referencing jquery and that clears up a lot of problems that we might come across in uh in the long run as well uh so there's there's information about that in the jquery documentation but uh you know this is the way we would uh standardly do it now we need to create our function name and we do this by using a dollar sign and then dot fn and then the name of our function or the name of our plugin so essentially a plugin is just a function it's just called a plugin uh in jquery so if i do refer to it as a function then think of it as a plugin anyway so the name that we've called this is target blank remember in the previous part of the tutorial where i showed you through this you could see that i'd called it as target blank so this is the function name obviously it can't override any other function that jquery has so any other standard you know that's something that's standardly built into the library so call it something unique you might have a catchy name for it or you might just have it something that you know does what it does and in this case target blank pretty much says what it does
