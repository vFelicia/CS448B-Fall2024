hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live camera for the new boss Tim and in this tutorial we're gonna be continuing with we're gonna continue working on the car application so we'll go ahead and just open it up here we'll wait for it to prepare prepare the solution okay so if you remember from the previous tutorials we created the form that will allow users to add cars to their list now what if they want to hit cancel and not add a car well we're gonna I'm gonna show you how to do that today and if none of this is familiar to you you might want to go back and start from the beginning of the series so what we need to do is let's come over here to our new car VB class and we need to create a variable so we'll just call it will create as and we're gonna make it a balloon and we're gonna go ahead and set it equal to false at the beginning and now let's come down here to the button add car event handler and if I click the button add right here it's gonna go ahead and add their car to the list so I'll just type it will create equals true so if they click Add it's going to be equal to true but if they click cancel let's go ahead and type me dot close we don't have to set the value to false because it's already false so let's go back here to form our BB and you can see here that when they create a car or that's not it let's do button create car right here okay so when I click create car it's gonna go ahead and do all of this stuff right here now let's go ahead and add an if statement right underneath add new car show dialog so if add new car dot we will create is equal to true then we want to go ahead and create this new car so we'll just end if right here so it's only going to run if that is equal to true now what we can do is let's just take all this code right here and we will copy it or we'll cut it ctrl X let's just go ahead and paste it under create car so now we have taken this and put it in another sub so that we can call this sub wherever we want and it's not limited to only in button create car so we'll just type create car and when you eat right there so whenever they click that it's going to create a car so we'll go ahead and run this and see if it works so we'll click new car we'll set the name of the car to GMC Tahoe we'll set the color to green the number of doors will be five the horsepower will be let's just say 200 we'll go ahead and click add you can see that we have our Tahoe right here and we can get the info of it now okay at another car and this car will call it Honda Civic we'll set the color to blue set the number of doors let's just make it a two door I'm gonna set the horsepower to 180 and if we click cancel you can see that it does not add our car to the list because it the boolean value is set to false and because it was set to false it's not going to complete that operation so go ahead put this go to did code in if you have it it's very simple you can play around with it change it I encourage you to changes to see what you can do to make the program better and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
