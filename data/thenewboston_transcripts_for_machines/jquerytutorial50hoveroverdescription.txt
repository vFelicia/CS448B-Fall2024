now the attribute that we've called this is hover text so we can go ahead and write hover text now that what this will do is it will take the attribute hover text which is the value here or here and it will take that from the class hover now the only problem with this is let's go ahead and just alert hover text out so we can test it is this we'll take the attribute from let's just show you it will take the attribute from the first class that's found so if we hover over Google we would expect Google a powerful search engine to now be that attribute that we've set and we've set that description however when we hover over PHP academy' you see that we get the the attribute that's associated with Google and the reason for this is that we need to change this or well I'll tell you the reason first the reason for this is that it's only searched for this element within this particular class and not unique classes as we hover over them so instead of using hover we use this and the way this changes things is as we hover over a particular element as we mouse over a particular element this only gains the element that is or only takes this attribute from the element that we're currently hovering over or recurrently mouse moving over so let's go ahead and just refresh the page and see what change that made so hover over Google or mouse over Google and it says Google a powerful search engine now when I hover over PHP academy' it says tutorials so we've gained just by using the this keyword we've gained the unique attribute from each one and obviously this is important because you might want to have multiple links on your page and you obviously want to have a unique description or hover text for each one so now that we've got the hover text that's great we can now start to do things with it but what we need to do is we need to assign it or assign this text to a particular div so we need to go ahead and first of all style our div that we're going to be using so I'm going to call this hover div and we need to apply some properties to it just to make it look nice and just to make it look like you know an actual hover over box so the first thing I want to do is say displaynone and this is important because we're going to be including this div on our page somewhere and we don't want it to be automatically displayed every time we only want it to be displayed when we're actually hovering over a particular element I'm going to set the position to absolute which is also extremely important because we're going to be defining the top and the left coordinates as we saw earlier when I was hovering over the link let's get rid of that when I was hovering over this Google link we had the coordinates appeared so we can set the div to particular coordinate so it's important that we use positionabsolute I'm going to go ahead and set just some aesthetic properties such as font size we'll go ahead and give it a background color of white give it a text color of 40 40 40 it's a nice gray color and we'll give it a border as well which I guess is quite important that's one pixel solid and let's say 999 and we'll give it some padding as well so it doesn't look too near the edges of our border so now that we've got this hover div let's just go ahead and preview what this looks like in our page so I'm going to say div ID equals that's hover div and some text in here so hover div we've now just included on our page when we refresh you can see that we've got this some text in here now you can see that's automatically overlapped my link my link is underneath here somewhere and that's simply because we've set the position to absolute and not relative or block or anything else like that so now that we've got this and we're happy with the look of it we can go ahead and hide it again and the reason I've just shown you this is because what we're going to be doing is changing the text within this div every time we hover over a particular element and then that will in turn we can in turn set the coordinates of this div so we're going to this here and this must be kept on every page that you use particular links probably not the best way to go about it but for now just as we're learning that's good enough so now that we're back to normal we just have our link and now we need to start setting what's going to happen when we actually hover over it so we've already got the hover text but we need to go ahead and actually set the position of this hover div so let's go ahead and use a selector hover div and we need to use the CSS function if you like to change the properties of this div now as you know or probably know in CSS we can use top and we can set the element to a particular place so I can say top and left 20 pixels so if we go ahead and unhide this again and place some text inside here you can see that's moved it 20 pixels from the top and 20 pixels from the left so now that we've done this we know that what we can do is we can set the top and the left of this div the top and the left positioning of this div to the coordinates relative to the link that we showed earlier so now hopefully that starts to make sense let's go ahead and get rid of that and let's go ahead and get rid of that and also the top and left properties as well so we want to use jQuery to set the top CSS property of this particular div and we want to do that using the e object and again remember we used the client X and the client Y of this so the top position will be client Y and then we go ahead and bind on another CSS changer and this time we want to change the left to e dot client X so e dot client X and E DUP client Y are the values that we returned earlier and display to the user but now instead of that we're setting the top property of our hover div to the coordinate that the users currently hovering over app and then we set the left property to the xaxis so now you'll see that when we hover over well nothing happens at the moment but you will see when we hover over the CSS will change for hover div according to the position that the cursor that so now all that's left to do is go ahead and actually show the the div and we want to do this before we actually set the position
