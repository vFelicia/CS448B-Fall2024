alright guys welcome back to your 11th C++ tutorial and last tutorial we covered the basics of an array and how to create it and pretty much the most basic easiest form but in this is where I'm going to show you a different way to create it so the first thing that we need to do is go ahead and just go ahead and type the data type of your array and the name of it and what or excuse me how many values you want to store in it and that's a line ended with a semicolon and bam right now we're telling our compiler this we're going to create an array and it's going to hoard hold 5 values so instead of putting an equal sign right here and setting equal to 5 values right now you have another option as well what you can do is go ahead and type in the name of your array the index and you can set each index individually and this might be a little easier to see let me just go ahead and copy this copy this might be a little easier to comprehend how you populate values in ternary so the zeroeth index of the array or the 0 with element we're going to set the 19 the first one let's just go ahead and set that to like 234 on let's run through this the second index is going to be equal to 3 or something the third index is going to be equal to whatever heck that is and the fourth index is going to be equal to you know whatever heck that is server saying all right you said 5 right here so don't you go to 5 no no remember by putting 5 right here you're saying all right we're creating an array with 5 elements but since you start every computer language is 0 1 2 3 4 5 it actually goes from 0 to 4 which is 5 elements so that's pretty much a different way that you can fill an array other than a way you learn before in the last tutorial so I mean either that way or this way they give you the exact same outcome just some people prefer that some people prefer this and when you're building programs in the future you might need to do the first way you might need to do this way but anyways for what we know so far they produce the exact same outcome so another thing I didn't teach you guys and you might be able to figure this out but I just want to show you guys anyways instead of just printing out you know like bacon a2 or something which is going to print out 0th index 1 2 which is 3 let's just go ahead and see that 3 right there you can also like um use arithmetic to add elements over to write together so bacon 2 plus bacon 4 plus bacon 4 again alright oh yeah I was going to add this up in my head but uh yeah I definitely can't do that so it's going to add this twice for 4 plus 2 so let's go ahead build into run this and we've this ten thousand eight hundred and sixty nine so anyways I just want to show you guys one you have a different type or excuse me a different way of building an array and also you can treat these array items or array elements just like you would any other variable and add them together print them out pretty much anything can do with a variable you can do with your pieces of your array so I know that this wasn't the most useful program we ever built either but again I just want to go over the basics of the pieces of our programs before I get into building a complex program so anyways whenever you see me building an array like this you'll know what it means any idea I'm going to be done talking because I got more important stuff to do more important topics that we need to cover so anyways study this tutorial and once you learned it you're ready to move on next topic so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys next tutorial
