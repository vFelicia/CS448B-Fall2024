so today is our last lesson in our geometry series so for our last lesson we're just gonna do some more proofs okay so we're given that BA D is congruent to CE da so b 8d which is this big angle here is congruent to CE da which is this big angle here and angle one is congruent to angle 4 and they want us to prove that this angle is congruent to this angle okay so first thing we're gonna do is rewrite our given and Gobi AG congruent to angle CDA and go one current angle for and that's our given okay so if you remember what we did when we first started learning geometry we learned this postulate that the measure of this big angle is equal to the measure of each one of these little angles and same for this one so the measure of angle B ad is equal to the measure of angle one plus the measure of angle two and in the same step the measure of angle CDA is equal to the measure of angle four plus the measure of angle three and that's our angle addition property addition property of angles okay so since we know that these two angles are congruent we can say that they have equal measures same thing with angle 1 and angle 4 because if congruent then they are also equal and then using substitution we can get angle measuring one less measure of angle 2 equals measure of angle 3 plus measure of angle 4 and that's by substitution because we're gonna substitute since we know that these two are equal and we know that this equals this and this equals this we can substitute each pair of these angles into this equation so then using our addition property of equality we can get the measure of angle 2 equal to the measure of angle 3 addition property of equality because since we know that this is congruent to this or this equals this in order for this statement to be true these two have to also be equal so in our last step we get angle 2 congruent to angle 3 for the opposite of this if equals then they are also congruent ok so we have one more proof we're gonna do and it's using parallelogram so we know that a b c d is a parallelogram and angle 1 is congruent to angle 2 and D F is congruent to EB so first we're gonna rewrite our given a base parallelogram Engel 1 congruent angle 2 DF congruent to EB and that's our given okay so since we know that ABCD is a parallelogram that means that it has opposite sides that are congruent so that means we can get this congruent to this piece right here so ad is congruent to B see if parallelogram then opposite sides are congruent ok so now I can get this angle congruent to this angle because we know it's a parallelogram and parallelogram halves have opposite angles who are congruent so angle a is congruent to angle C if parallelogram opposite angles congruent so now we have a side congruent to an angle congruent to an angle so we can get these two triangles congruent triangle d AE congruent to triangle bc f by angle angle side and then we can get this congruent to this de congruent to b f if triangles are congruent their corresponding parts are also congruent and then finally since I know that one pair of I was told one pair of opposite sides are congruent and we just proved the other pair congruent we can say that EB F D is a parallelogram if two pairs opposite sides are congruent then it is a parallelogram so like I said this is the last video for our geometry series but make sure you check out our other series is and next we're gonna do algebra 1
