hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new boss sim and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at exiting subs early now if you're familiar with this in another language what you can do is you can just go ahead and type return which will exit the method or function that you are using now it's a little bit different in visual basic so let's go ahead and get started and make a demo application for this and you're going to be learning a little bit more than just exiting the sub we're going to be working a bit with a listbox in this so go ahead and select new project select windows forms application and then go ahead and name it exit sub and we'll click OK so now we're up we'll open up our toolbox and we will add a button here and we will set the text to exit sub demo and we'll make it a little bit bigger and let's just stretch it all the way across here now we'll come down here and we will add a list box we'll stretch it out a bit to fill up the whole screen and we're going to go ahead and set the name value to list numbers and we will set in the button name to button exit sub so let's go ahead and double click on the exit sub button we'll close out of our toolbox and zoom in here now let's go ahead and create a sub down here so private sub count and we will just pass a variable to it so by Val num as integer and now what we're going to do is we are going to increment num so go ahead and add a while loop so we'll go ahead and do while true then we'll go ahead and in the while now what this is going to do is it's going to run this while loop forever because we typed while true and then all it's always going to be true it can't possibly be false so we'll go ahead and type num plus plus now if we go ahead and come up here we'll create a variable so dim number as integer and we'll go ahead and set that equal to ten and starting it my language is confused there we'll do num plus equals one and every time we add one to num we're going to go ahead and access our list box so we'll type list numbers and then we'll add a dot and we'll type items and add so list numbers that items I add and we will just add num to that now what we're going to do is we're going to add an if statement so if num is greater than let's say 54 get rid of this parentheses right here so if num is greater than 54 then go ahead and exit sub so now what we're going to do is we are going to call the count sub so we'll just count and then we'll pass number to it so what this is going to do is whenever we click the exit sub demo button right here it's going to create a variable called number and it's going to set that equal to 10 then just going to call our count sub now what this does is it runs an infinite while loop and now it is ok for us to use an infinite loop right here because we have an way for it to exit the loop if a value is or if something is true so if num is greater than 54 and if that's true then go ahead and exit the sub which will exit while loop so now what we'll do is since we since I just explained what we didn't count we call it count and pass number to it because we have to have an integer value to add to pass to count now if we go ahead and run this we can go ahead and click exit sub demo and you can see here that we get starting at 11 and it goes all the way up to 55 now the reason it goes up to 55 is because down here in our count sub it will add 1 to it before and then check if it's greater than 54 so it is equal to 54 when we hit this and it comes back up here and it's equal to 55 and then it's going to exit our sub so you can see it has all of these values right here now you can also use this with a function so go ahead and you can create a couple subs or functions and you don't have to use a loop in them you can do whatever you want practice exiting the subs based on a certain condition and once you got that down then you're not going to forget it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
