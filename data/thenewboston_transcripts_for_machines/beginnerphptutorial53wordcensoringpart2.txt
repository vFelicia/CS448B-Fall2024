now just to point out before we go any further these values are lowercase so if I was to type an uppercase into here so Alex as opposed to Alex it's not going to recognize there so I'm going to introduce a couple more functions a bit later on that are going to deal with that as well to make sure that people can't get around things like this I mean this isn't a foolproof but it's just an example of how we can use this string replace function so we've got our user input now what do we need to do we need to say user input news so we can create a new variable and this is going to be STR replace and inside of here we need to take our three arguments now in power three arguments the first one is going to be what to find then what to replace and then the user input so finding what whatsoever in this array so each element of this array remember this will automatically take each element of the array and search for it and then this will take each element of this array and set and replace with the corresponding value so and user input is obviously what the user has entered so now let's echo echo out the user input new and see what result we achieve so if I just type any old text in here and click Submit obviously we're not filtering anything we're not replacing anything there but if I was to type type the an example let's say today I went out with Alex Alex Billy and Dale and I click Submit you can see that these have now been replaced so it's quite nifty nifty thing today so now what happens if I have a capital A for Alex say on a capital D for Dale or you could have a capital L in the middle or something like that let's click Submit and see what happens now you can see that Alex and Dale and now have not been recognized as starred or asterisks to our text so how how can we you know protect against this well what we want to do is we want to create a new variable called in user input a cooler LC standing for lower case and I'm going to say STR to lower this is a another function in PHP another string function its string to lower case and that is user input so now what we can do is say user input lower case rather than the user input itself and you will see if we refresh now you can see that these have been started out however we've been faced with the problem that now everything is lower case we've converted this whole sentence to lower case however we do have a solution for this and this is to completely change the function that we use now don't panic because it's not particularly hard so I'm going to get rid of this LC here and get rid of this lower case version here and we have to make one simple change and that is using the STR I replace function so now what we can do is we can take in input and everything that we use is now going to be case insensitive so let's just try and click Submit again now what you can see is that we've used an alux with a capital A a Billy with a small B and add a tail with a capital D however we've maintained the structure of our sentence with being the case that we've specified but we've also changed the words and the only thing we haven't done is maintain the capital D B and a on that but that that really doesn't matter I mean depending on the way your program works then it's not a massive issue and for this example it's not going to be a massive issue so that's basically we've introduced you to a new function STR I replace and also earlier the STR lower function as well so this is basically how to create a little sensor and with the functions that hopefully you've already learnt about if you haven't learned about these functions and you are confused at this point go back and have a look at the functions on their own and just try to determine how to use them before you start combining to create things like this
