hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another video for the new Boston now in this video we're going to be looking at checking whether file exists before we actually create it on our server now why would we want to do this in a real life application well let's say you had a file upload form and you were allowing users to upload specific files and maybe storing them in an area that they can be viewed through the public or your own personal use so you may be asking users to upload for example CVS or you may be asking them to upload images that contribute to part of a website so you're going to have have specific location or locations that you're going to store images in however if you're generating random say numbers for the for the image file names they could still match however random you create a number to be there's always the possibility that it could match so for example what we could do is create a file name on upload so if you haven't already looked at uploads go back and have a look at that before you probably focus on this tutorial because you know you need to understand how we use the move uploaded file function to rename our file once we've moved it from a temporary location your file name might be round number between say a thousand and 9999 and then you might have the md5 hash of the original file name so the file name might be called image JPEG so md5 hash file name say Oh Arthur original and then like let's say you might have another random number between a thousand and 9999 so the md5 hash is basically going to create a 32 character hash from this here so let's go ahead and echo out the file name and see what result we get first of all okay so this is the random filename that we may have generated to save on our on our on our server so let's say the user the first user uploads an image called image jpg everything's fine the image is stored however what happens if say a thousand users later someone else uploads in the mix could image jpg and this random number here and this random number here happen to equal the same as what's already been stored here and what's already been stored here so there's a way we can deal with this and we need to use the file exists function so we can check whether file exists before we perform an action so let's go and have a look at this function itself so the functions could file underscore exists this is how we call the function and the parameter that we give is the file name itself so for example I could say file exists file txt or image dot jpg etc etc etc so what I'm going to do is in this example I'm going to check whether specific file exists and if not I'm going to create a text file so we're not quite uploading images or documents at the moment but you can apply this example to your own own web application so let's go ahead and say if file exists I'm going to specify a file name in here we'll do that a bit later then what we're going to do is not create the file so in here we're not going to create the file otherwise we're going to create a file so the file is going to be called file.txt so what we need to do is we need to say if file exists file name echo file already exists and what's going to happen is this file exists function is going to return a true value if the file already exists and it's going to return a false value if the file does not exist so if the if this is returned true it means that this file txt is already present in our directory here in this file hand handling directory but we can obviously specify different directories so you may have a dir forward slash file for example the folder might be called dir so you can use directories within this file exists function as well so if the file does exist if this returns true we're going to echo to the user file already exists otherwise we're going to say handle equals F open if you haven't already looked at file handling have a look at this before you try to understand this code then we want to F open file name for writing we want to F right to handle and I'm just going to write nothing inside for example and then we want to close this file by its handle so what we've essentially done is we've checked this file file dot txt exists so if it doesn't really exist we're just going to say to the user file or it already exists so we're just going to give them a error message otherwise we're going to open up a file and this is saved in the variable handle and then we're going to write just the value of nothing to the file so we're just writing this text into the file and we write opening using the right so what this doesn't matter too much within this example however if you've already looked at creating files and writing data to files this should make sense to you so what we're going to do for this example is we are going to click on file dot PHP and then what we're going to do is we're going to go back and see if the files being created then we're going to go back into file dot PHP and we should receive a message saying the file really exists because what file dot PHP is doing is creating this file for us let's go ahead and click on file dot PHP so we've got blank so we can assume in this example that the order in this sum when we've run this page that the file has been created let's go back and refresh you can see that we've now got file txt and we've written the value of nothing to this now when we enter the file dot PHP for the second time what we're now doing is we're checking if the file really exist so if file dot txt really exists so now we can see if this function is properly working so what we already know that it's working because we've run the second block of the if statement let's go and check it anyway so it says file already exists so this is the file exists function in PHP really useful like I said when you're handling file uploads and you want to check if a file name already exists just to ensure that you don't overwrite
