all right hosta so in the last video what we did is we created our very first app and we named it music now whenever Django created this app it gave us a few files and a directory by default now before we go on to the kind of fun part of the story I just want to give you guys a brief overview of what all of these files are so like a real quick summary so migrations what migrations are are basically a way that you can hook up or connect your website all of your source code with your database now if you guys are like oh that sounds kind of tough and it's probably going to be annoying it is one of the easiest things ever and it's one of my favorite parts about Django you basically type one line real quick in the command prompt and it's hooked up it's awesome can't wait to show you guys in it that py we already know what that is it basically says hey Python you see this directory it's not just a normal directory it's actually a package so you know just something for Python and min so whenever they're creating Django they realize that almost every website in the world it has an admin section a section that you can go and like access that base and delete users and delete posts whatever you want to do so instead of having to make it yourself it already has that admin functionality so that's what this is and there's a lot more to it but that's basically what it is apps this file is just again there's a lot more to it but it's pretty much the configuration file or settings for this app and right now we don't have a lot of settings it says the name of it is music ah all right there we go so thank you Django for letting me know that alright so the next one is models so a model is basically a blueprint for your database so it's a template of how you are going to store data for this app so real quick let's go ahead and think about how we are going to do that what do we want to store what tables are we going to want in the music app well we're probably going to want one for like albums and each album is going to need like a title and maybe the artist and we're probably going to want another table to store maybe the individual songs so you know each song of course is going to have a title a length so on and so forth so later on we'll create two classes in here one class is just going to be albums in another class is going to be songs so that's basically the blueprint of how we're going to set up our database it's going to be fun and this one right here this test probably don't even need to explain this you can create a bunch of little tests to make sure that you don't have any bugs in your code and this views views are actually really easy views are just functions they're just Python functions and what they do is they take a user request and they give them back something now 95% of the time these are just going to request the webpage and you just give them a web page like you're looking at someone's profile they send you that HTML page you look at a video page they send you all those files whatever now other times it isn't that direct like maybe these are just wants to log out or download something so you would perform some action but basically views are just Python functions that take a request from the user and respond or get back a response in some kind of way so once we like create one single page all this is going to make sense if you guys are like oh my god there's so many files right now but let's go ahead and just figure out how to do something simple right now
