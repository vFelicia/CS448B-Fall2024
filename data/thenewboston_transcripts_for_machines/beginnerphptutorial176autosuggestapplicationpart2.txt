so let's go ahead and give this a name I'm going to call it results so we know exactly what we we're talking about so we've got this search form we've got this keyword field we're finding the match every time we press a key down and we're displaying that in results so we've named the um elements of our of our page correctly so we can sort of remember them a bit later on so like I said we've got this find match function that we need to create up here so let's go ahead and open up a script tag and then go and close our script tag and the type is obviously text forward slash JavaScript because Ajax is um JavaScript and XML okay so now what we're going to go and do is uh create our function name which we've called down here find maps so we can just start a new function oh in the wrong place there so we can start a new function called find match it's not going to take any parameters because uh this function is unique to this field so we don't need to take any parameters to say you know pop it somewhere or like we did in the uh the example where we um where we created our Ajax code last time we we put two arguments in to here to say what file to grab and also where to put the data so we don't need to do that because we can we can do that just for the purpose of this of this um this search but you're welcome to modify obviously the file match to suit your websites needs okay so the first thing we need to do is check for a request so we do uh we say if window dot XML HTTP request so remember the case sensitivity of this we've got Capital eight XML and H and a capital R here uh the um the code inside of here is going to be case sensitive so be very very very careful or your um program may not run correctly so uh we've got an if and then we're going to have it else there so this is just for different browser support but in this case we say XML HTTP is equal to uh new XML http request and then we put our parenthesis on here otherwise XML HTTP is equal to a new um ActiveX object so active X object and we feed in one argument which is Microsoft dot XML HTTP and capitals Okay so we've done that set our XML HTTP variable now what we want to do is we want to check for the state the ready state of our xml.http because we're going to be submitting data through to this so we need to check for that so what we do is we say XML HTTP and we say dot on ready state and then what what's happened is we're going to equal this to a function and we're going to have no parameters in this but the function is going to be inside of here so when um when we are ready to do this uh sorry this is already State Changed by the way uh just noticed that there so um on uh on on the state change of uh our XML HTTP um which is our h x amount HTTP request object we need to complete the function inside of these parentheses so the function is first of all we need to make a check so we need to check the ready State and the status of this so we need to say if XML HTTP dot ready status is equal to 4 and XML HTTP dot uh status sorry this is State and uh I'm confusing things so we've got ready State equals four and we've got the XML http.status is equal to 200 this is just to ensure that data is being returned if data isn't returned we don't need to carry out the following block inside here which is grabbing the element by ID which is the element that we're going to be putting the data into is our result div so what we're doing is we're saying document because we're speaking about the overall document and then we're saying get LM oh element by ID and we need to get the element by ID which let's go down here and check we have called this uh results so I should have known that because I did name them so I could remember them okay so we need to type in results in here and then what we need to do is we need to um say dot inner HTML and Dot inner HTML is basically HTML inside of this div so we're changing this so we're making that equal to um XML HTTP Dot and its response value or response text so the value of the text in response so X X8 XML http.responsetext okay so we're done with that for now now we need to come down and actually send this data so we need to test it first because we don't know if our our code Just Around Here works at the moment so the first thing we're going to do is XML HTTP and then we're going to say dot open and you will remember this from the last tutorial hopefully we've got three parameters the first one is the method so we're using get and we could go to be using this um into this tutorial as well now is the file so we've got up here we've got search.ink.php there's nothing in it at the moment so search Dot inc.php and the next is if you want to send this data asynchronously so we do so we're going to just type True by default it's true so you can leave it out but I always like to put it uh just in there now we say XML http.send and we're done so now what we can do is test this out
