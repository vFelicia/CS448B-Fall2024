so let's make the change to the last one oh no I've done that again when we take that array from there so it can be a bit fiddly when you're writing all on one line but you'll get used to it eventually so I've just missed that all right now okay so let's go back and refresh ok so we've solved the two visible problems that we have now let me just go ahead and register another user so say Craig password pass one two three I've got my database up here so I can I can click on my users and check how we're doing here so password pass one two three pass password oh no sorry pass one two three first name Craig now let's let's have a look in our database at the length of the surname so let's click on structure and see how many characters we have so we're storing this as a variable character data type with 40 characters maximum 40 characters so what happens if we would just say let's just say m 1 2 3 4 5 6 we'll do it another way we'll say ABCD efg that's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 EF sorry ABCD efg hijk 6 7 8 9 10 11 so we can get rid of okay so we've got 10 characters here and then the reason I'm doing it in as the alphabet is just so you can keep an eye on what's happening so let me copy and paste that 4 times or 3 more times so we've got three instances now of this now what happens or four instances of this we've got ABC up to j and ABC up to j and ABC up to j and then ABC up station we've got for lots of this this is 40 characters long so when we click register they see is going to be able to this is going to fit inside our surname field in our database however what happens if we let's say go back to our form and we copy and paste it in one more time now that's going to equal I've copied and pasted it in another time so we've got ABC up to J J J J up to J so we've got five instances of this same text so we've got 50 characters overall now let's click register you've registered so everything's appears to have worked correctly now let's go and browse our table and we'll come down we can see that out our use names being popped in now we need to I'm going to click on this so little edit button and I'm going to have a look at what's been stored here so we've got ABC up to J ABC up to J ABC up to J and ABC up to J now we've only stored 40 of the 50 characters we entered and the reason for this is our varchar' only allows for 40 characters as we've already looked at under the structure tab so what we need to do is when we're registering the user we need to look at checking up here we need to check how many characters each of these are not including the password because that's hash to a 32 character hash anyway using the md5 functions we don't need to worry about the password it's just the username first name is surname that we need to check and we do have one other issue with the database which is usernames if I was to now register a username let's say with the username Craig but with a small C this is going to be allowed by this is going to be allowed by our by our code the reason being is we're not we're not talking about I don't yeah we're not we're not we're not look at what we're looking at case sensitive comparison so if I was to register a user on here called Craig let's go back to the register page with a small say and Craig a more just pet I don't know Garrett okay Malcolm okay so now let's click register Oh No using Craig already exists maybe okay yeah maybe maybe I'm wrong in that sense then so we've got yeah okay so we don't need to worry about that so let's just focus on this maximum character amount we have so what we first are all going to do is edit our HTML form to only allow a maximum value to be submitted on the form and this isn't an entirely protect against inputting masses of data because we're only allowing in that within the HTML obviously someone could take your HTML page they could change this to your server so your your your domain and then the URL that registers locator and they could submit the data from you know a local PC their own PC so what we need to do is we need to change the these fields to have a max value first then we need to check the length in PHP as well so let's give it a property max length and for username let's just refer back to our database so we know exactly what we what the lengths we're dealing with so we've got 30 for the username 32 for the password like I said we don't need to worry about like the hashes more or less always going to be 32 characters and then 40 and 40 for the first image sir
