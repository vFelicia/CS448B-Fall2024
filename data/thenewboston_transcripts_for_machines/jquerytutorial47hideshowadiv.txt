hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this example video we are going to take a look at how to hide and show a div with some text inside of it and also then change the show and hide buttons simultaneously so let's go ahead and start to build up our message that we want to display and then we're gonna have a button or a link that's going to allow us to hide and show it so we're essentially toggling it okay so let's create our div I'm going to give this an ID of message just a generic name for the text that's going to be inside of it inside I am going to just paste in some example text some Latin text now the div ID I'm going to style in line which I've always said I don't recommend however for the purpose of this tutorial and just to make things quick I will just create a style inside of here so the first thing I'm going to do is just set a width I'm then going to set a border to this and that's gonna be one pixel solid and I'm gonna have it a sort of gray color and I'm also gonna set some padding so padding 10 pixels okay so let's preview that in our browser you can see that we've got some text inside of a div with just a light gray border okay so let's go over to our text editor and create the link above this div that's going to hide and show it so I'm just going to create a link here the link is going to be just a hash because we're not actually linking to anything but the idea of this is going to be show or hide show and then here the initial text that we're going to display will be hide so now if we preview that that's going to look like that so the idea that we want to come across is when we press hide this will actually hide this whole area here the bordered area and then this hide text will change to show and then when we click on show this will be shown once again and then again this will change to hide so it's really just a case of this link changing and this being shown or hidden and then shown again so let's go ahead and create our JavaScript file and I'm going to call this message Jas and I'm gonna include that in my page just under here so script type is text forward slash JavaScript and we'll include that by putting that in the source so Jas forward slash message Jas okay so now that we've done that we want to go ahead and actually edit our message gif file to handle the events based around this link so the first thing we want to do is actually toggle this hide and show button and what I mean by toggle is we've looked at in this series how to actually change something based on when we for example click on it so what I'm going to do is reference this button and that's called hide show and then I'm gonna say dot toggle so we're using the dot toggle or the toggle event handler now inside here we need two functions the first function is going to be what happens when this link is clicked for the first time and then the second function is going to be what happens when it is clicked again and we revert back to its original state so we're toggling between two different states so I'm going to create one function and it's block and then I'm going to separate this by a comma and create another function and this block now let's pull these blocks down so we can work with it a bit easier so now in here this is the first state so we'll call that state 1 and in here this is state 2 so when we click this button state 1 will happen then we when we click it again state 2 will happen when we click the link again it will revert back to the original state and it will switch between the two so what we actually want to do is we want to modify the text here hide to show instead so we can again reference hide show but this time we use the text function to change the text within this link so essentially what we're doing is we are changing this text here so we can specify that when it's clicked we want to show now in the second state we want to do exactly the same thing so we can just copy and paste this down here however we want it to display hired instead okay so let's go over to our browser and preview these changes so at the moment the button shows hide when I click on it it now shows show when I click on again it goes back to hide and this will just continue because we've used the toggle event handler okay so that's all well and good but now we actually need to hide this div now there are two ways that we could do it we could include it inside this buttons functionality or we can do it outside I'm going to do it outside for the purposes of this tutorial and then I'm going to show you the inside as well okay so we need an event handler for our message so we're referencing our message div and we're going to say dot actually no we don't we need to show you need to say hide show so hide show dot click okay and then this will in itself this is in itself an event handler we need a function inside of here that will do something every time we click this hide show button now what we can actually do in this case is we can reference the message div and actually just use the toggle function now the toggle function will work exactly the same as this event handler but it'll just hide and show this message div every time we click on the hide show link so when we click this link this will disappear then it will toggle back to it being reappeared so let's just check out how that works so at the moment we've got a hide button when we click on hide you can see that the div has been hidden when we cook show it's toggled back to its original state and it's now visible and we can continue to do this over and over again now obviously including this code here is entirely unnecessary what we could actually do is we could copy and paste this here and delete this here and we could actually place it inside of here so what's happening is when we click this a hide/show button the toggle event is triggered we hide the div inside of this bit here so we could hide the message and then exactly the same in here but we could show it so we've actually every time we've pressed the top at the hide/show link we change the text to show and we hide the message div when we press it again we hide it we give the detects the display of hide but we actually show the div so now if we refresh you can see that this works in exactly the same way so there's a variety of different ways you can actually create things like this however this basic functionality is extremely useful for any any anything you want to hide and show now this could apply to menu options for example you could have a tiered menu with subcategories so when you click on say the main category you'll show a list of subcategories you can then click on the main menu again to hide these it can be used for a control panel for example for a user if you have particular settings you wanted the user to change but you wanted to keep them all hidden and shown you can actually allow the user to show certain parts of the settings that they can change so I'm sure you've seen this example used on a wide variety of websites however the functionality behind it is actually quite basic so just by using this code we've enabled this div to be shown and what are the visibility to be hidden and shown and also change the text of the button using the text function as well
