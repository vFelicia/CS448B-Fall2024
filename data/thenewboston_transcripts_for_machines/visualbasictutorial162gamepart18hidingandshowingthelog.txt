and there's a way we can cheat in our game that I didn't notice before but you can just Spam the attack button and Popeye will just automatically win um which is kind of funny but we don't have to worry about that for now okay so now that we've done that let's just go ahead ahead and add one more thing so we'll come over here to form one. VB and we'll open the designer for it and let's add a button so we will just come over here to our toolbox and we'll add a button and we'll just drag it and make it the entire uh length of our form okay so now we need to go to the properties and we need this set the text to uh let's set it to hide log to begin with so so let's go ahead and hide the log and for the name we'll do button hide and show so let's double click on hide log so let's go ahead and create a boine so we'll come up here and we'll type private log shown as boine we'll set it equal to true to begin with okay so we'll just use an if statement so if log shown then what do we want to do so if it's equal to shown and they click it we're just going to go ahead and set button hide and show. text is going to be equal to show log so if it's shown and they click it it'll be saying hide um and then it'll change it to show log after it hides so what we need to do is type new log. hide sotion so now what we need to do is we need to create an else so else so if log shown is equal to false then we'll type new log. show and then button hide and show. text is going to be equal to hide log so let's go ahead and run this hopefully we won't get errors so you can see here um that our log has been loaded and since we changed the size of form one um we get a little error here um this is actually hidden behind there because we uh increased the length of this we'll just go ahead and ignore that for now if we click hide log it hides the log and it changes the text to show log we can show the log and looks like we looks like we need to um change the log shown so after we do that we need to stop debugging so after we set the text to show log what we need to do is change the Bim so log shown equals not log shown so this way we don't have to know what log shown is equal to we can just set it to the opposite of what it already is so if it's true um since it's true right here it'll be set equal to false so and then we'll just type log shown equals not log shown okay so we'll come back to form 1vb design and you can see that the uh size of our form is 356 so let's come back into form one. VB and for form one move instead of 328 we'll do 356 and then when the form loads we'll do 356 okay so now hopefully we won't have any errors let's go ahead and run this you can see that the logger is attached to the game and we can move it around now let's go ahead and hide the log you can see that the log disappears and then if we click show log the log shows back up and it gives us the option to hide it and you can see that the text changes each time we do this so we can hide and show the log so then let's go ahead and cheat some and make popy win and you can see that uh popy has one popey got in a whole bunch of attacks and the dragon only got one in so we'll go ahead and go ahead and type in this code if you already haven't and once you've done that move on to the next tutorial and I believe the next tutorial will be the last for the game
