our Focus today is identifying similar triangles and we're going to do that through this AA property so AA or angle angle is when you have two angles of one triangle congruent to two angles of another triangle and if this is true you can say therefore the triangles are similar so using AA we're going to do some examples so the directions are find the missing angles then state if the triangles are similar so first in order to find X we have to set these we have to add these together and set the total equal to 180 so if we add these two together we get x + 144 = 180 if we subtract that over we get X is equal to 36° so now we do the same thing over here y + 36 + 66 = 180 y+ 102 = 180 so y = 78 okay 78 so we know that y 78 so this angle is congruent with this angle we know X is equal to 36 and this angle over here is also equal to 36 so those two are congruent so therefore triangles are similar by angle angle and even though we know that that this and this is also congruent all we need to know is that two of these are congruent to prove by angle angle so the directions are the same we're going to do that with this new triangle so we know that this is a right angle and a right angle equals 90° this angle 90° so now we're going to use our interior angle properties and set the angles equal to 180 so if you add those get together you get 128 + a = 180 so a is equal to 50 2 so since we know that this is a right angle and this is a right angle that means that these two angles are congruent because all right angles are congruent to one another and we know that this is 52° and this is 52° so we can say therefore triangles are similar by angle angle but we're going to check this one just for some extra practice because it should be congruent to this one so b + 90 + 52 is equal to 180 B plus plus 142 2 = 180 if you subtract this over you get B = 38 so these are also congruent you don't have to know that to prove this you just need two angles but we just went ahead and checked them just for extra proof so we're going to so next lesson we're going to talk about other ways to prove triangles are similar so make sure you check that out
