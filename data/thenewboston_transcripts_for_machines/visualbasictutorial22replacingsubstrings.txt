hello YouTube Sam I'm here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at replacing parts of a string so let's go ahead and get started we're going to come over here to new project and once it opens our new project window we're going to select a console application and I'm just going to call mine replacing substrings and let me pull this up here a bit and then just go ahead and click okay and it should load our project okay so now that our project has loaded let me go ahead and zoom in here a bit okay so now that our project has loaded we're going to going to go ahead and create a new variable so we'll just call it my string and we're going to create a second variable and we're going to call it final string okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt the user to enter in any string so we're just going to type console. right line please enter a string now what we're going to do is going to get what they typed in so my string equals console. readline okay so after we get what they've typed in we're going to go ahead and remove part of that string or replace that part of that string with another string so we're going to type final string equals my string and then we're going to use dot to see what we can use for my string now you can see there's a whole bunch of stuff here we're going to type replace so now what we're going to do is going to go we're going to go through here and we will just type in the first argument a inside of quotes which is the old value the value that we want to replace and we're going to replace a with the new value so let's just do n and then finally we will write that out on the console and then we'll just do console.readline so it waits for us to input something before it closes and now we're going to start running this program it's going to say please enter a string so I type Sam um do dog cat Cow uh astronomy now if I press enter you can see that all of the A's were were replaced with an N so here we have Sam and you can see down here it's SN M the A and cat was replaced with an n and this is an astronomy instead of astronomy so we can also do this with something larger than just one character so if I type hello in here we can replace it with let's say goodbye so now if I type in something like hello um on live gamer it's going to replace it with goodbye on live gamer now if you don't type hello in your first string it's not going to replace it at all and I'll just show you that right here so if I just type the new boss in here it's just going to give me the new Boston back because it didn't find hello anywhere inside of that string so this is a pretty uh simple tutorial uh thanks for watching Once you guys have this um nailed down and you know how to do it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
