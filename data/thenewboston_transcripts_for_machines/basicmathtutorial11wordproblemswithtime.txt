this section is called figure the amount of time these are word problems first word problem says your friends that are riding his bike at 935 to get to your house it took them an hour and 15 minutes what time need to get to your house we can figure this out in two ways we can look at the clock put your hand on the nine the hour hand and the minute hand on the thirty five so it took them an hour and fifteen minutes so we take the hour hand one hour goes up advances one to the ten and the minute hand advances 15 5 10 15 so they should both be landing on the 10 to read this it says 10 50 and that's your answer to do without the clock you can just do strictly math so your friend started writing this bike at 935 took them 1 hour and 15 minutes all you have to do is add one to the hour it's 10 and add 15 to 35 5 + 5 is 10 carry the 1 3 4 5 at 10 50 and that is your answer so a second where parlament says you leave for the grocery store 545 and arrive back home at 730 p.m. it takes you 5 minutes to drive the grocery store and 5 minutes back how long did you spend shopping at the grocery store you see you put your big hand on the 5 big hand on the 5 or the hour hand and the minute hand on the 45 so that's a 545 you ride back home at 730 so you put the hour hand on the 7 and the minute hand on the 30 so you see the hour hand advanced 2 hours and the minute hand went back 15 minutes 2 hours 15 minutes is equivalent to this this to make it easier to do in your head so it took them one hour and 60 15 Bravo 5 put 10 10 minus 5 is 5 5 minus 4 is 4 so that's 1 hour and 45 minutes but you also have to take an account the five minutes taking to drive there and the five minutes taking back so 5 + 5 is 10 so you subtract the 10 so it took you one hour and 35 minutes of shop in the grocery store we can do this all without using the clock as well let me delete all this real quick so what you do is you put down the five forty five and the seven thirty you subtract the five 45 from the seven thirty let me just erase this real quick so you take 730 and you subtract 5 45 but senses aren't this is the 45 is greater than the 30 you have to equivalent the one hour in two minutes so you are able to do this so every 60 minutes equals 1 hour so 730 is equal to 690 so you subtract the 45 from the 90 bring down the 5 8 minus 4 is 4 and 1 so it's actually 1 hour and 45 minutes and you also have to subtract the 10 minutes it took you to get there and back so it's 1 hour and 35 minutes let's use a different example so your dad wanted to go to the 1210 movie it takes them 45 minutes again you
