and their user ID would then equal to now in this case we could then force this to be two so just sort of recreating a login system but doing it within one line now if we were to go back and refresh and I was to type in Billy Garrett and click save settings have been updated you saw the loading you should have seen the loading text to come up a bit just slightly then so you can you could see that this is obviously just depending on the service you know how it's running if I click browse now you can see that Billy Garrett has been changed to Billy Billy has been changed to Billy Guerra so obviously this variable here is dependent on the user that's currently logged in you know the system that you've have in place on your site however you can now start to see how effective this is with updating values depending on the which user has logged in now if you wanted to go ahead and say create a few of these fields I'm just going to go ahead and show you how easy this would be so we have name and then want to copy this and paste it down here and I'm gonna go ahead and type in let's say email now we won't again create any validation we'll just go ahead and update this value so we've got this email value here this email field here let's go ahead and press Enter you can see we've now got a name and email now I'm gonna go ahead and update my database table accordingly I'm gonna add a new field on the end called email the type we can set as 255 as a variable character we now have an email field on so at the moment Alex G and Billy Garrett don't have an email now we're currently logged in as Billy in quotation marks because we're not actually logged in so we're logged in as Billy Garrett currently we've set this to two so now we can go ahead and make the appropriate changes elsewhere to update these values as well so let's say you've added this email input field in here over in Ajax Jas all you'd need to do is go ahead and create a new variable here grabbing the email as well as the name so via email is now equal to e mail dot Val remember we renamed this here email as opposed to name what we then do is we would pass the email value as well as name so we we would create a comma here an email email so we're sending another variable called email was sent well we're sending two variables name and email the value of name is name from here and the value of email is email from here so now that we've done that we've successfully updated Ajax to j/s we come over to settings dot PHP and we need to also check if the email fit or post data is set so we create a comma because the it'ss is set in is set function in PHP takes multiple values so if the name and email are set we can go ahead and again it copy and paste this down and email email here so it's literally a matter of just duplicating for each field now we need to go ahead and update our query so we can go ahead and update users' set name equals name we've done that now we also want to update where I'm sorry set email equals email so now we have updated our users table we've set the name is equal to the name we've specified and the email is equal to the email we've specified where user ID blah blah blah like we've already discussed so now what's going to happen is we can not only update one at a time but update multiple fields at a time so at the moment we're logged in as Billy Garrett and we're logged in as the user ID so the name is Billy Garrett and the is nothing let's go ahead and test this out I'm gonna put the name as Billy and I'm going to set the email as Billy at PHP academy' the org when I click save settings have been updated so the query it successfully ran here this query ran successfully when we browse again you can see that the email has been updated and the names changed back to Billy so now I'm going to log back in as Alex log back in again in quotation marks because we're not actually logged in I'm gonna change the user ID to one and I'm gonna set the name to Alex and the email address accordingly so we change this here back to one assuming we've now logged in as a different person Alex and Alex are PHP academy' dog click Save you saw that it loading text now you've seen settings have been updated back to the database table and you can see that the name and email now correspond to the two values that we put into these fields here so using this system is extremely easy and quick and it's also easy to change or update for the fields that you want to you know add into the initial form here so you can add as many fields as you like with as much data clicking save will show your loading button and then will tell you if your settings have been updated or not just one quick thing before we leave if I was to for example try and mess up this query so I'll just put up DTE instead of update when we now go ahead to try and save it says there was an error updating your settings so we are rich you know we're receiving this error message appropriately because our query has failed so that's updating database table values based on a form using jQuery
