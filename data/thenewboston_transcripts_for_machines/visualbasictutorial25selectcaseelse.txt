hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking another look at the select case statement so this time instead of using an integer we're going to use a string so we're going to start off by creating a string so dim my string as string so that equaling now what we're going to do is we're going to get my string from the user so we're just going to ask them to enter a string and then my string is going to be equal to console dot read line and now what we're going to do is we're going to start our select case statement so select case my string we're going to do a case hello and we'll just do console dot write line goodbye and we'll do two more cases from your case goodbye then console dot write line hello and now we're going to do a case um let's just do fishing and then we'll do console dot write line boat okay so now if we run this it's going to close out right before it's done so we got to add console dot readline now in some of my very first tutorials I said that this will let you read the line or the the program before it closes out and that is true but what it actually really does is that it waits for you to press Enter so whatever you type in there in the line that it's reading it's going to move on to the next statement once you press ENTER so if you press nothing and press Enter then it's going to go ahead and in our case exit the program because there's nothing after this let's go ahead and run this and if we type fishing is going to say boat but we have one problem problem with this if we type fishing with a capital F it's not going to give us anything so what we need to do is make this case insensitive so to do this we're just going to type my string dot to lower and we need to make sure that all of our strings inside of our cases are lowercase and you can see that they are we have hello goodbye and fishing and they're all lowercase so now if we run this we can type fishing in any way we want it's going to give us boat back now one other thing we need to cover is what happens if I type in something that's not in our Select case statement such as dog it's not going to return anything so to deal with this we're going to use what's called case Alice and this is very similar to the else in the ifelse statement it's going to cover anything that you have in your cases so if my string to lower is equal to anything other than hello goodbye or fishing then it's going to go ahead and we'll have it right console dot write line I don't know what you're talking about so now if we run this we can type in anything in here and it'll say I don't know what you're talking about so this is a very fairly simple tutorial but the stuff I talk to you and this is very useful and go ahead and practice some select case statements once you have that nailed down go ahead go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
