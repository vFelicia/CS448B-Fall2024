oh hey guys what's up welcome to your eleventh tutorial and in this tutorial I'm just going I'm not going to do this whole tutorial in song maybe maybe another tutorial but I'm not really in the mood this time so anyways and this is Toro what I'm going to be teaching you guys is how to use functions that require multiple parameters so let me give you guys a quick example of function that might require multiple parameters if you were making a calculator and you wanted the user to enter two numbers well it did it doesn't exactly know what those numbers are yet so we go ahead and we use these numbers as parameters and functions so as you can see instead of just a single piece of information it might need two numbers or eight numbers or 20 numbers so in order to use multiple parameters in a single function let me show you guys how to do that so let's go ahead and make that program right now that just goes in adds two numbers together well we can't use void because right now it is making calculation it's going to calculate two numbers find the sum of them and return to the return to us the answer so let's go ahead and say all right since what you're going to be returning to us is an integer go ahead and type int and now what am I going to name my function add numbers simple easy pretty clear so now we go ahead and make our parameter list and body list here's what I do before I add in my parameters I don't know why but you know I just do it so what we want to do is we already know that we can use one parameter by going setting the datatype and giving it a variable name cinches int X well we know that this function is going to need two numbers we already did one so how do we say we want to use another number as well well anytime you use more than one parameter you have to separate it with a comma and then you give it another piece of information that's going to need so it's going to need two numbers one is going to be called X and is going to be called why so let's go ahead and now we have a function that takes two extra pieces of information so we're going to be getting it to integers x and y so now let's go ahead and use those numbers somehow so what we're going to be doing is let's go ahead and make another variable called answer and this is just equal to the values of X plus y so say that the user passed in two numbers on five and six well what we're going to do now is say all right five equals x six equals y so answer equals eleven so once we have that answer calculated all we need to do now is we need to return it and this pretty much means give it back so in order to return anything you just go ahead and write return and then what you want to return well just return the answer so a return value is basically once you make your calculation the final calculation that's what they get back so in main we return zero because computer programs know whenever you get zero back this means that your computer program ran successfully well for this one we want to return the answer because that means that we calculate the answer so that's where we're going to return back so now when we're using our function we can just go ahead and print out that value using C out and then go ahead and write add numbers and then go ahead and write whatever numbers you want to add and just like before whenever we were creating our function we had to separate these variables with a comma whenever we're using on this function later on in our main program we separate the values we're passing it in with a comma as well so 43 is going to be equal to X and 86 is going to be equal to Y so let's go ahead and go and run this and check it out 129 pretty cool huh so what happened is this we said all right we want to print out the return value of this right here so we can't just go ahead and do this because this is going to go ahead and calculate it but it's not going to print anything out on the screen so actually made that calculation but nothing's printing out so in order to print that out that's why we need that see out to print out the return value of this so anyways what we did is we said this all right we want to use this add numbers function right here but it needs two integers in order to work and needs a x and a y so we said all right you want two integers you got it you got a fortythree and an 86 let's make some magic happen baby so it took that 43 plug the end for X and 86 plug the end for Y and it's stored that value or excuse me to store the sum of the calculation in a variable called answer and the answer was like I don't know what it was but it took the answer and it returned it back to you so says all right this is basically equal to 129 so this right here is pretty much just a different way of saying 129 so I'm going to print out 129 and that is how you use functions with multiple parameters for example if you wanted to add four numbers together it would be the same thing in X&Y and it's a and B and then you just go ahead and use those values just like before so plus a plus B and then later on when you needed more information 3243 again why I'm doing this I just want to show you guys that you're not only limited to two parameters you can have as many parameters as you want you just have to remember to separate them all with a comma so whether it's 2 3 or 100 remember to separate them all with the comma in here and also when you're actually using the function out here so now you understand the basics of what a function is and how to use multiple parameters single parameters you're pretty much a pro with functions now so once you understand this you're ready to move on to my next so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys later
