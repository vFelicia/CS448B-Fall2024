what's going on guys is Bucky and welcome to your 12th C++ tutorial and you're like all right WTF where is the code well before I get to the story I want to show you guys this right here some chick Believe It or Not posted this picture on my forum today and I thought it was hilarious so I thought I'd share it with you guys um if you understand the joke behind this then you're going to think it's hilarious and if you don't quite understand it yet then you probably will in a few years but anyways there you go guys again like I said some people are going to understand it some people are not so if you do enjoy anyways back to the tutorial in this tutorial we're going to be covering a new type of data in for once it actually is not a type of number so unless couture really covered in floats doubles pretty much all different types of numbers but let's get into something a little bit more interesting I'm talking about letters words sentences something that's going to be very useful because when we build programs we're going to be one and get the users name and address these I'll take letters we'll save the numbers for important stuff like the most important thing of all their credit card number but anyways for now let's concentrate on letters words sentences trust me it's going to be awesome so let me take a deep breath in head out alright now whenever we're working with the letters we need to use a special type of data and this CH AR it stands for character and this can go from anywhere from one character to like T to an entire paragraph so care or char some people call it is the type of data when working with characters now in this story I'm going to show you guys you know not just one character how you can store but multiple characters in since each individual letter is its own type of data what can we use to tie a bunch of these types together excuse me not types but a bunch of four pieces data what have we learned the time all together yes if you guessed an array you are correct so let's go ahead and make an array called tuna and set it equal to the value of five so now we have an array called tuna which pretty much stores multiple variables and we set it equal to the type of char or care I'm probably going to say char this means we can store five variables actually I just got an idea that means we can store six characters in the array called tuna so let's go ahead and instantiate it with means create it this way so let me think of something that takes six characters B yeah nothing exciting I know you see okay why you never say all right six characters one two three four five all right Bucky your name is only five characters that was a horrible example well it wasn't quite because I have one more character for you that goes at the end and that's backslash zero and then let me explain this before I even go any further whenever your compiler is working with arrays or excuse me an array of characters the last character you need to put in is backslash zero for some reason whoever built the compiler they pretty much told their compiler all right print out all the characters of an array until you get to this special character named backslash zero this is pretty much our stop sign for our compiler and this is our way of telling the compiler all right stop what you're doing this isn't included it's pretty much of our way of telling you to stop so let's go ahead and print this out right now see out tuna and hopefully it says Bucky and it doesn't print that zero at the end because again that's not part of the array itself it pretty much is just a stop sign so your compiler only sees Bucky and then it stops so now you know that is actually not a character and this well I just told you guys like eight times hopefully stuck in your head by now now if you're saying alright Bucky that is the dumbest thing ever well first of all don't blame me I didn't make the compiler second of all you are in luck because I have an even better way of creating an array so let's go ahead and say we wanted to create an array of characters but we want it a little bit easier way to do it well let's go ahead and make another area called bacon and go ahead to set it equal to blank square brackets and if you remember the square brackets we usually write how long the array is or how many bytes is going to take in that square bracket but whenever we set it equal to an empty bracket and set it equal to some text like bacon mmm good something like that what's going to happen is this we don't have to give our array an explicit number what an array is going to do is automatically count the character space is included and it's going to build itself never say an R type lucky last time you told me that we need to end everything with backslash 0 so I'm guessing we need to end this one with the backslash 0 as well well check this out whenever we build an array like this whenever we build it our compiler automatically throws in that backslash 0 so this is pretty much the way I create and erase so why did I even show you guys that old way to create a what urn array with a explicit number and a backslash 0 well we're going to come across that later on and I want you guys not to be confused when we do but anyways for the most of our how should I say this for our programs in future I'm going to be creating array like this a character array anyhow so let's go ahead and print this out see out and just go ahead and print out bacon and hopefully we don't get any errors so anyways you see a successful build as well so we can do things the first way or the second way they both give us successful build sometimes the first way is better sometimes the second way is better depending on what kind of programs you're building but anyways I'll be showing you these different types of programs later on just want to cover the basics right now and while I have actually three minutes if I thought that was going to take up most of my time I'll show you guys one other cool thing that you can do with the race that is actually really useful let's go ahead and see out actually let's go ahead and just do it right here see how STR le N and now go ahead and type in the name of your array right here that was in it bacon and let's go ahead and run this and see what we get the number 15 pretty cool huh know what it means probably not Str le n is the function that you pass in an array is a parameter and it counts how many characters are in that array so check this out 1 2 3 4 5 your spaces countless characters 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 so anytime you want to count how many characters are in a character array this is a real quick and easy way to learn how to do so by anyways that isn't even part of the story I just had some time left over so I thought I'd show you guys how to do that and now whenever we do STR Lent which stands for a string length by the way and up comes Orioles I don't have to cover it so you know double whammy so that is why what I wanted to cover today the basics of how to create an ik Erik Tura ray and two different ways of how you can do so and also a bonus STR LAN so anyways I hope you guys enjoyed this story in the next sort I'm going to be building a program to take all these concepts and tie together into an actual useful and program that you can actually apply in real life so anyways I will leave you guys with this awesome image of well I think some of you guys know it is I don't think I have to explain this but anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys later
