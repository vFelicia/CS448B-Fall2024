hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this example application we're going to be creating a form field that allows the user to enter a username which is then checked against the database values in the users table so over in my database if we just go over here you can see I've created a database the database called jQuery and I have a table called users I've got some randomly generated usernames based on names and numbers and there's sixty thousand seven hundred and sixty eight of these so we have a lot of data here now our goal in this tutorial is to create a dynamic username checker which checks a user name as the user is typing it and tells them if it's available so essentially essentially we're looking through a large group of data and we're going to show a very brief loading sign or a loading text as it's searching let's just say we had a million records in a table or in fact we had let's say you know this amount of large text we could go ahead and you can go ahead and implement this into other uses for example a search engine or something similar so our basis of this is searching this table diner what using an AJAX call their post HTTP request to check if a username is available so this is our document I currently have nothing on the page let's just take a look at the files that we're going to be using now users jeaious i've included on my page and this is going to be the essentially the basis of our application we're going to have a check here that will check on a KeyUp event for the username in the database it's going to send an HTTP request to this username check file just here and this username check file is going to return whether the username is available or not DB dot PHP is just going to connect to our database so inside index dot PHP let's go ahead and set this up first thing we want to do is create a form field so this is a text input type and we're going to give this an ID of username now I'm going to place a span next to this with a relative ID and this is going to be username status now what's going to happen is as we start typing into this text field here let's just go and preview it in our browser as we start typing into here our span is gonna first of all show a short loading symbol or you could incorporate an image into this then what's going to happen is we are going to display whether the username or is available or not inside of this span and that's going to be handled by users yes and obviously like I've already said it's gonna call username check to actually perform the background serverside processing in PHP so the first thing we want to do is check that a key has been pressed down in here or key has been pressed down and has come up so for example that would be a key press or key down but the keys also come up so we're checking it on key up just so we can return an absolute value so we'll go ahead and do that we need to use a selector to select this user name ID so we use hash username then we say dot key up so we've created the event handler just here and inside there we want to create a function and this function is going to run when a key is up so we can test this by just saying alert and it just say key up for example let's go over to our browser when I type a key down as the my key comes up we have this alert box to alert us that an event has happened as well as a backspace as well that will show the same thing so now that we've done that we can go ahead and the first thing we want to do is grab the user name from this field so the field is called user name we've given out an ID of user name so we can use the same selector or we could use the dot Val which would be a lot more efficient and appropriate and then I'm gonna go ahead and alert username so user name variable in JavaScript will now contain the value of this username field here which is the field on our page here so now that we've done that we're alerting out the username let's go ahead and test that out I'm going to type a you can see that relaid a back to us I'm going to type L that's relate that back to us so we're getting an absolute value of anything we type into here and let's just get rid of that okay so now that we've done this we need to go ahead and change the username status span to loading and then immediately after that we're going to use the post HTTP request to check this username check file and we're going to be connecting to the databases as well so we're going to go ahead and change the username status span and we're going to change the text of this to searching now this will only be briefly shown however like I mentioned earlier if you had a lot more records than this or you had some large text it may take a little while longer sites such as Twitter use a check similar to this and obviously it takes a lot longer despite them having millions of users it takes slightly longer to actually check whether the username is available
