so today we're going to go over the other angles formed by parallel lines and their relationships to one another so when two or more parallel lines but is these two lines right here are cut by a transversal which there's one transversal here and when transversal here their alternate interior angles are congruent and alternate exterior angles are congruent so if you remember what an alternate interior angle is it's just those angles that when you pair them up they form a Z right here their alternate because they alternate what side and what part of the line there on and now we know that they're congruent so I can say that the measure of angle one is 87 I can do the same thing this way draw my alternate interior angles with angle 2 and this angle right here so that means that angle too is 93 degrees and I can't do that over here because I don't know what these are what these measures are but I can use the other part of this and say that alternate exterior angles are congruent because this and is important because both of these are congruent so we start with angle 3 and I draw my land line down go on to the other side so that means that 3 has to equal 85 degrees and I do it the other way starting with 95 going down to 4 that means the measure of angle for has to be 95 degrees because I know these angles are congruent so using those two rules we're going to find the missing measurements of this quadrilateral so I know this line will call this ad is parallel to B C and we know that ad is parallel to DC or a be sorry so I want to find the measure of angle 1 well if you look at this BD is the transversal that cuts these two parallel lines and a half so that means that the alternate interior angles of these two lines are congruent so if we start along this first line come down the transversal go over this other parallel line because both of both sets of parallel lines are cut by this transversal I know that a measure of angle one has to be 38 degrees and if I look at these two parallel lines this time instead of these two they're also cut by this transversal BD so I'm going to start because I know their alternate interior angles are congruent so I'm going to start with this first parallel line come down the transversal BD and go over to this pair line and that means angle 2 has to be 86 degrees because they have their congruent which means they have equal measures so we have one more example we're going to do so find the missing measurements so this is what we need to find so the first thing we're going to do is find out what this what this measure angle equals because then I can use my supplementary my knowledge of supplementary angles to find out what the measure of angle 23 is okay so i can find this out because i know that these two lines are parallel they're cut by this transversal so that their alternate interior angles are congruent so I mean this has to be 65 degrees as well so now that I know what that ain't gold equals I can use my supplementary not my knowledge of some supplementary angles set 23 this is angle 23 not the number 23 plus fit plus 65 equals 180 if i subtract the 65 / i get angle 23 equals 115 okay so if you notice these marks right here this means that these two angles are congruent so this has to equal 65 as well and if you look this angle and this angle are also supplementary so we're going to do the same thing to 25 angle 25 + 65 equals 180 so angle 25 also has to equal 115 degrees so out round 1 115 degrees so last if I look at these two parallel lines here they're cut by this transversal so that means that they are alternate interior angles are congruent so if I start here on this parallel line come down the transversal and go across I know that 6 that 24 has to equal 65 degrees so that's it for parallel lines but make sure you come back and check out the videos on polygons next
