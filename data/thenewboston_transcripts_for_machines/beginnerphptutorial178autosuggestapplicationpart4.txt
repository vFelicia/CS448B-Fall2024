okay so now what we're doing is we're we're checking for a connection to our um MySQL server then we're checking for our database so just for now I'm going to Echo out okay so let's go back and check if this is working I'm going to just start typing something in here and you can see that okay is displayed so that's absolutely fine we are connecting to our database and our um our server and our database correctly so now what we need to think about is the query that we're going to perform on our table so let's just go in go go in here and I'll explain a bit about the query we're going to be using the like keyword which is inside uh our SQL uh query and like is going to take is going to use um a percentage sign to say do we want to check if it's like from the left and the right hand side so it could be let's say we could type A into the search text now Alex Garrett has an A in Dale Garrett has a couple of A's in Billy Garrett has an A in Craig Malcolm has an A in and so do all the other records so therefore these would all be returned now let me just show you what that looks like that looks like like and then a so in other words uh search text so if search text equals a our query is going to look a bit like this obviously there's going to be more to the query because we we're creating a full query um but we would retrieve all results because all results have an A somewhere in it if we were to do this this means search text from the start and then anything afterwards so what we're doing now is oh we don't want to save that what we're doing now is is we're searching uh for a and then we could say a l e so we're searching Al e than anything else oh I don't want to save that again so um so yeah this is the way we're going to do it we're not going to use a percentage sign at the end of each one um but we are going to use one at the end to correctly display our search results because we don't want to be searching you know with keywords inside of of our words if that makes sense if not you'll uh understand a bit later and there is another tutorial on this that I've created so you can go and have a look at the like um the like keyword so let's start creating our query let's go ahead straight start creating it I'm going to say select and what do I want to select from the database I want to select the name so if we go into our database we've got the name here so I want to select the name and we're selecting from and the table is names so let's go back into our database and have a look at that we've got names there um and then what we're doing is we're saying where name oh where name like remember I said now usually you do this if you want this if you want to search for a key keyword inside here but what we're doing is we're just saying like and we're specifying the search text and then the uh percentage sign afterwards so we're searching for anything in the front uh well we're searching for a specific in the front so Al would produce Alex Garrett and Alex Malcolm um and then anything after that otherwise it would just be an exact match so we uh create this as a wild card it's called a wild card so we need to think about Security in here as well so Let's Escape that there um and Rec concatenate that on there and we need to oh no sorry let's get rid of that and put that back in there okay so now what we need to do is we need to say MySQL real Escape string I do have some videos on SQL injection that you should have a look at if you don't understand what this function does it basically protects protects against SQL injection um by escaping certain characters inside of this string uh now we can actually run the query so query run equals MySQL Query and we've just simply run that query so now what we can do is we well what we need to do is we need to return a list of all names retrieved from this statement so if I type A there will be let's go and count there'll be one two there'll be two names retrieved cuz if we start with an a anything after that um is a wild card so we've got a for Alex Garrett and a for Alex Malcolm if we type Al e x for example these two will still be returned if we type Al X space g then only this record will be returned because we're matching this part and the rest of it is a wild card so hopefully now that makes sense if you didn't understand before so we need to use a wall loop as we've done in some of my previous tutorials we've looked at um creating an array from our query from the results so I'm going to say while query equals MySQL fetch associative now what this function here is going to do is fetch an associative array from the uh Records that we've returned from this query and we specify the query inside of it just like that so now what we can do is we can access each element of The Returned results so I can say just print out the name uh obviously we're not selecting the ID from the uh table here so we're just going to have access to this name so let's Echo out name equals so we're just basically setting the variable called name here so name equals query row remember we've set the array as this variable here so we're using Square parenthesis as an array and then we can just type in name there because it's an associative array so this value here of name will match our field in there so hopefully that makes sense as well and we're going to append a break on it cuz we want it to look nice when we uh displaying it as the user is typing otherwise they're all going to be in line okay so that's about it let's go back to our page and uh refresh so I'm going to start typing a character I'm going to type a hopefully I actually get something back no odd let's go back and have a look at what we might have done wrong okay yeah we're not actually outputting anything that would help um so yeah I've I've I've assigned um the value of the name from the data based to this variable name and we can simply stick echo in front of that and that will just display it out to us
