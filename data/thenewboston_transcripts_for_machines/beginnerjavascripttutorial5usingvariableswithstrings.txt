what is up guys welcome back to your fifth JavaScript tutorial and in this story I mean teaching you guys how to use variables with the string of text in your program so it's going to be awesome and it's actually really helpful in understanding how these programs work and trust me you're going to use this a lot whenever your program in JavaScript so let's go ahead and uh well enough of me talking let's go ahead and get started so the first thing that we need is two variables go ahead and make a variable called name and just set it equal to of course whatever your name is Bucky and go ahead and make another variable called like age or something and set this equal to your age I'm 24 so of course I'm going to set mine it's 24 so we already know that we can use document dot write to basically write things out on the screen so we can either write name and if we go ahead and print this out it says Bucky or we could have went ahead and printed out age and it will print out 24 but what if we wanted to include this within a bigger string of text well in order to do that you need to use the addition operator aka the plus sign and you write the addition and this sticks it to whatever string of text you're trying to type out so for example it says Bucky um is my name so go ahead and it's going to treat this as the word Bucky and it's going to add it with this string so let's go ahead and just see it now says Bucky is my name simple enough so anyways whenever you want to write a variable inside a string of text you just can't you know write something like this you just can't go ahead and write name is my name or else check it out it's going to say your name is my name if you want to treat that as the variable you need to put it outside the quotation marks and you need to stick it together with that plus sign and then it works perfectly and not only can you do this before but say you want to write something after like Bucky is my name and my age is plus h so again not only can you do this before your text but you can also do it after and check it out Bucky is my name and my age is 24 so easy enough that is how you use variables alongside strings of text whenever you're trying to write out stuff so let's go ahead and delete all this and let me um let's go ahead and make some new variables let's go ahead and make a very my own name tuna and set this equal to I am a fish and then go ahead another make another variable called bacon and set this equal to Baconator and then go ahead and add one more called mmm only got like two things why don't I think a tuna and bacon table time any time I make a variable I made like a thousand Sorrells and I swear I only made like two variables tuna bacon and ham so heck it might as well include ham and set this equal to am burglar make sure it's spelled around or else it won't work so anyways we have three variables right now and we already know that we can stick them on a string of text but what you didn't know or maybe you did is that you can also stick them alongside one another so tuna bacon plus ham and whenever we try to print this out it's going to give us I'm a fish Baconator Hamburglar so let's go ahead and see that I'm a fish Baconator hamburger you know it doesn't make any sense at all and I probably should pick something that did make sense but hey this is just an example who the heck cares so anyways that's what I wanted to teach you guys in this tutorial about that addition sign and whenever you're working with variables or strings of text you need to include that addition sign or else it's not going to work so again that's all I want to teach you guys for this tutorial in the next tutorial we're going to be diving a little deeper and in JavaScript and going over some more advanced topics but trust me they're going to be easy to follow along with and just stick with me in no time you'll be a JavaScript pro so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget if you have any questions just go to my forum the New Boston comm slash forum and if I don't answer them for you someone else will so thank guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys later
