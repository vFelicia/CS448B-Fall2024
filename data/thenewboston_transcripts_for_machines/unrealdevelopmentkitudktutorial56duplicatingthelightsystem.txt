alright guys welcome to your 56 the UDK tutorial and check it out we already have a pretty cool level where we can go ahead and go up to the light and shoot it out and it looks like it blows it out but what if we wanted to build a big level and have a bunch of these lights well let's go ahead and figure that out right now so the very first thing that we could do is I'm actually going to be putting more lights on this wall so I'm going to go ahead and expand this wall a little bit by X I'm just scroll out and move it over a little bit looking pretty good so now what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be duplicating these lights so I'm going to be you know selecting all of these things and I don't want this wall to get in the way so if i go ahead and select this wall and hit this button hide selected it's going to hide out my wall and it's going to allow me to select these things a little bit easier so now i can go ahead in my side view and hold ctrl alt and select all that crap right there and if i hold alt in drag it's going to be able to duplicate them a whole lot easier without selecting that wall so now actually what i can do is go ahead and press this button show all and it can bring my wall back because I just didn't want to accidentally select my wall whenever I was duplicating that so now you're saying all right you do paid your light should be good to go so let's go ahead and test this out hit play from here run up to this one perfect shot that out run up this one hmm doesn't seem Lee we work in here so what exactly is the problem well the thing is whenever you duplicate objects using that technique it duplicates the objects in the perspective view but it doesn't duplicate the kismet see for example we only have this first lights system set up so we need to go ahead and change that right now so go ahead and hit ctrl alt and select your entire lighting system so now what you want to do is hold ctrl C to cut and V to paste and now you can just go ahead and move that over it actually is pretty good if you move keep this one on the left and this one on the right since then you can tell what while use on your left and what light is on your right however check this out right now if you look at the event it says enter back through 10 enter Pachter 10 all right this is 10 this is 10 so this isn't a system that's set up for this light right here these are pretty much as to kismet systems and they're both set up referring to this light right here so we go ahead and play our level whenever you shoot our light okay it doesn't seem to be really working so let's go ahead and fix that the first thing I want to do is rebuild my lighting because it is just annoying me and let me think of a cool story to tell you guys that take up five seconds I'm sorry I got nothing so yeah I'm just going to wait here awkward that was awkward so now let me go ahead and rebuild the system so the very first thing we want to do is we already have this kismet setup now let's go ahead and change this so let me go ahead and select this and as you notice this is the bus that out light right here that we're selecting so go ahead and select your busted light and open kids met and here is a system to the right that we want to alter so the very first thing we want to do is actually it's probably easier to do this go ahead and select your busted light and hit hide this now whenever we high that the glowing light is going to show so if we go ahead and select that glowing light which is the first light the light that takes the damage we can go ahead and rightclick this event right here and we want to assign interp actor to two events now check it out instead of interp actor ten taking damage now this inter bacter to which is this one takes the damage so basically with that light selected we also want to go over here to the lit up light and right click it and put a sign enter pachter 22 object variables so basically what we're doing is this system over here references this light over here and we're changing this system over here to reference this stuff over here so now what we want to do is I guess we can go ahead and select our spotlight in our perspective view and in kismet right click and hit a sign spotlight talkable 22 this variable and the last thing we want to do is we want to assign that busted light to this system so if we go ahead and show all again we get our busted light back so now select your busted light right click it and hit assign busted light to this object so now we have two custom systems the first system right here is referring to this first light over here and now the second system right here is referring to this entire system right here what's the light spotlight and all so now let me go ahead and scroll out of that and now I'll go ahead and right click and play from here and we'll see how it works so our first system whenever we shoot it it shuts off perfectly it doesn't affect this system at all and now this system whenever we shoot it it shuts off perfectly and everything is working beautifully so I just want to go over a couple points um before I let you guys go first of all whenever you copy objects that have kismet applied to them it only copies the visible object it doesn't copy the coding or the kismet behind the scenes and also whenever you want to assign a new variable to pretty much the same system pretty much to replace an object in the system I need to do is select the object in your perspective view right click it and assign it a new object or a new event so it's as easy as that so if you guys are just trying to you know copy your system and it wasn't working then that was probably why so that's all you get for this tutorial thank you guys for
