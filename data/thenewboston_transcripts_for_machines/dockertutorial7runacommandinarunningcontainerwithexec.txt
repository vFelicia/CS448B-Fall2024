all righty guys welcome back to another video and in this one i'm going to show you guys how to run a command in an already running container okay sounds like inception kinda why would we want to do this well imagine that we have a service like redis running on our computer now let's just go ahead and start with this right now so docker container uh will run a redis container right now so i already have it downloaded from docker hub it may take a little bit longer for you but whenever you have a redis container running just keep it running in this tab and pop open a new tab because this is how it would work in a real daily workflow so you want to keep this redis service running but maybe in a separate process you want to run the red cli so you can you know connect to it configure something about redis debug it all while redis is actually running in a separate process so now that we have that running in the background let me just go ahead and run docker container lsa and that is because we're going to need a reference to this redis container's id right here so go ahead and copy that and now that we have read us running ready to tap into it so how do we do this well if we run docker container ex ec what this allows us to do is it allows us to run a command inside an existing container so if you imagine this like a server we're basically sshing into this server so we can run an additional command that is going to be the redis cli so ex ec now after this we're going to pass in the i t flags this is essentially going to say that whenever you run this command we want to be able to interact with it and provide input so that's what that flag means and after this we're just gonna paste in the container id of the container that we're trying to connect to now in this container the last thing before you hit enter is what is the name of the program that you're trying to run and ours is just called the redis cli so again what this is going to do is it's going to run the redis cli directly inside this container so i'm going to hit enter and look at this we get our nice little interactive prompt where we can now interact with redis using the redis cli so just to show you guys that it does work i'll just pass in help yep nothing bugged out and for the redis ai if you hit exit then it exits it all right so now we're back to basics now just to demonstrate real quick the impact that that it flag has is if we run this exact same command again the container id didn't change but we just exclude that it flag i just deleted it i'm gonna hit enter now okay so this reddit cli does run because that's what we instructed it to do but as you can see it just exits right away because we don't have anywhere to you know interact or input text or anything now another interesting thing is anytime you just want to shell into a container like straight up ssh style what you can do is you can use that i t flag again remember anytime you want to interact that's what we do now instead of redis cli we can just pass in sh program and there we go now we just get a simple prompt where we can you know cd ls yada yada all your fun stuff now to exit from this you can either hit command d on a mac or you can type exit and there you go now the last thing i want to point out and this has nothing to do with exec i just don't know where else in this tutorial series to talk about it but that is anytime you want to start a container with shell right away then what you can do is you can run docker container run and include the it flag so you can interact with it via your terminal and we'll just use busybox since we know that this image which we're going to be creating a container out of it does include all those unix commands and after this you can put the default command of sh right away so whenever you create this container and run it then you get your command prompt right away of course you can do ls la all that fun stuff and uh wow home this is what docker views me as just some nobody wow docker it uh that one stinks okay so let's just exit out of here and uh yeah since docker threw me into kind of a depression there i think i'll end on that video and uh go think about life a little bit so anyways thank you guys for watching and i'll see you next time
