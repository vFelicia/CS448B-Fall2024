alrighty y'all welcome to the very first video on loopering and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about what loop ring is what you can build with it and we'll also be talking about what layer 1 and layer 2 mean and the differences between them however before we get into all that good stuff i do want to point out that is a prerequisite for understanding a lot of the content in this course you are going to have to have some basic ethereum knowledge and if you don't then i did make an ethereum tutorial series so feel free to check that out but as long as you understand the basics meaning what an account is what a smart contract is what a transaction is really if you understand that then you're going to be good to go so first let's go ahead and figure out what layer 1 and layer 2 even means so when we talk about layer one what we're talking about is this main block chain right here in other words it's just the main ethereum network now layer two got a little diagram for that layer 2 is a secondary system that lives outside of the main layer 1 ethereum network now i use the term system kind of vaguely because layer 2 not only refers to the actual computer network but also the rules and logic that dictate how these two systems communicate and interact with one another all right sounds pretty interesting but then again we still haven't talked about what is the point of a layer two well layer two technologies help the main ethereum network process more transactions per second and also at a much lower cost alright so that sounds pretty cool so how exactly does this work well the idea is that instead of having all work take place on the main layer 1 ethereum network that instead users can perform the bulk of their activity off chain in this layer 2 protocol there's actually someone called robert stevens who said you can think of it as creating a side road off of the main highway to help ease congestion and i always thought that was a pretty cool quote so now let's go ahead and answer the question what is loopering now for this i actually want to talk to you about some of my most recent business experience and that is a few months ago i decided to create my very own decentralized exchange my very own decks so what i did of course is i went to the new boston youtube channel i learned ethereum i learned solidity i figured out how to write smart contracts and i was loving life so what i did first is i created this smart contract right here and it allowed anyone on the ethereum network to deposit tokens and create trades it essentially included all of the logic that you would ever want in a decentralized exchange now i tested everything locally and well to me i thought it was pretty awesome however after a few days i started getting some feedback from customers and i don't know if you can tell by their face or not but they were not happy with this experience and i asked them why and they said well a couple of reasons first every single time i try to do anything on this exchange like deposit tokens or create a trade basically anytime i send any transaction at all to the ethereum network to the smart contract then it's costing me like five or ten dollars i really want to use this dap but it's just really expensive now i also receive feedback saying that any request is just taken forever yeah this decentralized technology is pretty cool but in terms of user experience everything is just really expensive and really slow so i told myself you know what there must be a better way so i went online and i did a bit of research and i stumbled across something called loopering so loopering is a technology that claims to be able to solve some of these problems so how exactly does it work well according to their docs that i was studying scratching my head trying to figure out this out they said that in this loopering protocol this loopering architecture what users would first do is they would send their funds to a smart contract managed by the loopering protocol and this would be called the deposit contract now this contract is responsible for storing and get some more arrows going here so this contract is responsible for storing all of the user funds and not only that but it also contains the logic to transfer those funds to and from my decks so essentially i'm going to create my dex is a separate layer 2 network and then once i'm plugged in to layer one my decks can now listen for any new deposits so this is where things get interesting so unlike before whenever a user wanted to do something like create a new order instead of reaching out and communicating with the smart contract living on the main ethereum network the main layer 1 network now instead what they can do is they can actually reach out to my decks directly so i'm going to have my decks living outside ethereum and i'm going to create a simple api just because you know i want to give them some kind of interface to interact with this however point being instead of sending requests to a smart contract on the ethereum network they are instead going to be sending those requests to my api for my decks so for example whenever this user right here wanted to create a new order and let's say that this person over here was gonna be on the other side of that order person a would just send a request up and immediately that could be fed down to person two and from their perspectives everything happened very efficiently it was very quick and it was just really a great experience and not only that but i also created this super cool order matching algorithm so that users can always get the best deals on their trade and i actually had this before running on my first smart contract however it required a lot of processing and it was just super expensive whenever i ran it on layer one however when i run it on my own server it's no problem super cheap alright so this is pretty cool my users are now happy because they have a great user experience all of their requests are super cheap and are happening super fast however thinking about this a bit more wait a minute something feels a bit off because what it looks like is that if all of this activity is happening on my layer 2 network then how do all of these transactions for example this person traded tokens to this person and maybe they traded another token back and forth how does all of this information in all of their updated balances get communicated back to the main ethereum network that is a good question well with the loopering architecture what's going to happen is me in this case as the maintainer of this dex what i am going to periodically do is i'm gonna bundle together all of this activity all of these transactions that happen on my layer two network and i'm going to periodically send them back to the main ethereum network through these loopering smart contracts and that's essentially how this main ethereum layer 1 network in my layer 2 decks stay in sync but now this introduces some more questions one won't that just be expensive as before and also couldn't i just say hey you know what all of these users um they actually sell their tokens to me bucky like trying to do something malicious well the answer to both of those the short answer at least are no and no the long answer are going to require a bit deeper dive into loopering's technologies such as zk roll up zk snarks merkle trees and all those other buzzwords you may been hearing about before now for that what we're gonna be doing is covering all of those in some later videos and i say later videos probably like um i don't know i wanna guess like four or five videos from now and that is because the next videos that i want to cover are some more of the user facing apps and that includes the loopering smart wallet which is their mobile app loop ring io which is loopering's very own decentralized trading platform and we might even be covering some layered to nft minting as well who knows now i also want to point out that if you have any questions at all about loopering then the best place to go is one their official website loopering.org and if you want to talk to someone maybe have some more granular questions then you can check out their discord so right now if you scroll to the bottom of their website and click on the discord link then of course that's going to take you to their discord lots of people there all the time to answer any questions that you may have another good resource is their reddit this is actually pretty active and again that's r slash loopering.org so between their discord and reddit really if you have any questions there's always going to be someone there to be able to answer them for you and last but not least if you have any questions for me directly or anyone from the new boston community as always you can go to thenewboston.com and our links to join our discord are either in the footer or you know they are let's see resources and join the community here as well but either way hopefully that gives you a very high level understanding of what loop ring is like i said in the next video we're going to be getting into a lot more details so for now thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and i'll see y'all later
