hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new boss Tim in this tutorial we're going to be started learning about ArrayList now if you look at this code right here I already have some typed out now if you remember this is from one of the previous tutorials where we learned about structures and readonly properties and if you don't know what those are go ahead and move back and watch the videos about those you don't have to if you don't want to but I would recommend it before moving on to this tutorial so you can see here's our program and you remember that when we clicked list customer it lists their full name their first name their last name and their email now we need we want to make a lot of customers and we want to store these in an array but we don't know exactly how many there are going to be added so what we can do is use what's called an ArrayList now an ArrayList is similar to an array but it can hold any data type so you could have an ArrayList and store a string Internet in it an integer in it you can store double you can store all different data types inside of an ArrayList and you can also it has no bounds so you can just keep adding stuff to it and you're not going to run out of space you're not going to have to read eclair it or anything like that it's also known as a type of collections so what we're going to do is we're going to come over here to our code and we're going to come up to the top here and let's just do it before our structure and we're going to declare a private variable or a private ArrayList so what we're going to do is going to call it private my customers as new ArrayList now when you use the new keyword it means you are making an object of the ArrayList so now what we're going to do is we are going to create a sub that will add customers to our ArrayList so what we're going to do is come down here right before these private fields and we'll go ahead and type private sub ad customer and for our parameters we're going to use first name last name in email so we'll buy Val first name as string by Val last name yeah last name as string and then we'll do their email as string by mail email as string so when the developer or you call add calls add customer it's going to take three arguments their first name the last name and their string so then what we're going to do is we are going to make an object of our customer structure and now whenever a customer is called it makes a new object of it and it's independent of the structure itself so we will just declare sodimm object new customer as customer so when we create this new customer right here this can only be used inside of this sub right here so when this sub is called it's created and then after that it's no longer used and this does it matter to us because we're going to be adding those customers to a list box above these fields so we'll go and do that right now we'll just make this a little bit bigger we'll highlight everything by just taking our mouse and dragging a little box over it and then we'll pull this down to the bottom and now I'll come over here to our toolbox and we will add a list box and we will just call this list customers so list customers ok so now we're going to do is we're going to come back to our ad customer sub and you can see that it's unused so now what we got to do is use that so we're just going to fill in all of the fields that we need to so when we create a structure customer structure we will have access to first name last name and email and they will be stored in object new customer so we'll just type object new customer dot first name equals and then we're going to use the first name that the that you have passed to this sub so we'll just do first name and then we will do that for the last name equals last name and object new customer dot email equals email now what we have to do is since we've created our new customer we're going to add that to our ArrayList of my customers so that we can access it later on and we'll just store a bunch of customers in one ArrayList so we'll just type object customer dot add or not object customer sorry about that we want my customers dot add and it says as an object to the end of the system stock collections dot ArrayList so whenever you add any item to your ArrayList of any data type you want it'll just go ahead and add it after the last item that you've added in there and since there's nothing in there this is going to be the first thing inside of it so we'll just add object new customer and then we're once we leave this sub object new customer is going to be gone so whenever we run this sub it uses it and it's gone and if we call it again object new customer is going to be something completely different so now what we need to do is we need to add that customer to the list so list customers dot items dot add and we will just add object new customer so we're going to come down here to our button one click event and let's just remove what we have created so far so we're no longer going to need that so what we're going to do is we're going to create some customers here or add customer so what is type add customer and we'll do first name Sam last name let's just do hello and let's just do Sam dot hello at programmer calm and we'll create a couple more customers so add customer John or John Roberts and we'll just do Roberts John at programmer calm and we'll just add one more to our list so add customer let's just do Rachel and Smith and then Smith dot or we need to make that a string so Smith dot Rachel at programmer calm okay so now we have a called add customer three times whenever the user clicks button one or list customer so it will go ahead and create those customers add them to the list and then add them to our ArrayList here so that we can access them after that so we go ahead and run this you see we've got form one right here if we click if we click list customer you can see that it's not exactly what we wanted it gives us structures form 1 plus customer so structures is our project form one is the class and then customer is the object type so what we're going to need to do is override the two string method here so I've come down here and whenever they add it we'll just convert object new customer dot to string and that should give us something a little bit different so if we click run click list customer you can see that it gives us the same thing because it's already a string so like I said what we're going to need to do is over I to string so that it will give us what we want so we're going to be learning that about that in the next tutorial so I'll scroll through this code real quick for you so you can pause wherever you want and once you go ahead and practice a little bit with ArrayList make different projects add stuff to ArrayList like strings and integers all on the same ArrayList and you can add those to list boxes using a for loop and once you know what ArrayList is and you're not going to forget what they are go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
