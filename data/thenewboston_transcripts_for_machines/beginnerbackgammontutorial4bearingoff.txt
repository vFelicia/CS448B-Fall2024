now bearing off is the process of taking your Checkers and moving them off the board and remember first person to get all their Checkers off the board is the winner now here are the rules you can only begin removing your Checkers when all of your Checkers are in your first quadrant or your home board if there is a checker out here and there is a checker out here then you can't bear off if there is only one Checker outside then you can't bear off they all need to be in your home board just like that never saying all right so how exactly do I bear off well whenever all the checkers are in your home board go ahead and roll and for example you got a six and a four so that means 1 2 34 you can take one off your four point and one off your six point so then I would go ahead and play right now and remember I can't bear off because I got Checkers outside of my home board so what I'm going to try to do is 1 two and 2 4 6 I'm going to go ahead and try to get all my Checkers to the home board so I can start bearing off so now let's go ahead and here's what you would roll a four and a six so again you would move one off your six point and one off your four point and you continue to do this until you have no Checkers left but here are a couple little rules that you might want to know all right so say you have set up like this and you have point and you have Checkers on your 1 through five point but not on your six point if you go ahead and you roll a six then what you would do is since there's nothing on your six point you can just move it off the highest point so just like that and for example if you roll a five like this and you don't have anything on your five point you can just remove it from the three point but you can't say you can't do this if you roll a two you can't move it you can't like just remove it from any point you want it has to be higher you see where I'm coming from so here's what would happen if you roll like a two and a one in this instance well you see you can't remove any from one and you can't remove any from two so what you would need to do is you would need to use your one by like say move this one and you would need to use your two by saying one two so if you can play then you can just play like you're playing normal but if not then you can remove them so pretty much if there's something on your point remove it if there's nothing on your point then you can you either have to play it or remove the highest one under it simple enough so that is the basics of bearing off um hitting and reentering uh let's see I think that's really all we have to cover so I can't think of anything at the moment that I left out so in the next tutorial what I'm going to be doing is covering some basic strategy that all beginners must learn first so now that we got all the rules of the game done we can begin learning what are smart plays what are really dumb plays and uh we can I don't know maybe learn some more about hitting our opponent donkey punching them so anyways thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next video
