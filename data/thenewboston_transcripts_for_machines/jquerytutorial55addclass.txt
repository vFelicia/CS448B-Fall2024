hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to look at adding classes to elements with JA jQuery sorry classes as you might know it for example in style dot CSS we've included this in our index dot PHP page just up here so we have a style sheet applied to the page a class would be something like docked bold and then you could create inside of this fontweightbold so bold is now a class and we can apply this to particular elements for example if we were to come down and create a paragraph here and type some text and in here we could say class equals bold now when we refresh our page the text is automatically bold so in HTML we can use the class attribute to apply classes to a particular element however in jQuery we can also do this using add class so let's go ahead and keep this paragraph and just type this is some text I'm going to give an ID to this paragraph so that's just going to be some text and we're going to create a button which will actually apply the a particular class to this paragraph so we're going to apply a class to this some text paragraph so let's go ahead and create another paragraph up here with an input button inside this is going to be a button sorry the value we could say apply class and we're also gonna give the this button an ID so we can check for when it has been pressed so I'm just gonna call this button so when we press this button let's just preview it in our browser we want to apply the bold class to this text here so let's go ahead and create an external javascript file that will allow us to do this so I'm going to create a file inside of j/s folder and I'm gonna call this class J s because the next few tutorials will also be on classes so we're gonna be using this same class file okay so now we are inside class J s we can actually apply this bold class to this paragraph here to make the text bold so the first thing we want to do is listen out for a button click so the button is called button we reference this with a hash we say dot click this is a this is the click event handler and then inside we create a function we bring that down and we can start writing our code in there okay so now that we've done that we can use the add class functionality to actually add this class found in style dot CSS to our paragraph so our paragraph is called some text so we can go ahead and reference that as some text then we want to say dot add class remember the capital C and then in brackets the name of the class so the name of our class in this case is bold you won't need the dart so you just need bold ok so when we press the button will apply the class bold to this some text paragraph and once we've checked out in the browser I'm going to go ahead and tell you why you might actually need to do this so when we click apply class nothing happens ok that's because we haven't actually included this class dot J's file in our page so let's go ahead and type that out now script type source and end the script and the type is text forward slash JavaScript and the source is je s forward slash class dot J ass okay so let's go back to our browser and preview this press the button and that clap that particular class is applied to this text okay so why might you need to do this well let's just say you are validating a form and you had a particular element for example a and input text box or just you know some text next to it or a label you might want to apply a class through validation for example when we click on the submit button or register button whatever your form is doing we might want to make the text bold for fields that have perhaps an error so instead of replacing the text itself and making everything look messy we can just simply apply a predefined class to an element on our page so form validation is one way this can be used however there are obviously a variety of ways that you can use the add class functionality
