alright Milady's welcome back in in this video what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going over some various buttons and options and before we begin let's go ahead and get a little sidetrack I actually tried to figure out how to use a LinkedIn today I opened my account like I don't know maybe a year ago or something and the first time I logged in I was like what the heck is this I have no idea how to do anything so I basically just uploaded picture and did nothing but today I actually tried to figure it out and like I I know changed some settings and stuff so yeah if you guys got one connect with me or add me follow me whatever it's called I don't know alright I clearly don't know how to use it yep go ahead and you know add me and I'll figure it out so back to this video the first thing I want you guys to do is just go ahead in any repo and click any single file and that is because whenever you are looking at one file I want to cover these buttons right here raw blame and history and a lot of people never even click these or just glance over them and they're actually pretty important so the first one is this raw so whenever you click this it gives you basically a raw view of the file without any text formatting now the reason that this is actually handy is because if you guys were ever working with some IDE like this sometimes whenever you copy code like this what's actually happening is it's not just copying the text but if you inspect this it's copying all the HTML as well so whenever you are copying code from github and pasting it into you know one of your projects then always copy the raw and then you're not going to have any problems whatsoever now another thing I want to mention is if you guys ever make like these cool BOTS or programs to download I don't know maybe a shell script or something from here make sure that you are downloading it from this URL and not this one so the reason is the same so if you tried to download it from here then it's going to get all the HTML and try to like execute that program so again raaah is what you want alright moving on the next one is blame so blame is a cool way that you can look at each line in a file and see who edited each line so this was a little script that I was working on and I didn't add any comments because I was just kind of lazy so another guy he went through and he actually added comments above each of these methods so that's why you see that all right I have my commits right here but then whatever he added it has his little icon and said he did this five days ago and it's just cool way I don't know if you find like a bug in a file that a lot of people working on you know who to fire so so there you go there's that and the last one I want to talk to you guys about right now is history so history pretty obvious what it is it shows all the commits and changes for this one file so again this is the history for one file and don't confuse it with your commits which is basically the history for the entire project or any of the files so there's that now now that we got those options taken care of let's go ahead and click back on any repo so those were for a single file but we also have these buttons for your entire project or repository so this is going to say watch or unwatched I'm watching this right now so that's why I says that start or run star and fork now actually let me go ahead and oh let me find one of my friends instead of my own because that's we're going to be seeing most of the time all right what do we got here all right so this is what you're usually going to see whenever you're just browsing around github looking for projects it's going to say watch by default because you probably aren't going to be watching it so what this means is basically if you click this and hit watching it means that you're basically like following this project so that means whenever you click this icon and it takes you back to I don't even know this is called your stream your home page whatever you're going to get notifications whenever a change is made to that project so again watch is basically saying follow this give me updates whenever something changes on it and another thing is you can actually change your notifications to get them just in your github stream whenever you go to this you can also have a notification sent to your email and you can either have notifications turn them all off or turn both of those on and you can take care of those in your settings but cover all those settings later now another thing is star so a lot of people confuse watching star star is basically just like saving something or bookmarking it so I can go ahead and say I'm going to start this and then if I go back to my github profile you can see all of the repositories of project I have starred or saved they're basically the same thing so if you find something cool but you don't want to have a notification every single time then you can go ahead and just bookmark it and there you go so again watching it is get notifications about it and star basically means bookmark it or save it now fork we already kind of talked about what that means what this means is make a new branch or copy of this project so we'll say that what is this even a collection of his configuration files I know why he upload this but uh let's say that I wanted all of these configuration files to maybe I wanted to change something on them well if you look at my github page in my repositories I don't have any of those yet so here are all my repositories I don't have a copy of that but what I can do is if I want a copy I can just go ahead and press fork and I don't know if you guys I don't know if that text is going off the screen it says fork your own copy in other words it means make your own copy now since I have organization it's going to say do you want to put it on your organization or just your personal account so I'm just going to click mine just going to say alright give us a few seconds to copy all those files for you and yeah there you go so now if I go back to my profile in my repositories I can see right here config files so again this as you can tell by the URL is a copy of my configuration files so this is the copy that I can actually you know edit the files to make a bunch of changes maybe fix some bugs whatever I want to do and also if I ever want to like improve that project and I want to submit it back to my friends project I can just go ahead and make whatever changes and hit new pull request so that's the basics of how you work with other people's projects and not just make branches on your own so ladies and gentleman that's all I have for you for this tutorial I am probably going to go ahead and try to figure out LinkedIn some more and I've got some pending invitations here nice all right so yeah I think that's for watching I'll see you next time
