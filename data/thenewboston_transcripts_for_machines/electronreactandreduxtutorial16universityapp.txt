all right everybody welcome back to another series and in this one we're going to be building a decentralized university and let me go ahead and actually show you what I got so far so go ahead open up your favorite platform tnvos you click on this University icon and as you probably noticed instead of just that white square that says University before I did make quite a few updates and for now what we can do is go under this teach section to this my courses page make sure you click that and we're going to go ahead and create a new course by clicking this new course button and I am just going to be making a draft course that I actually plan on making in the future I don't actually have any videos recorded yet but it's good to use as a demonstration so I'm going to create a course and name it react optimization and just give it a quick description say in this course you will learn how to optimize react applications applications and I also made this snazzy thumbnail right here so just gonna copy the URL for that and paste it in this field submit and boom so as you see we now have a course created however this course you can tell by this badge in the top right it's in draft mode right now so what does this mean well the other mode or status I guess you could say is published so if you click this little check box to publish the course and hit submit that's going to publish your course and whenever a course is published what this means is that this course is now shared with other devices that we're connected to so in essence this device right here that I'm on it's going to act as a host to provide this data to other devices now to kind of see what I'm talking about in action if we go back to this main page and under this alert section you just go ahead and click browse what you're going to see right here is all of the other courses from the other devices that we're connected to that are being shared with us so right now I'm only connected to one other device which is my MacBook however on that device I have four courses that I created and are being hosted and actually to show you something pretty cool let me so you guys aren't going to see this because I am on my Mac right now but go ahead and keep an eye on this title right here electron react and Redux so I'm just gonna make an update to this you can probably hear me typing I'm going to hit corn and then hit submit and as you see whenever I make those changes on my MacBook those changes are going to be reflected in real time right here so now let me actually go ahead and change that back to electron react and Redux and there we go so really just trying to demonstrate that we have data that's hosted on other devices that's being shared with us in real time and as that data gets updated those updates are reflected on my UI again all this happening in real time pretty darn cool now let's go ahead and click into one of these courses and take a look at what we got so on the course homepage you can see an overview of you know all the videos or the lectures that we call them in the code and you can of course click and view each one watch the video go back to the course page and let's see you can also take the course and whenever you take the course what it does is it moves it kind of out of this brow section you see that it's no longer here just moves it into your my courses section really just for better organization and let me just go ahead and leave that course actually now another cool feature that I built in is cloning the course now like I said right now this course is hosted on my MacBook and I'm on my iMac right now another device and by cloning the course I'm basically going to copy all of the content and make me as the owner or instructor for this object so right now what I just did is I copied the course object in all the lectures as we can see over to this device and by the way whenever you first clone a course every single thing is in draft mode so nothing is being shared with anyone else by default so I wrote it like this because what you can do now is go ahead and make any changes that you want and then once these changes are good you can just go ahead and publish these courses as needed now another thing that I want to know is that even though I publish these courses they still aren't going to be visible to any other devices and that's because the course itself is still not published so it isn't until you actually publish the parent course which I can do from either that form that we just saw or just right here where once it's published then like I said everything is then going to be visible and shared with everyone else but for now I'm just going to go ahead and delete this course because I don't actually want to clone it just want to kind of show you this cool cloning logic and by the way the reason that I made this is two reasons one it is kind of tedious right now writing in all the individual lectures and I just figured that if we wanted to collaborate and kind of like build up these courses and write actual descriptions with better thumbnails and so on and so forth then it's just the way that like multiple people can kind of collaborate at the same time I make some changes uh you clone the course make your changes then I can clone over so on and so forth and another useful reason I found for cloning this course is sometimes I'm just developing and I need to go ahead and reset my entire store or basically just like wipe all my data just for testing purposes in that case what I can do is for all the courses I have created I can just clone them to another device wipe all the data on this device and then once I'm you know done developing whatever I can just pretty much copy all those courses back to this main device that I want among but yeah just thought that cloning was a pretty cool feature at least one that I find Handy now as far as our roadmap in the feature what I want to do is well one of the first things that I want to do is just make it easier to add lectures and I'll show you what I'm talking about right now so for this course that we just created whenever we create a new lecture I'll show you how it's kind of a pain right now so the first lecture name I don't have a video like I said but let's just say I'm going to make a video on using the devtools profiler and I'll say in this lecture we learn about the profile or okay definitely copy that there we go and for the thumbnail URL actually for the thumbnail URL I'll show you what I do so I'm going to need the video code and this isn't the actual video it's just the last video I recorded but just to use it as an example this is what I would type in for the YouTube ID now whenever you upload a video to YouTube it generates a default thumbnail and it can be uh queried by this format right here so in here what I do is I copy that from that stack Overflow link and then I just paste the video code right here and that gets you your thumbnail now all that as you could see it was kind of tedious I have to like go to YouTube and look at the URL and copy this then go to the stack Overflow page and like copy this and replace my video code with this in like it wasn't that bad what we just did but imagine like some of my courses that have like 200 videos in them so imagine doing that 200 times I'm going to get carpal tunnel in like five seconds so I definitely want to make that process a little bit easier another thing that I want to do is I want to add in Vimeo support since a lot of videos are on Vimeo 2 and right now this is only supporting YouTube so make it a little bit more flexible and in addition to that some other features that I had planned a while ago is first of all on the um these are kind of features as the students perspective first on the lectures page just have a little progress bar to yeah just track your progress you know nothing else to say about that and then on the actual video or lecture page I thought it would be cool to have a download button a lot of people asked to download my videos and well there's like not a download button on YouTube so you know since this is pretty much our own platform I mean we could build whatever features we want I thought that would be a cool feature and another thing that I thought was handy was just to have some links to different resources um almost everyone asked for the source code and on some videos I have like links to I don't know maybe somewhere I got images or installation guides uh links to like docs of whatever topic we're learning so on so forth but yeah just like different links for resources and as far as the first interactive feature since these are kind of like you know the download button the resources it's just like static content as far as an interactive feature goes I think there's a motorcycle outside but I thought a comment section would be you know one of the top things on the list of priorities since a lot of people have questions just want to get feedback we're going to just chat hang out that'll be cool too but a comment section is definitely top on the list and then some other small things is that on these uh course pages right here whenever you're just browsing the courses from other devices right now I only have four so it's not you know you don't really need too many tools however I can see this growing where once I have all my courses there maybe like I don't even know how many let's say you're like 50 or something then if we have some tools for like filtering and searching and sorting kind of just small stuff like that that you see in every application but those are going to be handy not only for viewing like courses on other devices but even your own courses um you know imagine you have like 50 of these and you want to edit the Django course it's going to be kind of tough to find out so you know some small stuff like that but it's a small stuff that really turns this from like a high school project Feeling app to like a professional application although slight interactions transitions uh small features stuff like that so yeah that's kind of just the overview just want to show you what we have so far and kind of where we're going but if anyone has any other suggestions for other features or other UI improvements that I can make I would love to hear them basically any other tools that we can use to help each other learn um yeah let me hear them I mean this is our application it's we're pretty much the end accusers so uh you know our feedback is the most important so yeah on that note that is what we're going to be doing if anyone is interested in following along building The Sting with me then uh yeah we'll see where it goes so for now thanks for watching and I will see you in the next video
