so we'll choose this file click Submit and ok maybe not yet I'll be 17 sorry okay so just refresh so we've got JPEG now this we've achieved the result that we want however we need a dynamic way of choosing of choosing this extension because we're not always going to rely on uh knowing how many characters the file name is for example if I chose file dot PHP and click Submit nothing comes up because this is not work because we don't have exactly 17 characters up to the dot so we need another function which is called STR pause which stands for string position and what we need to do is we need to grab the string position from name of the dot okay and then we need to add one to that the reason we need to add one to that is because we're looking for the position of the dot and then after that meaning one after that we need to take and that will be the J so we find the dot one after that will be J and then the rest will be PG so let's just check how this works remember we selected this image file first and we click Submit so that seemed to return everything correctly now let's choose the file dot PHP click Submit and you can see that it's given us PHP so just by combining these two functions we found this really easy way to grab the file extension and then obviously as well as this extension here we've got the type of file here so that can go up there for now okay so let's remove these and what we need to do is perform a couple of checks to see if the file is what we want it to be so we want it to be a jpg file so we need to add in just over after here we need to say if not empty name and extension equals jpg or extension equals JP eg because sometimes they can be named JP eg what we can also check for is it would be good idea check for uppercase as well because otherwise that won't be allowed so what we can do is we can actually say STR to lower and what that's going to do is that's going to take the strip the the extension name and make it lower case so we we don't need to check for jpg in lowercase jpg the jpg in lower case and then in upper case this is going to automatically make the extension lower case so we only need to check two times and then we need to say and type equals equals image /jp eg okay so now let's see empty okay let's take this out of here actually because let's take that out of there and we'll create a new if statement down here so if and we can paste that in there let's just get rid of that and that there so it's nice and tidy so if the extension equals jpg or the extension equals jpg and the type equals image JPEG then we process this so let's just end in that so we look well it need let's just check where that's going to end that one into there and then okay so let's just indent that okay so we performed a check now and then we obviously going to add an else on there so echo file must be jpg jpg so let's give it a test let's choose a file we're going to choose this Nikolov worsley file click Submit pass error on line 11 so that's going to bug this so 11 if empty our they'll go missing another bracket on there that was me messing around so let's refresh the page 113 as well okay should be there so let's check what's wrong here it would be one missing on there so I'm missing out all my brackets okay so that's uploaded so let's go and check that and that might have just overwritten that file again yet so it has let's just delete these actually so we can keep an eye on what's happening and what's not so let's just start there just delete these files here click yes okay so as far as we going now there's nothing in here so let's try and upload our our image file again so choose file choose that click Submit that's uploaded so as we as it stands at the moment we presume that this has been uploaded so I'm going to click an upload yet it's there and everything's worked now let's go and try and upload a PHP file and see what happens submit file must be jpg /jp eg so now you can see how we've used these two methods of security we're first of all checking our custom extension which we've taken we've taken from the name and the original type of the file and we checked for that so we're checking that the file exists and now obviously you can add in more logical operators to check for different types of file but there is actually an easier way to do that using arrays so we'll do that probably later on so that's basically a bit of form security in the next video we're going to be talking out about how to check for the file size which we've currently got grayed out here
