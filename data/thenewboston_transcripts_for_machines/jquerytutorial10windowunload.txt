hi this is Alex from PHP academy' no org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to look at the unload event applying it to the document itself so for example if we would have a link on the page and user were to click it or for example they were to either navigate away from the page using their back or forward buttons as well as closing their window we could perform a specific action or a specific set of actions based on this event so as an example let's go ahead and create a link and I'm going to create this link to Google so the address in here as well now once we've done this we can go ahead and start to write out our code in ext jas which I've included on my page as well as jQuery so let's go over to ext Jas now in previous tutorials we've already looked at things like window dot load and we've also looked at things like document dot ready however what we're going to be looking at here is window dot unload so this means that when the like I said when the user navigates away from the browser the functions or the function within this will be performed so let's go ahead and outline the function here and pull this down so we've got this function in here and we can go ahead and perform an action when the window is unloaded so over here we have our Google link here or this was from a previous example I'll just go and get rid of that okay so we have Google here when I click it we navigate to Google code at UK however we want to perform something or display something when the user leaves so for example we could alert out you're leaving you're leaving this Paige now in reality you wouldn't really alert every time a user leaves the page it's probably not a good idea but we use an alert as just as an example so we can see when the unload event is called now this doesn't work with particular you know we can't account from the beginning essentially if we wanted to say allow the user to cancel the navigation away we're unable to do this using unload and we'll take a look at that in a minute and see how that handles it so let's go ahead and refresh okay so when i click google you can see now we have this alert box appear say you're leaving the page now when i press ok it forwards the user to the location that was initially requested so for example if I now click forward in my browser which would take me back to Google it will still say you're leaving this page again if we close the window as well let's just go ahead and open another window okay so we've got Google just open here when I was when I for example go ahead and close this and this tab just up here you see we get the same message and we can press ok and that tab will be closed so we can now see that the unload event will perform a specific action based on when the user unloads the page and as I said if we were to go ahead and for example allow the user to either press ok or cancel in a confirmed dialog a JavaScript confirm dialog this wouldn't actually work so let's go ahead and create a confirmed dialog and see what we get I'm going to create a variable called C which is equal to the confirmed dialog function and inside here I'm just going to write for example are you sure you want to leave then what we could do is perform an if statement as we usually would now in this case what we would think would be possible was to say if the confirmation is okay so I the user presses ok we can for example return true or something like that otherwise we could go ahead and return false now in any other circumstance this would return false to this function and therefore the action wouldn't be carried out if the user does press ok we would return true therefore they would be able to leave the page however let's go and take a look at see what happens you'll see that we automatically get this dialog oh no that's from the other other part so let's go ahead and click on Google and we get this dialog box saying are you sure you want to leave now let's go ahead and press ok first of all and you can see that we leave the page when we come back to this how every one click it again but this time if we go ahead and press cancel you can see that the user is all you know still forwarded to the page that was requested and we can't actually stop this event from happening it just happens and then we carry out this particular operation or this particular set of you know this code this particular you know function whatever you want to do so there's no way that we can actually stop it so why do we use unload in that case like why would we ever need to use it if we don't want to show for example an alert dialog saying like you're leaving the page or something why would we ever use it well let's just say as a scenario you had some kind of script that would allow users to you know log in to say a chat window and show on the page that they're available to chat in this case you would obviously the user would come in and they would be able to say chat to other people on the website however if you were to then use this unload function it would be extremely useful to them remove them from the list of people that are available to chat so you would maybe have a assignment of user IDs that correspond to values in the database and you could remove them from the site as well as performing up you know using the unloads you can perform operations that you require just before the user leaves the page so cleaning up anything you know any particular part of your site or you know temporary files you know anything like that so use the unload function in this case but you wouldn't be able to use it to you know say are you sure you want to navigate away from the page it's not possible to do that using this unload event function so taking them you know notes of why we might use unload you can see that we wouldn't really be able to use it in the case of a link and confirming whether they want to leave but we can use it for a variety of other things that otherwise we would have to use pure JavaScript or raw JavaScript to do
