okay so today we're going to do some more proofs and I know we've been doing a lot of these but every time we do a new lesson on proofs we're learning more rules that help us prove things so example number one given that t l is isoceles and te is equal to e l prove that te EA is congruent to Le EA so first we'll write down our given information t a l is isoceles t e equal e l okay so the first thing we can do is since we're told that t l is isoceles that means this has to be equal to this so ta a is congruent to a l if triangle is ises then sides are congruent because a is the vertex angle of the isoceles triangle so that means Ta A and A L have to be congruent so now we're going to learn something new we are told that te is equal to e l but to prove triangles are congruent we need two congruent sides but the definition of congruent is segments who have equal measures so we're going to use this little theorem to get te congruent to eel and the theorem is if equal measures then congruent because congruent means to have equal measures so now we have one side and another side all we need is a third side but if you look these two triangles share AE and since AE is always going to be congruent to AE we have a third pair of congruent sides so this is our reflexive property and we have one last step which is to say therefore triangle te EA is congruent to Triangle l e a by side side side so so our next problem is going to deal with this shape trying to prove it's a parallelogram so given that AB is parallel to DC and angle one is congruent to angle 4 prove AB c d is a parallelogram okay so let's write our given information so AB parallel to DC angle one congruent to angle four okay so if you notice since these two lines are parallel that means that angle two is congruent to angle three because they're alternate interior angles so angle two is congruent to angle three if line are parallel alternate interior angles are congruent okay so we just got this angle congruent to this angle we have another pair of congruent angles and if you look they share this side because if we can get these two triangles congruent we can get this pair of opposite sides also congruent and that proves it's a parallelogram so we can say DB is congruent to DB and that's the reflexive property and then we can say that the triangles are congruent by angle side angle so triangle DB a is congruent to triangle B oh yeah b d c by angle side angle and then we can get DC congruent to AB DC is congruent to AB cuz if triangles congruent corresponding parts are also congruent and then finally we can say that a b c d is a parallelogram because if one pair of opposite sides are parallel and congruent then it is a parallelogram so those are the only proofs we're going to work with today but make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where do some review of area and regular polygons
