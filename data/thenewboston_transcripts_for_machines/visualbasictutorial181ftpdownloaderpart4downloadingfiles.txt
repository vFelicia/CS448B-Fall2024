hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our FTP download so now we need to do is since we've already made it where it will show the files in the directory of our server let's go ahead and allow the user to download one of the files so we'll go ahead and access the download click event and let's go ahead and show a message box to make sure they really want to download the file so we'll type if message box not show I'll say are you sure you want to download and we'll just go ahead and add the file so we'll go ahead and do list FTP files dot selected item so this will give us the name of the selected item and for the title let's just go ahead and say confirm and then we'll do message box buttons dot ok and cancel so they can press ok or cancel the download and for the icon will just do message box icons dot and let's do a question okay so if this message box is equal to so if it equals dialog result dot okay then what do we want to do so message box is a dialog you should know this already because when you show a message box the user can't do anything outside of that message box until they click a button inside of it or close out of it so we're going to show the message box and if the result is ok then what do we want to do we'll use FTP downloaded so FTP downloader and now we're going to download file so we will just download and now this is going to take some arguments now the first argument is going to be the source file name so what we can do is just use list FTP files dot selected item dot and then I'm just going to rode it to a string no we don't need to do that because that's already a string and therefore the local file name let's just go ahead and download it to the downloads folder because that is the default for browsers and any other program you're going to use now you can also incorporate a save file dialog but for now let's just save it in the downloads so like local file name is going to be my dot computer dot file system dot git directories and let's see here we're going to have to get special folders so special directories and what we want to access is downloads let's see here hmmm looks like there isn't a downloads in here so we'll just use my documents so it's my dog computer dot file system dot special directories mine documents and now we're going to have to have a name for that file so when you go to access a file in your computer let's say I go to computer here you can see that it has computer if I go to C it's C colon backslash now backslash separates folders and files so we're going to do My Documents backslash and then we will add list FTP files dot selected item now you can see here that we have my documents and then the name of the file now we have another argument that is going to take and is permit override so if you set this equal to true it will overwrite that file if it already exists now this comes default as false so let's just leave it as false so let's go ahead and run this and hopefully everything will work so we'll go ahead and go to our home directory and let's download jackal dot txt go ahead and click download and it says are you sure you want to download jackal dot txt we'll go ahead and click OK and it will download the file for us and it looks like yes we did not set overwrite equal to true and since the file already exists it will not overwrite it so all we have to do is put true right there and let's move this arrow up to the top so it will show the message box again and we'll run this says are you sure are you sure you want to download jackal text go ahead and click OK and we'll come to my documents and let's scroll down here where is it here it is let me just make this a little bit smaller so here is our Jack elects file that we just downloaded so we can go ahead and minimize now that and let's download YouTube copy to dot txt so we'll go ahead and click OK and it should download that to My Documents town let's see if it's in here and here it is right there YouTube copy too so go ahead and put in the code that will let files me download and then once you do that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
