okay guys time to get back to work on my castle slous slash whatever heck is so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm actually gonna copy this right here holding control alt and drag this out just a tid bit because I got a feeling I'm going to want to make my walls just a tidbit bigger so let's go ahead and add a bridge now by opening the content browser and dragging this bridge right here out right about there and it looks pretty huge now and I think that is because my camera is Right close to it I don't think it's really that huge so if we go ahead and in our side view scrolling scrolling did you guys ever see that CSI where they're like enhance enhance it's BS anyways you guys probably have no idea what I'm talking about so let's go ahead and in my top view position this right where we want it and I'm going to need the grotus bridge by like let's uh give it 2.0 see how that looks 2.0 let's go ahead and bump it up just a bit more 2.5 all right good enough so on my top view I want to position that right about actually it looks pretty dang good my perspective nicely positioned Bridge Bucky and now let me go ahead and look in these views make sure it's touching and hey good enough and just verify find my perspective view that it looks amazing and verified so now I got my bridge and Bridge pads now it's time to actually start building this Castle or whatever the heck I'm going to build so go ahead and in your content browser I think I feel in my heart that as soon as our user is going to come in then we want to build them like an epic Archway to go under so let's go ahead and in our content browser delete bridge and go ahead and type in Arch and and let's see what we got to work with this one looks pretty cool but that might be a little hard to work with this one might be a little easier to work with and it looks pretty dang good so go ahead drag that on on your screen and the first thing I'm noticing is this is amazingly amazingly huge so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be shrinking that by let's see 05 let's see how that works yeah that's a little bit better so let's go ahead and select that and see where it is and maybe if we all right that looks pretty good right there I mean we can always move it later on right like I said kind of winging this tutorial but I think uh that Arch looks pretty good right there the reason that I'm not going to adjust it up and down right now is because I'm going to build the walls first and then I'm going to set it right on top of the walls so with that being said I'm going to go ahead in my content browser grab some walls and by the way if you guys think you can build build a better Castle than this awesome amazing one I'm building go ahead and build it and send it to me in a video response and I'll just approve all the video responses like I always do I don't even look at them I just put check all approve all and uh we can see who builds the best castle and uh I'm guessing that yours can probably be better than mine since I'm doing this in like 5 seconds so let's go ahead and search for a wall none of these look very appetizing this one looks all right but want something a little more h this looks pretty good so let's go ahead and drag this out X and my wall looks pretty good right now but I wanted just a tid bit bigger so I'm going to go ahead and let's say I want to grow this by 1.5 that looks pretty good so the very first thing I'm going to do is position it exactly where I want it and that would just happen to be well let's say we want to like leave space on each side obviously so we go ahead and put one right there and we'll put another one right there for now so if we go ahead and take this and drag it up so it sits right on top of those then in my front view I can just go ahead and grab each one of these and drag them right under again if you're building a game you typically want to you know take more than half a second and make sure everything's positioned correctly but for now I do not want to do that so this is what I get and I guess even if I want to yeah I got an idea so I'm going to go ahead and copy this and I'm going to drag them both up because I kind of want the effect that yeah that effect right there I really like where this is going oh yeah this is going to look sweet so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and grab these walls right here and probably in my top view would be the best bet yeah oh yeah and just go ahead and rotate and then with your rotate things selected go ahead and hold down alt and you can actually rotate these to copy them as well you guys probably thought that moving them was the only way but boy were you wrong so let's go ahead and if we position these exactly where we want them with both of them selected still and just move them right about there and go ahead and my perspective view I want to make sure they look amazing again we really don't want these to overlap because if they overlap then your stack meshes are going to create this concrete looping through each other and it wouldn't look really natural so I think that's a pretty good natural looking again see this look right here of this concrete kind of going into this that's all right because I mean concrete could be built into each other but if these walls were doing it then that would look unnatural so for now it looks pretty good I think so what I'm going to do is go ahead and select those and oh and drag it down right about there and now let me go ahead oh man this is looking just it's almost looking too good that's the problem so with those being selected I'm going to go ahead and drag these and I'm going to kind of make a hallway so let me just go ahead and in my top view all in drag you can almost make a song out of this alt and drag and ALT and drag and one and two and ALT and drag so I got a nice little hallway going on there so let me go ahead and scroll down to players View and as I as I can see first and foremost this is totally not centered but I'm just going to say that that's what I was going for even though it clearly was not what I was going for so let's go ahead and um see what we got so far so we got a starting point right here looks pretty good the player is going to cross over this bridge look look around huh what it's over here huh no nothing one it's over here I got to going to go down this hallway and that's what the player is going to do so it actually looks pretty epic in my side view right here looking pretty good again if we want to make this even more epic you can add windows and you know maybe a guy at the Top shooting catapult at you but we don't have time for that right now so in the next story what I'm going to be doing is well I'm just going to be spicing things up a bit so it's going to be awesome again um like I said said the best way to probably learn this is just to create your own but if you want to stick with me and watch me build the rest of my awesome castle then you are welcome too again sorry I didn't plan anything out but hey that's that this is all you guys get so thank you guys for watching and uh I just I just had another idea I'm going to go ahead and expand these all the way down I'm going to do that between this video and the next video so when you guys come back this is going to look even more awesome so for now thank you you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
