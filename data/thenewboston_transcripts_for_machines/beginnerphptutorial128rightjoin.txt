hello this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a video tutorial for the New Boston now in the last uh example we've looked at um left joining where we um return let's give you an example in the SQL tab um we have said left join pets on where people. ID equals pets. people ID so if we click go we're given a list of um people on this hand side and the pets that relate to them on this hand side so we've got two different tables people uh where we've got the um ID which is unique to each person and we've got pets where um we're ignoring the ID for now but people ID is uh one for Alex and two for Dale so uh we're just displaying this information now what happens if for example we have got um uh dog which is relative to two um people ID 2 which is Dale but we delete Dale from the database so let's delete Dale from the database let's go aad and run this query again and click go now you can see that it's not return it's only returned Alex um and Cat and fish because um because uh Dale now doesn't exist now what happens if we want to display data on the uh right hand side even if the the corresponding value on the left hand side doesn't exist now for this we use the right join we've used left join but if we change this to right join what we're now doing is even if this people ID doesn't exist we're still displaying it um because we're right joining so let's click go and see what result we achieve Okay so we've got pet catfish and dog dog still exist in the database in this table pets but the owner does not exist now in people so why is this useful why can we use this right join well in this case it doesn't really make too much sense unless we were saying you know um the dog is now I don't know homeless and it's been abandoned the user no longer exists so it could be a pet owner's website for example this user might unregister or or yeah unregister so so um they might delete their account and now dog is left homeless so that's just an example a silly example but I'm sure you can understand where this is going so for Left for if we want to represent the data on the left even if it doesn't have a value on the right we use the left join if we are on the if we want to represent the data on the right hand side even if it doesn't have a data on the even if it doesn't have a value that corresponds to it um after the on keyword on the left hand side we still show this so we've shown this as null so inside PHP we can make this comparison and say that dog doesn't actually have an owner so that's basically um the difference between the left and the right hand side joins so we use left join if we want to display data on the uh uh on the left even if it doesn't exist on the right and vice versa with the right drawing we display data on the right even if it doesn't exist on the left
