okay so I've opened up PHP my admin' so we're going to be years of administering our database let's have a look at what we've already got stored now your database could obviously be different you could be using it for different purposes mine is a basic login database so this information that's stored about users is going to help us log in now that's irrelevant for now we've got an ID of six for Alex and an ID of seven for Dale now this is a unique incrementing value so what we could now do is modify our generate PHP file to take in a user's ID and what that's going to do is it's going to return their email address as we have just by typing it in here so let's just close the source on here so the first thing we need to do is connect to our database so let's go ahead and just quickly connect to our database we're going to say MySQL connect now this is very rough so don't follow my example in this sense and there is another tutorial about connecting to a database so root MySQL select dB so what we're doing now is we're selecting the database which I believe is called a underscore database so a underscore database now let's perform a query and this is going to be MySQL query and we can say select email so we're selecting the email field which is here so select email from so what our our tables called oops sorry our tables called users so let's select email from users we're ID equals and we want to specify the ID of the user and that's going to be taken in let's copy and paste this up here so query equals MySQL query select now so that ID here is going to be we'll just call this ID for now and what I'm going to do is add some just some security on to this so I'm going to enclose this in my MySQL real escape string to help prevent SQL injection okay so if is set get and this time we're going to get the value ID and we're now going to say ID equals dollar underscore get ID so now let's let me briefly take you through what I've done I've connected to the database using my over connected to the server the MySQL server using my credentials then I've selected my database now I'm checking for an ID input the idea is going to equal the input that we've specified using our get otherwise email is going to say no email specified once again so down here what we can do is perform our query which we've performed now we should retrieve some information back so I'm going to say query result is equal to MySQL result now we can specify the query that we executed and we can also specify the row which is going to be 0 because we're only going to retrieve one row and then the field here so that's going to be email so the query that we performed here the row which is going to be the 0 row which is the only row that's been returned and email there so what we could do is have checks in here to check if this exists so if the ID exists I suppose we could quickly do that now if MySQL num rows query is greater than or equal to 1 which it will never be great at the moment we can include this check anyway this comparator anyway and do then get the result otherwise email equals ID not found now what I'm going to do is I'm going to change the change the name of this query here this variable here I mean to email because the value that we're returning from this MySQL a result function is going to be the email address of the user therefore now what's going to happen is our script is going to run as normal so let's go through this again just so you make sure you entirely understand we're connecting to our database or connecting to our server selecting our database checking if this ID value which we previously had let's go back to our source we previously had as email equals this will now read ID equals and then we're going to specify a specific ID then the ID variable here is equal to what we've specified otherwise email equals no more specified as we did before now what we're doing is performing a query in fact we're going to perform this query here inside here because otherwise there's no need to continue and we'll change this to no IDs specified so sorry if that's confused to let's bring this down to make make it a bit easier to read so if if we have set this ID thing then we complete a query so query is selecting email selecting one field from the users table where our ID equals the ID that we've specified so i ID up here ID up there MySQL real escape string for a bit of security against SQL injection now we're checking if the rows returned are bigger greater than or equal to 1 so if they are greater than equal to 1 which means that we have successfully retrieved an email value we retrieve this value by using the MySQL result function now query that we've run up here 0 row which is the only road that's been returned and we're retrieving the email field otherwise email equals ID not found then we come down here and we do our checks as I've already explained in the tutorial so let's test this out after that long mouthful of explaining let's go back to index dot PHP let's first of all not specify and see if we returned with the correct error you'll see no ID specified so now let's go in and say ID equals now the ID that we have in the database the two IDs we have six and seven so let's specify this to 10 because that doesn't exist so he should when we refresh our page retrieve the result saying that we the idea is not being found so ID not found so that's fine it works now let's go back and do it sensibly so we can say six now what this should now do is retrieve the email address of user 6 and that is Alex at some domain comm so let's go over to our page and refresh and we retrieve Alex at some domain.com so not only we're converting this to text we're securely doing it because now if we look at our page source the email address doesn't exist anywhere in this code okay so our bots are going to find it harder to pick up a plain text email value so let's just try it with seven which is Dale's email address and then the tutorial will be over so let's refresh and you can see that's changed to Dale at some domain.com so that's a little bit about why you should use this method as much as possible and a really quick and easy way to do it play around with a code make it your own change colors change font sizes and I wish you the best of luck with creating this and because our functions do get a bit tricky
