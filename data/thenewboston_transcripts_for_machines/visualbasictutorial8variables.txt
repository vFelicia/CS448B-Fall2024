hello YouTube Sam from youtube.com slash on live gamer here for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about variables now variables are one of the most important parts of programming there's no possible way to make a program without variables so let's go ahead and get started and we'll create a variable here now to create a variable in Visual Basic you're going to start off with the keyword dim now what this tells the compiler is that you're going to declare a variable so if you read this right here from intellisense it says that the dim statement declares and allocates all right here declares and allocates new storage space for one or more variables so what we're going to do is when the type dim and then after this you can type whatever name you want as long as it contains valid characters now there's a list that you can find a list of valid characters online or invalid characters so we're just going to start off by calling it my num now you can name this whatever you feel like and now after we tell the compiler what the name of our variable is going to be we're going to type as so this just says specifies the data type in the declaration statement so we're just going to tell the compiler what kind of data type is going to be and so we're going to make ours an integer and so you can see that a little green line comes under that and it is a warning here and it says unused local variable not mine um so when you're making programs if you never use a variable the error list is going to tell you the warning so that you can take that out and make your program more efficient but we're going to be using mine um so we're just going to ignore that warning for right now so now what we're going to do is we're going to assign my num so type my num equals 5 now if we do console dot write line my num and then we'll do console dot read line if we go ahead and run this it's going to say five right there now what we can do is we can instead of putting this in two lines we can go ahead and set the value of our variable in the declaration line so we can set it equal to five there now the reason I showed you the two line method before that is because sometimes you're going to be declaring a variable in one of your subs and then later on in your subs you're going to be assigning that to another value now that would be a way you wouldn't want to do that so for example if I run this let's go and run this it'll say five now if I come down here I set my num equal to something else such as seven if we go ahead and run this it's going to print out seven because even though we initialize mind I'm at five after we do that it's going to read it's going to change the value of mynum to seven and it's going to write the most recent value of mynum now doesn't save the old values it just updates it so it's going to start at five which changes to seven and it prints out the seven which is the what it's currently equal to so let's go ahead and work with a another time now QB color I want tab or not caps lock tab okay so let's go ahead and get rid of my num in here and we'll declare a string so dim my string as string and we're going to set it equal to hello the new Boston fans so now if we come down here and we console dot write line we're just going to put my string as the arguments and you can see that it prints out hello the new Boston fans now if we want to do a character we can just do dim my character as Kari or s char and we'll set it equal to a or M a and if we type out my character you can see that it will print out a for s now let's go ahead and do a double really quick so if we do double then equal set it equal to five point four we go ahead and run this it will say five point four for us now let's work with a balloon real quick if we create a boolean variable we'll set it equal to either true or false so set it equal to true and we'll print out my character over here let's change this to my pool now you can see here that it prints out true now we can also set this to false and if we run this it's going to print out false now here's something that I was going to teach you guys in a later tutorial but I figured that you guys are smart so I'll go ahead and teach it to you in this tutorial now whenever you create a variable let's just do let's create an integer and we'll set it equal to 5 what we want to do is in our Castle dot write line we want to take my num and we want to convert it to a string now you may not notice any difference any differences in this but I was taught that whenever you it's good coding practice to convert numbers to strings when you're going to be printing them out anywhere on the screen such as a label or a text box or a console which is what we are working in so to convert it to a string you just do the variable that you want dot to string with empty parameters and this is going to convert your integer to a string so now if we run this you can see it prints out five but instead of printing out a number this is actually a string so that's about all I wanted to cover in the variables tutorial so I'm practicing some variables make some of your own print them out get used to what they are and then once you've got that nailed down move on to the next tutorial and don't forget to comment like and subscribe
