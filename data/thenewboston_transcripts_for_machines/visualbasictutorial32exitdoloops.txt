hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at quitting your do loops early now this will work for dowhile loops or do one two loops now if you remember back we learned how to quit for loops early now the same concept can be applied to do until and dowhile loops let's go ahead and get started and make a little demo application so go ahead and select console application and we'll type this quitting do loops go ahead and click okay so let's zoom in some here and let's go ahead and add console dot read line okay so now let's create our do until loop so let's do until num1 equals 10 then go ahead and loop now let's come up here and create num 1 so we'll declare num1 as integer and we will set it equal to zero so now it's equal to zero we're going to do until num1 equals 10 and we will console dot write line num1 so now what we're going to do is we are going to increment num1 so if you run this it's going to give us 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 now let's add a simple if statement so if num1 equals 5 then exit do so what this is going to do is whenever it comes down after they are due until statement each time it loops it's going to hit this if statement right here and then if number one is equal to five then exit the do loop so since num1 starts at zero it's going to run through this it's going to be fine and it's going to equal to one and then it's going to go down and then once it equals five it's going to exit the do so our program is going to print out 0 1 2 3 4 because it's going to exit once to equals 5 let's go ahead and run this and you can see here that we have 0 1 2 3 4 now we can also do this with a dowhile loop so do while num 1 is less than or equal to 10 so if num 1 is equal to 5 then exit the new loop let's go ahead and change this a little bit here will do if num 1 is equal to 7 so you can see here that we get 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then it exits now what we can also do is let's say our dowhile loop is not incrementing by 1 so what if it skips the number 5 well what we can do instead of if num 1 equals 5 we can do if num 1 is greater than 5 so let's just increment this by 2 and you can see here that we're going to get 0 to 4 and now you can see that it stops before it got to 5 because num 1 was greater than 5 now if we do it like this then it's going to print out all the way and this if statement is never going to run so go ahead and make a couple do until loops that exit based on certain conditions you can do it differently than I did it I encourage you to do that so you can learn more about the programming and then once you got that down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
