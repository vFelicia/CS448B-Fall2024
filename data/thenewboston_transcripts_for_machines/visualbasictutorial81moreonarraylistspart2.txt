hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at uh a more indepth look at array list now I did this in the last tutorial and this is going to be a continuation of that so what we're going to be talking about in this is removing stuff from array list and uh maybe something else if we have time for that so let's go ahead and add some more items to our array list so my array list do add We'll add 20 we'll add a couple strings and we will add let's add we can even add a Bine so my array list. add true okay so now that we've got some more stuff added to our array list we can go ahead and run this and you can see that it will print them out for us so now what we can do is we can remove items from our array list so let's just do this right before everything is printed out on the list box so we'll type my array list and then when we use dot it gives us a whole bunch of functions and sub Subs that we can use so what we're going to use is we're going to use remove so what this says is uh removes the first occurrence of a specific object objects from the systems. collections. arraylist so what this means is whatever you type in it's going to remove that so if I type in true it's going to remove the first occurrence of true which is at index uh here 0 1 2 3 4 5 so at index 5 it's going to remove true now at index index six or seven um if we add true again uh this will stay inside of our array list and this one will be taken out because as you saw it said it removes the first occurrence of it so if we type um my array list. remove true we can go ahead and run this and you can see that if we click display array list everything is here except we're missing the true that was uh somewhere right in here but you can see that the last true is still there because it removes the first occurrence now what we can also do is we can remove at so instead of remove we remove at and it says removes the element at the specific index so inside of our arguments we're going to use the index of the um place in our array list or the item so let's just remove hello and that's going to be an index of one because they always start with zero so if we remove one or remove at the index of one and click display array list we got 10 and then you can see Hello is gone and then everything else is still there now here's one thing that I would have covered in the last tutorial but I didn't want to confuse you guys um just yet so if we come up here let's just declare an array so private my array and we'll just um leave that empty as array or not as array we want it to be a string and then we'll just populate this array so we'll type Sam and then so we'll just add this stuff right here and so now we have an array that has three items at 0 1 2 and three now what if we want to add all the items of this array to our array list we could use a for Loop but there is an easier way to do this we can just type my arraylist do add range and you can see it says adds the elements of a system. collections. i col section to the end of the array list so it'll just add all of the stuff in my array to our array list so if we type add range and then my array or what it's going to do is it's going to add all of these three um strings to the end of our array list so let's go ahead and run this and you'll see how this works so we'll go ahead and click display array list and you can see that adds Sam on live gamer and YouTube because we used ad range and it adds each of the items in our array list so in this tutorial we looked at removing items from an array list by using their name and um removing them at certain index and and we also learned how to add all the items of an array to an array list so um practice that a little bit and um once you got that down move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching guys
