hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston in this tutorial we're gonna be taking a look at some chair well one jquery utility which is in array now if you've written code in PHP or any other web development backend language you'll know that you can check for a particular element by supplying the element value and this will check whether it's in an array so you have a few functions in different languages that will do this however we can do this in the front end with jQuery now this can be done in JavaScript alone as well but in jQuery we make it particularly easy now the first thing I've done is gone ahead and include this file utility s which just stands for utilities j/s and I've have this open in my text editor so we can make use of this code on the page so I'm going to go ahead and demonstrate the inner a utility first and then we'll go ahead and create a very short application that will utilize this function so I'm going to go ahead and wait for the document to be ready so this is what we would usually do in our jQuery code once the document has loaded and it's ready I'm going to go ahead and initialize or create an array so I'm going to give this a 1 I'm going to create a variable and I'm gonna give this a value of names the array name is names now inside these square brackets we can supply different values so I'm gonna give this 3 names and I'm just gonna fill in the data here so Alex Billy and then Dale ok so now what we can do is we can use the in array utility to check whether a particular element is in an array so for example if we were to specify Alex in this it would return that we have got something in an array now it's important to know what the function if you like if you want to call it a function actually returns let's say we were to use this utility and supply the value Alex now we would actually retrieve the value 0 back from this and the reason this is important is because when you're putting this into an if statement condition need to know which values it's returning or you'll get inaccurate results so if we were to go ahead and search in the array for Billy it would return the value one and that's because it's at a key index of one so it's no good just putting the inner a utility inside a condition because it may still return zero and in this case the block wouldn't run so let's go ahead and demonstrate this I'm gonna create an if statement and this condition will be it's jQuery dot in array remember in this case we have a capital I in a small I as well as the jQuery with a small J and a big Q so it is case sensitive so you need to make sure you're working with the correct case and inside of here we're gonna supply two parameters the first one is the value that we're looking for so the value of an element so I'm going to type go ahead and type in Alex in fact we'll go ahead and type in Billy first and then I'm gonna the second parameter supply the names variable so we're looking for this value Billy inside of names now usually you would just be allowed to say you know with normal functions use this condition in because it would probably a function would probably return true or false and you would expect in a ray to probably go ahead and just return true if it is found so inside this block will go ahead and alert found and you'll notice that we will return this alert because it will have even found however the only reason we're gonna actually alert out now is because Billy is at key one if we were to change this a bit later to Alex we wouldn't get this alert box out so let's go ahead and refresh and you can see we've got a dialog box hang found let's go ahead and change this value now to Alex and see what happens remember this function will now return zero that's refresh and you see nothing happens so we need to check this that it doesn't equal to a particular value and this value is minus one if a key is not found in a and array or an element isn't found in an array this function here this in a red function will return minus one so we want to say where it doesn't equal mine one and in this case it will you know return Allah regardless of the fact that Alex is at position zero because zero doesn't equal minus one so now when we refresh you see we have the found dialog box okay let's go ahead and create a sample application I'm gonna get rid of this code here and I'm gonna return to index dot PHP and we'll just go ahead and type out a form a quick and basic form I'm gonna have an input type with text so we're gonna allow the user to enter some text and I'm gonna give this an ID of name just after this I'm gonna create a button so input type button and the value of this I'm just going to say check so the ID of this we could just call check so now we can create an event handler for check and then pick up the value that's been entered into the name and then go ahead and put that into an if statement so we're creating something the user can actually use so the first thing we want to do inside here is we want to create an event handler for our check button so we say check click and inside here we want to go ahead and create a function pull that down bit so it's easier for us to write inside or to view and once we've once we've clicked the textbox we want to go ahead and set the variable name of the value of inside of this text field so let's go ahead and create a new variable called name and that's going to be equal to the value of our name text box so that's dot Val quite simple so now that we've stored this name we can go ahead and utilize this in array utility in jQuery and check whether this name that the user has entered is actually inside this array so for now I'm gonna go ahead and just alert out name just to check that everything's working I'll go ahead and refresh and type in a name here click check and that gives us the value back so we know what that we're passing the value into this name variable okay so now what I'm going to go ahead and do is perform an if statement and this if statement is going to be jQuery in array and then we supplied with two parameters the first one is the name that we're looking for and then the array name now if this doesn't equal minus one we can go ahead and alert out something otherwise we want to go ahead and alert something so essentially what we're doing is if the if the element has been found we want to alert something if it hasn't been found we also want to alert something and this is just going to be named and appending on is in the array and for the fact if it hasn't you know if this returns anything else than minus one we're going to go ahead and say name plus is not in the array okay so now let's go ahead and test this when we refresh we can type in a name so I'm going to type in Alex and you'll see it says Alex is in the array let's go ahead and type another name that's in that array so Billy click check Billy is in the array now let's go ahead and type a name that isn't actually in the array click check and it tells us that is not in the array so lastly why might you use this well you might want to store say something that the user has given on the front end either temporarily inside of an array in JavaScript on the front end of your document rather than transferring the data for example to PHP or another web development language so using arrays saves time so you can go ahead and create an array like this and add elements to an array as you usually would and then you can use this in a way there are some other functions such as is array and make array which will convert arrays but we're not going to be covering them because I think the in array is probably the most used utility as part of this jQuery set so that's just a quick demonstration of in array and how you can check values inside a specific array with jQuery
