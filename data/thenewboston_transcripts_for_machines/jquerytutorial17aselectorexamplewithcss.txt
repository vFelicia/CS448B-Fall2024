hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston now we've already looked at quite a few selectors in jQuery but now we're going to take a look at an example using CSS and the CSS manipulator now the CSS manipulator is essentially something that will change a value of a particular element by feeding it the element the the style name if you like and then the value so let's go ahead and take a look at a quick example let's go ahead and create a paragraph and we are not going to give this an ID because we're going to be selecting it by the fact it is a paragraph and let's just type some text inside of here okay so we've already includes the included selectors yes and we have that open in our text editor now what we want to do is we want to go ahead and create a button just up here and I'm going to go ahead and and I'm not going to give this a and ID because we're going to reference it by the fact is a button I'm going to give the value click so over in our browser you'll see that we have a click and then we have some text now we're going to use some jQuery selectors to first of all select the fact this button has been clicked and then we're going to highlight this text here by giving it a background color in CSS okay so over to selectors is we want to first of all use the button selector so I'm going to use the button selector here and when that button is clicked or when any button on the page is clicked we want to carry out a function inside of here so we're using this event handler to perform a particular function so we have the button selector we have the click event handler and then we have a function inside here inside this block of code which will just bring down slightly we are going to change the color of the background of this paragraph okay so now what we need to do is we need to reference this the well every paragraph on a page so we're going to use the P selector here which will select them every paragraph on a page at the moment because this is just an example if you had more paragraphs on a page it would highlight every single paragraph so please be aware that I'm just selecting all paragraph elements on the page now we're then going to use the CSS manipulator to change all of the properties of the P the first parameter we give it is the style name so this is background color or the reference to the style and then we give it a value so I'm going to give this a value of yellow what we could also actually do is change this to black for example and then we could use CSS again to then change the color of the text to white so you can use hex codes in here so for example you could use hash 0 0 0 and for this you could use hash FFF so what now what's now going to happen is when we press a button on a page the paragraphs are going to turn with the background color black and the foreground color white so let's go and test this out when we click here you can see that the background color of this paragraph has been changed to black and the text color has been changed to white
