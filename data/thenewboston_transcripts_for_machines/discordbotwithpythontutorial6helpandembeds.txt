all righty guys welcome back to another tutorial and in this one we are going to be covering the help command and also embeds now i know this sounds kind of boring the help command oh my god that's like the most boring thing we could talk about but it actually is a very important part of bot development because even if you have the coolest spot in the entire world if no one knows how to use it or if it's confusing then it's never going to be popular so what i did is i copied over the source code from the last tutorial and i removed some functions just because i want to have some simple commands so basically we have two commands the punch and the roundhouse kick now what i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be removing the dock string from this round house kick and this is just to demonstrate something in a second and then for this punch doc string i will say this command punches another player we'll pretend we're making a game or something all right now the reason i changed that is to demonstrate this concept right here i'm going to go ahead and run this bot and pop open discord and i'm going to use my command prefix and just type help now before i hit enter i want to point out that i do not have a help command written i only wrote two commands and that is punch and roundhouse kick those commands that we wrote in the last tutorial so now let me go ahead and hit enter right here and you can see that indeed tutorialbot did respond and that is because this library comes basically with a default help command and some logic built in around it so it's gonna basically tell you the instructions of your commands it's gonna take its best guess help this was again the one that we didn't write it just says shows this message now punch remember we have a doc string and the comment we left is this command punches another player so that is where this is pulling this from and then roundhouse kick we don't have any dog string so that's why it said nothing so just to reiterate the help command is gonna go through look at all your commands and then for any description text it's going to pull those from the docs strings now this is great and all but let's say we want to write our own custom help command and you're going to be doing this like 95 of the time so how do we do that well let me go ahead and just copy this because i'm a little bit lazy and instead of punch i'm just going to name this help all right so the help for this example we're actually going to be removing this argument because whenever you type help like this you don't pass anything in after it you just basically type help and that's it so now how do we overwrite this well let's say that instead of the default text that we sent back to the user which had all that standardized builtin logic let's say that instead we want to send back just a simple string that says this is a this is a custom help command all right so we weren't digging that default help command so we decided to write our own now let me go ahead and run this and um what is this right there i'm getting an error and all i was trying to do is overwrite this default help command well check this out in order to actually overwrite the default help command there is one more bit of code that you need and that is bot dot remove command and in here you need to explicitly say that you are removing the default help command and now if you go ahead and rerun this all right no errors that's always a good thing now when we go ahead and type help instead of this default logic that it returned the first time it now is returning our own custom logic and this says this is the custom help command all right so that's pretty cool that's how we can standardize a string output but what i want to do now is just spice this up a little bit make it look a little bit better so let's go ahead and plop back in our source code and learn about embeds now in bed i'm sure you guys saw it before you may have not known that it was called an embed but it's that fancy output that usually has a color on the left hand side and if you don't know what i'm talking about well you'll see in just a one second so either way if you make a variable called embed and set it equal to discord dot embed just like that then let's go ahead and just create one real quick just to see what it is so i'm going to give this a title and i'm going to say the title is going to be bot command since this embed element is going to override that default text that we're printing out right here so the title of this embed is going to be bot commands and again we're going to be adding some more information to this embed but just to show you guys what the heck this thing is let me go ahead and run this and now let me plop open discord again and write help and there you go so it's this element right here and even though the default color is like dark gray or black this is usually like red or green or we can actually customize this color and well let's go ahead and do that right now so like i said you can customize the color of that lefthand bar some other cool things that you can do is forgot my comma here is you can leave a description and we'll say um okay so this is going to be overriding the help command so we'll say welcome to the help section here are all the commands for this game all right looking beautiful so this is of course going to add the description now we said we're going to override that color so what what spelling do we want to go with we'll go with the american one here so so in order to add a color you add the color attribute and the value is just going to be equal to discord now we are going to be using the color class and make sure that this is the one with the uppercase c and then from here whenever you press period if you have autocomplete then it's going to give you all the available colors but let's see let's just choose uh green nice and simple and all right our embed is looking good let me go ahead and rerun this and we will see what we got going on so i'm gonna type help and there you go so we got our title our nice little description now and now we got a beautiful green outliner border or whatever it's called all right what else can we do with this embed well one thing that you can do if you ever saw an embed they have images embedded in there that is called the thumbnail so if we go embed dot set thumbnail then we can pass in a url and i actually have i wonder if this one works so let me copy it image address this is just a profile photo um of my github it's basically my face as you guys are going to see in just a second but um in addition to setting a thumbnail or having an image in your embed whenever people want to add actual documentation for the commands what they do is they add those as fields so if you type embed add field then what you can do is you can give each field a name a value and then specify if it's in line or not and i'll show you guys the difference between inline and not inline so the name of this first field again what you can just list out is the command name and then for the value this is basically going to be the description and i'll say that the help command um we'll say uh list all of the commands and first let me just go ahead and set inline to true and then i'll run this in set in line to false and then we can see the difference between those so i already have the field for the help command now let me just do the punch and the roundhouse kick so copy and paste that twice all right so the second one will be punch and the third one will be roundhouse kick and we'll say punch what do we have right here this command punches another player and we'll just keep it simple actually let's say punch another play and then we'll say roundhouse kick another player alright so our embed is now styled we should now have an image appearing in it and then we have three fields that we added to symbolize our three commands that we have in there so let me go ahead and run this bad boy and pop open discord and all right so now let me go ahead and write help again and there you go so there is my uh beautiful face and same stuff as before however now we have three fields where it just you know kind of spices up the documentation now right now remember this is with inline true so they appear all next to each other and i'm sure you guys can guess with that little hint what's going to happen when we write inline false spoiler alert spoiler alert they are just going to appear on top of each other so let me go ahead and run that one more time and then you guys are going to get a nice comparison here with inline true this is what the commands look like with inline false they just stack right on top of each other so check this out we went from this fugly looking help command to this nice beautiful gorgeous hope command i mean there you go that is an embed right there and again embeds don't only have to be used with the help command you can actually use those in other places as we're going to see in the upcoming tutorials but there you go that's the basics of help and embeds i hope you liked the tutorial and i will see you guys next time
