hello youtube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be working more on the car tutorial now this isn't familiar then go ahead and move on to the beginning of the car tutorials so let's go and get started if you remember we created a public variable called car name as a string now we're gonna go ahead and do this for each of the text field text fields so we'll just type public car color as a string it looks like I forgot to rename text box one but it's actually the color of the car so we'll just type car color equals text box one dot text so whatever the change the text is going to update our car color variable so we can go ahead and get these out of the way because we're not using them okay so now whenever the we'll come over here to new murders and whenever the value has changed we want to store that value and update it in the code so we'll create an integer value so public car doors as integer so whenever they change the value of the numeric picker doors we're gonna go ahead and set car doors it's going to be equal to new murders dot and now we are going to access the value and if you read the description says gifts are set the value assigned to the spin box so when you're using the equals so it's gonna be well this is on the right side of the equals so it's gonna be getting if we had new murders start value equals car doors we'd be calling set so car doors is gonna be set to the value of new murders go ahead and make some room there and let's do that again for the horsepower so we'll just go ahead we'll make the horsepower this string I have a string type so they can type whatever they want there and we're not gonna get any errors because it's trying to convert that to an integer so Otis type public car horse as string and whenever they update the horsepower we'll just type car horse equals text horse dot text so now that we've stored all of the values we're gonna need to know let's go back into our form 1vv code and so we're gonna use with new car 1 new car one car name is going to be equal to you can see we've got new car right here so we're just gonna type add new car which is the object of new car and we're gonna get to cover the public variable car name and now we're going to access the color we'll set that equal to add new car dot let's see car color and then we're going to need to do the number of doors and the horsepower so dot horsepower and we'll set that equal to add a new car dot and we're going to add we're gonna do a car horse and then we'll do it with the number of doors well so then equal to add new car dot car doors so we set the values that we're gonna need for our new car one now there's an easier way to other well not easier there's a more efficient way of doing this instead of creating a new car object every time they create this let's just go ahead and use the using keyword so we'll just type using new car one as new all cars.com so then we'll add the end using so let's see here looks like we're getting an error see using operator type must implement systems huh we're gonna have to come over here into our all cars dot V B file and for our class car we're going to how to type implements I disposable so now we can use the using keyword when creating our new car let's find the code right here okay so once it's done creating the car we're gonna want to add that to the list so let's type cars dot add and then we'll just add new car one so it's gonna create that car and it's gonna add it to the list and it's going to destroy the car that was created now we'll go ahead and let's see we need to add we need to access the button click event for add and we'll type me dot close now what this is gonna do is it's going to close out of the dialog that we currently have open now we'll be covering the cancel later on because now even if they click cancel it's going to add that car to the list and we're gonna be working on making it not at the car to the list when I hit cancel so we'll start debugging and see if we get the results that we wanted so we'll type will click new car and it opens up our new car dialog you see that we can't go back to form one so let's set the name of the car lets do a Dodge Charger set the color of the car to black we'll set the number of doors equal to four and we'll give it three horsepower we'll go ahead and click add and you can see that it added the car to the ArrayList but it did not add the car to the list box so what we're gonna need to do is we'll type list cars dot idem Zaid and we will add new car one and we just want to go ahead and get the car name for that so whatever the name is it's going to be added to that and the index will correspond to the index in our cars ArrayList so we'll do this once more look like new car name of the car will be the Dodge Charger color of car will be black it has four doors and 300 horsepower well click Add and you can see that I add the Dodge Charger to the list and we can show the info of the CRV the Mustang and then when we get down to Dodge Charger when we show the info that we get car name Dodge Charger car color is black the number of doors is four and the car speed is zero sorry about that alarm that went off but anyways the car name is dasha Roger black number of doors is four so in the next tutorial we're gonna be talking about using the cancel button so it does not add the car to the list box so go ahead and put this code in if you have it already you can pause it right here if you to do that and then once you're done with that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
