oh gosh will come to your 11th actually had to think about that for a second welcome to your 11th JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about something called global and local variables so the concept of a global variable is simple it's any variable that you make that's outside any function and a local variable is simple it's any variable that you create inside the body of a function so I mean there are only two places you can make them simple enough but the rules when you use them they get kind of tricky so let me go ahead and show you guys let me first demonstrate what a global variable is and when you're allowed to use it let's go ahead and make a variable called Girl and I'll set it equal to the name of my first girlfriend called Kelsey I'm sure she will appreciate that so Kelsey if you're reading this what's up and so by the way she wasn't technically my first girlfriend I had a girlfriend in fourth grade named Nicole but we really didn't weren't boyfriendgirlfriend she just let me played with her Giga pet it wasn't nothing serious Kelsey I actually wound my first date with her we went and saw what was it the wedding singer with Adam Sandler and he had a mullet and I was extremely nervous the whole time hey I was in fifth grade give me a break guys and her mom drove us there in her van but still was pretty cool so anyways let's go ahead and make a function right now and we'll call this spit it really doesn't matter what you name it I'm gonna name it spit because it's gonna spit out this name so all this function is going to do is document dots right out on the screen the name of that variable girl now check the cell like I said you can make variables in one or two places inside the function right here or outside of the function where we made this girl since this variable is outside of the function we are allowed to use it inside the function right here now let's go ahead and let me prove it to you right now let's just go ahead and call spit it and when I run that line of code it's going to type out Kelsey and now let me go ahead and document dot right that variable and then this is going to print out Kelsey so anyways the point I'm trying to get across is whenever you have a variable outside of function you can use it both in the function and anywhere else in the program so let me go ahead and refresh this and it says Kelsey Kelsey just as we predicted simple enough but now let's go ahead and take this variable cut it and there we go and let's go ahead and make it inside this function right here so now inside this function we created a variable called Girl and we're going to try to run it inside this function and outside the function so now let's go ahead and refresh and it actually had to save that and refresh and we see we only get one Kelsey well why is that we made the variable it didn't have any typos we didn't forget to semicolon or anything so why is this Kelsey only appearing once well like I said with global variables whenever you create a variable outside your function you could use it in any function you want and also anywhere else in your program but whenever you create a variable that's inside a function you can only use that variable inside that function if we had another function we couldn't use it in that if we had another function could use it in that and we're not allowed to use it outside that function this function is very greedy it says whatever my variable is I create there mine no one else is getting them boy so that's why whenever we call it spit it printed out Kelsey because this was the function and then when we tried to just use it on our own it wouldn't let us because it said all right the variable that I curry it's mine I get to keep it so that's why it only printed out once that was the functions call not the one outside so anyways the point I'm trying to get across global variables when they're created outside any function you can use them anywhere inside functions outside functions whatever but whenever you create a variable inside a function it's called a local variable and that variable can only be used within the function in which it's declared aka created so that is your basics of global and local variables in yes that is the technical term from global and local so if you have a test it's okay to write global and local so thank you guys for watching I think you guys for putting up with my history of fifth grade girlfriends and I hope you enjoyed and hey again Kelsey if you're watching what's up
