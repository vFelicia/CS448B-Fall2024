all right guys welcome to your 59th actually I think it's your 59th I never check and make sure what tutorial I'm doing before I start recording probably should do that but anyways I think it's your 59 tutorial so welcome and now that you guys understand the basics of MAA what it is how it's used and kind of the neat little overview of Mata I can begin talking to you guys about the more intricate details of Mata so the very first thing I want to mention is how to open Mata so we have a couple options here the two most common are if if you go ahead and click this little director's board you can go ahead and open Mata for your scene or what you typically want to do is open Kismet and Kismet and mat are kind of like real close cousins whenever you're working with mat you're probably working with Kismet and a lot of time whenever you're working with Kismet you're going to be working with matina so if you go ahead and you have a MAA in your Kismet go ahead and double click that and it's going to open up the matina as well so now what I can do is I can actually let me go ahead and slide this over there and well let me go ahead and talk about our Mata object right here first so whenever we have a matina object it has inputs on the leftand side and outputs on the right hand side just like any other you know action or any other object we would add so the inputs of course play you know what that does reverse reverses your animation stop pauses your animation change direction again these are all selfexplanatory um outputs are pretty selfexplanatory to whenever your animation completes it's going to fire this little completed right here and if it's reversed it's going to fire this however two things that probably aren't as selfexplanatory is this data and this door moving variable right here this data object basically stores how your animation should be played it pretty much stores all that key Frame data and timing data so you can actually go ahead ahead and copy this and stick it on another MAA and you basically would have the exact same MAA so just remember this data stores all the animation data of how and when your animation should play now this variable right here these are going to be changing depending on how your matina is set up since we have a door moving if I scroll you can see that this is the thing that's moving we now have an interb actor which is actually that door that is automatically built into our MAA sequence so if we wanted to go ahead and you know decide that we want another door to stick in there all we'd have to do is change this variable and now it would play the exact same animation with a different variable so again these MAA objects are pretty selfexplanatory you just got to watch out for the data and basically what object is your animation using and that's what this is right here and those will change so now let me go ahead and talk about the the MAA window I guess I'll go ahead and just talk about the toolbar first so at the very top probably the most common toolbar you're going to be using except for this big timeline um let me go ahead and scroll out to give a better view so I can demonstrate some of the stuff so the very first thing I want to mention is this add key frame so we can actually add key frames and remember I talked about key frames in the last Toro in a couple ways we can go ahead and slide this time slider to wherever we want to add a key frame and we can go ahead head and select the track we want to use and hit enter and it will go ahead and as you can see it'll add a key frame right there or what we could do if we rightclick that we can delete that key frame we can go ahead and hit this and it'll add a key frame there as well so you know whatever floats your boat you can use whatever method you want so I'm going to go ahead and right click and delete that and I'm done with that this next little drop down list has to do with a curve editor and we're going to be talking about that in a few seconds but for now just hold on so these other things are play your animation so if you go ahead and bring your animation back to the beginning and you play it check it out in my perspective view it's going to play my animation right there pretty cool huh now this Loop play we're going to be talking about that in like a couple minutes but anyways we're just talking about these other ones for now the stop animation if you play it you can go ahead and stop it and you can go ahead and play it in reverse again all selfexplanatory now this right here is the speed of your animation so if you have a really intricate animation and you want to make sure it's working exactly how you want you can go ahead and slow the speed down to like 25 and then play it and it'll play only 25% as fast AKA a quarter slow I don't even know how to say 25% as fast as it normally would so basically take four times longer so I'm going to go ahead and leave it at 100 now undo and redo you obviously know what those mean and now I guess I'll talk to you guys about the curve editor by default you have another section in here that's hidden if you go ahead and click this it's going to bring up this section called The Curve editor and if you still can't see it if you go to window you have another option of viewing it and hiding it right there so what the curve editor is is it's basically a section that you know how I told you guys that you're going to go ahead and make keys in keys are pretty much like checkpoints and the udk takes care of all the in between stuff well with a curve editor you can actually edit that in between stuff but we're not going to be really messing with it in these tutorials because the udk typically does a pretty good job of handling that in between stuff so I'm going to go ahead and hide that for now and move on so this next thing I want oh by the way this has to deal that curve editor too so again this and this button right here we're not going to going to be using all that much so the next thing I want to talk to you guys about is toggle snap now this toggle snap and the snap size kind of go hand in hand whenever you want to move Keys you can go ahead and hold down control and move your keys just like you know you can move I don't know anything so as you notice we have these gray lines that kind of indicate the half second marks of our timeline so we can go ahead head and if we have snap enabled whenever we try to move our keys our keys are going to pop to those half second marks so if you want to keep everything nice and even it's a good idea to toggle snap also if you want to pop everything you know bigger or smaller you know like pop everything to a second we can go ahead and have some bigger snaps but typically you want to use that at like you know 05 and if you're working in really intricate animation where every millisecond counts you're going to want to go ahead and UNT tole that snap so you have full control over your key frames so now um this fit view to sequence and all these buttons right here just pretty much give you a customized view depending on what you want to look at but typically I just like to use my scroll wheel on my mouse to scroll out I think it's a little easier to see and these buttons right here we won't really uh get involved with so basically that's a real quick overview of the toolbar and also the MAA object and in the next tutor I'm going to be covering hopefully the rest of this stuff right here so for now thank you guys for watching and I will see you guys later
