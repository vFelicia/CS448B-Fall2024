hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our FTP downloader so if you remember from the previous tutorial we added this notify new file icon um which is a notify icon now what we need to do is set an icon for this so that it'll show up in our system tray so let's just use this star right here now this star is going to be used in the next series of tutorials where we create a favorites viewer but we can also use it for this too so we're going to have a star for our icon so we'll come back here and we'll go to form one. VB and hold on here okay so what we need to do sorry about that I had to look at uh my previous project that I that I had created so what we need to do is show the user that a new file has been found so we'll type notifi new file. show balloon tip now a balloon tip is one of those things uh if you're on Windows right now a balloon tip is when you see a little balloon looking thing pop out from one of your icons in your system tray and it tells you something now you may have seen this with um a Windows updater or something like that um and it has a little has a little x button on it so this is going to take some arguments we're going to need the timeout so let's set the timeout to 10 seconds now this is in milliseconds so what we need to do is put 10,000 milliseconds which is going to be equal to 10 seconds now the next thing we need to do is set the title of the tip now to show tool balloon tips you have to use uh a notify icon because there has to be an icon in the tray for you to show a balloon tip you can't do it from an icon in the taskbar so let's set the title to new file file and we'll just set the text to the new file found is and then we'll just go ahead and add let's see file do fil name. twring or file name is already a string so we can just leave it like that and then the tip icon is going to be tool tip icon doino so this will set the icon of our tool tip now let's go ahead and run this and you can see here that we've got start checking for new files so if I click this it's going to say um it's going to check for new files now that just showed up uh a whole bunch of balloon tips because it did that for each one of these because it did not contain it so we'll go to home home directory and let's see here we need to change this to let's see so it looks like it's not um changing our uh text for this so let's go ahead and we'll copy this go ahead and paste that right there and then paste that right there so so we'll get rid of this and we'll set checking to true to begin with okay so now let's run this again and if we start checking for new files ah there we go that was the problem it changed the text of this instead of this um because I didn't use very good names so let's just undo this stuff we did here and that's not what I wanted to do okay so instead of button check for new files we want button let's see start check timer so we'll just copy this and we will paste it right here Ah that's not where we want to paste it we want to paste it um right here okay so now if we go ahead and run this if we click start checking for new files you can see it changes to stop and it shows us a balloon tip down here now let me pause right here and I will try to show the balloon tip okay so I've moved the recording down to here and let's just go ahead uh we'll clear the list and then you can see that because it's checking for new files it gives us a balloon tip that says new file found is youtube. text now it actually did that for each one of these but it scrolled through so fast that you couldn't see it so we can stop checking for new files and then we can clear and then every tenth of a second it's going to check to see if there's a new file so it's going to say new file found so if we upload a file so let's say we upload um the dragon we can go ahead and we'll see that it's going to check and find the dragon now let's see here actually that will not um trigger this to tell us as a new file because when we upload it's going to refresh the list by itself and so it's going to see that that file is already in there so we'll go ahead and close out of so go ahead put this code in if you haven't already um and you should get the complete program to where you can do a whole bunch of stuff with FTP and you can have it check for new files and notify you when that happens so thanks for watching guys and stay tuned for the next tutorial
