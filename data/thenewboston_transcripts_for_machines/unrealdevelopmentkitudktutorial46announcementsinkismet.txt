alright guys welcome to your 46th udk tutorial and in this is oral I'm going to teach you guys how to make text appear on your screen sounds pretty basic right but check it out whenever you want to give your user a set of instructions or directions or maybe you just want to you know output a nice little message saying hey what's up what are you doing tonight well you want some text to appear on their screen so there's actually a little more kismet involved than you may think so if all along with this story and by the end you'll be a pro at making text appear on the screen so before I even get started with that part of the tutorial I want to tell you guys this I probably should tell you guys this in the last tutorial but typically whenever you work with triggers you just don't go ahead and rightclick in to add actor add trigger and give a nice little big green trigger that the user can interact with when they're playing the game you typically don't want the user or player to see that in the game so you typically put the trigger inside a static mesh so let me go ahead and explain this a little bit better I have a static mesh right here that looks like a control panel and usually you want to have the user interact with something like a control panel or a workstation or maybe a light switch or something so go ahead and let me just drag this out right there and now you see this is a lot more appealing to the user rather than a big green switch on the screen so this is typically what you would have something like this now this is of course is just a static mesh it doesn't have any functionalities basically just a 3d model so what we would want to add is that trigger right next to it so go ahead and hit add actor add trigger and hello let me know reposition that move down a little bit and actually let me go ahead and change views if I move that right underneath there we go right now so as you can see what would be going on is behind the scenes we would have this trigger right next to the static mesh but whenever the user was playing the game all they would see is this static mesh so they would think that they were interacting with this 3d model but we would know as the game developer that they are indeed standing in the radius of the static mesh which is causing the program to interact because you know you can't really interact with static meshes only these triggers so go ahead and position your trigger somewhere around the static mesh and then whenever the user is standing right there they're going to be able to interact with that so now that we got our trigger on the screen again like I said I want to give you guys the story of how to make text up here on the screen so go ahead and like I said make sure you have your trigger selected and open unreal kismet by hitting that K button and now make sure your trigger selected and right click and hit new event using trigger now in the last tutorial I thought you guys about the touch event which pretty much means your player runs up and stands on your trigger or touches it well let's go ahead and use the used event trigger right now and what used means is the user or player needs to hit a key in order to switch that trigger so by default it's the e key so if the user goes and stands where the static meshes and they hit e on their keyboard then whatever we program this trigger do that's what's going to happen so let me go ahead and actually want to change a few things the first thing we want to change is aim to interact this means if you have this selected the user needs to be looking directly at the trigger so this would actually work if we position this trigger right inside the static mesh but since it's kind of you know underneath it and all around it we don't want a man in there interact and also a max trigger count go ahead and set this to zero because remember from the last tutorial zero means infinite so now we got our trigger right here so now let's do something cool that in order to add text to the screen we need to add something called an announcement and in order to do that go ahead and right click to the right of your event and hit new action and under the voice and announcements category you were going to want to hit play announcement now text on the screen and then announcement are basically the exact same thing so whenever that says play announcement we're going to give it some text to pop up on the screen and also has the option of playing a sound as well so the very first thing we wanted to do is tell the UDK all right whenever we use our trigger go ahead and play our announcement so that's what we're telling it to do via this wire right here and now you're saying all right so how the heck does the UDK know what text the make appear on the screen well let's go ahead and change that right now if you go ahead and let's take a look at some of these properties under announcement right here we have to sub properties the first one is the announcement sound and by default it has no sound which pretty much means text is going to pop up on your screen but it's not going to play you know any sound so if you're familiar with xscape or anything whenever you send a message to your friends a little blue place a nice little sound so let's go ahead and give us sound right now and the easiest way to do this is if we go in the content browser and just go ahead and deselect everything clear clear clear go ahead and look for a sound start double clicking all right I know you guys can't hear any of this but we're looking for a sound note wave and by the way I know that you guys can hear sound and that's because I switch from my old screen recorder to Camtasia again and that's just because I like Camtasia better so you know just pretend oh ah you know give me my voice over what sound sound like so go ahead and hit this green button and it's going to use your currently selected sound which kind of sounds like this oh that is actually a pretty pretty good example so now the announcement text is what text do you want to have up here on the screen and we're just right lucky is awesome like a hoss and now with that I'll programmed in we're going to go so again make sure you have your trigger event and then make sure for your play announcement that you have an announcement sound which is optional and an announcement text which is kind of required so now let's go ahead and X out of that and we'll just go ahead and right click and hit play from here so by default if we run up to our switch nothing happens and also it doesn't look as cool as it should because I didn't rebuild my lighting but for the sake of this tutorial this nice little black static mesh will do just fine so remember we're touching the trigger and nothing's happening and that's because this is a touch trigger anymore it's a used trigger so now let me go ahead and hit the e key and now as you can see it says Bucky is awesome like a hoss and I know you guys can't hear this but every time I hit it goes so yeah I'm sorry that I had to switch programs and you guys can't hear my awesome sounds but trust me they're there and that's how you do it so again um well that's basically all that I have to say in this story so I hope you guys enjoyed it I think you guys for watching and I'll see you guys next time
