all right y'all welcome back to another tutorial and in this one we're going to be talking about ether so where to start how about what the heck is ether great question so ethereum's unit of currency is called you guessed it ether and you need ether to do pretty much anything on the network aside from some very basic things like you can read data from the network for free but let's just say that you need ether to do anything interesting on the ethereum network so let's go ahead and start with the most simple use case and that is whenever one user has some ether and they just want to transfer it to another user so say that this user just got done watching the new boston tutorial on ethereum and they thought it was pretty cool decided to buy let's see one two three four ether right here so they told their friend about it and their friend thought it was pretty cool too so this person decided to transfer to ether to someone else's account maybe their friend their moms their brother sister whoever so what they can do is issue a command to the ethereum network and say hey i want to take to my ether and send them to someone else another account so the ethereum network can do that and after this it would update their balance from four to two and it'll update the recipients from let's say they had zero before so zero to two all right so in this way it's it's basically just acting as a transfer money or in other words you can view ether as a standard unit of currency now i do want to mention that even in the simple transfers of ether it is going to require the user to pay a fee in ether and that is because even though it's uh you know pretty simple math just saying you know deduct some ether from this account and add it to this account what this user is essentially doing is instructing the ethereum network to do some amount of work and all of these computers all of these node maintainers they just don't want to you know spin up their servers and do everything for free so the ethereum network does require a small fee even for these simple transactions now another thing that i want to mention real quick is that you'll often hear people saying things like hey send me five ethereum or hey i'm going to send you three ethereum now ethereum is technically the name of the network so this isn't correct terminology although you know i'm guilty of uh using incorrect terminology a lot however in this case i do want to point out that what they actually mean is hey send me five ether or i'm gonna send you five ether so ethereum is the name of the overall network and ether is the unit of currency used by ethereum now aside from just simple transactions of ether from one person to another ether is also needed for dapps developers they need ether to actually create these smart contracts and pretty much issue them or deploy them to the network and another thing is that ether is also needed to execute these smart contracts or run them whenever they are on the network and i know we didn't cover that process of deploying or executing smart contracts yet but just keep in mind for now that ether is needed for dapps now another interesting note is that ether can be further divided into smaller units called whey now one ether is actually equal to one quintillion way so this diagram is not exactly accurate for purposes of not wanting my computer to explode i decided it was best to not render one quintillion one quintillion way on here but just remember that one ether is equal to one quintillion way and that is 10 to the 18th and wei is indeed the most base or in other words the most atomic unit of ether so you can't split up a way now if you are interested in developing smart contracts you're actually going to be working with whey quite a bit and just to make it easier in everyone's head there are a lot of tools out there to convert way to ether so say that you wanted to i don't know maybe make a smart contract that was distributing like uh to ether to someone now if you wanted to convert that to whey instead of you know having a piece of paper or calculator there are actually a lot of different converters online if you just type in ether to weight converter there's going to be a ton that pop up but let's say you type in two ether right here then it's gonna do all the conversions and you can see that this is two quintillion way now there are also a lot of different units in between there but the most common ones are just ether and way to be honest no one really uses these other units that often gray is one that's i see sometimes use but really if you just know whey in ether then you're gonna be fine now the last thing that i want to touch on in this video is how is ether created or in other words where does it come from so whenever new ether is created it's distributed to the nodes in exchange for their help in participating and securing the network however when new ether is created it is not just split up and distributed evenly to all nodes the new ether is distributed to one node at a time through a process called mining and i'm sure you heard of this before but we are going to review mining in more detail in the upcoming course for right now i just want to give you a very high level overview to really just focus on the core concept of ether and mention that that is how it gets created or minted into the network so for now i think that covers everything that we need to discuss about ether for the time being so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and i will see you later
