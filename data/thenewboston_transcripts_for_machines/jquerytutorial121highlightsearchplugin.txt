hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be installing a plugin and using it on our page here where we have a paragraph of text now what we're going to be doing is we're going to be installing this particular plugin here found at this web address just here so if you want to go ahead and just go ahead and type this into your browser you can come on you'll obviously come on to the page and we'll look at downloading it and installing on here and the first we're going to be looking at it in terms of sending a variable to the particular page for example at the moment we're on index dot PHP and we're going to be highlighting a particular word so for example search and the first thing that this will do is it will it will highlight any keywords with the other word any words on the page with the search term search so this word here will be searched will be highlighted for example if we would change this to a for example every letter in here with a would be highlighted just here so let's go ahead and first of all look at how we're going to install this plugin and then we'll go ahead and actually create this in this way we're then going to be creating a more dynamic search on our page using jQuery to actually search so we're first of all going to be using a form that will submit this get variable and then secondly we'll look at actually installing it with a button and an event handler so like I said if you go over to this page we can come down here you can see a demo of this but we'll skip that just for now and you can download this file here jQuery highlight is so I'm going to go ahead and click on that and this just gives me the code for this plugin so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and copy that and open up my text browser sorry my text editor you can see I've got ext dot J s which is already included in my page and I've got style dot CSS which is included as a stylesheet up here we're going to be creating our form just here but first of all we want to go ahead and create a file for this plugin and also then include that on the page so the first thing we want to do is create a new document and just paste the contents of this plugin in we want to go ahead and save that in our J's folder and I'm just going to save this as highlight j/s so now I've saved this file we can confidently go ahead and just close that off now but now we need to go ahead and include it on our page now ext look j/s is where we're going to handle our jQuery and so we're going to do that in just a moment however we need to go ahead and include this and include this plugin first so let's go ahead and say script type equals and we'll just close our script tag off there it's a text JavaScript type so text JavaScript and the source we just need to go ahead and include j/s forward slash and then we saved it as highlight j/s so now that we've got this plugin available to use we can actually go ahead and use it now what I'm going to do is I'm not going to include the original functionality that I said with regards to highlight equals search I just feel this is going to be a bit too sort of longwinded and everything we're going to need an additional plugin to read the variables as well so what I'll go ahead and do is we'll just go and do the jQuery where I guess that's a bit more appropriate as well so okay inside another paragraph tag I want to go ahead and create my form so at the moment on my page we just have this sort of paragraph of text now what we want to go ahead and do is just create our first of all a text input type so text like that and then we want to go ahead and create a submit button as well or just a plain button so the type in this case it's going to be button so the value here of the button is going to just be find and you'll see that gives us the result here we've got a text input field and a fine button so we're going to go ahead and type something into here click find and the relevant information is going to be highlighted on the page now as part of this as part of this plugin we're going to need to specify a highlight class inside star dot CSS and obviously this can be tailored to how you want the particular word to be highlighted for example you could just want it bold or you know in any case it doesn't really matter in this case we're just going to highlight it with a background of yellow just to keep things simple so we need a way to reference these input fields or you know this input button as well using jQuery so we're going to need to go ahead and give these an ID so this one here will sorry ID this one here is going to be search underscore term so we can use that to grab the value of the text that we've typed and here I'm going to call this search underscore button okay so now that we've done this nothing on our page has change we just have our text field and find but we need to go into ext dot j s to actually pick up and apply an event handler to this button which will then in turn grab the value from this text field so inside ext is we're going to say document dot ready this just ensures that our document has loaded our elements have loaded or our Dom is ready and available to use so alternatively you could go ahead and use Windows load but that's I'm not really required in this in this case so once our document is ready we need to set up an event handler for our button so I'm going to go ahead and reference or select our button which is search underscore button so we use a hash and then search underscore button and we want to add the click event handler to this now inside here once we click this button we're going to run the code just here so the code that we want to run is obviously first of all we need to retrain our retrieve the value that we've typed into here so in this case I'm going to go ahead and create a variable and this is going to be called search underscore term which is going to be equal to selecting search underscore term and then dot Val so dot val and jquery just returns the value of the search term so I'm going to go ahead and just alert the search term out just to you know see if we've got everything working I'm going to go ahead and type in here search and click find and you see we have an alert dialog box saying search so essentially what's happened is we've clicked the button once we've clicked the button here we grab the search time using Val from this search term text field here and then we just go ahead and add an alert that out now obviously we don't just want to alert out we want to highlight it so at the moment we can't highlight anything unless we have a class set up to deal with the well to essentially highlight it I'm going to go ahead and open highlight j/s again just so we can take a look you see that essentially what happens when we search is we create a span element around this particular sorry around this particular search term so if we were to type search in here and click find a span element will be created around this search and the class that belongs to it you can see here span up class name is equal to highlight
