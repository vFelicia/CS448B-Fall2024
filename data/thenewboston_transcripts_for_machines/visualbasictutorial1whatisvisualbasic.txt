hello YouTube and welcome to your first Microsoft Visual Basic tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be introducing myself letting you guys know what a programming language is for all you beginners out there who are just looking to learn a language I'll let you know a little bit about the.net framework and about what we're going to be doing in these tutorials now let's go ahead and get started my name is Sam and I run the YouTube channel youtube.com online gamer I currently have about 80 videos and they're over Visual Basic Java visual C plus plus and csharp so you can go ahead and go check that out if you want I'll be making a lot more csharp videos in the future so um if you want to go ahead and subscribe and now that my little advertisement is over what is a programming language what a programming language does is it uses code that the developer writes and it makes a decision now what I mean by this is that it can solve a problem or make a decision for the user and to do this it uses data and algorithms all programming language use data and algorithms it takes that data pushes it through an algorithm and then you get an output so now that you know a little bit about what a programming language is I'm going to try to explain to you what the.net framework is now the.net framework was um made by Microsoft and uh what they wanted to do was they wanted to create a programming language or not a language they want to create a framework that was independent of Windows and what I mean by this is that when you create a program that runs on the.net framework it is not dependent on the system it runs on the framework itself which is kind of like a virtual machine if you've ever used used a virtual machine or for you Java programmers it's like the Java virtual machine it keeps it independent of the computer that it's running on but in my opinion it's a lot more effective than the Java virtual machine and does a lot better job now um I may already tell you this but Visual Basic is a very high level language now what I mean by this is that it is easy to understand it's very much like English and it's one of the highest program highest level languages that I know of and an example of a lowlevel language would be C plus plus or something similar to that now um what are we going to be doing in this tutorial well not this tutorial all the tutorials we're going to start off by covering data types variables we're going to do some math we're going to work on um simple stuff to begin with just in the console and then we're going to move on to Windows forms now this is one of the things I love about Visual Basic is that it's easy to make Windows in it unlike C plus or python or other programming language or Java you don't have to use the code to make your windows and in the Visual Basic IDE you can just drag and drop objects onto your windows and the IDE will automatically generate code for you that creates that window so that when you run your program it looks exactly like you want and now if you do it by yourself such as in a language like Java sometimes it's hard to see to visualize what your window is going to look like by just by typing in the code and using coordinates so this is one of the reasons I like Visual Basic and all of the visual all the languages in visual studio so um if you guys have any questions you can go ahead and leave them in the comments I'm I'll be monitoring these videos on the new Boston and I'll try to answer as many questions as I can I know they're going to be a lot because he has a lot of subscribers and I hope you guys stay tuned for the next tutorial also one more thing is that if you guys want to learn more about the languages in that run on the.net framework or just other stuff about development with this you can go ahead and head over to the Microsoft developers website at msdn.microsoft.com to read up about the languages they have and the new stuff and the new releases that they come out with so um that's about it thanks for watching and don't forget to comment like And subscribe
