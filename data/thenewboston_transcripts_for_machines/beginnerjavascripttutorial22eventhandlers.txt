what's going on guys welcome back to your 22nd tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to be beginning to talk about something called event handlers now an event handler is basically our first step towards creating a more interactive and dynamic web page an event handler is basically running a bit of JavaScript code in response to a user action for example whenever they roll over a button or whenever they click a mouse this is when we can set the JavaScript code to run and instead of just running everything right as the web page loan so as you can see instead of just making everything happen when the web page loads we wait for the user's action and it creates the feel of or like an interaction so let's go ahead and enough of me talking it's a lot easier if you just see what's going on so let me go ahead and mention a few things first first of all when you're you're working with event handlers you don't always need to place the JavaScript inside those two special scripting tags event handlers are it's kind of special you can it's possible to make it outside those scripting tags and for the first example that's what I'm going to show you guys how to do so aside from that I better mention this event handlers can be placed in many locations on a web page they kind of look like just basic xhtml attributes but instead of like writing um color equals blue instead of writing a value like like blue this is where you insert the JavaScript so let's go ahead and I guess it would be easiest for me to just make one so one place you can insert event handlers are in form elements specifically um form buttons so let's go ahead and make a form and we'll go ahead and insert some event handlers in here so go ahead and make your basic form and then go ahead and make a one input we only need one input just a b basic button on the screen and in case you forgot from xhtml tutorials how to do this you just go ahead and write input type equals button and for the value the value is basically what is your button going to say and we'll just write touch me so let's go ahead and end this right now and we'll see what we got we got a basic plain old button on the screen doesn't do anything you just click it a bunch of times and nothing happens pretty boring huh so let's go ahead and use event handlers to spice this up a bit now event handlers are pretty much built in keywords that your computer recognizes and knows that it's JavaScript you don't have to tell it in another function that it's JavaScript your browser automatically knows the event handler so whoever created your browser they already typed them in there for you so the only thing you have to remember is these different keywords for event handlers and the most well I don't want to say common L used because I never did a survey on it but one of the most commonly used event handlers is called on click and make sure the C is capitalize and this is a keyword that says whenever the user clicks this element and in this case a button right here then I want to run the bit of JavaScript code in here so anything you type in between these quotation marks it has to be JavaScript code and that's what's going to be ran whenever the user clicks this button so go ahead and I'm just going to make a basic alert box so go ahead and type alert and add your parameters but check this out you know however we make an alert that we usually type some text into it and we put it in double quotation marks like hey now or something like that well since we're working inside xhtml attribute right now and we have all these double quotation marks these quotation marks right here tell JavaScript or excuse me tell your browser that we're working with attributes so we can't use those same quotation marks in here so instead of double quotation marks we need to use single quotation marks so we don't confuse it so it doesn't really have an effect on your program at all it just differentiates between the double ones for your attributes and the single ones for your JavaScript so go ahead put single quotation marks in your parameter and go ahead and write something like ah or write something stupid and now just like in JavaScript with every statement we have to end it with a semicolon this lets our browser know that we're done running this bit of JavaScript code so go ahead and save that refresh it and our web page looks the same right now but in fact it's not the same because whenever we touch this button check it out an alert box pops up that says Ah pretty cool so let's go ahead and press okay and that's the basic of an event handler so as you can see before whenever we were working with JavaScript our web page loaded and all the JavaScript ran and it did whatever it did and that was basically it but now we can wait for the user input and whenever they do something such as click button then the JavaScript code runs and it's just a way to make the web page more interactive and more Dynamic so aside from that I guess I have time to mention one more thing you know how I added one statement in there on the onclick attribute and whenever you touched it a bit of JavaScript code ran well since we added a semicolon we can add more than one statement in here so for example let's go ahead and add one alert box that says Ah and let's go ahead and add another one right after that so alert and of course remember to use your single quotes right in here and just go ahead and write like two times or something different from your first so you can tell that it's different so now we have two different statements whenever we click it using this onclick event handler first it says alert a and then it says alert two times pretty stupid but hey it works so I just clicked the button and it wasn't even in the screen so so check it out touch it ah press okay and then it says oh I didn't refresh it there we go touch it uh and check it out two times and you might have this uh happening if your code isn't running exactly how you want it in some browsers in order to prevent a bunch of ads from popping up or if you have any um like anti antiad uh what's it called anti virus or antipy we built on your computer only one popup will pop up and it's not because your code is wrong it's because your browser has thinks that you're trying to post a whole bunch of ads so it only pop up one at a time so if that's happening then that's your browser not your code but anyways what I want to show you guys here is you're not limited to only one statement you can add more than one statement you can add 500 if you want but you see how I added two statements right in here whenever you have like three or more statements it's probably easier just to add a function and then whenever you make your function uh before you can just add all your statements in there but for now this is just a quick example so there you go so anyways that's the basics of of an event handler I showed you on click in this tutorial but in the next tutorial we're going to be going over different types of event handlers and you'll begin to see why they're useful and what we can do with them so that's what you got to
