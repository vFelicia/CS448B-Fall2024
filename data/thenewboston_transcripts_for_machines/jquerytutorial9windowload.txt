hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in the last quick video we took a look at loading three different iframes and we used the load the load event handler to actually wait until each one had been loaded and we looked at the example with images as well now in the last tutorial we had a slight problem where we wanted to make sure all the page contents has contents had been loaded so all of the dom elements have been loaded and then we wanted to perform a particular operation or an action and this action was just to alert something else so we're working with very basic feedback now what happens if I go ahead and have three different iframes on a page I'm going to go ahead and just define these now or other elements I mean we're talking about a mix of elements it could be an iframe a image even form element it depends on how you know long you know the page content is but we're going to go ahead and have three different iframes here so we go ahead and make three of these and obviously the sources are going to be different we're going to have evade code at UK and then we're going to go out ahead and have PHP academy' dorg so we've now got these three different iframes on the page now what I want to do is show an alert dialog when the content of these three iframes have been loaded so once each and every one has been loaded I want to then say page has been loaded or window has been loaded and that's giving you a clue as to how we're going to do this because we're going to use window as our selector and then we're going to say load so window dot load inside of this we define a function as we usually would but this time this is going to wait for the entire contents of the page with regards to the elements themselves to load we're not talking about as soon as the dawn has loaded and you know it's ready to go so once each element and its contents for example well let's just take an example when we load a page we have we have the Dom elements that have been initialized however they're not necessarily loaded the contents of them have not necessarily loaded and this is particularly you know useful for images because images sometimes take a while to load like for example if you want to have the user apply a particular or allow them to see a particular thing after an image had been loaded this would be useful so it depends I mean it's all very general and very you know condensed and quick but sometimes when you're working in detail you need to know this okay so after window has loaded we want to go ahead and alert out loaded so what this will do is it will check that each contents of these iframes have been loaded and then it will say the message loaded so let's go ahead over to our browser and take a look at this I'm going to go ahead and refresh the page now you can see that all the pages are loading and now we have this dialog so you notice that each one of these iframes took the time to load before they actually were available and appeared so we have all of the iframe contents loaded now however beforehand in the last tutorial we saw that we couldn't really assign the load to each one individually because that then took each one and loaded you know each high frame was loaded and then we alerted three times so in the last tutorial we did iframe by generally selecting all iframes and then when we went ahead and refresh the page we got a message for each one that had loaded as you can see so that's the window dot load usually with jQuery you're not going to go ahead you're not really going to need to use this and document ready and the function inside of that is enough to actually is enough to actually load the page and then start to perform actions so it depends entirely but feel free to go ahead to the jQuery documentation or Google search this and there's lots of different information on each you know reasoning behind doing each one however we've looked at some you know classic you know raw examples of the differences between this and loading using this and also loading using window
