because we didn't define it but the heights now changed as well because we've pulled it down with all this content so you know these are sort of like absolute values that we actually take in rather than you know what we've defined in style.css ourself because we know that the content could overflow and increase the height or the width of the div so this is all well and good but now let's go ahead and look at a practical example that we can use within our browser now many browsers when you display an image inside them allow you to click on them and resize to you know a particular and give a particular you know image it's actual subtle to fit inside the browser so let's go ahead and take a look at an example of this I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of style or CSS we don't need it anymore in fact actually we do we do we'll need a bit a bit later on and I'm gonna go ahead and get rid of all of this as well so I'm just gonna include an image file onto the page which is extremely large in size as Berlin dot jpg and let's go ahead and look at this huh so Berlin jpg okay so you can see that the image is really large most browsers will give you the option to allow you to actually you know resize an image to the page width particularly if you've just referenced it like Berlin jpg like that I always hide it for you in actual fact I'm wrong this wouldn't let you resize an image because we've included it as an element on a page so even more to the point we can now start to resize this image but this time we're gonna get the window width and the window height and set the properties of this image to actually fit inside the window so unsure where you might use this but it's a lot more practical example than just returning to the user the height and the width of a particular element oh and also with regards to width and height this doesn't have to just be divs or anything else it can be things like text elements like form elements and you know you name it paragraphs anything so I'm gonna go ahead and give this a class and this class is going to be called fit just so we know that you know it fits this into the page so inside style dot CSS I'm gonna set some body properties and this is just going to be margin naught pixel and this is just gonna allow us to resize this into our page in its entirety so now what we want to do is we want to automatically resize this class fit to the window hi Andy the window height and the window width so we'll get will call of our W height which is the window height and this is going to be equal to window instead of actually referencing a particular element or selecting a particular element and that's gonna be window docked height we'll create another variable window width and we'll make this equal to window dot width so now we've got the width of the window itself so this means the current the current window as you can see R so now what we can do is we can go ahead and set this image stop the image style the styling installed not installed or CSS but the CSS you know that applies to this class and fit it inside the page so let's go ahead and select the dot fit class and then we apply some CSS we're gonna need to do this in a moment just here but for now we want to set the width or the height of the image to W height and then we again use CSS this time we apply the width as W width so now what's going to happen is when we refresh this is going to be automatically resized to the size of the window as you can see so it automatically resized this image to the size of the window and if we were gonna go ahead and sort of resize this window we can do and it will follow obviously the window width well it won't at the moment but if we were to refresh it would keep the same width and it would resize it accordingly so let's resize that back out once again so obviously every time we actually resize the page when we refresh whatever size the actual window is currently and might the user might have been maximized in their browser or they might have it as a small document this means that what we can actually do is accurately fit content to a window and I don't just mean images I mean things like divs we can resize divs use percentages to scale the div down for example the main body of a document etc etc so there's there's many uses for grabbing the height and the width in order to display it to a user now one benefit of this would might be for say mobile devices if you had a mobile device with a large screen but not the size of a phone for example a tablet you might want to use the height and width to scale down a particular document in order for it to be viewable and not overlap so you know you don't have to do this but it's a more dynamic way to create things but usually that would be handled by style dot CSS but you know why not use height and width to do this as well it would probably make it a lot more you know fun and better and also easier and it does have a good a good way of working so that's the height and width manipulation properties or styling properties by grabbing the height and width of any element and we've seen here how he can assign an image size to the window width and height
