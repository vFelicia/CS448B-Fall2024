so we're going to talk about surface area of a cylinder so first of all a cylinder is a threedimensional shape with the bases parallel and congruent to this circle right here is parallel and congruent to this circle right here which means that this height right here has to be perpendicular to both of these circles so to find the surface area of a cylinder we take circumference times height plus 2 times the base area of these circles so we're going to write this a little different way by filling in some things first circumference is equal to 2 PI R so 2 pi r times age would be 2 pi r h plus 2 times the area of one circle well the area of one circle is PI R squared so for our final formula for surface area is 2 pi rh + 2 pi r squared so now we're going to find the surface area of this cylinder so the surface area is equal to 2 pi r our radius for this is is five right here so 2 pi five times the height is 12 plus 2 PI R squared so for the surface area we get 2 times 5 which is 10 times 12 is 120 PI plus 5 squared is 25 2 times 25 is 5050 pie so when we add those together we get 170 pie for our service area so when we take a surface area of a cylinder it's like we take like pretend we have a soup can and there's a top lid and a bottom lid and we find the area of that if we unwrap that label on a soup can if you unwrap it and hold it open it's a rectangle so right here this part of our formula is finding the area of that rectangle which would be if we if i were to unwrap this cylinder i'd get this rectangle and this top of the rectangle would be their circumference which is 2 PI R times the height which is 12 so that's where this part of the formula comes from and then to find the top of the top and bottom of the soup cans we do two PI R squared so find the surface area so we if you remember it's two pi r h plus 2 PI R squared so now let's plug things in 2 pi the radius is 4 times the height which is 10 plus 2 pi radius squared so the surface area is equal to x 4 is 8 times 10 is 8080 pi plus 4 squared is 16 times 2 is 32 so 32 pie so our surface area is equal to 112 pi so we're going to do one more example find the surface area of the cylinder so surface area is equal to 2 pi r h plus 2 pi r squared now you don't have to write the formula every time you do a problem but when you're learning the formula it helps to write it down because then you'll remember it and then you won't have to write it down anymore you'll just know it so 2 pi r right here which is three times the height now remember when we when we say height we want the thus the edge that is pair that is perpendicular to both of these bases so that's that height right hair if we were to take this height it would be perpendicular to the rectangle that goes around the cylinder but we need this height which is perpendicular to both bases so our height for this is 12 plus 2 pi r which is 3 squared surface area is equal to 2 times 3 which is six times 2 which is 72 so 72 pi plus 3 squared is 9 times nine is eighteen 18 pi so surface area is equal to 90 pi feet squared because remember when we find surface area we're finding a twodimensional area so if I was if I had in my suit can or if I had a cylinder container and I was wrapping it up for a present I want to find how much wrapping paper goes around it and that would be a oneday two dimensional measure so that's all for surface area but next video we're going to talk about volume of a cylinder because it's a little bit different than volume of a prism
