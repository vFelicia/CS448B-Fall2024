hello youtube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our favorites viewer program now full credit for this program goes to the authors of beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 and they are Thea and Willis and Brian Newsome now they created this great program and I'm using it to teach you guys some visual basic concepts and how to program so let's go ahead and run the program and we can see what we've done so far so when we open up my favorites it loads in the favorites by using the favorite to name and the URL and we can select one of these and visit them so if i visit the new boston it's going to open that up in my default web browser so let's go ahead and we'll run this again and you can see that when it opens up at the beginning we have this ugly link label right here that says link level one and then when we click on it the application freezes and crashes so let's go ahead and make it so that when the program lows there will be a link in there that the user can click on so before they scan all the favorites in let's just go ahead and set that link so we can use what we did down here because we wanted to look similar to the rest of the design of the program and we want to keep it consistent so we'll type link URL dot text equals visit and then we'll add the link that we want so we've got this favorite salsa like them items right here so we'll just put our own link in there so we'll do HTTP colon slash slash and let's just do let's say you have a developer website or something and you want to put that in there to come to advertise for it or to let them know who created it so we can do ww youtube.com slash on live gamer or i could put the website for the rocks publishing company because i created the book that has program in it that'd probably be better but for now we'll just leave it at this so once we set it set the text we want to clear the links in there because if they try to click on something it says visit and then has a link it's going to try to open that link with the visit in front of it and it's just going to mess up so we'll type link URL dot links dot clear and now I need to do is we'll use the same thing we do down here so we'll add a link and we'll start index 6 and then we'll just add our link so we'll go to link URL dot links add and let's find the version of this that we want so we want to start the length and the link data so the start is going to be starting at index 6 because we have 0 1 2 3 4 5 and then after this is when it's going to start and we'll do length let's say let's see we got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 so hopefully 32 will be correct and the link data is going to be HTTP colon slash slash ww youtube com / on live gamer now this will probably be better to put this link into a variable and then use the variable length but this should work just fine so hopefully when we run it everything will work the way we want to do and it says visit and then it has our link so we can go ahead and click on that and it's going to open up the website so let's just fix that we need to go ahead and go to more places now you can see it's giving us the link here so let's just go ahead and replace this with on live gamer so we've got 12 three four five six seven eight nine ten so we wanted to be start at six and go to let's see the lengthy out the link is going to be 10 and that's going to be our link so when we visit on live gamer it's going to open up the website now you can see here that we're missing the are so let's go ahead close out of this and we'll make this 11 okay so now what we can do is let's go ahead and add a button that refreshes the favorites so let's say you added a new favorite and you don't have to you don't want to have to close out of the program and then reopen it to add that favorite in there so we can set the text of this to refresh and we can set the name to button refresh now this right here is not in the book i'm adding this myself so come back to or let's create an event for this first so whenever they click refresh what do we want to do well we want to use all of this code right here so what we can do is we can cut this code and let's put it into a sub so we can come down here and type private sub load favorites and it's going to load the favorites into the ListView so before that it loads the favorites in to that list view what we need to do is type list favorites dot items dot clear so it will clear it each time it reloads to favorites so whenever it loads we want to type load favorites and then whenever they click refresh we also want to load the favorites so let's go ahead and run this and you can see that everything is working fine it's got our favorites and we can click on them and now let's go to Internet Explorer and we'll just add a new favorite so we'll just use the home page which is msn com and we'll click add to favorites and we'll call it msn and then if we click Add it's successfully added to our favorites now if we minimize out of this and click refresh you can see that msn is added to our list of favorites and that it will add visit msn for us and we don't have to add any extra code because the way we've made this we can add an infinite number will not really an infinite number but a large number of links and favorites and it will still work so we can also delete favorites so we'll go ahead and come to our favorites and let's just delete this so you can't see this on screen right now but there's an option called delete I deleted that favorite and then when I click refresh you can see that msn is gone so go ahead put that code in if you haven't already and then once you've done that if you don't have any questions move on to the next tutorial
