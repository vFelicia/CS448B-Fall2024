hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at substrings now basically what a substring is is extracting part of a string a certain amount of characters from a string so let's go ahead and start it and make a little demo for this so here's our main sub what we're going to go ahead and do is create a variable so we'll just make this user string as string and we'll set it equal to nothing and now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt the user to enter in a string so console dot write line enter a string now what we're going to do is we're going to get that string you should be very familiar with this okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to print out the length of that string so first off let's just add some space here so that will create an empty line and then we'll see what the program outputs underneath that empty line just so it's easier to read inside of our console window so now what we're going to do is we're going to do console dot write line use the string dot length and then we'll just go ahead and convert that to a string so basically what we've done is we print it out user string dot length which gets the length of the string and we just went ahead and converted that to a string and left empty parameters right here so now we're going to get some sub strings of user string so we're just going to do console dot write line and we're going to do user string dot substring and inside of our parameters we're going to have two arguments we're going to have the start index and we're going to have the length so we're just going to start at zero and we'll print out the first three characters of this string so whenever you're working with a substring strings always start at zero so let's say you have a user string and you get the length of that whenever you're counting through that link it's going to start at 0 so if the length is 12 is going to go from 0 to 11 because that's 12 values but they always start at 0 so then we'll just go ahead and do this a couple more times dot substring and we'll start at 3 and we'll go ahead three characters and then what we're going to do is we're going to do this one more time but we're going to do it a little bit differently so instead of using two arguments for the parameters have the substring we're just going to go ahead and do user string dot substring so what this is going to do is going to print out the first three characters of user string then it's going to print out the third through six characters of user string and then it's going to print out the remaining characters of user string so if we go ahead and run this it's going to say interest string so we'll just type on live gamer and then we'll do Sam so once again we get that air that I always run into okay so let's run this again so we'll just type on live gamer Sam and you can see that it tells us that the length of online gamer Sam is 14 and it's going to tell us that the first three characters of this string right here is onl the next three characters is iv'e and then the remaining characters is gamer Sam so go ahead and you can practice a little bit with sub strings and then once you've got that nailed down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
