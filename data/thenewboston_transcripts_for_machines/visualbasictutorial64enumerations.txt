hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about enumerations now if you remember from all of the previous tutorials we've been using variables now these pretty much have no limit except for integer has a limit of I think for billions of them so there is a limit there but you can pretty much put whatever you want into it now let's say you want to limit a user so that they can only put a certain value in so let's say if you want them to tell you how many doors that car has you wouldn't want them to be able to put 523 because that's impossible so the way you can do get around this is by using enumerations and what enumerations is is pretty much creating your own data type and you can create as many variables as you want based off of that enumeration so let's go ahead and create a project and we'll give this a little practice so go ahead we'll go to new project we will select windows forms application and we will call it enumerations and we'll go ahead and click OK now we'll wait for this to load ok so now let's go ahead and we will come over here to our tool box we'll add a button and we will just set the text to enumeration and we'll go ahead and set the name to button enumeration okay so let's go ahead and open up the code for forum one and now what we're going to do is we're going to create an enumeration now to do this we're going to declare like we would a method or a function by starting off with the keyword public or private so this guy case will do private so private and then we're going to use the keyword enum for enumeration and now we have to create a name for it so let's just call it day action and you see it gets that light blue color and they actually we're going to be using that in the upcoming tutorials we're going to be learning several different things and we're going to use them all in one application so private in um day action and then we'll type as integer you have to specify a data type for that and now go ahead and press enter now we have to populate our enumerations with possible values so we'll just type awake equals zero asleep equals one and let's just do coding equals two okay so now we can create a variable based off of this day action such as we would make a variable that's an integer value so instead of doing private action as integer and set a value to that we would do it as day action now we can make as many of these as we want and they will each be their own separate things holding different values so now what do we want to do we'll go ahead and set that equal to two which is going to be coding so we'll go ahead and create a click event for button enumeration and we'll go ahead and show what action is currently being performed so we'll type message box dot show action dot to string so if we go ahead and run this we're going to get form one right here and when we click enumeration it says coding now we can set de action to different values as well so if we'll give this a little bit of time to load so we'll set it equal to one and it should give us asleep so if we go ahead and run this and click enumeration we get asleep now you don't have to set it to an integer value or let's say you create an enumeration as a string or anything else so you would have we have all of these names right here for the possible values so instead of actually putting in the integer which we may not know what it equals so if we put in 0 we will what if we don't know that means awake so what we can do is type day action and you can see here down in intellisense it gives us several options so we can do a day action dot we can do a sleep awake and coding so if we click awake action is going to be equal to zero and it's going to be equal to awake so to set it equal to something that you want that is the name in your enumeration you type the name of your enumeration dot and then whatever you name you have for that certain value so if we go ahead and run this we'll go ahead and click enumeration and we get awake so go ahead and practice with the numeration x' make some that are other datatypes besides an integer they may be a little confusing at first they were for me it's kind of a little bit hard concept to grasp I fear a new programmer so I'm go ahead and practice with those and we're going to be using in the next upcoming tutorials so just get used to them so you won't be confused in the next tutorial and thanks for watching
