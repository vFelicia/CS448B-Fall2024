hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is another video tutorial for the new Boston now if you've watched some my other tutorials that I've created you will see that I'm now in a different environment and I'm not using context for this tutorial now there's a reason for this when we send mail in PHP using the mail function it's not going to work from my local server because I don't have the support to send the email on my local server and you may find this as well you can set this up but I won't be talking about how to do this in a local server as with most paid hosting you will have access to be able to send Mary using this function so let's go straight ahead and send a basic email so I'm going to create a file now called index.php I'm going to click create new file that's created that in here for me now I'm going to click on code editor so we can start editing this file okay so obviously the first thing we want to do is create PHP tags now if the mail function basically looks like this and it takes typically in the case that we're going to do four parameters one after that is optional I think it takes 5 parameters in total but you can go to the pier to be manual to look that up now we need to create a few variables in order to put into this function the first one is 2 this is the email address that the email is going to be sent to so in this case I'm going to say Alex at PHP academy' to org this is my press and business email address only so the next is is the subject so the subject is going to be this is an email now I have the body so this is gonna equal some text that we're gonna have in the body of the email and finally we have the headers now the headers in this example I'm going to show you I'm gonna only work with basic headers we are just going to use the from field so what I'm going to say is we're gonna say from and then we're going to say someone a PHP academy' to org this is the name that is displayed or the email address that's displayed from so if I was say sending a mail to someone after they'd registered had registered say or with the website and the registration process has completed I could send it from no reply up here to pay Academy to org or I could send it from admin a PHP academy' dog the email address doesn't necessarily have to exist so let's specify a body let's say we're gonna come down here and we'll start saying that we'll go up here we'll say this is a test email I'm gonna use backslash and end to go to a new line and then backslash an end now to go to new lines so I'm starting a new paragraph hope you got it okay so now what I need to do to actually send the email is use the mail function and then it's passed these arguments to actually send the email so the first one you need to specify is who it's to so the recipient email address then you need to specify the subject of the email so our subject is this is an email then you need to specify the body so our body here is equal to this is a test email we go down a new paragraph which is equivalent to two lines and then we say hope you got it now what we need to do is give the headers and there's plenty of information that we can pack into here but for now this simple malfunction tutorial just giving you an idea of how it works I'm just saying from someone so this is the name that is going to be displayed when we pick up the email now this is all well and good but what happens if the malfunction doesn't work well I'm going to enclose this in an if statement and say if male then do something here so I'm going to come in and say email has been sent then I can say else there was an error sending the email just in case the malfunction fails for one or more reasons we can process this and say echo there was an error sending the email otherwise email has been sent we can even say email has been sent to and then specify the two variable that we've created up here so we need to run and test this now so I'm going to log into my email account and we can send this afterwards
