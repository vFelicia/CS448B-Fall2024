hello this is Alex from PHP academy' with another video for the new Boston in this video we're going to be looking at the third and final loop in PHP and this is the for loop now for is a bit more complicated in syntax and by this I mean it's structured slightly differently so if we use the for keyword and we create a block you can see that it's very similar to a while loop or sort of similar to a dowhile loop however what we're doing is we use three expressions within this these parentheses so we use three different expressions to control the loop how we want and we can also increment increment a value within this as well so in here all we need to do is echo something out either a variable or some plain text or maker or could continue in operation however your program is eventually going to work and everything can can be trolled controlled within here so for now I'm going to create a variable called count and that's going to be equal to in fact know the reason I'm not going to declare it out there is because like I said we can we can try everything within here so I I'm going to call my variable count I'm going to append a break on to that so we can keep track of it neatly now I declare my count variable or I assign my first value to it in here so I say count equals one okay now what I do is I put a semicolon and then I say what this is basically the next part of the expression is what needs to be evaluated true or false to determine whether the block should run this block should run so count while count is smaller than or equal to ten like we've done in the previous examples and then we say count plus plus we don't need another semicolon to end here it just ends so what we're doing is let me just separate this out so it's a bit more easy to read okay so we're setting initially our count variable to equal one then we're choosing this where we're creating a condition that needs to be true or false and then we're incrementing here and the way that a for loop works is this is executed then this happens then the block runs then we increment here okay and then obviously this here will be ignored because it won't reassign the variable so now you can see it's just a completely different structure of creating a loop but it has exactly the same effect if we refresh we're just counting from numbers one to ten now the beauty of doing something like this is it's a lot easier to read we can also obviously assign this on the fly it is neater as well if I was to just simply change that to greater than this that's decrementing it this to one and this to ten now what we're doing is we're counting from ten to one so just change them three parts of the each expression around whereas end count is equal to ten initially while count is smaller than or so greater than or equal to one and decrement until we reach 10 the condition until we reach one the condition is until it where we're still greater than or equal to one we still execute the loop when we still echo so that is basically for loops in PHP
