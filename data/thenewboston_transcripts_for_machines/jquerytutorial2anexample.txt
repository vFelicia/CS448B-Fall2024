hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in the last part we looked at an introduction to jQuery however let's go now on and look at an example that I've quickly written out I'm going to go over to this tab in my browser and you can see that we've got a paragraph of text here that just says you can see this paragraph now I've created a button here which actually hides the paragraph and then allows the paragraph to be shown again so this is probably um an extreme well it's a simple example but an effective example of how powerful and easy jQuery can be to use now this is essentially going to hide the paragraph and then allow me to reshow it while changing the button text so if I go ahead and click hide you can see that the paragraph has been hidden if I go ahead and now click show you can see that the paragraph is shown again and you'll notice that the button text changes as well now JavaScript particularly with the animation you see as it fades um up and Scrolls up um this would be extremely uh tedious to program and quite long to program and write out however the code that I'm actually using is extremely simple now don't worry too much about the code um for now uh a bit later on I'm going to show you how to implement jQuery into your page and we're going to look at writing our first example but I'm just going to go over to my Text Editor to show you how easy uh this is to write now the first thing we have is a button here and that's the button that we uh use to hide and display the message uh the value you can see at the moment is hide and that's changed in toggle. JS um I've given it an ID so I can reference when the button uh click event happens you'll see that there's no JavaScript code in the actual uh part of my um page that we see so for example the uh input button and the paragraph every time I click a button this is handled by this toggle. JS file you'll also notice that I've included jQuery uh the jQuery Library into my page so let's take a look at jug to toggle. JS now the first thing that's happening is we are looking for a click we're then taking the value of the text box oh sorry the uh button and then we're using the toggle function to uh hide the um paragraph we're also then checking the St uh the value of the um button and then changing it accordingly so just with this short code we've achieved a an effect which is extremely uh usable on your website for example if you have a message that you want to show to uh a user but you might want to give them the option to hide it now this can also be done with a link it doesn't need to be done with a button it's extremely flexible to use so with this example you can see how easy it is to actually Implement jQuery and start to look for events happening on your page you'll also see that I've got jquery.js which I've just pasted into a text editor and uh and actually uh included on my index.php page so at the start of the tutorial I did mention if you don't understand this then that's absolutely not a problem this was just an example to show you how we can actually use jQuery uh and how easy it is now this is an example of an animation effect um however later on we're going to be looking at Ajax and how we can actually take data uh and pass it to another PHP file uh which will allow us to actually create a more Dynamic and useful uh website so we're going to be looking at that a bit later
