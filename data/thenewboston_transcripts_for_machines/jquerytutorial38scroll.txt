hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video for the new boston in this tutorial we're going to be looking at the jquery scroll event handler we're going to be creating a text area with some text in and when the user Scrolls we're first of all going to be feeding back when they have actually scrolled then we're going to be feeding back some more dynamic information like the position that they're currently at in the scroll area so the first thing we want to do is go ahead and create this text area we're going to outline the text area tags and we're going to give this an ID of some underscored text and this is how we're going to reference it once we use jQuery to check this I'm going to give it rows of seven and columns of 25 I'm going to paste some long text in this is just some Latin text in here and we can go ahead to our browser and preview this so inside of our browser we now have this we can scroll down that's important so we can actually test the event handler correctly we now want to create a file which we're going to include in our page down here with the scroll functionality and the event handler in there so let's go ahead and create a new text file and I'm gonna save this as scroll j/s inside my j/s folder okay so now that we've done that we need to include that in our page so let's go ahead and type script type is equal to text forward slash JavaScript the source is going to be jeaious forward slash scroll J s and we end the script there so now that we've included scroll J s we can begin to actually check when the event handler well create the event handler when the user Scrolls first thing we're going to do though is create a div which is going to relay some information back to us so this is going to be a div ID of let's just say some feedback now let's go over to scroll j s and start to create the event handler so we're going to reference the some text text area and the event handler is scroll now inside of the parentheses we're going to create a function which is going to be executed when we actually start to scroll so function and we create the block so we create a function as normal with the parentheses and a block here we bring this down so we can start writing the code inside of the block so our div is called sum underscore feedback so what we can simply do is say sum underscore feedback dot HTML and inside of here we can say something like you have scrolled so now what's going to happen is when we return to our browser and we start to scroll we're gonna have the div display that text that we've just typed in let's go ahead and start scrolling okay so you can see that the text has now appeared just here and we have fed back to the user when they've started to scroll now what we're going to do is we're going to use something slightly different to feed back some more dynamic information I'm going to create a variable called scroll pause and that's going to be equal to again the reference of some texts but this time it's going to be dot scroll top now this scroll top function in jQuery returns the current position the user is at inside of the text area as they are scrolling so now what we can do we can change this to you have scrolled and are at position and then we can append on the scroll position so it's now going to say you have scrolled and our apt position and it's going to give us the current position that we're at so let's refresh and test this I'm going to start to scroll and you can see that the numbers are dynamically changing as I scroll all the way to the bottom of the text area okay so why might this scroll that'd be useful in some websites you see that they have a list of terms and conditions inside a text area in which you're meant to scroll down and read if you were to use this you could match the position you're scrolling at to the height of this box now when the user has reached the end you could then display something like I agree I have read the terms and conditions so apart from demonstrating this event handler it's also useful to note where it might be used so that's essentially the scroll event handler in jQuery and a bit about where it might be used
