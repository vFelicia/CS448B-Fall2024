what is going on guys welcome to your third tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be covering addition in scientific notation now to be honest whenever you're working with addition and subtraction and scientific notation it's kind of easy the only time it gets triky is whenever you're working with multiplication and division whenever you have to multiply two of these bad boys together it gets kind of weird whenever you have to do it on paper so in order to understand that we first need to understand addition and subtraction so right here I'm working with two positive exponents 10 4th and 10 the 5th in the next example I'm going to be showing you guys 3 and 2 and lastly I'm going to be showing you guys what happens when you try to add a scientific notation with a positive exponent with a negative one and it's kind of weird so just stick with me and just follow along so say we have two huge numbers right here and these are really big numbers they can symbolize you know your mom's weight plus your grandma's weight burn or something like that so the very first thing we need to do is convert these to I'm just going to call them real numbers basically numbers that we can understand so 6214 * 10 4th is 6 2 1 4 0 so 2.4 61 * 10 the 5ifth is 2 4 6 1 with two zeros so now what we need to do is we need to take this number 62,000 and add it to 246,000 you know plus some change so whenever you add these two numbers together you get 38,000 240. now we aren't done yet if you ever had this question on a test from you know your science teacher or whatever you need to take this final number right here and you need to convert this in a scientific notation so in order to do that you want to move the decimal place all the way over here so every saying all right here's where I want it to be but here's where it is right now all you need to do is count the spaces 1 2 3 4 five so basically your final answer is this 3 point make that a little easier to see 08 2 4 you can forget about all these extra zeros times 10 to the 5 so that's your final answer 6214 * 10 4th plus 2461 * 10 5th equal 3.08 to4 * 10 5th there you go so aside from that we also need to learn how to add two really small numbers together so say we have a number like 3.6 * 10 3r plus 2.4 * 10 2 and again like I said these are two really small numbers like you know maybe your mom's IQ score burn and yeah these corny jokes are going to be coming all day long so just get used to them so this number whenever we convert the scientific notation or excuse me convert it to a real number is point yeah that's embarrassing all right Point 036 and this bad boy over here whenever we convert this is 0.024 so whenever we add these numbers together we get 0276 but if you put this as the final answer on your test your teacher is going to frown upon that and probably take some points off what you need to do is you need to convert that to scientific notation so this is where you want the decimal point to be so we need to move that one two spaces right there so 2.76 I make that a little bigger time 10 to the 2 is going to be your final answer because remember if you move it two places then you need to make your exponent two right there so this is your final answer that's what they expect to see on the test so now last but not least say you have a really big number like this one yeah I'm going to be doing that like all the time too 9.3 * 10 3r plus a really small number 1.6 * 10 to 2 well let me go ahead and convert these numbers first so you can see them a little bit easier so this number right here is 930 9,300 plus this small number over here is 0.16 better write that down so whenever you add these together again you don't need a calculator for this it's 9300 .0 six but obviously like I said this let me make that a little bit bigger this is not nearly good enough to go as the final answer on your test what you need to do is you need to convert this to scientific notation so right here is where you want the decimal point to be so we have to move it three places to the left so our final answer is 9.3 how many zeros 1 2 3 1 two 3 1 six times 10 and you remember how many places we move that to the left three so that's our final answer that can go on our test so this number right here plus this number whenever you add them and convert them to scientific notation is this number right here so again like I said that's how you use addition in scientific notation whenever you have two positive exponents two negative exponents and in this case a positive exponent and a negative exponent so that's how you do that and again subtraction is really simple as well the only way it gets really confusing whenever you're trying to do it is when you're working with multiplication and division and we're going to eventually be covering that and I'll show you guys a really easy way and some really easy trick tricks to do that but for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and yes in the next tutorial corny jokes galore so I'll see you then
