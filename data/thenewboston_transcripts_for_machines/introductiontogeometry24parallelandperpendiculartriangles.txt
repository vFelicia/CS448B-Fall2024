so today our focus is on parallel and perpendicular lines soap airlines do not intersect so if you look these two lines have an equal distance between them and they will never intersect and we denote parallel lines with these little arrows so those two lines are parallel and these two lines are parallel so perpendicular lines intersect to form right angles and we denote this by a little square just like we denote any any kind of right angle so each one of these angles right here is the right angle so they all measure 90 degrees so now that we know what parallel and perpendicular lines are we're gonna name a few so name two sets of parallel lines well if we start with segments Ln we know that Ln is parallel to mo because they both have these little lines on them so Ln is parallel to mo and that's how we write parallel lines with these two little lines right right here so the second set if I look for to tick marks there is LM and n oh and that makes sense because if I were to extend these lines on forever and ever and ever they would never intersect so line LMK is parallel to n.o name two sets of perpendicular lines so like we said perpendicular lines intersect to form right angles so we know that none of the parallel lines can also be perpendicular so if we look we've got a right angle right here and Ln this segment right here and n 0 meet intersect to form a right angle so that means Ln is parallel excuse me is perpendicular to n 0 and if you look at this other right angle right here it's formed when LM and Mo intersect so that means segment LM is parallel to line segment em oh well that's all we're gonna do today with parallel and perpendicular lines but next time we're going to talk about other kinds of angles that can be formed when two lines intersect to make sure you come check it out
