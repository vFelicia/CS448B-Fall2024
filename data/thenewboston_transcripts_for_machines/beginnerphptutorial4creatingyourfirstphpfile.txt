hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and back with another video for the new Boston now in this tutorial we uh going to go on from our previous tutorial where we installed xamp for Windows now now that we're at this stage where we've uh installed the um installed xamp we've accessed Local Host we've tested that PHP my admin work so we we've run our um our MySQL databases for when we look at databases a lot later on and we've also um brought with attention the xamp control panel here uh which allows us to start and stop particular services and um the services that we've focused on are Apache and MySQL because these are two that we're going to use most frequently okay so now this tutorial is basically going to cover how to create your PHP your first PHP file um and we're going to do some little bit of output in it nothing major because we have other tutorials explaining uh sort of um output um and uh the PHP info function as well so have a look at the other tutorials and you'll uh you'll find some great information on that okay so uh let's go ahead and we need to think about opening up this um folder here let me just uh bring it into view this folder here called examp and this is a c colon back/ xamp by default depending on how you installed uh your xamp installation depending on how you run the installation uh this might be different but by default it's C column back/ xamp or whatever Drive you've inst it to so replace this with your drive number uh letter sorry okay so in here we've got a few folders you can see uh some of which are useful to us some of which are not we have our PHP installation folder which contains all our dlls um php.ini so let's find that got php.ini here um etc etc so um there's another tutorial on php.ini so go and check that out okay okay so um HT docs is the uh folder that I want to focus on in this tutorial because we're going to be creating our first file now inside HT docs at the moment it's a bit of a mess for me I've got a few files in here but we want to create our um PHP file in here so um in let's just open up uh our browser so you know now that we access our uh website from or our local server from Local Host now we don't need to do localhost slht docs sln our file because HT docs here um well no in here is where is the root directory if you like for where our file should be so let's go ahead here and I'll create a new text document and I'm going to call this um my first file.php now in Windows I have uh extension naming uh enabled so I can automatically name my extension but if you can't do it this way you can see I've got if you change a far name extension blah blah blah click yes and that's changed now to a PHP file now this C icon you see is my text editor my default text editor and my default text editor is context so um usually you know you might have notepad is your default text editor but I recommend if you're going to start learning PHP download a good um a good text editor I use context I've always used context and I prefer it however Some people prefer to use notepad++ or even just notepad and I mean there are many out there that you can use uh depending on what platform you're in as well you might be running a Linux system uh so you may have different text Avail editors available to you so I've created this file um like this now what you can do is uh let's delete that and let's go over to um let's go over to my text editor so I've got my text editor open here I'm going to create a new file um and I'm going to save this I'm going to go save save as and I'm in my HT docs uh folder here so I'm going to type my first file.php and then down here I'm going to save as type all files to make sure that the extension's read now watch what happens to this just up here this text files bit here when I click save so let's uh get this into view as well I'm going to click save and you can see that's automatically changed syntax highlighting for my file so now the PHP extension is applied we can see that that file's been created there for us the extension has been applied and now syntax highlighting has been turned out on now syntax highlighting if you've ever program before you'll know highlight specific parts of the syntax so Constructors um variables uh string data and integers things like that just everything will be highlighted differently um depending on how your text editor handles that and you can modify that as well uh from options menus but we're not here to talk about that we're here to talk about the first PHP file now inside our PHP file um let's just actually go to our browser first and try and access this so we know this is saved in um c/ examp and HT docs so let's go ahead to our browser and type in um my first file.php so remember HT docs is the root folder so all we need to do is say localhost slm myfirst file.php we press enter and this file has been loaded in now because it's a PHP extension you might think that you can't put HTML data in but we can in fact write uh data into here and just either plain text or HTML and when we refresh that's displayed on the page so you can see now that we're accessing our uh files like we would on a normal server and uh again you can create folders directories in here and and uh create things uh as you wish so to create the first PHP file we've done this and our tags look like this um you'll notice that we've have um a less than SI um a question mark PHP and then we end on a question mark in here so that's very similar to how we open up and close HTML um so we open up tags like that and end tags like that in PHP we do this but that's not what this tutorial is about we've created our file we've accessed it from our um from our web server and now um you can go on the tutorials where we talk about um echoing out data to the user and uh so on and so forth and you can start your journey learning PHP
