so our Focus today is on the length of segments in a circle so when two chords intersect the product of the lengths and just remember a product is a fancy word of saying the multiplication of the lengths along one cord is equal to the products of the lengths of another chord so if I have this chord right here and it intersects this chord right here a * B is equal to C * D and if you remember multiplication is communative so I can multiply in any order and I'll still get the same answer as long as I multiply the right parts together I want part of one chord times part of another chord equals part of one chord times part of another chord so now we're GNA do an example okay find the indicated length so we have this chord right here and this chord right here we're trying to solve for a so we need to take part of this chord right here which is eight multiply it by this other part part which is three and set it equal to 6 * a so 8 * 3 is 24 = 6 a to solve for a we're going to divide both sides by 6 and if you do that you get a is equal to 4 and we can check that by doing 8 * 4 = 6 oh I made a mistake it should be 8 * 3 is equal to 6 * 4 so 8 * 3 is 24 and 6 * 4 is 24 so that's a good way to check your answer so now I want to find the measure of I and this is a two by the way not an A so I'm going to take 2 * I and set it equal to 3 * 4 so 2 I is equal to 3 * 4 which is 12 to solve for I I'm going to divide both sides by two and I get I is equal to six so that's all for our lesson today um make sure you come back because the next lesson we're going to shift our Focus to perimeter of shapes and polygons more specifically
