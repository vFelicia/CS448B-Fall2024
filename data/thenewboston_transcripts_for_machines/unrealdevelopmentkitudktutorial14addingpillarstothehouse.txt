all right guys welcome to your 14th udk tutorial and in these upcoming tutorials I don't know if I'm going to be able to finish it in this tutorial or it's going to take two tutorials but in these next few tutorials all I'm going to be doing is adding the pillars and also the roof to my little house so you guys can probably figure out how to do this but if not you guys are welcome to follow along with my tutorials so the first thing I'm going to be doing is adding some pillars on this front porch right here so I'm actually going to be doing that using the cylinder so go ahead and right click the cylinder and it's going to bring up your cylinder properties now the Z is pretty much if we look right here the Z is going to be the height of our pillars now I already remember our walls are 576 tall so that's how tall my pillars are going to be obviously now the outer radius well let me explain to you guys this first if you want you can go ahead and make a cylinder that's Hollow by checking this hollow box and you have an inner radius and an outer radius whenever you have something Hollow it's kind of like a pipe but for these pillars we don't need them to be Hollow so the inner radius isn't going to matter the only thing we need to worry about is the outer radius so again whenever you have a hollow cylinder you need to set the outer and inner but whenever it's solid you only need to set the outer so let's go ahead and set it to 32 I think that's going to be a nice size for a pillar and go ahead build X out of there so the first thing we need to do is probably position this so go ahead and select your red Builder brush and I'm going to position this right here and let me just scroll in and I only want it like one one block away from the outside wall so that looks pretty good right there the only thing I have to watch out for now is make sure it sits right on top of that floor so let me scroll in and my position in looks pretty good so I'm going to go ahead and click add CSG right there and now we have a nice looking pillar so now what I can do is I guess I might as well just go around and do this with all of them so let me go ahead and position this exactly where I want it I'm going to want this one right there so go ahead and click let me make sure it's positioned correctly add we got another pillar right there and now for this one let's go ahead and make it right there I'm going to go ahead and click add for this so go ahead and click add and now since we have the three pillars on that side go ahead and get that out of the way and now it would probably be easier just to copy these so go ahead and remember in order to copy it hold down alt and drag and now we get a copy of that one and in order to copy this one let me see hold down alt and drag and now we get a copy of that one looks pretty good and last but not least copy this one holding down alt and drag so now all my pillars look good I just want to go in one of my views up here and make sure that they all are indeed sitting on top and of course since they're not showing up in perspective view we need to rebuild our geometry and go ahead and close out of that and now if we start flying around here we can see that indeed our pillars did get built successfully so that's I'm going to be doing in this tutorial um make sure that you build your pillars exactly like mine and in the next tutorial I'm going to be doing is adding a roof and I'm actually going to be going over some things so make sure you watch the next tutorial because I'm going to be talking about splitting and also selecting well you'll see in the next tutorial but I'm going to be talking about some new stuff so thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to check on my next video
