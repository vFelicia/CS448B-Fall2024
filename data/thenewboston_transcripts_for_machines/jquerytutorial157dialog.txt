I'm then gonna go ahead and bind on another attribute function and we're going to change in fact no we're not we're going to change the text of the dialogue now what the div this is what this is going to do is place text in here so we've already determined the title we now want to go ahead and place text inside of here so in jQuery we use the text function so I'm just gonna say settings were saved for example okay so now what's going to happen is we've changed the title and the text within this div so now we've predefined what we want to display before we go ahead and display it so now at the end of this we can use the dialogue widget and that will then substitute in them variables and then show the show the dialogue so now when we click Save we have saved and settings were saved so we've now achieved a sort of like a a global div that we can use for any dialogue we want okay so now what we want to do is take a look at some of the settings we can apply to this dialog box first of all it's important to note that our page is still active so we can still click on specific things and we might not want to be able to do that so we're gonna gradually go through and change this dialog too as you saw it in the first part of the tutorial and I'll explain each option on the way so you'll know what to do with them and how to change them and there are a variety of other options as well ok so inside of here we want to go ahead and start to change our settings inside our dialog definition just here so inside here we need some curly brackets the first thing I'm gonna do is go ahead and set my own predefined button or customize button and that's going to be an OK button just here so let's go ahead and the option of buttons now this starts to look a bit tricky so I'm gonna pull this down here in fact now let's keep that up there I'm going to okay so let me start again the buttons option takes more parameters inside curly brackets so now I can start to create a function inside of here once I have predefined which button I want to be associated with which function so I'm going to define a button okay and then using a colon I'm going to define a function here and more curly brackets and I'm going to pull this down so now inside of here this is what's going to happen when this okay button we've given it the label okay is pressed so we've defined a button called okay and then the function associated with this okay button goes here what you can then do is you could go ahead and comma separate this here and create another button so for example not okay you wouldn't have a button like that but then you could define another function and so on and then you could create more after that but obviously for now we're just creating one button which is okay so I'm just gonna test this and I'm gonna say alert hello so now what's going to happen is we have this okay button that's appeared with our label when I click on it we have this dialog box saying hello so we know that it's working but what we want to happen is when we click OK we want this to close I know we already have the X button up here that we can press to close it off but you might want to incorporate other buttons into this dialog that don't just close it that might want to do something else but for now inside of here instead of an alert dialog I'm just going to demonstrate what we can do with closing this so what we're gonna do is the selector we're going to be using is this so we're referencing the dialogue itself and then I'm just gonna say doc dialogue close so what that's going to do is that's going to closed off this dialogue so let me just go ahead and refresh and click Save now when we press ok this closes so we've determined that pressing ok is now going to close the dialogue and the variety of other options you can supply within here but obviously for now this okay button is just going to close okay so now what we want to do is we want to supply some more some more options so just after you can see this is highlighted in red here is starting to look a bit messy we're going to supply more options just here so the first option I'm going to choose is clothes on escape now what clothes on escape does is it will actually close this dialog box if the user presses escape on their keyboard so at the moment we can close it either here we can close it either here here or you can have a variety of other buttons or I'm just again I'm just going to go ahead and press escape on my keyboard which I've just done and that has closed the dialog box so by defining this option here closed on escape set to true by default it's set to false the user can press escape on their keyboard and that dialog box will close so let's go ahead and define some more options the first the other thing you'll notice with this is that it is draggable we can drag it around the page which might be a bit of a pain we might not want to drag this around the page if you had some perhaps content in here that you wanted the user to be able to move and work on more here you're more than welcome to have it draggable but for now I'm just creating a dialog box with a notification so I want this to be not draggable or not to be draggable so I'm just going to simply divide define the draggable option and I'm gonna set this to false quite simply and now when i refresh I can't actually drag it around it won't let me drag it trying to click won't work the other problem we have is that this dialog is now resizable I can resize it from the top I can resize it from the sides I can resize it using this keep not keeping an aspect ratio now there are a variety of options you can do if you would like the user to be able to resize a dialog box you can set a minimum height and a minimum width we looked at the jQuery interactions and the draggable interaction sorry the resizable interaction in jQuery UI which allow which allowed us to set a minimum width and a minimum height that a particular element can be resized to in this case we don't really want the user to be resizing this dialog box around we can set the we can either set or keep it as cific sighs so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go over to you ijs and I'm gonna supply resizable folks so I'm changing resizable the ability to resize it to false so now when i refresh the first thing you'll notice is this little resize icon is gone and now we can't move it and we can't resize it so it's just a static dialog box in the middle of the page we can go ahead and close that now
