hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be learning a very important part of programming we're going to be learning what's called the trycatch statement so let's go ahead and create a new project and basically what the trycatch statement does is you put a block of code inside of your try statement and what it does is it tests it runs the code to see if it gets the errors now the reason you would want to put it in a try statement is let's say you have some code that you know may return an error based on certain circumstances you'll want to put that in a trycatch statement so that if there's an error happening your program will not crash and it will catch the exception and it will keep running at normally so let's come over here to our toolbox and we will add a list box and a button so we'll click button so we'll set the text of button to add all and we'll set the name to button add so let's go ahead and double click on add all so it'll open up our form one class and let's go ahead and create an array so private my array as integer and let's go ahead and give it some values so we will have five four three two and one okay so whenever they click Add it's going to add all of the items in the array to the list box so for let's just do index as integer and we'll set it equal to zero and we want to go to what well we have zero one two three four so zero to four what we want to do is list list box 1 dot items add and we'll go ahead and add my array at index okay so let's go ahead and run this and it should be working perfectly if we click at all we get five four three two and one now if we go from zero to five we're going to get an outofbounds error because this only goes zero one two three four and if we try to access five so what we try to access index five we get what's called an outofbounds error which means that you're trying to access some memory that isn't there so let's go ahead and run this and you can see that if we add all the program freezes up and it's not working and it crashes and it shows us an index out of range exception and it was unhandled and says the index was out of balance of the array so what we can do to keep this error from crashing crashing our program is enclose it in a trycatch so we got we put try before it and then after it after it we put catch and then in try so this is the very basic trycatch statement so it's going to try this code right here and if anything happens to causes an error what we want to do is so a message box so a message box and then we will say an error has occurred I think that's how you spell occurred so let's go ahead and run this and you can see when we click at all it says an error has occurred so what it does is it goes through and it adds everything perfectly and then once it accesses index which is out of bounds as five it's going to go ahead and then error is going to happen and this right here is waiting for that error it's going to catch it and when it catches an error it's going to do whatever code is inside of the catch statement so we'll go ahead and run that again so what happens is it it runs perfectly fine and we get the results that we want but then it stops itself before the program just crashes completely so practice a couple trycatch statement you may even be able to add them to a program that you've already made which will make it run a lot better it'll keep errors from happening well the errors will still happen that will just be handled so once you got the basics of the try catch down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and we're going to be learning more about these
