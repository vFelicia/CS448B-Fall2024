all righty mates welcome back and now that we have where shark downloaded and installed we're going to start figuring out how the heck to use it it looks kind of overwhelming at first just because there's so much stuff going on especially when you start capturing traffic but I'm going to be breaking down the interface showing you guys what all the different pieces do what ones you use what ones you really don't use that often and yeah nothing me talking let's go ahead and get started so the welcome screen whenever you first start Wireshark you're going to have this screen right here now a lot of these for example whenever you start capturing traffic then all your recent project files are going to be right here this little section will actually take you to the website that I showed you guys in the last video so if you just want to look through some traffic that other people captured and uploaded maybe you're curious about a specific type of network or something like that then you can download the sample files from here also they give you some other links like to their websites homepage user guide in some other help sections as well the main section that we use from here is this one right here so these are all the capture settings so we can either capture our own traffic however if you did download one of those sample files and you want to review that then if you just go to file open then you can choose whatever file you downloaded so this was the HTTP one that I told you guys download but I'm not going to open that because I'm going to show you guys how to capture your own traffic so in order to start listening for the traffic on your network you first need to choose an interface now depending on how your network set up and what next you have installed on your computer this section is going to be different for everyone so this is my main neck and right now I'm just sitting at a regular desktop and I have I believe it's on board um it came installed on my motherboard but if you guys have like other wireless cards that you bought then they're going to pop up here to you guys probably won't even have these because I have virtual machines installed on my computer and whenever you install a virtual machine then it comes with a virtual interface but just select your main one whatever it is for your computer and then you can hit start so what this is going to do is going to say okay this is how connected to the Internet start listening for traffic on that network now as you can see I'm not even going to any websites or anything like that however I do have a browser open so it's doing a bunch of stuff behind the scenes and that's what's kind of amazing that people don't realize is that whenever you're just like this all right got nothing going on just you know looking at my desktop your computer is doing a lot of crap as you guys can see so I'm just going to go to some other site and it doesn't matter what slice I'm going to right now so open your browser and start you know go to like two or three websites and then come back here and click stop now let me pull this back up don't mind what I'm doing right now this is just because I was playing around with this before the tutorial but you guys are going to see basically something like this now just a real brief overview and I'll talk to you guys about everything in detail but of course this is your main menu bar up here these are commonly used tools this is so you can filter specific packets and down here as it was pretty clear whenever you start capturing traffic or packets they're all going to pop up right here so the more people that you have on your network and the more websites that they're going to or whatever they're doing the more packets are going to have if it's just you then you know they probably won't be coming in that fast but if you just want to cycle through these and you can just click on the different ones or press up and down then you can see all of the different packets that are being transferred over your network and if you guys don't understand what any of this crap means then don't worry like I said we're going to be going into everything in detail I just want to give you a a little basic a broad overview of interface right now so whenever you click a packet then of course you're going to be able to look at more information about it now this middle section right here this is information about your packet in human readable form this bottom section we really don't use that much because this is just the bits view and actually if you rightclick this and choose bits view so this is basically how your router and your NIC card are going to see you know the pulses of electricity that's why I said it's not really useful not that it's not important but you know we can't read this so to us humans we really don't want to see it that much so we are usually going to be looking at the individual packets and the information in human readable form and if you just want to hide this section down here then if you go to view and uncheck packet bytes then it's going to hide it right there so if you ever want to hide some of these sections then the packet list is the top one the packet details are details about that individual packet in human readable form and of course the bytes if for some reason you like looking at the ones and zeros then boom there you go now another thing that people like to do is maybe they let me pop that back up again maybe they actually want to see this in they want their layout arranged a little bit differently so maybe you want all the packets on the right hand side and the details on the left hand side maybe that's a cool layout so if you go to edit preferences these are your main Wireshark preferences now I say what are sharp because there isn't too much information about the actual packets and information this is pretty much just for the Wireshark environment the colors the layout how you want your sections arranged all this stuff so if you click the layout right here then you can just choose a really general layout so how do you want all your sections organized you can actually choose to you know not even display one at all and you can also choose some other stuff as well maybe I'll show you guys so you see in the packets you have a number which is pretty much just the ID the time of the capture the source where it's coming from where it's going to you know the protocol a bunch of information if you're like you know what I really don't care about this time that much you can actually uncheck that and then that column will be hidden so pretty much like I said she's going to go ahead and hit apply no ok so if you just ever want to control maybe hide some stuff maybe show some stuff organize your layout then you can go there and you're going to be good to go now one last thing that I'm going to recommend doing we hide this is this so if you go to view and then you go to name resolution make sure that you have this enabled for Mac layer so you know whenever you have a mac address it's pretty much it looks like a bunch of weird numbers well the first section of your mac address is actually there to identify the manufacturer or the distributor basically the company that made your network interface card so if you have this enabled then it's going to take those numbers and translate it to the company's name so that way it's going to say something like alright so right here like ASIS or ASIS whatever so they made this net card so that's why instead of having a weird long number like this you can actually see it it just says a sus and I don't know it's just a little bit more helpful to me at least so it takes this weird number and translates it for the name however what you probably don't want to do is you don't want to resolve just every single name because if you start traveling trying to pretty much translate all of these IP addresses then what it's going to do is it's going to try to connect to a DNS server every time and then you're going to have a lot more traffic kind of unnecessary traffic that you really don't care about so I know I'm kind of overwhelming you guys already but get your layout how you want it arranged you know all these panels all these sections display the ones you want by the ones that you don't want and once you got a decent feel of the environment then we can move on to the next video where we are going to be talking about the capture settings
