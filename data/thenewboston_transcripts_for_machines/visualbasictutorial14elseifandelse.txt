hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and this tutorial we're going to be covering the else if and else statement so the last tutorial we covered the if statement now let's go ahead and get started we're going to start off by using console dot write line and we'll just type what is your name and now we're going to create a variable called username and we're going to store the information that the user types in as user name so we'll declare username so dim user name as string and we'll set it equal to console dot read line so now what we want to do is we want to ask them for the password so we'll just type console dot write line what is your password and will declare the password so dim password as string as equal to console dot readline ok so now what we want to do is we want to create an if statement to see if they typed in a name that is in let's say a list of possible names that can be logged in so if username equals Sam or if not Sam say not same same then do something so if username is equal to Sam then we'll do console dot write line welcome Sam now we want to cover any other cases that could happen now I could do this with a bunch of if statements that's not very efficient we can use what's called an elseif statement so we just do this by typing else if username equals Tim so if username equals Tim then we want to do something so we'll just type console dot write line welcome Tim so basically basically what we've done is if username is equal to Sam then go ahead and say welcome Sam but if username is equal to Tim then say welcome Tim and this is all in one if statement by using else if in case somebody else tries to login and we don't know who they are we're just going to tell them that they have typed in an invalid name now to do this we're going to type else so else they can go ahead and do the code that is inside in between else and then div so what else does is it covers anything else that you did not cover so if username equals Sam they're just going to go ahead and do this but else say if username equals Tim it'll do this and if username equals anything else other than Sam or Tim then go ahead and do whatever we type inside here so we'll just type console dot write line you are not a valid user and then after our end if we'll just do console dot read line so that so that the user has time to see if they've been accepted or see if they type in the right name so if we do what is your name and I type in Sam you'll say what is your password I'll just type in the New Boston it'll say welcome Sam and then it won't say anything else after that because we haven't added anything that will handle the password so now if we run that again it'll say what is your name I'll type in Tim or let's see this is casesensitive so Tim and say what is your password type in a bunch of stuff right there it says welcome Tim now if we type in anything else other than Sam or Tim it's going to say you are not a valid user so we can do the same thing with our password so if password equals the new Boston then go ahead and let the user know that they have been granted access so we'll just type console dot write line and we'll say congrats and then we'll just add their username so congrats username and then we'll say you have been granted access now this isn't very secure but it's just for the sake of this tutorial let's say instead of you are not a valid user let's just say I don't know who you are so that way the person doesn't have to have the right username but if they have the let's say the administrator password then they can go ahead and login so I don't know who you are so if we go ahead and run this say what is your name let's just say Sam what is your password type the New Boston it'll say welcome Sam congratulations Sam you have been granted access now what we need to do is add a space right here so that Sam isn't right next to that so now if we type an invalid username it'll say let's just do this and if we type in the New Boston you see that will get the output I don't know who you are and I'll say congrats a da FA you have been granted access so go ahead and practice some else if statements and some else statements get familiar with that and then once you have that nailed down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
