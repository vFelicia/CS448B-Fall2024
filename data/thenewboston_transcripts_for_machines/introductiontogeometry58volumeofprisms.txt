okay so today we're g to finally be finding the volume of a prism so the volume of a rectangular prism is length time width time height so length times width times our perpendicular height or altitude so volume is equal to 14 * 15 * 5 so since those are kind of big numbers I'm going to put this in a calculator 14 * 15 * 5 1 050 cm cubed because we're taking cenm time C cenm time cenm so we're going to get centime cubed volume because it's a measure of threedimensional it measures how much space something takes up and since space is a threedimensional measure we have to have cenm cubed a volume of a non rectangular prism is its base area times its height so for this triangle it would be 1 12 base time height because that would be the area of this space right here times the height of the prism so for this triangle it's going to be 1 12 base which is this five right here times height which is which has been drawn in for us and it's perpendicular to the base and its measures 3 time 3 so first what we're going to do is find the um area of the base which we're just going to call Ba so 12 5 * 3 okay so 12 of 5 * 3 1 12 5 * 3 is 15 so our base area is 15 halfes so now we're going to take 15 halves and times it by 3 15 * 3 is 45 over to and pretend that they gave us that this is millimet so it' be millim cubed and I'm just going to leave it like that because there's no point in getting a not pretty decimal this is more accurate so now we're going to do an example find the volume so this is a trapezoidal prism because its bases are a trapezoid so first for the volume it's base area times height so let's find our base area if you remember the area of a trapezoid is 1 12 base 1 which is 4 plus base 2 which is 8 times the perpendicular height which is 3 so make sure you add these together before you multiply by two or 1/2 I mean so 4 + 8 is 12 12 of 12 is 6 * 3 is 18 so the area of our base is is 18 cm squared so now we're going to take our base area and multiply it by the height of this prism which is three so our volume is 54 cm cubed well that's actually all we're going to do for volume but make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we're going to talk about the surface area of a cylinder
