hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be changing some things about the log um like adding the ability to show or hide the log and also um adding the ability to hook the log to our form so let's say this window is our form whenever this is moved around the log is going to be moved around and connected to it so before we get started I just want to apologize for some of the logic errors in my last tutorials um such as in the first two game tutorials and then tutorial 159 um for the most part I was making up this game as I was going along and I wanted to do that because if I went ahead and prewrote the code before I did it first of all it would take a really long time and second of all it would make it seem to you guys that like whenever you're making a program you're going to come up with the best best most efficient code with no errors at first and that's not realistic to what programming is like you when you're programming you come up with ideas as you go along you come up with better ways and you will run into logic errors um that don't actually show up um in your error list because it's something that you did wrong or in this case I did wrong and it's nothing has nothing to do with a compiler or the program so I wanted to apologize for that um I did fix those in tutorial 106 um you can see that I added some uh annotations to the tutorials where the errors were created so that I won't get trolled in the comments so now that we got that out of the way um let's go ahead and we will hook our log to the form one so what we're going to do is we're going to set the position of new log so new log. location is going to be equal to a new point now a point is a point that has has X and Y coordinates because the location property for any form is going to be of type point so we have to create a new point and the location is going to be me do location do X so what this is going to do is it's going to get the X Lo of the current form which is form one so the ex location of new log is going to be the same ex location as form one so the X location would be across so we want it to be the same across um as it is form one so it'll be a straight line down each of the sides so we got me. loation dox and then for the y coordinate we'll do me. location doy but we need to to subtract some from it so let's open up the designer for form 1vb and you can see that the size uh 457 across 328 down so let's go ahead and try 328 so the Y location and we want to add 328 because all coordinates start from the top left corner of the screen and they go forward you cannot have negative coordinates so it's it's not like a normal grid where it is um across with a point in the middle and then it has negative coordinates the point in the middle would be the top left corner of your screen so let's go ahead and try plus 328 so it's going to set the coordinates of our new log to just below our form one and it's going to be touching the form one but what if they move form one well we want to move that um log with it so go ahead and click the lightning bolt on this and we need to find the move event so you can see here we've got move so whenever form one has moved we will Tye we will set new log. location equals and then we'll do a new point and we'll do me. location dox and then me. location doy and then we're going to add 328 so every time it's moved it's going to update the location so hopefully everything will work here well here and we won't get any logic errors um so you can see that here is our game and here is our log you can see that the log is touching right to the bottom of the game and when we move the game around you can see that the log is attached to the game and it moves with it so this is something very useful very cool that I figured out um if you've ever used team view or you've probably wondered how they did that well this is um a similar method and it works the same way but then you can also move this log away um from the game it looks like I shook it there and so but then once you move the game again it resets it back to the original position which is connected to it and it'll function just like normal
