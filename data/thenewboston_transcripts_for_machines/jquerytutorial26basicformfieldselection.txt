and then the color of it and I'm going to choose yellow okay so now let's take a look at how that works and then I'll show you how it wouldn't work if we'd used our original way when we click on it you can see it's turn to yellow when we click on the other one you can see that also turns to yellow however they've both remained yellow so now we have the problem that we want to create this to you know change back to white however as I mentioned before if we had used text like that and we refresh when I click on just the first one you can see that they both change to yellow because we've selected text and not this which will refer to the current field it's changed both of the background colors to yellow okay so now let's go ahead and use the blur out two or the blur sorry to remove this yellow once we've lost focus of the text fields so inside of here we need to create a function this is the blur event handler and we want to do exactly the same thing but this time we want to say dot CSS and we want to change the background color to white or we could use hash ffff depending on your choice okay so this is the first part of the example application complete you can see I've now clicked on it and it's turned yellow when I move away it goes back to white so I can either I can either click in and tab down or and then I can click away or I can click on this one and tab up and you'll see that we get the essentially the same effect so or the correct effect so now that we've got that sorted we need to change the sign up button so when we click on it it disables and shows a please wait message so let's go ahead and select the button element so this would happen for all buttons on the current page and because we're going to be using this it doesn't actually matter what we do well it doesn't matter that we're only selecting all buttons on the page so button click we need to apply a function to this and inside of here we need to change a few things so the first thing we need to change is this etre which is going to change the attribute of the field the attribute that we want to change is the field value at the moment the value is signup what we want to do is change the value to please wait and then underneath here we want to change it so we disable the button so we'll do that in a moment once we've filled out the form in Thailand we click signup it changes to please wait however we can still click on it now inside of here you might want to add functions that validate the form on the front end and then obviously in the backend of things you would validate again you might also want to add functionality to actually submit the whole form itself I'm not going to show you how to do that in that tutorial but it's quite easy to look up so the last thing that we want to do is go ahead and disable the button so we use this dot atre again so we're changing an attribute this time we're changing disabled to true and we're not supplying this inside string so it's not string data its boolean data so once we filled out the form and we have these colors changing nicely when we click sign up the button is disabled and it says please wait so in this example application we've looked at form fields themselves and buttons themselves and we're actually changing these based on an event using the CSS functionality so like I've said before this is extremely useful to implement into your site because then this will apply for all forms that you actually create so depending on what the forms for it will achieve exactly the same effect as well as this button as well but like I mentioned before you might want some kind of functionality in here to submit the current form because obviously at the moment this button you know it's just disabling itself and showing the text please wait
