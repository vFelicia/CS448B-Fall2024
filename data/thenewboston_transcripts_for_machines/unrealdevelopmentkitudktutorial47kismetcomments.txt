what is going on guys welcome to your 47th udk tutorial and this is going to be a really quick tutorial because before we go on any further with kismet I need to talk to you guys about adding comments to kismet because later on we're going to be building big kismet sequences and things are going to get all jumbled together and we're going to be connecting wires all over the place and at first glance things can get kind of confusing so I'm going to teach you guys how to add these things called comments and helps organize and visually see your kismet a whole lot easier so the first thing I want to teach you guys is about object comments now each of these things like this event the sound this toggle this variable each one of these things is an object and you can add a comment individually to each one of these so for example if we have a million different light switches in our you know level or on our sequence we need to be able to identify each one in look at this trigger 0 trigger one trigger to that can get a little bit confusing whenever you have a huge map so go ahead and in order to add a comment right above this you just go ahead and select it in under sequence object you have the optional comments so I'm just going to go ahead and add you would add something like oops easy caps locks bathroom light switch or something like that now just go ahead and focus away and now you can see you have a comment above it this has bathroom light switch so you know if you think about it this way in your house you have a bunch of different light switches and if you just go ahead and identify my trigger zero trigger 1002 then it will get kind of confusing but if your mom says go ahead and turn off the bathroom light switch then you be able to identify a lot easier so I don't need to tell you guys the importance of comments in that sense so let me go ahead and just comment some of the rest of these object comment on the sound is just what sounded we have um I think we it was like a gun sound so that looks good right there and for this toggle we'll just go ahead and write turn lights on and off that's pretty good and for this variable we'll just put like light bulb so now even if you don't know kismet at all you can pretty easily see what's going on alright here's a bathroom light switch and now whenever you touch it a gun sound place and also when you touch it it turns lights on and off and this is your light bulb right there so again if you were working as a team then comments would come in handy so much because they don't have to go through each one of these vents look at the properties and say alright what's this one do try to figure out everything so aside from just object comments you also can have something called group comments so in order to select group remember you go ahead and you hold ctrl + alt on your keyboard and then you select a group of objects so now I have all four of these objects selected now we can go ahead and either right click and add new comment and there's another way but I'm just going to go ahead and show you guys the easiest way so with all of those selected go ahead and hit right click new comment and will just write something like um lighting system and now go ahead and hit okay and it draws a box around all of these objects and calls it lighting system so now you don't even have to look at all of these piece by piece you can just send this to somebody and they know all right all of these objects make up the lighting system so this is a whole lot easier to see then you know just opening a kismet for the very first time say someone handed off the project to you and try and figure out what everything does so again comments are going to come in handy so much not only when you're working with a team but when you're working with yourself and you have huge levels it's going to help you organize a whole lot so again one last time to select the group objects just go ahead and hit ctrl + alt and drag and then you get a group of objects selected so aside from this I just want to go over this real quick this sequence frame right here the size is of course the size of the frame the border with I usually like to bump this up to two or three and for the sake of this sorel let me just make it five or something and this makes your border a little bit thicker because I don't really like one because one is the size of these wires so I know I just like a little bit different personal preference and the other two things I like or well of the fill color I don't even get in that the border color is I usually like to change this to something a little bit different so by default it's black like that so let me go ahead and change it to like a blue or something hit OK and now it's blue so whenever you have a bunch of different systems rigged up trust me and I know I can't really demonstrate this because i only have one system but changing your border color two different colors is incredibly useful especially when you zoom out you can easily see well just trust me change your border colors to different colors it's going to help you out a lot so anyways that's a tutorial on comments like I said a real quick tutorial to help you guys better organized and better visually see what's going on with kismet so you don't have to figure everything out every time you want to go back and change something so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe it now see you guys in the next video
