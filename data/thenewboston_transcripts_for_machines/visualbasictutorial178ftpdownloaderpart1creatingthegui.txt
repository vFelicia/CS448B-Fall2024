hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the New Boston in this tutorial we're gonna start a new project now what we're gonna be doing in this new project is creating an FTP downloader so that we can connect to FTP servers see what files are on there download upload delete files whatever you want so let's go ahead and create a new project if you don't know what FTP is then you may want to do a little bit of research on that it's File Transfer Protocol and you can set up an FTP server of your own and it can host files and people can connect to it so we'll select a windows forms application we'll call it FTP downloader and I'll just add YouTube at the end of this so we'll go ahead and click OK and we'll wait for that to load ok so once that's done loading let's go ahead and create our form so let's set the text to FTP downloader and now I need to do is let's add some labels and some text boxes so you can see here I've already created these and we've got a label and this is label two so let's call it label server we got label user name and let's use label password and for each one of these text boxes we've got text FTP server which you can see right there txt FDP and text ftp password now whenever you're connecting to an FTP server you need a username and a password so here's our server this comes I have it set to default to have this server in there which is the one that we're going to be using and there's no use trying to connect to this yourself because you cannot connect to a local FTP server this can only be connected to you if you're on my network at home if you try to connect to this site on your computer it won't work so now we need to do is let's add some buttons and a phox to show all the files so underneath our server text boxes with the username of the password let's add some buttons so we've got update server open folder home directory and download so for update server what this is gonna do is it's gonna let us change the values in these fields now you may be saying well you can change them anyway well we're gonna set it to where you cannot change the values of these fields while you're browsing through the server and then you have to click update server to change the credentials so we can open folders so if there are folders on our server we can open those we can go back to the home directory and we can download a file ok so now let's add two more buttons so we have an upload end a delete so when we use the upload it's going to upload to the current directory that we are in so it'll open up a file browser dialog and it'll let us upload to that directory and delete will simply delete a file or a folder now you may be thinking how it was I'm how's it going to do this stuff well we haven't actually added the code yet and that's what we're gonna be doing in the upcoming tutorials so let's just go ahead and add some more controls that we're going to need to use okay so I'm going to go ahead and paste these in and now you guys are gonna have to create these controls I have already made this program so it will make it easier for me to teach you guys because I already know what's going to happen and how to do everything so we had three buttons load files clear and start checking for new files so load files will load all the files in the FTP server clear will clear our list box of all the files and then start checking for new files will start running a background process that will check to see if new files have been added and when it does it will notify if new files are found it will notify us so let's go ahead and we'll make everything just look a little bit neater in here so now let's go ahead and add the list box that will show all the files so I'll just go ahead and paste this in so here is on this box and it has a label that says name and it's got a list of SFTP files now you can set these buttons to whatever you want but we're gonna be using them with these names later on we've got button clear list button check for new files button start check timer button delete button upload button download button home directory button change directory button update settings and so now let's just go ahead and let the user know what directory they're in so we'll add a label that will show this so I'll go ahead and add a label here and you can see it says current directory now if you don't know what this is a directory is just pretty much a folder path so the main directory of your FTP server is going to be just a forward slash because you're not inside of any folders so go ahead and create this a user interface and make sure you name everything something easier for you to remember and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial where we will start adding code that will make this work
