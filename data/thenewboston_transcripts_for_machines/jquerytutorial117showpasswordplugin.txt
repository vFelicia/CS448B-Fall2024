uh obviously you could have a global JavaScript file with uh all your plugin initial initialization uh another jQuery code uh but for now I'm just going to call this password. JS I'm then going to go ahead and include that as well so password. JS is going to be the file that we actually uh initiate this plugin from so as long as all of these are included in our page we can go ahead and do that so I've included uh a script obviously exactly the same thing with this password. JS file here so now that we've got our plugin uh available to use on our page and we've got our password. JS file we can go ahead and write our jQuery code in here to initialize this plugin so assuming I don't know how to install this plugin many authors will uh give you some kind of indication of how to use this so you'll see that we have on this page some information uh we can see that all we need to do is create um an input field with a type of password and Supply an ID for this as well so that's the first step that we're going to go ahead and uh carry out so input type equals password and we'll give this an ID of a password so now that we've given this an ID we can use this as we normally would uh other elements in jQuery or other elements in HTML to reference to this and we can use a selector to select this element and then apply the um the plugin to it so here you can see it's most basic form uh you can you just literally need to select the element which will be a password and then you need to just call this show password here so let's go ahead and do this now remember our ID is a password so in here when we create our selector we want to choose a password and then the call for this plugin is show password now it's extremely important to note that jQuery uh obviously JavaScript as well is K sensitive so we want to ensure that we use a capital A small s and a capital P exactly as stated here and uh earlier I said that this index.php will provide an a demo as well so if you go ahead and you're not too sure or the documentation limited on the website and they do include uh a demo file uh go ahead and open that demo file up and you'll be able to see all the relevant information there so with regards to this now this should be activated so we haven't supplied any options to that but we'll make uh options to this but we'll take a look at that in just a moment so let's go over to our page and press refresh you can now see that we've got our form field that we created earlier and we've got this show password check boox here so obviously to test it's working we want to go ahead and enter a password and click show password uh and it does appear to be working so as well as that uh if we were to go over to the documentation as well we can go ahead and look at some examples given uh this is particularly well document uh documented uh we've got some uh paragraphs here just giving you know a lot as much detail as possible so you can see here we've got a few options that we can uh give this uh for example text and uh that's you know sort of noted here that it would show the custom password text so at the moment on our page it just says show password so for example if we want to change this uh we just take a look at the notation on the website uh so in here we can um specify particular options so uh with regards to this one we would need to supply an element and then the options associated with that element so in this case Checker uh we can change the text so we need to supply Checker and then in Brackets we need to supply any options uh that are available so in here we can go ahead and uh the class Checker contains the following options we can supply text so for example reveal and uh now when we refresh this uh you can see that the text Will oh no hold on let's see what we might have done wrong here there we are so Checker and then we've got a colon and then in Brackets we've got the uh options associated with this particular class so now when we refresh uh it still hasn't worked and that is because sorry not a colon we've got a comma because remember this is the uh the element and this is the op these are the options so finally uh no uh so let's go ahead I think I know what's wrong I think uh I haven't read this properly um yeah okay so uh I've misread it and uh haven't done my research correctly uh but what we're actually going to do here is we are specifying an element that we want to inject um the checkbox into so let's go ahead and create a span just at the end of here and I'll call this checkbox so now in password. JS we can go ahead and say checkbox text reveal and that should give us that option there okay so uh another probably point now to make is actually read the uh text rather than just looking at the options so now that we've done that we have uh supplied the checkbox uh class which I've assigned to this span just here um with the text reveal and we've we've given the we've put the text box into this uh span here uh and then just specified a particular option so that covers just installing uh a very basic uh jQuery plugin um we've already spoken about why we use plugins but things like this um obviously are useful um and uh and a relatively small in file size we saw in in our archive earlier that we've got a 1.7 KB file so you're looking at something that's uh you know quite quick to run and uh the benefit of this is we have a minified and compressed version as well
