hello everyone my name is Sarah and in this video we are going to cover some organic and biochemistry fun stuff right this is still just uh introduction introductory material so it's not going to be explained in a lot of detail but as with a lot of other things I've already covered I will be explaining it in much greater detail in future videos I just can't fit everything into one 10minute video anyways cells are basically just tiny little chemical factories they're constantly working to break down build or modify compounds cells contain both organic compounds which contain hydrogen and carbon in a chemical combination and also inorganic compounds which do not contain carbon and hydrogen in a chemical compound this is not to say that inorganic compounds cannot contain carbon for example diamond is made of carbon however diamond is not a an organic comp compound since pretty much all the chemistry that happens within a cell is organic chemistry that's what I'm going to be talking about in this video we're going to cover lipids carbohydrates proteins and nucleic acids before I cover those things though I'm just going to introduce you guys to a couple of functional groups that are found in organic molecules that will be important for you to know later on we start off with hydroxy groups um you have an oxygen and a hydrogen these are known as alcohols and they have the formula R which stands for pretty much any other carbon hydrogen Group whatever o which is your hydroxy group an example would be ethanol or your typical alcohol what's found in beer vodka teila whatever excuse me as you can see here there are two carbons and your hydroxy group we next have carbonal groups which have the function C with a double bonded oxygen and two other groups on either side you have ketones and aldhy the only difference between ketones and aldhy is that one of the r groups has to be a hydrogen for an aldah an example of a ketone would be acetone or nail polish remover and an example of an alahh is a seed alahh which is believed to cause hangovers when you drink too much of this you can see the double bonded oxygen and the hydrogen for the aldah and the double bonded oxygen and these two methyl groups for the Ketone carboxy groups have the chemical formula c o um these are known as carboxilic acids and the general structure is a c double bonded o and then you have a hydroxy group here that's very it's very important to remember the difference between carboxy and carbonal groups um and example of a carboxilic acid is acetic acid also known as vinegar you can see here you've got your carbon double bonded oxygen hydroxy group right here we next have amino group which are called amines these are a nitrogen and bound to some other organic molecule an example would be ethylamine and you can see here n hren to hydrogen there are different classifications of amines you have primary amines secondary amines and tertiary Ames this has to do with the number of hydrogens attached to the nitrogen a primary amine has two hydrogens on the nitrogen secondary amine has one hydrogen and two R groups and a tertiary I mean does not have any hydrogens instead it's all R groups next we have phosphates you have a phosphorus three oxygens excuse me four oxygen one one one one and a double bonded oxygen and this has a charge of 2 this is what is called a polyatomic ion but anyways an example of a phosphate would be glucose 6 phosphate glucose is a carbohydrate a sugar here you can see the phosphate attached to the sixth carbon right here and the last one is a sulf hydro group or thol or mer captons an example is butane thol four carbons sulfur hydrogen and thil are sulfur containing groups think of it as a sulfur alcohol
