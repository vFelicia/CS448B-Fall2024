hi this is Alex from PHP academy' and in this video for the new Boston we're going to be looking at continued string functions however what we're going to be doing is we're going to be creating a small program that allows you use it input and then we're going to sense out certain words that we don't want to be included so it's quite a fun program to make and you get to specify your own words that you want to be excluded and we obviously are taking user input so it's interactive and it helps you learn to that degree so the first thing I'm going to do is create a form with an action and a method now we've already discussed this I'm going to create the methodist post because we're going to be sending a fairly large text area size worth of data and the action is just going to come straight back to index dot PHP but obviously if you're creating a program that let's say post a comment you're going to want this value to go maybe to another page too to process but entirely up to you where your form is being processed so now what we need to do is we need to type or create a text area so we're going to start and in the text area and we're going to give this a name of user underscore input and I'm going to give it a rose and the Cowles value and this is rows and columns so rows about seven and we'll say columns about 30 let's make this a six actually so let's preview what we've got so far in our browser let's just go to there okay so we've got a small text area we're going to also create a submit button so let's break down a couple of times and then we an input type of submit and then we can give it a value of submit to ensure this value is displayed on the button so let's refresh and see what we've got there okay so we've got our submit button we've got our we've got our text area so what I want to do is I'm going to create a horizontal line just up here and that's just going to separate the content that we display back to the user and this form so now what I'm going to do is inside PHP we need to do first of all a few checks to ensure that this user input value has been submitted and that contain some text so we're going to create an if statement and then the block here is what we're going to run if inside here this block is what we're going to run if this is successful so we're going to say if is set and then inside this function we're going to say post user input and we're also going to check using a logical operator and we're also going to check if it's not empty so I'm using an exclamation marks another logical operator to say it is not empty and this is obviously a function if not empty dollar underscore post user input so we've already addressed this in other tutorials but basically what we're looking for is the user input to be there and to have some content inside of it so let's just echo this to test if it works so let's get back on here so if we click it without entering anything nothing happens if we type some text inside of it and click Submit it works so now we are all set to process this data that has been typed in this text area okay so actually what I'm going to do beforehand is just embed in here some data and that's already been submitted so the user can look at what they've written look at what they've submitted this is just purely for learning purposes so you can get an idea of this so let's first of all create a variable up here called user input that's going to be equal to dollar underscore post user underscore input so we're just taking the variables from our form of the data from our form so we can echo user input and now what's going to happen is when we do submit data in here when we submit it it's going to work out what's happened there so look try and submit that no okay so obviously we're echoing out this inside but we're not echoing out here that's why it's not being displayed so as it stands at the moment as we let's come back and refresh this as we type text into here we submit it's displayed here and kept in here that's just a little tweak to ensure that we keep everything consistent so now what we need to do we'll get rid of this is we need to create two arrays which I'm going to create up here and the first one is going to be called find and next one's going to be cool to replace so the find array is going to be words that we want to find and I'm just going to keep these as names for now so I'm going to have three names and that's going to be Alex Billy down ok so the array to replace is the values we want to replace so we have the same corresponding values so Alex will correspond to this one here and I'm just going to keep that as Alex with the two stars in the middle Billy with the 3 stars just in the middle there asterixis if you like and Dale with exactly the same thing
