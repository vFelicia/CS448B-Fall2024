inside the text area so we use again we reference or no for the first time we reference text area and then we need to say dot key up and inside of here we need to create a function and this function is going to happen every time a key is raised um when when text is being typed into this text area so let's think about what we need to do we first of all need to grab the length of the text inside of this text area so we can do that with a combination of jQuery and raw JavaScript as well so let's create a new variable and this is going to be called text length I'm going to make this equal to again with reference to text area we're going to say dot val now do Val gets the value of the text that's inside the text area so for example on the this function key up on this event handler key up if I was to type Alex for every time I've pressed a key the value is now Alex so the first value was a then I typed L then I typed e and X now the current value is Alex therefore this text length is now equal to Alex so despite the fact that our variable is called text length we still don't have the length however in JavaScript we can use do length without the uh parentheses and what this will do is it will take the length of this value of this text area so now text length is equal to four as opposed to Alex okay so now we can create a basic sum to deduct the amount the the length of the text from the maximum value so we can create a new variable called text remaining and we can make this equal to text Max minus text length so this will be 55 minus and in this case four which would equal 51 and therefore this would have displayed 51 had we have had this in place beforehand now that we've created these two variables we want to finally uh output this to the text area feedback div so we can say dollar and we reference text area feedback then we say HTML as we did up here with this um function up here and then we say um textor remaining plus and then we do exactly the same as we did up here characters remaining now the reason we initially did this is because we would have had to wait for a key to be pressed and released in order to actually put some information into this text area feedback div so at first we initiated this by putting the maximum amount of characters remaining into the box before the user typed anything that way we don't have to wait for the user to press a key in order for anything to be displayed in this feedback area so now that we've done that this should work so we can go ahead and refresh the page and start typing so initially we have 55 characters remaining I've just explained uh how we did that now as soon as we start typing what will happen well we'll grab the value of the text area deduct it from the maximum characters and display it back out in this area so let's just start to type and you can see the uh character count decreases so as we type um let's just say I'm typing something in this text area I hope it will all okay so I was going to type I hope it will all fit but now we are at zero characters remaining so we've performed some frontend validation essentially is validation of our form we've cut the user off um using the max length attribute in the text area however we've given the user feedback as to how many characters are remaining now obviously an HTML form can be modified and the max length attribute could have been removed so it's always best to when you submit this data um check in the back end as well obviously we're not going to be looking at that in this tutorial because this is jQuery however if you were using PHP for example you could use the St L function to check this so make sure you as well as checking on the front end also check on the back end as well so that's how to create a dynamic characters remaining counter in jQuery much like you'd find on a lot of websites
