so hopefully this will make sense in a moment when when we write it and you say so I'm gonna say file equals read dir this time and we're applying the handle into that so we're reading in the handle that we've already opened with open dir and let me explain what happens in this loop every time we go around this loop file is going to equal the next file along so in this case we have let's just double check we've got three files here so for the first loop will equal first file dot txt then second file of txt then third file opportunity now it will only represent in a string format so file is now a string format it's it won't it won't actually be a link to the file so we need to do that ourselves so let's go ahead and just test this out we can say echo file and then a line break so let's so preview this in our browser and see what it looks like okay so we we have the first file dot txt second file dot txt and third file dot txt however you can also see that we've got these this double dot here and this single door here this is just part of a normal directory structure so it's as long along with the other files we've also got this which means current directory and this means back our directories so these are the options that we can do by saying go back a directory or forwarded directory but we don't want to include these because we just want to look inside the files a look inside this files directory and list our files so let's go and see what we can do to sort this out now we need to create a condition inside of our loop so we need to create an if statement here and one end that there okay remember your block so we've created an if statement and we need to put a condition in here and the condition is based upon something if it's true we're going to echo the file so the condition could be if file doesn't equal a dot and file doesn't equal two dots so if it doesn't equal a dot and doesn't equal two dots then we connect without a file so therefore these this dot and this two ducts will be eliminated for our list and this echo won't happen okay they're still exist this echo just won't happen so let's go back and refresh and see what that's done okay so that's got rid of the third the one and the two dots there so we've achieved that just simply with an if statement here okay so now what I want to do is create links to the files and we can do this just by appending on an eight eight eight ref equals and then that's the start of the a tag and then we end the a tag them just like you do in a in an HTML document a normal HTML document now the link is going to be the directory and then forward slash the file so inside here what we can do is just append on directory so what I've done here if you didn't already notice I've ended the echo so we've started the echo here but ended the echo here using a dot to append on our directory then we using a dot to append on the rest of it so we can just do for short like you just saw me do two of two of these single quotation marks and then two dots and then in here we can write our variable data so it's directory and then it's forward slash and then two more dots two more single quotation marks and file so now what we can say is when we refresh you can see that these are links now if you look at the bottom of the video in the left lefthand corner you can see localhost forward slash series forward slash file handling for such files and then first file dot txt if I move my mouse down to the second one you can see that at the bottom of the video in the in the bottom of the browser it changes to second file and the same a third file so now we can just click on these and view the contents of the first file view the contents of the second file and view the contents of the third file which you can see I've just written the first file second file and third file but obviously if these were images you could change the a href tag and you can instead change it to image source and you could point the image point the image to point the source to the image that's located within the directory and you could also talk about using functions that we've already already seen in previous tutorials by myself to only show JPEG files so we could what we could do is we could either read in the file itself and check the type or we could select everything after the last dot and say is it a JPEG file but for now I'll leave you this this is a basic this is a basic most standard structure of looping through a file and displaying all files that don't equal a dot and two dots
