hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to look at implementing jQuery into a page and just testing if it actually works or not so one of the things that we need to do uh first of all is go over to the jquery.com homepage and you'll see here that we can actually download jQuery now there's a production and a development version and you're going to need to choose the production version the development version you'll notice is slightly larger it's 229 KB and this is uncompressed code now the reason for this development version is if you are developing plugins I need access to the um uncompressed code for jQuery however the production version is only 31 kiloby and is minified and gzipped now let's take a look at the difference between them quickly you'll see that the uncompressed code just looks like normal Javas script um a large large file um as uh as you would expect from a 229 KV file let's go and look at the production version you can see that it's still long but it has been compressed uh to create a shorter file size so once you have the production version selected go ahead and download J jQuery it should open up in your browser as code what you're going to want to do is select the entire page and copy it to your CL clipboard copy now we want to come over to your text editor and before we paste it into a file we'll just have a look at our directory structure before we continue now when I write uh any JavaScript code I keep it in a file called JS index.php is the file that we've got currently open here and JS is where I would keep all of my JavaScript um files so let's just look in JavaScript you can see that I've created a file called jquery.js I've given it a JS extension and that's the file we've also got open in our text editor so essentially what I'm going to do is I'm going to copy and paste the code from jQuery and I'm going to paste it into this jquery.js file let's go back again now inside index.php and I'm going to include this jQuery file that is found in the JS folder so that's essentially the directory structure we're going to be keeping and where we place jQuery in order to include it into our page so like I said I've got this jquery.js file open in the JS folder and I'm just going to paste the code that I retrieved from the jquery.com website now I'm going well I've saved it out and I need to come over to index.php in order to include it into my page so how do we include it well usually when you're writing code code uh JavaScript code you would start in your head and you would do something like script type is equal to text/javascript so we've got the type attribute in the script tag and then we would come down and we would end our script and we would write our JavaScript code in here now because jQuery is uh a 31kb file and uh we need the body of the document to load before we actually um use things like event uh event handling you'll notice in the last example I showed you with the hide and show button um we actually need to allow every element in our page to be able to load before we actually start to check for elements so we're not going to be writing any code or including any files in the head part of our document we're going to be doing it at the very end of our body so let's go ahead and type script type equal equals text/javascript and let's go ahead and end that script there now usually you would write your code in here however what we're doing is we're including this um just because uh we don't want to paste our code into our document so it would work if you were to paste the jQuery um file into this document let's just wait for that to load okay so I've just managed to get rid of that because the uh file size of that crashed my browser so the example didn't really work however um my point is that we could write our JavaScript code inside of here however what we're doing is we're just simply starting this script tag and ending it but we're supplying the source attribute so we can say JS jquery.js now because we've pasted our jQuery code in here this is now available to use in this document we can write all of our code up here and uh we'll still have um use of the jQuery Library so now what we want to do now that we've included jqu inel page is actually testing whether it works so in the next video we're going to be short creating some short inline um jQuery which is highly discouraged just so we can test the functionality of jQuery and see if it's worked by including it uh by this method you'll often find that if you were to include jQuery and you did it you didn't do it properly you'll have no control uh or use of jQuery at all so extremely it's extremely important if we just create a simple inline test um just to see if it's worked now if you're not sure of the uh difference or the similarities or you know the rights or wrongs of inline or external uh JavaScript then uh this will be explained in another video um you'll be able to understand why it's not so good to use inline uh JavaScript or jQuery now if you remember the example we looked at a couple of videos back you'll notice that I was using um external Javascript and there was no actual JavaScript present within my button or the paragraph that I that I was actually hiding and showing so we'll look at that another video however in the next video we'll look at a quick example to see if jQuery is working on our page
