hi this is Alex from PHP academy' no org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the date picker widget in the jQuery UI now we can bind the date picker to a particular form field so make it easier for us functionality wise to allow our users to pick a date by clicking an input field so at the moment there's nothing on my browser and the first thing I'm going to go ahead and do is create an a input field a text input field so let's go over to our text editor and create an input field and I'm going to give this a type text I'm going to slightly reduce the size to 8 just so the date will fit nicely in there and we don't have too much white space left and I'm then going to go ahead and give this an ID so I'm going to call this date so in our browser now we have a input field which our user is going to click on and they're going to show is going to show a date picker the date picker widget now because we can actually bind the date picker widget to this input field there's no need to create a separate area that will handle this jQuery UI will handle this for us it will actually show the date picker just below the field that we actually click on so let's go back over to our text editor the first thing we're going to do is reduce the overall font size on the page and this is because by default the theming will create a the you know the default font size and we want to create a standard font size on our page in order to show this properly so I'm just going to specify it in body the front size to be 10 pixels ok so now we want to actually append the date picker widget to this field and it will automatically show when we actually click on the input field now when the date picker is shown and we click away from this it will actually remove it so we don't need to handle any of the action ourselves oh as well as that when we actually click on a date the date will automatically be inserted into the field so it's extremely easy to implement so what we need to do is we need to use a selector to select this date here which is the our input field so date and all we need to do is bind on the widget so this is just date picker now by default without specifying any options within our curly brackets as we usually would with widgets and interactions we actually have the functionality now existing within this input field so now when we click on the input field we automatically get this date picker up now we can browse dates and it's fully functional ready to use let's just go ahead and click on site tomorrow which is the 29th of July 2011 when we click on this you'll notice that the date is automatically inserted into the field now if we want to go back and change this we can then go ahead and click back on the field and change this to a different day so it will automatically update the date we choose so now that we've established the functionality and the working of the date picker this is suitable to go into a normal form so for example if you were to take a date in a form field you'd be able to implement the date picker and it would automatically put this text in there when you were when you say go ahead and press a submit button this will be submitted along with the rest of the data in your form so obviously we're not going to go through actually creating a form and submitting anything but I'm going to show you a few options that might help you depending on date formats and available dates so at the moment when we click on it we have this format which is the month the day and then the year now let's just say we wanted to go ahead and change the day to the first element of this day so we wanted it to read the 29th of the 7th 2011 so we can do this by specifying the date format option so date format we can now choose a textual representation of a date that we want to implement or we want the date picker widget to implement for us so at the moment it's set to mm DD YY so let's just go back and see that that looks exactly the same you can see that we've got exactly the same functionality exists in hand in the same date format but we can obviously then just go around and change this so we can change it to the day the month and then the year so now what's going to happen is when we click on say the 29th of July 2011 we now show the date first then the month then the year different countries have different ways of displaying dates by default and more recognizable to the UK it's the date first then the month so depending on sort of like localization you can go ahead and change this to suit your needs now you don't just need to use slashes you can go ahead and implement hyphens into this as well also depending on how you wanted the date to be shown so you can now see that we've got hyphens instead of slashes you could obviously even then go ahead and do just spaces for example and this would work in exactly the same way however usually with databases database tables you would submit a date with slashes it's entirely preference
