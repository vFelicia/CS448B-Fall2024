so what will happen is for each one when we click on here that should know it's not working so might just have error in my code let's take a look min length equals oh sorry I've said this Val I'm gonna say this cell refreshed up just click in here and you see that we get an alert dialog with five so let's go ahead now and just get rid of that and we'll go ahead and refresh and click on this one here and you can see that we've got ten so what we're doing is were successfully selecting the unique minimum length for any field that we sort of click onto and that's going to be useful because we want to add this span afterwards now there's a few things we need to check for the first one is if the minimum length doesn't equal zero the second one is if the minimum length is greater than zero because obviously we can't specify a minimum length of zero and also we want to check that the length of it is not always less than the minimum length so let's go ahead and create our if statement and we'll sort of put why I've said into practice let's bring that down and inside of our condition we need to say if min length doesn't equal zero because we obviously want to add the span afterwards if the min length is you know some has some kind of value and also when the min length is if the min length is greater than zero because we don't our our users to specify a min length of zero and we also want to check that this underscore cell dot value that just takes the contents of the text field and then we're using the original JavaScript length function and we want to make sure that that is less than the minimum length and essentially what this is gonna do is it's not going to show the span if the text is greater if the text is greater than the specified minimum length like I said earlier in the example we don't want to keep pestering our users with a message if their text is over the minimum length so if the all these are true we want to go ahead and they use this underscore cell dot after we're using the after function what this is essentially going to do is add an element straight or directly after this element here and let's just go ahead and refresh that to get our previous code so after what do we want to add we'll do we want to add a span to a couple of span tags so with this when we click on this the span tags will be generated let's just go ahead and put some test content in there for now and press f5 click on that and you see we get tests after each one and obviously they're just being added sort of after each time but we can do something to fix this but for now what we want to do is we want to a sort of displacement relevant data so what I want to do is I want to say append on min length and then I'm gonna say characters required and just to have a space after that span there so now what's going to happen is back to our to our browser when I click on it it says five characters required I'm gonna click on this it says 10 characters required so we've added that functionality and quite easily what I now want to go ahead and do is avoid this problem of the duplication of the span so we want to add another event handler after dot focus and this is blur so inside of here essentially all we really want to do is let's just line that up all we want to do is go ahead and say this underscore cell dot next which is a directory traversing function so the next element after this current element which is obviously our input field so essentially next is our span that we've created up here and then we want to just say remove and that will just remove that element entirely so now when we click it and we navigate away ie we blur that will disappear whether we navigate to sort of you know the next field or whether we tab down to another field or tab back up to a field so we've got that functionality in there quite nicely now all we need to do is go ahead and add the functionality of when our user is typing to remove this message if they have successfully typed more than than specified minimum characters so just before this I'm going to go ahead and use a key up function oh the key up eventhandler and inside here create a function just bring that down so it looks quite untidy but essentially all the we're doing is we are sort of binding on different event handlers we want to go ahead and include an if statement here and this is going to be let's add the condition it's going to be if this underscore cell remember selecting the current thing or the current element value length so the length as we specified up here we use the same thing it'd probably be better to go ahead and put this in a variable somewhere but for now obviously because we're focusing on them we're sort of using the length we need to sort regenerate this data if it's greater than or equal to the minimum length I has the user typed either exactly five characters or exactly ten characters or more characters then we can go ahead and use this sorry this underscore cell next dot remove as we did down here as we blurred away so if the current that length of the value is greater than or equal to the minimum length specified we remove the span as well so now as well as clicking in and removing it as we blur out when we type something in here so some text you can see that it's removed so for example a lit but let's just get rid of that as we were to come in here and say Alex there we go so it removes it and then obviously when we tab down and we click back in because we've deleted this text it says five characters required so that's a sort of a quick example there are probably better ways to do this but it's a quick example of sort of how we can pop together things like this type of selector use a bit of directory traversing and also some quick simple logic to work out the lengths and apply this span afterwards as well so that's just a quick example of a minimum text length checker and how you would do that in jQuery
