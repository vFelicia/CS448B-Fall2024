so the first thing we need to do is check for an a response so we need to say if window docked and we need to say XML HTTP request okay so we're checking for an XML HTTP request if so we do something otherwise we do something else and the rest of our code is going to go down here so if so then we're going to create a new variable called XML HTTP and that's going to equal new XML HTTP request and remember the parentheses at the end okay so now that we've done that we can use this XML HTTP to well in the rest of our code so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna say else and this is going to handle it for different browsers so for some browsers this will be the case and some this will be the case so you can say HTML access at HTML sorry XML HTTP equals new this time we're going to create an active X object and the reference here is micro soft dot XML HTTP now it's very important that you understand that everything I'm writing is case sensitive so when I come to test this at the end of the tutorial when we're finished writing out our code you might find it hasn't worked for myself so I'm gonna have to go back and check so I may have created maybe I mean with variable names that obviously doesn't matter but with things like this it needs to be a capital XML capital H SMO TTP and a capital R min the rest small so it has to be it well it is case sensitive so you need to watch out for that okay so the next thing we need to do is check for a change of state so we're gonna create an if statement and I'm gonna say if oh no I'm not sorry no no I'm not checking this way what I'm saying is XML HTTP dot and we're going to write onreadystatechange so on ready state to change now we're gonna equal this to a function so this might be not this might not be something that you've seen before what equaling this to a function and then what we're doing is we are creating the block for our function so we're saying that onreadystatechange so when the state has changed we're going to perform what's in here we're gonna perform the action in here okay so onreadystatechange equals function so this is a function that we're gonna create or run rather if our state has changed so now we need to do a couple of checks we need to check for the 8 I'm sorry XML HTTP dot ready state is equal to 4 and we also need to check that the XML HTTP status is 200 so we just type status it was 200 sorry W equals there just pull this in as well okay so if it does we're gonna continue so this is just doing a couple of checks to make sure we've got correct codes being sent back and now inside of here we need to do what we need to do so what we essentially need to do is we need to check or sorry we need to insert some HTML data into this div tag and by HTML data this could be a PHP file because when we echo out hello this is essentially HTML data we can also read in we can also read in text files things like that to our div as well but we're just gonna be focusing on PHP like I said so now what we do is we say documents are referencing something on our document and we're saying get element by ID and getting element by ID takes an element from a page by its ID obviously we've set an idea of a div to this div here so in here we can type a div and then we're gonna say dot inner and HTML and capitals and we're gonna equal this to XML HTTP dot response Tech so when we when we send a request here up here we honor on the change of state we are checking the ready state and the status of the page to make sure it's not empty so this 200 here's making sure it's not empty and then we're getting the element a div and we are changing the inner HTML of this div down here and that's going to be the response text so now on here we need to send what we want to put into this we want to send what we want to put into our div essentially so what we do is we say XML HTTP dot open now what we're doing is we're opening with a get so we're opening yet we're getting the data from the page we're not posting anything we just need to get the contents of this page and that is including dot PHP ok so the last parameter is whether we are going to do this a synchronously so we're just gonna write true in here and then underneath we write H oh sorry XML HTTP dot send so what this is essentially doing is it's taking the contents of this file here and we're placing it into this div using this line here and when we send this is going to be picked up here so when everything is working hopefully working as it should be so let's go ahead and test this so what should happen is we click on the submit button we call this load function we check or depending on different browser types the XML HTTP requests and put the valid the valid instance of this into it we check for a state change here which at the ready state and the status so make sure the page doesn't return nothing and we get the element a div and put inside put some HTML inside of this and that's the response text from this and we're taking this value from here so we're we're sending the data essentially straight to this div so let's go ahead and refresh this page and test see if this works so what should happen is when I click Submit we should have the value hello being being output underneath it because what we're essentially doing in include indexed to include the link PHP is we're just echoing out hello so this should just echo out the contents of our PHP page let's try and see if it works okay it's not working there's a surprise so let's go let's go back through our page and just have a look at everything and check that everything's okay
