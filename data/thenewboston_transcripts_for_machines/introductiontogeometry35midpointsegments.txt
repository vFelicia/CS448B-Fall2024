so our topic today is the midpoint of a segment so if a is the midpoint of line segment c c a t or CT a divide C2 into two equal parts and equal also means congruent such that c a is congruent to a T and if it's really a midpoint two because there's two equal parts times the length of one of these segments should give you the length of the entire segment CT so in trapezoid p a r k t is the midpoint of PA a so that means T divides PA into two equal parts and D is the midpoint of our K so that means those are congruent therefore TD this segment right here is the median of the trapezoid so when a line goes from one median of one side of a trapezoid to another median of the other side of the trapezoid or midpoint excuse me it is the median of the trapezoid and when the median of a trapezoid is equal to the sum of the bases divided by two so now that we know that we're going to do a couple examples so we have this and if you remember we're going to call this m the length of M is equal to base 1 + base 2 / 2 so to find the length of X we're going to plug all this information into our formula so m is the median of this trapezoid because it it connects the two medians of the sides so then we can plug it into this formula so 25 is equal to 18 + x which is what we're trying to find / 2 when we solve for x X we have to divide or sorry multiply both sides by two so we get 50 = 18 + x so solve for x we subtract 18 over and you get X is equal to 32 and if you want to plug that back in 32 + 18 / 2 32 + 18 is 50 50 / 2 is 25 that's just another way to double check that your answer is right okay so now we're trying to find the length of X well since X this point right here divides this leg into two equal parts it's the midpoint same thing for this one divides it into two equal parts so it is also the midpoint so that means that X is the median of the trapezoid so X is equal to the sum of the bases over 2 so X is equal to 75 / 2 and we'll just leave that as our our answer well that's all we have for midpoint but um next time we're going to go into graphing so make sure you come watch that
