hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and if you remember from the previous tutorial we made this calculator right here and now what we're going to do is we are going to start adding the code that will make our calculator work so go ahead and open up the code for it and I'll zoom in some here here is all of our subs that handle our buttons being clicked now what we're going to do is we're just going to come down below all of this and we're going to start off by creating the functions that will add subtract multiply and other stuff so we'll create a private function add and then we will buy Val num1 as double and then we will buy Val num2 as double so now what we're going to do is we need to return a value so we will just return num1 plus num2 now go ahead and create that for subtract so we'll start off with private functions subtract and we will buy Val num1 is double and num2 as double now we're going to do is we'll just return num1 num2 now we will create another function for dividing so private function divided and we will add the same arguments for subtract and addition so we'll just copy this and paste it right here and now we're going to do is we're going to return num1 divided by num2 now we'll create this for multiply so private function multiplied and then we're going to have the same arguments as up here and we will just return num1 times num2 now we'll create that again for modulus but instead of using a double for modulus we're going to go ahead and use an integer because if you use a double for modulus you're always going to get the value 0 so we'll type private function modulus and then we'll buy val num1 as integer and num2 as integer and we will just return num1 modulus num2 and we'll do this one more time for pi and so we'll go ahead and create private function pi and then we'll go ahead and add our arguments so by val num1 as integer and we only need one argument for this one let's do double instead and now we will just return number one times math dot pi now what we need to do is set a return type for each of these so for pi we'll just do as double because we can possibly get a double and for modulus we're going to have to return an integer and for the rest we will just return them as doubles okay so now what we'll do is we'll go ahead and come to our button ad click sub and we're going to add the two numbers that are in the text box so what we're going to do is we're going to do the addition so we'll type ad and then for our arguments we're going to go ahead and convert whatever text is in there to a double so we'll go ahead and type C type and then we'll just type text number one dot text so what this is going to do is it's going to convert text num1 dot text to a string and to come into an into a double and to do this we're going to add a comma and type double right there now you don't have to when you're using C type you don't have to use it in an assignment such as create a variable and then this variable equals C type you can do it on the fly inside arguments or wherever you want so we'll just do that one more time for text num2 dot txt and then we'll go ahead and close that now we need something to store what add gives us back so we'll go ahead and declare answer as double and we will set it equal to whatever add gives us back when we call it and give it the first number and the second number and let's see what we got here all right we need to convert this to a double okay so go ahead and try this we get all this code written down make sure you understand it you can even play around a bit with with it yourself to see if you can get it to show up in the third text box and to do other stuff and once you understand everything go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
