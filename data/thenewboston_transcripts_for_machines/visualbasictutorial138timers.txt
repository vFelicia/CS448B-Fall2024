hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about timers so let's go ahead and create a new project we'll go ahead and select windows forms application and we will set the name to timers so let's go ahead and we will make the form a little bit smaller we will add a list box and two buttons so here's our list box we've got button 1 and button 2 so we'll just make this a little bit bigger and now all we need to do is set the text of button 1 to start and then the text of button 2 to stop we'll go ahead and come over here to start and we'll set the name to button start and then for stop we're gonna need button stop okay so let's come over here to our tool box and we will scroll down and let's find the timer so if you drop down your components submenu right here you're gonna go ahead and see the timer right here so just like any of the dialogues you don't need to drag it out on your form because you cannot actually see it so we'll just double click on timer and you can see it has been added to our form so let's go ahead and click on time come over here to the lightning bolt and we'll just double click on tick so what the tick does is every time the timer ticks and you can set the properties of this and set the interval so this is milliseconds so 100 milliseconds is a tenth of a second let's just set our interval to 5000 milliseconds which is five seconds so every time the timer takes let's go ahead and add an to the listbox so we go ahead and do private number as integer and we'll set it equal to zero so whatever it takes we will add it to the list box so list box 1 dot items dot add and we will add number let's go ahead and just add 1 to number so it's gonna add it to the list box and then increment it by 1 now 5 seconds is gonna take a pretty long time so let's just go ahead and shrink this down to 1 second so we've got 1 second 1000 milliseconds now we'll double click on the button start click and whenever they click start we want to go ahead and start the timer so we'll September 1 dot start so it's gonna start ticking the timer and whenever they click stop let's go ahead and stop the timer so timer 1 dot stop so let's go ahead and run this and if we click start we wait a second and 0 shows up 1 2 3 and this is happening at intervals of 1 second now if we did all of this at once and added them all at the same time it would be almost instantaneous but since we are pausing well not really pausing we're using a timer and every time that ticks were adding so let's go ahead and change the interval and we can see the change in time so let's change it to 5 thousand milliseconds we'll go ahead and click start you can see we wait five seconds and zero shows up if we wait another five seconds the one's gonna show up so go ahead and practice with timers they are very useful you put the code that you want to run in during each tick and then you can have certain actions start and stop your timer so go ahead and practice with those and once you got those down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
