hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at exiting a for loop early now let's go ahead and get started we'll create a new project select console application and we'll just name it exit for loop and then click OK now I'll just wait for it to load our project and we'll zoom in a bit here ok so now let's go ahead and create our for loop first let's type console dot write line and we'll just label this one as normal for loop now let's go ahead and create a simple for loop so for number one equals one to 30 let's go ahead and print out num1 so console dot write line num1 so this is a very fairly simple for loop now let's just add a space here so there will be an empty line and now let's tell them that this is a for loop that is exited when num1 is equal to a certain value so console dot write line for loop that exits before it's finished so now let's create another for loop so for num1 equals 1 to 30 let's go ahead and do console dot write line num1 okay so now what we're going to do is we are going to test the value of num1 to see if it's equal to something and if it is then we're going to go ahead and exit the for loop so we're going to do this by using a simple if statement so if num1 equals 23 then what are we going to do we're just going to use the keyword exit which is exits a procedure or block and transfers execution immediately to the statement following the procedure call or block definition so basically what that means is that if num1 is equal to 23 it's going to hit this exit statement and it's going to skip all the way down to this line right here where i'm typing these commenting because that is after the if statement and this after the for loop so now if we go ahead and run this you can see it closes there let's go ahead and do a console dot read line okay so let's go ahead and scroll up to the top and you can see it says normal for loop and it says one two three four five and so on all the way down until it gets to the value thirty and now it says for loop that exits before it's finished it starts at the value 1 and then it goes all the way down to the value 23 and then it exits the for loop now we can also do this if we step the value so for number 1 equals 1 to 30 and if we step by 4 then you can see that is this if statement it's never going to run so if we run this you can see it's all the way to 29 and it doesn't stop at 24 so what we can do is we can do if num 1 just a load here okay so if num1 is greater than 23 then exit the for loop so you can see that it goes 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 and then it exits a four loop because num 1 is greater than 23 so go ahead and make a couple for loops that exit under a certain condition and then once you've got that down and you'll remember it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial so thanks for watching
