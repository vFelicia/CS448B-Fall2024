hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org back with another PHP video tutorial now in this tutorial I'm going to be briefly introducing you to what objectoriented programming is and also why it's more useful to use in our case we're going to be programming um in objectoriented programming in PHP so objectoriented programming also um noted as oop you probably SE more commonly written as oop is a different way to program um within many languages not just PHP we've got um PHP in languages such as c um Java and just a name a couple so why do we use Orient objectoriented programming now usually in a PHP script you would use a procedural way of coding so you would write your code Maybe include a couple of functions uh from top to bottom now objectoriented programming takes use of objects in your program so you will have um different objects um inside of your program which will allow you to access them in different ways so if you think about objectoriented programming if you think of your whole application or your your code if you like as a whole object you have smaller objects inside that you can deal with for example you may have a bank account we may have a class but we'll go into classes later so uh if you don't know what a class is just follow along the example you may have a class called bank account and inside this bank account um this will be relative to say a specific user you might have a balance um and some more information now what happens if you want to automatically update this balance by calling um this object and telling it what to do now inside of this object you will have um you will have or this class if you like you will have different methods so the methods will update things so we could have a method called update balance or more realistically deposit funds um and then we could have say withdraw funds um so the deposit funds will take in a parameter let's say 10 and we'll add 10 to our balance so this is a bit of a bad way of representing it but when you get into your object orientated Pro object oriented programming um and you start to write the code you'll start to understand how actually easy it is once you've got around the basics so why do we learn um objectoriented programming well for the reasons I've already described your code is a lot better organized um objectoriented program has been part of PHP since PHP 5 was released I'm not sure when that was I think it was a good good sort of five odd years ago um and not a lot of people do actually use it they still use the same uh procedural code um which I do I mean I do a lot of the time as well um however it's a good practice to get into learn objectoriented PHP and start to get into this practice because you're going to re the many uh benefits from this as you can so like I said object oriented programming is a better way to program in general um you have um just part of the structure of it you like I said you have classes you'll then have properties of each class so this could be say uh like I said with the bank account example earlier the property could be the balance and then you have method so the methods are things that do things so methods are essentially functions properties are essentially uh variables that we would store data in however we have lots of other aspects of of object orientated program of object oriented programming sorry that we can look at in order to work out how it's useful for example we have things like the extend keyword uh you can see that my text editor has highlighted it blue extends creates a new class but adapts and create and takes um properties and methods from another class so we can have a main top level class but then we can have classes underneath it that extend data from that class so we can take things like the bank account example and we can extend another class with different information but still using the balance from there so you'll find that lots of complex um code uh written properly will use object oriented programming I've just shown you a few examples however um we're going to crack on in the next examples of creating the code rather than talking about it so I'm not going to spend too much time talking about it but we're going to get straight in and do everything by example so you can understand where and when oop is useful
