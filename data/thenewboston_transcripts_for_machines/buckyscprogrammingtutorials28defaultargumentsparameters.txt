what's going on guys welcome to your 28th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial as you can see I'm going to talk to you guys about something called default arguments so of course we're going to be building a function that takes a couple arguments and a default argument is basically exactly what it sounds like you know how we can have a function to like calculate the area of something and then the user would need to enter arguments like length and another value for width well they can either enter the values explicitly or we can have a default value already in that function so let me go ahead and we'll build a really basic function here just to demonstrate this point so let's go ahead and calculate the volume of uh just something a box or something and so we have three arguments or three parameters int length int width and int height so we can go ahead and make this function right now and well let's actually go ahead and make this function right now go ahead and copy this and under main make sure you're not in main when you make this go ahead and paste it and to calculate the volume in case you don't know it's just length time width time height so now we can go ahead and call this function C out volume and the user can enter three values like four five and five so this should go go ahead and print out 100 because 4 * 5 is 20 20 * 5 is 100 so the volume of this box is 100 so all right we have you know just a regular function here with three values or three parameters that it takes and the user goes ahead and passes in those values and it calculates it perfectly but in order to add default arguments or default parameters here's what you do in your function prototype right here here instead of just having you know the variable type and a variable you can go ahead and set these equal to something automatically like one uh we'll just set equal to one right now so if a box is 1 by one by one we can go ahead and assume that well it's basically this if the user doesn't enter any values explicitly then it's going to use those default values of one one and one so whenever we call this function without any values check it out it gives us the value of one because a box 1X one by one has a volume of one now let's go ahead and say that the user enters a number like five okay so the user enters a number like five and it gives us the value of five but you're saying all right so does that function use that five for length width or height well when a user enters one value and you have a function that has three default values the the computer is automatically going to assume that you meant five equals the first parameter or five for length so if you go ahead and run this again we get five that's because it's five by 1 by one so if you go ahead and enter something like five and six the user automatically going to or excuse me the computer is going to assume that you meant five for length six for width and by default height was one so the only thing you're really overwriting is length and width so it's basically the rule is this you can have a function that has default values and by default it's going to use those values unless the user overwrites it with values of its own whenever the user does overwrite it with values of its own it's going to pass them in in order of which it received them so if it pass in one number it's going to replace the default value for that number if you pass in in two number it's going to replace the second value for that number number right there and if you just pass it in two numbers it's going to of course keep that same default value of one for the last one so you get 30 for your value so of course I just want to point out that you can you know go ahead and add three values if you want but you know what's the point of having default values if you're just going to have three parameters you're going to pass in anyways so basically that is how you have a function that uses default arguments in other words default parameters and one other thing that people typically mess up you only have to put the default value in your function prototype right here whenever you create the function and the function body itself down here you don't put the values down here because you already saying all right if I don't explicitly pass in any values I want to use these as defaults so you don't need to re type it right here so people get this wrong a lot so don't forget to uh you know just remember that simple rule so now you understand the basics of having default values in your function why they are useful and how you can pass in a different number of functions like six or six and five or six and five and seven and it would all work fine basically whatever you pass in it replaces the rest with the default values so that's all I have for you guys for this tutorial hopefully you understand if you don't just go ahead and ask me one of the questions on my Forum the new boston.com forum and I will be more than happy to answer it for you guys so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
