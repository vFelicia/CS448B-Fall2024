hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dork and welcome to another video tutorial created for the new boston now in this video we're going to be continuing with this server environmental information but we're now going to be producing the hosts now this is the hosts of the website is we're going to return is going to be the HTTP colon forward slash forward slash and it's going to be the domain name after that so let's get straight ahead and echo out this dollar underscore server and the information we need to supply it in here is HTTP underscore host now what this is going to do for me is going to is going to output localhost because I'm just running on a local server so let's refresh this and you can see that we've got localhost here now in this video I'm not going to program as much so I'm going to talk about this we're just going to talk about why this might be useful now let's just say we have a template system I might have a variable up here which is called host okay I've got a variable up here called host and this might be contained within say a configuration file so let's get rid of this and we'll create a new file called and we'll call this comp in PHP so what we can do is from our index top here it's pre far we can include or rather require that would probably be better comp in PHP now presuming these are our settings what we've automatically now done is created this variable that's going to automatically update the host that we're running this from so let's say at the moment I've got it on localhost and I'm developing it all my pictures for example for a template system are going to come from localhost forward slash something so it could be local at the moment the URL running under is localhost forward slash series forward slash server so what I could do is I could say host equals this however template or images equals dollar underscore sir no it would be host because we've already defined that host and in a pend forwardslash images for example so we could say that this is our images folder and what we've automatically now done is as long as the directory structures kept the same within our site which it should be if we're developing it the way we want it were automatically updating the host so what I could then do is inside my file I could say echo and I could create an image here source equals that and I could say write what's the location of this so we can append on images so we've created this images variable if you like so we can append on images and then we can put the file name afterwards so I could say another trailing slash on there and we could set images and then header dot gif for example so this is automatically journalists now if we transfer this from local house which I'm running at the moment on a local server let's say PHP academy' org our configuration files automatically going to update the images folder to PHP academy' org forward slash images so now our page is going to automatically update each directory so we don't have to go through and change them so this is how this the server environmental information with a HTTP host in here helps us with sort of daytoday easy running of a website and when you're thinking about creating a website with lots of images and you put lots of different pages you should always think about creating a config file with this kind of information in there there are many other ways to do this and many different sort of techniques and methods however as long as you're using something that ensures that each of your folders or wherever you're referencing too often is consistent you can end up with a website or a project that's easily transferable especially if you are creating something that then had to be say released to the public you'd want something that people can just copy straight over to the server and start using more or less straightaway
