welcome to addition with decimals decimals have fractions of a whole number so this is 75 and six t you can see here how we had the ones place the 10's place and so on and so forth well now we have the tth spell tths with the th don't get that confused with tens and we have the hundreds place spell hundreds versus the hundreds just know the difference between the two so we do the same exact thing as we do with the whole numbers we start on the very last n and even though there's not a zero here just pretend that there's a zero so 0 and 8 is 8 6 and 0 is six bring down the decimal point the decimal point is very important that you bring it down exactly where it is 5 and 5 is 10 put the zero there as a placeholder carry over the 1 78 9 and there's our product so over here we do the same exact thing 4 and 2 is six bring down the decimal point 8 and 2 is 10 placement holder carry over the one 9 and 1 is 10 + 6 is 16 carry of the one bring down the six and 1 and 1 is two it's a different color and over here don't let this confuse you just put an imaginary decimal point right there and imaginary zero as a placeholder we have 0o and one is one bring down the decimal point we have two and 1 is three four and four is 8 6 and 5 is 11 put the one over there bring down the one right there and 10 same deal over here don't let this confuse you put an imaginary little decimal point right there and two zeros in actuality there can be infinite amount of zeros so you can keep on going from so on and so on so 0 and 9 is n 0 and two is two bring down the decimal point 0 and five is 5 7 and 3 is 10 and this example 2 and six is 8 0 and two is two bring down the decimal point 6 and 7 is 13 carry over the one 9 and 1 is 10 + 8 is 18 carry over the one bring down the eight 4 and 2 is 6 + 1 is 7 and bring down the one over here if you get good at placement holders you just know that there's two placements behind the decimal points so you start with a seven and go two over it's 9 7 and 9 is 16 you want to start way over here way to the right carry over the one you can put it wherever you want on top of there or on top of there 9 and 1 is 10 + 6 is 16 car of the one and you have to make sure it's two sixes make sure you put the decimal point 6 and 2 is 8 + 1 is 9 make sure you have enough room there 8 and 8 is 16 bring over the one and one and one is two so that's 260 26966 so over here we have two decimal points so pretend that there's an imaginary zero right there let's change colors so five and zero is five eight and zero is eight decimal point 6 and three is 10 nine and 2 and 1 is three all right over here we have two decimal places over so 7 and 9 is 16 carry the one 8 and 1 is 9 8 and 3 is 10 11 I'm sorry s that care over the one we have 7 and 3 is 10 + 1 is 11 and then 4 and 1 is 5 + 1 is 6 and that's all we have for addition with decimals
