hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on the paint program now all credit for this program goes to the writers of beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 um the authors are theoren Willis and Brian Newsome I took this program from their book and I'm teaching you guys um how to make it and walking you through the steps and explaining everything so now what we're going to do is we're going to allow the user to change the size the size and the color of their pen now this part isn't in the book I uh made this part myself because what's in the book takes a really long time to program and we're already on tutorial 170 something and we still have a lot of stuff to cover so let's come over here to our solution Explorer we'll right click on paint YouTube and let's add a Windows Form so we'll select Windows forms and we will call it option form we'll go ahead and click add okay so now we have our option form so let's go ahead and we'll come over here to our properties of the option form and we need to change the form border style so we'll come up here to form border style and let's make it a fixed tool window so they won't be able to resize it and they can only close out of it so let's make it a little bit smaller here and let's add a toolbox and we will have a combo box and let's go ahead and label this combo box so we'll add a label and we'll call it brush size so set the text to to brush size and let's just set the name to label size and we'll set the name of combo box one to combo box size now let's go ahead and come over here to the toolbox We'll add a button here we'll set the name to button color and we'll set the text to change color so so let's find the text property here so change color and we'll go ahead and Shrink this down some so now what we need to do is come over to our toolbox and let's add a Color Picker dialogue so we need to find our dialogues and we'll double click on color dialogue so we'll just call it color dialog um brush so it's going to be the color of our brush so let's go ahead and we'll come over here to the uh combo box size and whenever whenever they change the index what do we want to do well let's add a select case statement so select case and we will do combo box size do selected index for case Zero what do we want to do well we need to come over here to our option form and we need to add some stuff to our uh collection under the items property so we'll have small medium and large okay so let me zoom in here a little bit uh so you can see it better now the only problem is we can't access the color of paint canvas let's find it here we cannot access the color um variable because we don't have an object of it in here so let's go ahead we'll come over here to our paint YouTube and we need to find the main method now there isn't actually a main method that we can access so what we need to do is we need to come into paint YouTube to right click it and select the properties now here you can see we have our application properties and we have a startup form right here so we want our startup form to be option form so now if we come back into option form let's go ahead and access the load event so we'll scroll up and we will find load where is it
