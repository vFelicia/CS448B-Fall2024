hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to look at the jQuery slide down function and this is effect that this is an effect that will slide down a particular element and it works uh probably best with divs so what we're going to do is we're going to be creating a div uh which slides down at the top of the very top of the page now the first thing we need to do is style this div in order to make it look um make it look you know the right size so we can fade it down or slide it down so the first thing I'm going to do is the inclusion of a stylesheet so I'm going to say linkr equals stylesheet um the type is going to be text SL CSS and the source we're going to locate it in CSS SL style.css so let's go ahead and create this uh Style CSS file now um let's just save this file out uh into a directory uh CSS style. CSS okay so we can start to style this div um I'm going to include it first of all here just so we have reference to it so the div is there and the div ID is going to be topor message it's just going to be a message that slides down at the top of the screen uh and I'm going to put some content in here as well so we see you're not logged in do you want to sign up and we can create this as a link just as an example so now that we've got this in place you'll see that it looks something like this uh we've got we see you're not logged in do you want to sign up uh let's go ahead and style the page and this div as well so the first thing we want to do is change the body and we want to say m margin top n pixels and margin left n pixels in fact no that's not important okay so now for the top message we want to apply styling uh we want to say the width so the width I'm going to pick at 700 pixels I'm going to choose a background color for this as black and I'm going to choose padding as 10 PX uh let's go for 20 PX um we're also going to want to change the font size to make it look a bit bigger so 20 pixels let's just take a look at how it's looking and that's not worked because this is not Source it's HRA okay let's go back to our page uh you can see it looks like this at the moment we obviously need to change uh a few things like the font color so we'll just say color # FFF that's white and we we also need to Center this as well so margin left Auto and margin right Auto so now that we've got the effect that we need except for the fact that we need to text align Center we can start to actually create something that's going to slide this downwards uh soon as we enter the page now obviously this isn't functional within an actual website it would get annoying um however just the effect itself can be useful uh perhaps it could perhaps you could include it in a specific function uh on specific pages and based on the fact if the user is logged in or not however for now this is just an example okay so the first thing that we need to do um I've included obviously jquery.js that's located in the JS folder as well as effects. JS which is also located in the JS folder now this is extremely simple we have our uh div just up here now we need to um initially have this hidden so there's one thing we need to change in our style. CSS and that is display none so now when we revisit our page in the browser you can see it is not um active it's still there as an element but it isn't uh shown yet so using jQuery we can slide this down so we're going to do this when the document has loaded so we use hash uh sorry dollar sign document. ready and inside of here we create a function and we give it a block so we have curly parentheses here as well as the F function um parentheses just here so I'm going to bring this just down a couple of lines so we can work within okay so now what we want to do it's a single line to actually create this effect so it's extremely easy to do and effective we want to reference top message and then use the uh slid down function so dollar and then inside of here we want to say topor message with a hash to reference the ID then we say dot slide oh sorry if I spell it correctly slide down and then in Brackets we can give some optional parameters in a moment however just the slide down function on its own will work so let's go back to our page and hit refresh you can see that that's slid down this div and quite nicely as well and quite smoothly Okay so we've got a a variety of parameters that we can give here we can give the speed um we can give the effect type how the effect actually slides and we can also give a callback function as well so uh I'm going to just go ahead and uh demonstrate the speed and if you go over to the jQuery documentation uh there's a variety of other options as well as the Callback function that you can Implement okay so I'm just going to say slow you'll see that now the speed has decreased very slightly if I was to go ahead and choose say 3,000 that equals to 3 seconds so that slides down a lot slower uh obviously that wouldn't uh be appropriate if we choose something like 500 or 300 uh that's 3 of a second so that slides down pretty quickly so obviously this example doesn't include um for example a button to actually you know make the um div go back up again however in the next part of the tutorial we're going to be looking at the slide up and we'll Implement a button that will actually uh slide this back up again
