so today we're going to talk about angles formed by intersecting lines there's three types of angles we're going to talk about today first are the corresponding angles and there are angles that occur in the same place so the angle on this line that corresponds which like we're going to talk about angle one first so the angle on this line that corresponds to this angle is angle five because they happen in the same place on each line the angle that corresponds to angle 2 is angle 6 so angle 1 and angle 5 are a pair angle 2 and angle 6 are a pair angle 3 and angle 7 are a pair and angle for an angle 8 or a pair so the alternate interior angles occur on the inside of these two lines and when you draw them they draw a Z so if I want you this is an alternate interior angle with this angle see how these two angles because we want the angle that's on the inside of these two and on the inside of these two so when I rare you look for alternate interior angles you look frizzy so angle 3 and angle 6 are alternate interior angles and angle 4 and angle 5 are alternate interior angles because they're alternate because ones on this side and ones on this side and their interior because they're on the interior of these two lines so alternate exterior angles so if we start with this one because it's on the outside there's no other line right if there were a line right here it wouldn't be an exterior angle so we start with this one and we want alternate so we want it on the other side and it needs to be down here because it needs to be on the other side of these two so these two are alternate exterior angles and 2 and 7 or alternate exterior angles so we have these lines and we're gonna find named two pairs of alternate interior angles so these are the ones that make the Z so we're gonna just any two you want so first we're going to start with this line right here we're gonna go down and across so that means that this angle and this angle are alternate now alternate interior angles and we're going to do the same thing on this side 8 and 11 but if you look angles 6 an angle 9 are also alternate interior angles and number angle 7 and angle 12 but they only asked us for two so named four pairs of corresponding angles so corresponding angles are just angles that happen in the same place so if I start on this top left angle this angle corresponds to this angle on this line so angle 1 and angle 9 this angle now this this doesn't mean that they're congruent these are just the angles that correspond to one another so angle 2 and angle 10 angle 3 and angle 11 angle 4 and angle 12 now one more kind of angle to do which is the alternate exterior angles so we want one angle that's on this side of what's on this side of this line we want an exterior angle so we're going to start with one we want an angle that's on this side and that's an alternate angle so angle 1 and angle 14 we do the same thing we get angle three in eleven you these ones don't really form a special shape but this is just so you can see which angles match up so the reason we went over these today is so that in the next lesson we can talk about corresponding angle is formed by parallel lines
