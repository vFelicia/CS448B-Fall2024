hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about a major logical error that was in the previous tutorial now if you remember for the enemy it's going to access current enemy attacks at the index of current enemy attack none now you can see for each one the enemies we have different attack array so we got zombie attacks we've got villain attacks and other stuff so what we need to do is make all of these just attacks now you can see that we're gonna get an error because we already have attacks in our enemy class now we can easily fix this so since each of our villains only has three attacks we can create public read only attacks with three indexes as a string and now for each one of those indexes we're gonna have to add an attack so attacks at index of zero it's gonna be equal to eat brains I don't know how I didn't notice this you know in the last tutorial I guess I didn't really look at the log very closely when we were testing it so they all said this one two claw and we'll do attacks 2 is going to equal throw up okay so now that we have the indexes in our attacks what we need to do is make that for each one of the classes I'll pause and come back once that's finished okay so now that that has finished you can see that I've got the I've added the items to the array in zombies dragon and villain VB so now we can come into form 1 DB and let's see here we've got attacks and then attack num and then attack damage and you can see that we made attack damage in the same way that we did attacks now let's come back here to enemy and we'll just take this out to make sure that nothing bad happens so we got public override herbal sub attack and then you use your health so we can do is we can just get rid of all of this because we have overridden this sub in each and every single one of our other classes that inherit from enemy this doesn't have to have anything in it it's just there that so that we can use it so let's say for example we have current enemy of type enemy we wouldn't be able to call current enemy attack if it wasn't declared an enemy and because it's over rideable and we've overridden it in every single one of the classes all we have to do is just leave an empty sub in here so it's there for us to use but it's already overwritten so let's go ahead and run this and hopefully we won't get any errors and let's see here got event logger go ahead and shrink it down a little bit so we can attack it says anchor throw you can see that zombie has used claw punch claw anchor throw eat brains for 10 damage anchor throw eat brains for another 10 damage punch claw for 5 claw for 5 and could throw for 15 another claw once again we got eat brains kick and you can see that Popeye has won so let's go ahead and close out of this and we will close out of that right there let's just go ahead and make sure that everything works fine so you see that we didn't get any throwups here so let's see what went wrong we need to make this with a max value of 293 so that it will generate 0 1 or 2 now let's just make sure we've done that in each one of these classes surprise I've never found that error but we'll go into zombie zombies fixed and we need to fix villain here so apparently the whole time um it hasn't been ever going to case 2 so now that we've got all that sorted it out let's go into form 1 now I know I might get some comments from people not liking that I'm getting errors and then I have to fix them but other people especially people from my channel that have washed they said I like it when I find errors and teach you guys ways to fix them and how you can incorporate that in your own programs okay so when the enemy attacks if Popeye is lost let's go ahead and add that to the log so new log dot add event and we just want to say Popeye has lost and just to make this more noticeable we'll go ahead and do new log dot add event and then we'll just separate this from the rest of the stuff that is in this log so copy this one more time you can see that it's gonna say Popeyes lost and it's gonna separate it from the rest so we'll do that once again for button attack and let's go ahead add that right there and then new log dot add event and then we'll add Popeye has one and then we'll add this right here so going so let's go ahead and run this you see that here is our form 1 and our event lager so let's go ahead and spawn a zombie so go ahead and click attack says he use anchor throw and then the zombie threw up on me for a to damage you can attack again anchor through it one more time you can see that's logging everything that's happening let's wait for Popeye to win here see it says Popeye has won and then down here it adds an event to our log that says Popeye has won so go ahead and close out of that let's go ahead and fix these logic errors that we have then once you've done that and put all that code in if you have any comments leave them in the comment section and if not go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
