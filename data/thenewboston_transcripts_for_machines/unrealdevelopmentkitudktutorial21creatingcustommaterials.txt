all right guys welcome to your 21st udk tutorial and now that we know what collections are let's go ahead and learn about packages so in this tutorial what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to show you guys how to create your own custom packages and how to add things inside them like materials and stuff so let's go ahead and actually create one right now and before I get started I want to say this when people typically make packages they typically like to group similar objects in packages for example they want a packages a package of sounds or a package of materials or static meshes what we're going to be doing is since we already know what materials are let's go ahead and make a package for materials so in order to make a new package can you guess what one yep create new asset and this is going to allow you to create a new package so the package name I'm just going to name mine my package sounds kind of kind of dumb so um bies awesome package that kind of sounds sexual but I kind of like it at the same time so grouping a group is pretty much it's like a way of organizing all your stuff so go ahead and just type materials it's not that important uh your name just go ahead and this is actually going to be the name of your material itself so I'm just going to name on like crappy material 01 and for your factory you need to select what you're going to be storing storing in your package and of course if I can find it material right here so this crappy material one is a name for a material so go ahead and click okay and now when you do first you get this material editor that pops up and we're going to go ahead and X out of that for now because we're not ready for that yet the material editor is where you make your material but like I said we're not ready for that yet so by default whenever we hit okay the material editor pops up and behind that it took us to our package so as you can see in new packages right here we got a package called Buy's awesome package and our group is materials and inside our group we have our material which is called crappy material and by the way this little asteris next to Bucky's awesome package means that you created a package with a material in it but you didn't save it yet so make sure you go ahead and save it and you do that by right clicking it and press save and now just go ahead and it verifies where you want to save it and now you can see the a asterisk disappear so that's all the asterisk means make sure you save it or else when you excited the udk you're not going to have it so that is how you create a new package and add a new material to it but say you already have a package created so I already created this package I want to add a new material in this package anytime I already have a package created and I want to add an additional material just go ahead and right click anywhere in here and click new material there I go right there there and I could add a new material but for now I'm just going to stick with our one material don't want to jump ahead of ourselves so in order to open that material editor what we can do is we could have not xed out of it but I want to x out of it because I want to show you guys how to access it anytime you want to work with a material in the material editor go ahead and select your material in the content browser and go ahead and just double click it and whenever you double click it this thing called the material editor is going to pop up now the material editor is where we create our own custom materials pretty cool huh so let me give you guys a quick overview of the material editor in the upcoming tutorials I'm going to be teaching you guys how to add textures and how to add you know make your materials different colors and shiny and stuff like that but for now I'll just give you guys a quick overview because you know I have some extra time I might as well so the first thing I want to talk about is this toolbar white right up here here now just like when I was covering the uh udk in general a lot of these tools were not ready I'm basically going to be covering them as we go along So eventually we're going to know what all these tools mean but some of this stuff like toggle realtime material viewport we're not even close to learning with that as yet so instead of overwhelming you guys with like toggle expression realtime previews I'm just going to say these are tools that we're going to be covering later on now this black pan right here this is called the preview pane or the preview window I guess whatever you want to call it and whenever we create a material we can preview it in 3D on a 3D model for example if we made a material of wood we can go ahead and draw a sphere and it would show us what the material wood would look like on a sphere so it's pretty much just a preview Pane and that's why it says preview up there pretty cool huh now this big gray panel with this window floating around is called the materials expression window or panel I'm just gonna call them panels so without getting too in depth for now expressions are pretty much formulas that give they pretty much give you a value and they allow you to change the appearance of your material now again I'm going to be getting into this later but here's your material right here and here are all the different aspects or attributes of it the diffuse is the general color um the emissive is like the glow the specular is how shiny it is so what we're going to be doing is we're going to be bringing a formula like this and this formula is going to like output the number seven I'm just want to say that for a quick example and now when we give the value of seven to your diffuse it's going to like turn it blue or something so this pretty much outputs something and changes one of the attributes and again that was a pretty bad example I know I didn't really I'm just giving you guys a real quick example so anyways that's what the material expressions pain does if you don't understand it then you probably shouldn't because that was a pretty terrible example but over here is the Expressions list this is pretty much all the formulas that you can have and by the way I want to mention this the reason you need formulas instead of just constant numbers is say this you have a material that you want to apply to a spaceship well we can apply the color red to it or the color blue to it and it would stay red or blue forever but whenever you're playing a game you don't always want to apply a constant color so that's why you need formulas a formula can change its value so you're saying all right why would I want a material that changes its value well say you were modeling a spaceship or something and you had green lights on it but anytime that spaceship got shot the lights you might want to make turn red or something or maybe you had a gun and whenever you fired it the material would change to like a glowing fire material so that's why it has all these different properties and these formulas can change the properties as we go along so you see what I'm saying you see why we don't just apply a constant value to these attributes right here we actually need a formula to change those values if need be so with that being said the last thing I want to talk to you guys about is this expression list down here now this I mean excuse me this was the expression list right over here this down here is the properties panel now the properties panel whenever you don't have anything selected like here's a formula right here whenever I'm just going to deselect everything it gives you all your properties of your material that you're working on and since we don't even have a material we made yet it's not going to show us a whole lot of stuff but whenever we do we can adjust some of these settings it's pretty much allow you to adjust the settings of your material however once you have one of these things called an expression selected it allows you to edit the properties of that expression so depending on what you have selected if you have nothing selected it's just your general um material properties if you have an expression selected it gives you the properties of that expression and again I know you guys don't know what expressions or Properties or any of these attributes mean yet but trust me I just wanted to give you guys a quick overview of this material editor and by the end of these next like three tutorials you guys are going to be a pro at this so thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
