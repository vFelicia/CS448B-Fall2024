now we move to the major classes of organic molecules found within a cell the first major class is called carbohydrates carbohydrates are sugars and starches they have the general formula C h2o in just me in as a multiplier and is between three and six so you can have c3h6 oh three c4h8 oh four so on and so forth carbohydrates are a very very important energy source for your body they are used in short term energy use the biggest source of energy in your body comes from a molecule called glucose which is a sugar shown here but this is the major source of energy for your body this is what all your cells use to create energy there are a couple of different types of sugars you have a monosaccharide which is a single sugar glucose is an example of a monosaccharide you have disaccharides which are two individual monosaccharides combined for example table sugar is called sucrose which consists of at one molecule of glucose and one molecule of fructose polysaccharides are large molecules composed of a bunch of different monosaccharide units starch is a polysaccharide of glucose molecules and starches contain hundreds and hundreds of molecules of glucose all bound together the next class are called lipids these are fats and fat like substances if you've ever watched Austin Powers you will understand what I drew there but his name is well I don't think I'm allowed to say what his name is on this video anyways fats are lipids are involved in longterm energy storage they are also involved in structure and messengers such as hormones lipids are generally insoluble in water when a molecule is installed insoluble in water it is called hydrophobic but anyways this is an example of a fatty acid as you can see here you have a carboxyl group right here and then a long chain of carbons and hydrogen's this is called palmitic acid another example of a lipid would be cholesterol which is a steroid you can see here cero is usually have this structure a couple of rings and some methyl groups a hydroxyl group right here and most steroids act as hormones cholesterol is found in your cellular membranes and an actual lipid molecule is an alcohol and a fatty acid most lipids are tri glycerols glycerol is this molecule right here it's got three alcohols on it and attached to those three alcohols will be three fatty acid chains chains excuse me such as palmitic acid next we have proteins which are involved in control and structure most proteins are going to be enzymes or biological catalysts proteins are composed of what are called amino acids you can see here you have your amino group right here and then a carboxyl carboxylic acid group right here the R is what it's called a side chain all amino acids have the same backbone they are differentiated by their side chain amino acids come together to form what are called polypeptides and amino acids are joined what are called a peptide bond what is called a peptide bond whenever they come together they are joined at the nterminus and the cterminus they come together and a water is lost and then they form this peptide bond whenever I explain advanced biochemistry if I ever get that far then you'll learn a lot more about that the last class of organic compounds are nucleic acid these are composed of nucleotides which consists of a sugar a nitrogenous base and a fate the sugar is going to be either ribose or deoxyribose which are five carbon sugars I'll talk about the differences between those whenever I go into genetics later but the four excuse me five bases are adenine thymine cytosine guanine and uracil nucleic acids are responsible for passing heredity information from one generation to another they're involved in protein synthesis and energy transport energy transfer excuse me DNA is deoxyribonucleic acid this is the main molecule responsible for container let responsible for passing heredity information on RNA is involved in protein synthesis and energy transfer molecules you have ATP which is adenosine triphosphate contains the molecule adenine and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide which also contains the molecule adenine and both of these contain the sugar ribose but that's all I have for biochemistry and organic chemistry right now
