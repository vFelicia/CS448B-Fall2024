hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our paint program now if you remember from the previous tutorial or before that um the paint program that we've been using in the previous tutorials or that we've been learning how to make is almost directly from beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by theoren Willis and Brian Newsome um I changed maybe a couple little things in there I'm not very noticeable but I just want to give them full credit um I'm just teaching you guys uh the logic behind this and I'm taking you step by step so you can understand it better so now that we got that aside if you remember from the previous tutorial whenever we started painting the the whole screen would flash and it would repaint each time so you can see here that if I start drawing you can see that the whole thing is flashing and it just looks really bad so there's an easy way we can fix this so we need to come over to paint canvas. VB and you can see here we have me. invalidate so what we can do um instead of invalidating the entire control which will flash it each time what we can do is um we can invalidate that one rectangle angle so under me. invalidate we can pass a uh an argument to it so you can see we've got invalidate children as B here um invalidate rectangle is system. drawing. rectangle now that's what we're going to be using so we got RC as a rectangle so we're only going to be invalidating an area the size of a rectangle well how do we know what size of rectangle we want to use well what we can do is we can use object graphics item. rectangle now rectangle is a public variable of type rectangle um that is in object Graphics item so we go to Graphics items. VB we've got our rectangle as our rectangle and um we made a new rectangle and just set some sizes for it um just to initialize the rectangle so we'll come back to pain g. VB so it's going to invalidate an area this size of um this rectangle right here so we'll go ahead and run this you can see here we've got paint. VB go ahead and make this bigger you can see that if I start drawing here maybe you'll be able to see this a little bit but you can see that it's only invalidating the area right where my mouse is you can see it's kind of flashing right there and there's a white um in front of the dots now we can draw and the fashion you move the more spread out the dots are going to be uh but that doesn't really matter you can just draw a little bit slower now let's go ahead and close out of this and we'll just play with some of the options before we move on to the next tutorials so we can change the size so all we have to do is just change one variable in here and we'll change it to large so we got graphic sizes. large and you can see that when we start drawing we draw with large circles and you can see the invalidation right here a lot better it's invalidating an area the size of the rectangle that we have now it doesn't look the best but it's better than the whole screen flashing now we can even come into our graphic sizes and we can set large equal to let's say 50 so this is going to double the size of our brush come into paint. VB and you can see here that we're drawing with these big huge circles and once again the invalidation is even more um visible in this demonstration so go ahead um add the uh invalidating a small area that we used here to just instead of flashing the entire control and repainting it it's just going to invalidate um the area the size of the rectangle that we have in object Graphics item and once you put that code in um even play around with your program sum go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
