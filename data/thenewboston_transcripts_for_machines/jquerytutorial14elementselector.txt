hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston in this tutorial we're going to again look at selectors but this time we're going to look at the element selectors now obviously an element in an HTML document would look something like this this is a paragraph element we could also have something like a div we could also have something like a span as well as things like images like that and things like a tags as well so there's a variety of different elements inside HTML documents and we can use jQuery to select specific elements of our page so for example if we had a paragraph here and we had a paragraph here but then down here we had a span we're going to go ahead and create some functionality in our selectors j/s file which we've included on our page to add some text to this this paragraph here and this paragraph here but not this span here and then we're going to change these around a bit to see the effect that we get from that so we've got a paragraph here and a paragraph here we can simply reference we want to do something to a paragraph in particular and this will work and carry out the same operation for every paragraph on the page so inside selectors is we want to say P we've now actually selected the paragraph element now this would then apply it to this paragraph here and it would also apply to this paragraph here however we have a span here so it would not apply to that so inside selectors we can say dot text and inside here we can place some text so for example hello now when we go over to our browser you'll notice that we have two hellos just here now if I was to go ahead and change this here to a paragraph as well this is now in the range that we've specified all the selected set that we've specified and therefore when we refresh the page the text will also be inserted into that last paragraph as well now what we can also do is when we set when we have elements and I'm just going to give the example of paragraph elements in here I'm sure with this example you can work out things like spans and divs as well as other elements however what we can actually do is because we have three paragraphs we can choose the first the last or any other particular paragraph so inside selectors jas instead of just having P we can then use a colon to specify which paragraph we want to apply this text to so I'm going to type in first now obviously the first paragraph on the page is this one here and therefore the only text that should be applied or the only paragraph that should have this text in is the first paragraph let's go ahead and refresh the page now you can see that despite us having three paragraphs on the page and selecting the P we've selected the first as well and therefore it's only applied this to the first paragraph now similarly we can also use last so if I type last in there and refresh obviously we can't see any difference at the moment let's just go ahead and put some text in here so you can see that that hello has applied to the last element that we've specified so obviously you can also do this with other elements for example if these were div elements you could then use div and then last or div and then first it's entirely obviously for the purpose you're using it would be entirely up to you but for now we're using paragraphs and we've successfully referenced all the paragraphs and then we've chosen the first and then the last now you might also want to say 'pete first and go ahead and change this back to just P you could then go ahead and select ID equals let's just say para let's just put some text in there as well when we refresh you can see that they've all changed however this is because we've specified a P despite the fact that we've put an ID on there in the last video we looked at referencing by an ID it's still a paragraph so you need to be careful when you're using this on your page because if you wanted to for example just change this text in here you've given it an ID here you've referenced all paragraphs now you could solve this by for example copying and pasting this line down and just referencing that paragraph on its own when you refresh let's just go ahead and change this something different hello and when we refresh we get that change however this is an inefficient way to do things so at best you need to think about how you can actually name things and where you need to reference things and which elements need to be referenced so hopefully that will make sense we've got three paragraphs here go ahead and try it with divs spans images anything and try and combine your other jQuery knowledge with referencing to see what you can do
