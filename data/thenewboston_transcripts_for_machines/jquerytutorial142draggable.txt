now what's going to happen is we can still drag it around however when we get to the edges you can see that it doesn't actually go beyond the edges because we've contained it to the actual document and the same with the other side as well now the difference to this is that we could actually inside here let's say specify a style so style equals text CSS so we could create the we could create a say the body to have let's just say margin left 50 pixels now you can see that even though our document actually starts with a margin here we can drag it beyond these as well so we can drag it in the entire document itself and this is extremely similar let's just get rid of that this is extremely similar to the window value as well however this will constrain to the window itself and not just the document so you can see that we can still drag it slightly beyond the the document here but it's constrained to the actual window itself so very similar properties here but we can actually do something with these you know you might have different uses for these now we're going to go on now and look at parent now at the moment the parent of this this element is the actual window itself although we can still drag down the page here now we want to constrain it perhaps to a particular element now let's go ahead and surround this span with a div and it's indent that and let's apply a style to this div let's go ahead and make the width 200 pixels and the height 200 pixels as well and it's just such a background color of that so now that we've got a specific window here if we were to say supply document here we can obviously drag this outside of this surrounding divs so we can drag it anywhere on the page we want or anyone anywhere on the document we want however if we were to choose the parent value here you'll see that automatically now this is contained within this parent and we can't actually drag it outside of this parent here so I'm trying to drag outside of this div however is not letting me so this is probably a more practical example of the containment option where you can specify a particular element to only be within the boundaries of a parent element okay so let's just get rid of this div here we also have an option to specify containment with regards to supplying the actual coordinates of the area so this time in square brackets it's important to know we can choose at the X that we can choose X 1 X Y X 2 and Y 2 so we can specify a starting and ending area so let's just for example say 0 0 and end this at 200 we've now created what would be a rectangle or a square I guess if you like although we're not actually containing this inside a div with specifying coordinates ourselves that we don't want this drag me to move out of so now you can see I can't drag it out of this particular area so you can sort of see the shape that it's formed and we can specify particular a particular area inside of our document that we don't want the element to move out of so that's the containment option we're now going to move on to look at the cursor option now this is probably less practical but a bit more interesting in the sense that you might want to create you know some kind of visual visual effects for your user we can specify the cursor that is displayed when we actually drag a particular element so by default we use the cursor like you can see at the moment it's got the highlighting cursor that we'd usually highlight and some text with we can change this so at the moment it's as it is default for example I could choose a crosshair and this would create a cross icon you can see it's changed to a cross when I drag or for example you could choose pointer which is probably slightly more appropriate and this creates a pointer hand icon as we drag so now we know when we're dragging an object obviously but now we've created an icon to suit the overall concept of actually dragging so we're dragging this around so I think the pointer I think the pointer icon works well with dragging elements okay so as well as that we're going to move on to some other options however we're going to comma separate these so we can supply more than one option so now at the moment as the element is being dragged we're changing to this pointer cursor but we also want to take a look at other elements and include these as well so the next one we're going to take a look at is the opacity and obviously the opacity is the you know display of this from zero to or from zero to one or from one to a hundred usually just basically it's visibility so for example if I was to choose a zero point six oh four point six so 0.60 this now has an opacity of 60% so this is only whilst dragging so you can see that the colors are as normal when we're not dragging however when we're dragging you'll notice that the pointer has changed as well as the opacity so this is another useful effect for when dragging because we now you know we sort of see the element as it's being dragged and it's also important to know that if we're dragging over things we can see behind these as well so if we were to have other elements in our page and we were dragging over them we now have the opacity set to 60% or 0.6 Oh in this case okay so the next option we're going to look for and again we're going to comment separate this we're going to look at the let's say grid option now the grid option takes two values and these are the the points of the grid if you like so I'm going to choose 20 and 20 now what this is going to do is it's going to allow this element to be snapped to a particular grid at the moment we can freely move it around anywhere on our page and we have no grid to snap to however what this grid option is going to do is create is going to create an invisible 20 by 20 grid which is going to allow us when we refresh the page to actually snap this to a particular grid
