all right guys so for the past couple videos we've been talking about IP addresses and subnets and right now we basically know that whenever we have a network any device on our Network it needs to have its own IP address and that's just essentially what it boils down to is a unique identification number so we can identify and manage every device all right so that's easy enough but here's the thing how do these numbers get assigned I mean I learned about subnets and I know that we're only allowed a specific range of IP addresses but I mean how do we determine which IP address gets assigned to which computer well we actually have a couple options of how we can do that one of course is just to do it manually so if we wanted to whenever we're starting a network we can actually sit down every device this laptop and say okay whatever IP addresses I'm allowed you can have this one like 1.2.3.4 all right go to the next one all right you can have 1.2. 3.5 all right well if I ever you know sell this computer then I have to say Okay um so free that IP address up and I can you know use it somewhere else well all that is going to take a long time and of course whenever we just you know want to get on the internet at our house most people you know don't want to have to learn how to assign IP addresses to each device so instead what usually happens is all this is taken care of through a method called DH CP you guys have to excuse my handwriting because I haven't used this tablet in I don't know a few weeks and these things are actually really weird uh once you start like using them after you haven't used them in a while but uh nonetheless all right so DHCP this stands for dynamic host configuration protocol now long name but it's actually really easy all this protocol does is whenever you have a new device on your network or a device leaves it assigns it or what's the opposite of assign design no un assigns it um an IP address so basically all of this work that we would have to do manually assigning an IP address manually is taken care of automatically using DHCP now just as a side note you can actually have an entire server devoted to just this but you really don't need that unless you know you have a huge humongous Network um you know maybe if you had like a college or something that you would have a server just for DHCP most server operating systems have DHCP built in so if you want to just you know enable it then you can do that however just for a simple home network DHCP is built into most routers and usually users don't even have to worry about it because you know you plug in your router and it just works but I'm going to be showing you guys in this example of you know how a home network commun Ates using DHCP and how it automatically gets an IP address so let me what color am I going to use how this cool little red orange one all right so here are my computers already in my house these already have IP addresses already hooked up however I just got this computer Best Buy so I bring it home I boot it up turn it on and right now my computer knows nothing about this network right here it's a brand new computer doesn't know where the heck it is it doesn't have any IP address assigned to it so the very first thing that it's going to do is it's going to I'll write this down so it's going to send out a broadcast packet and it's called a DHCP discover message now you know how I talked to you guys about the special broadcast address that's assigned whenever you have you know your range of IP addresses that you're allowed to use what this address essentially does is it takes message and it sends it out to everyone it possibly can now it only needs to talk to the router but it doesn't know that yet it you know pretty much knows nothing about the network so this discover message it's pretty much the equivalent of your laptop shout shouting out hey someone I'm here I need an IP address someone please help me so that's what it is and for the source it uses 0.0.0.0 so your default IP address before you have an actual one assign is just 000000 Z that means whenever anyone gets this message and send it back just broadcast it out shout it out to anyone so that's the return address and the next thing that happens let me pick a new color here all right so whenever your router hears this what it does is it sends back a DHCP offer so it says okay I heard that someone said they need an IP address address what I'm going to do is this I am going to look through all of the IP addresses that I have and if I have one that's available then I'm going to say okay here's an IP address that you can use let me know if you want it so that's what the offer messag is basically the router or whatever DHCP system you have is going to find an available IP address and it's going to send it back and remember your laptop it doesn't have a valid IP address so this is going to be sent over broadcast 2 so right now you know these computers are pretty much just shouting at each other back and forth that's the you know digital equivalent of it but that's what's going on so whenever the hardest part of this tutorial is actually just picking the colors I want to use all right getting kind of sidetracked here so your laptop receives an IP address let's say 1. 2.3.8 this one's available your laptop's going to look at it in it's going to send back after it reviews it something called a DHCP request message so it looks at the available IP and it's pretty much saying yeah that looks good can I have it please now the last part of this equation and I'm kind of running out of space here but once the router hears that's okay the laptop looked at the IP it said it was cool it said you know it wanted to use it it's going to send back and act so a c k so the router is going to say okay um sure it's all yours and also here's some other information that you can use too and it sends it not only um the IP but also things like the subnet mask and how long the IP can actually be uh leased for and you know the router's IP and just a bunch of other information that it needs to be configured on the network so the laptops receives it and configures it to connect to the network and boom you're good but essentially all of this happens behind the scenes and that's why whenever you just plug in your WiFi router you're usually good to go so again anytime you're at home and you connect a device to get on the internet what's going to happen is it's first going to say hey anyone who's listening I need an IP address someone help me out and your router is going to go hey I got this available one let me know if you want it and you're laptop's going to go yeah that looks cool I'll take that one and then your WiFi router goes okay here's all the information that you need to connect and it also takes care of some other things like whenever a device disconnects from the network then it automatically frees up the IP so someone else can use it but there you go now you guys know the basics of DHCP incredibly thrilling I know but uh yeah hopefully you guys enjoyed see you guys next time
