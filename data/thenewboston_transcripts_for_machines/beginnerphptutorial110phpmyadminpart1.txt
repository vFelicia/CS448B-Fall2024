hello this is Alex from PHP academy' with another video for the new Boston now we've already looked at databases and why we should use a database but now we need to find an easy way to manage our database before we start to connect to our database and start to sort of add and retrieve data now what you can see at the moment is something called PHP myadmin and it's a freely available piece of software if you like it does come with an X amp install so if you so if we go over to localhost you can see we're presented with the xampp sort of control panel if you like so down here we've got tools and you can see PHP myadmin so if you just click on that if you don't have xampp if you're running something else then you can download it so just Google for PHP myadmin copy it over and you just put your database settings in there so your server which would be localhost and then everything will be managed for you so the first thing we need to think about is um the server we're connecting to so the server name that we're connecting to let's just write it in here and get rid of the PHP tags the server at the moment is localhost and this is the case for most for most MySQL host names for example if I had paid hosting and I was uploading to a shared hosting account for example usually I could specify localhost and it will connect straight to that however if I was connecting to another database on another server I'd obviously have to specify the server name itself ok so now let's look at this tab here called privileges and we'll be given a list here of of users so at the moment you can see we've got root twice with a host 127 or not or 1 and localhost and password no now because I'm running on my computer and I'm not currently connected to the Internet then there's no need for me to set a password obviously it would be better if I did set a password however for now I've not set a password so in the examples that you see me using I'm not going to be I'm not going to be using a password my password is just going to be specified as blank so we've now established that the username here is root which can be seen here and you can also add a new user so if you wanted to add something there was a bit more friendly so you could say Alex for example and then you can specify the host but that's best to use local host and then you can specify password ok you can even generate a secure password so we've done that and now obviously I've already spoken about the password password which is blank so I'm just converting null here so we've established the server the username in the password this is all we need to use to connect to our database now we're not going to be looking at that now but that's just how you're going to find that information out now let's look at let's go back to the home page here now let's look at these on the side here now what you can see here are databases that I've created over the years or months if you like just things that I've worked on in general so you can see that we've got a database names we've got card for example here we've got a quotes for example here videos for example here these are databases these are our database names and to create a new database we use this field here so I can create a new database called let's just say a a database so I've chosen to create a new database called a database we put an underscore in there and I'm going to click create now you'll see it appear here we've opened the database now if we go back to our home page you can see that it exists up here and you'll notice something different about this and all the other all the other database is listed that it doesn't have a bracket with a number in now this bracket with an brain is how many tables exist on your database so if we for example click on videos ok you can see that we've got one table inside here therefore we've got a one in brackets the same of all the others so if we click on a database at the moment we've got absolutely no tables inside of it we're getting a message here saying no tables found in database now it's fair enough having a database on its own but we need to have day tables to store data we can't directly store data inside of a database it has to contain tables and the last example I showed you we had a user's table and then we had an uploads table so I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to create a table called users now number of fields is the number of columns that we have listed so let's go back here remember before we had user name password first name etc so what we need to do is we need to before we create a table think about how many columns or fields if you like that we might need so for example if I was creating a user login database the minimum we need really is an ID because we need to assign a unique ID to each user a username field and a password field that's all we really need to create a user login system so I'm going to come back to my database and I'm going to choose number of field 3 now I can click go and what this is going to do is it's going to transfer me to this area here where I can create a data create each field now it looks like a lot of information but you don't have to specify all these boxes you don't have to choose a dropdown for all these boxes but there are some important parts that you will need to specify so for the field this is the field name so the first one I'm going to choose is ID the next one I'm going to choose is username and the last one is password so now I've specified my field names now I need to do is specify the type of data that I want to store
