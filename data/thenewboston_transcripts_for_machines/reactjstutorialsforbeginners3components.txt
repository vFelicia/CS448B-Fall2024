all righty houses welcome back and in this video I am going to be teaching you guys about react components now a component is one of the core building blocks of react basically every application you make using react is going to be made up of these things called components now components are actually incredibly simple to understand components are just part of your website that's it that's all they are so let me go ahead and show you guys any website so if this was made using a react this video player it would be a component this progress bar it would be a component this button would be a component now even complex things like this a little text editor area at the bottom this entire thing may be a component now that brings me to another point and that's you can actually put components together to make a bigger component so say that all of these buttons were individual components well once we put them in this little area on top and added a form below it would make up a bigger component so just like you can put a bunch of parts of a car together to make an entire car that's basically what component is part of your website so that's why I say in react your entire application is going to be made up of these components just different parts of your webpage so it sounds pretty cool how do we make a simple component well the first thing you do is go ahead and make a variable now just to show you guys that you can actually name these components anything you want I'm just going to go ahead and name mine bacon now set this equal to react great class so this is the method that you use to actually create a component so what component is essentially just the react class now since this is going to return an object go ahead and throw curly braces in there and inside this is where we actually make our component now as you guys already guess since a component is just essentially part of your website all it is is pretty much HTML so we can just have a component that's just a heading we can have a component that's an entire buddy list but for right now essentially what your component needs to do is it needs to turn some HTML so how do we do this we do this with a function called render so render is a function and all this is going to do is it's going to return some HTML now whatever HTML you return that's essentially what this component is so let me go ahead and return something really simple and I'll just return another let me return like a heading 3 it always autocompletes at the wrong time and I'll say this is a simple and I can never spell component Co MPO and ent I always spell component in int or something alright so this component is complete all this is is essentially just a heading 3 now again eventually we can actually add attributes to it or properties and States and have some more functions in here but for right now whenever we use the component bacon it essentially just displays a heading 3 so then once we have our component made let me tighten this up a bit so it's a little bit easier to see we actually have to say instead of this which was a HTML we displayed before we actually want to display our component now remember I said that render basically takes a bit of HTML and displays it in your target but what is the HTML for this component right here well the HTML tag that you use is actually just the variable name so if you go bacon that's all you write so whenever you see this tag bacon is basically allowing you to create custom HTML tags so we're going to throw bacon right here which is this component and we're going to display it in this target right here which was basically our only div on the website so there you go and actually let me bump this up so you guys can see for some reason I need to refresh this twice alright so again that's the basics of components basically your entire application is going to be made up of these individual parts called components now at the heart of a component it essentially just returns a chunk of HTML so in this example we just made a component that was composed of I don't want to say composed made of a heading to tag and then whenever we use that component it was essentially just equal to this so we displayed bacon in this target boom roasted there you go
