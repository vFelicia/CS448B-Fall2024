So today we're going to focus on the midpoint formula which to find the midpoint of a segment with coordinates X1 y1 X2 Y2 we're going to use these two equations and as our final result we're going to have an ordered pair whose coordinates equal these these two equations and this is going to be our midpoint so we're going to do some examples and then we're going to graph a midpoint problem so first for the X we have 1 + 3 over 2 comma 8 + 10 over 2 so we add the x coordinates and the Y coordinates to get the y coordinate and the x coordinate so 1 plus + 3 is 4 / 2 is 2 8 + 10 is 18 / 2 is 9 so that is what our midpoint equals so now we have a negative right here but if and and right here too as well but if you remember we add the two numbers together an addition is commutative which means that you can add in whatever order and you'll still get the same answer so we have 1 + 3 / 2 for our x coordinate and 5 + 3 / 2 for our ycoordinate so 1 + 3 is pos2 / 2 and then when we subtract when we add a negative we're really subtracting a positive so 5 pos3 is two over two and if you reduce those you get one and one so we have one more example here and the same thing where you're going to add your x's and add your y's so 6 + 2 is 8 over 2 is 4 4 + 1 is five and we're just going to leave it like that so given the segment's midpoint is 32 so we're going to graph this so we're going to go left three up positive2 is right there and actually let me get a different color so it's shows up on our graph better so three up to and this is the midpoint remember and then our end point is 3 1 so over to the right three down one is about right there this is n.1 so R we're trying to find the other end point of this segment and if you think about it the other end point has to be up here somewhere because M has to be between and 0.1 M point2 and point1 for it to be a midpoint and the distance here needs to be congruent to the distance there so we're going to have to work backwards a little bit so we're going to use the same formula we just learned except since we already know what the midpoint is we're going to set the x coordinate or the X midpoint equal to we're going to call it X1 this point up here X1 plus this end point right here ided by two and we're going to do the same for the Y and set 2 equal to y1 1 / 2 so if you multiply both sides by two and subtract three over you'll get X1 = to 9 and multiply two over add one over you get Y is equal to five so if we were to plot this we'd have to go we'd have to make this a little bit longer we're going to call this 10 soga 9's about here so we're going to go over9 and up five so right about there and this is our entire segment so that's all for midpoint point but in the next lesson we're going to talk about the slope of a line so make sure you come back and watch that video too
