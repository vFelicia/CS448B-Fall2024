hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the continue statement now what this does is let's say you're making a for Loop and it's 4 num1 equals 1 to 30 now let's say if num one is equal to 23 then you don't want it to run that uh iteration of the four Loop so it will print out let's say we're doing console. rightline num one and you don't want 23 to be printed out you would use if num one equals 23 then continue 4 so basically what that does is it skips that iteration of the for Loop and moves on to the next one so let's go ahead and make some examples of this so we'll type console. right line normal for Loop and we'll make a for Loop let's just do 15 we'll do console dot right line num one so basically what this is going to do is it's just going to write out 1 through 15 on our console now let's add a space here and let's do continue statement okay so now let's make our for Loop that has the continue statement in it so we'll just start off by using the four keyword we'll create our num one variable and we'll go to 15 now num one can only be accessed inside of this for Loop and nowhere else because we didn't actually declare it so let's go ahead and type a simple if statement so if num one is equal to 5 then what do we want to do we'll just type continue for so what this is going to do is it's going to skip the iteration of num one if num one is equal to 5 it's going to skip whatever code comes after this now here's here's a trick that I wanted to teach you guys in this tutorial if you have an if statement with only one line of line of code in between then and end if you can just go ahead and take out end if and do this instead so if num 1 = 5 then continue 4 and by doing this you don't have to have the end if statement and your code is a lot neater and easier to read so now that we have our if statement done we'll just do console. right line num one so if we go ahead and run this we're going to get it in our normal for Loop it says 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 you can see that all the numbers are there but if we come down here and look at our continue statement you can see it looks like all the numbers are there but we are missing a five in in between four and six now let's do this for a couple other values so let's go ahead and and create a multiline if statement so if num 1 equals 5 then continue 4 let's just add an or operator so if num 1 equal 5 or num one is equal to 8 or num one is equal to let's say 12 so we didn't really have to make that multiline we'll just go ahead and put this right after that okay so now what it's going to do is it's going to skip the number five 8 and 12 so if we run this we're going to get 1 2 3 4 6 7 it's going to skip eight you can see it skip five and it also skipped 12 so go ahead and practice some continue for statement you can come up with different ways to use it within your program and uh once you know how to do that and you're not going to forget it then go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
