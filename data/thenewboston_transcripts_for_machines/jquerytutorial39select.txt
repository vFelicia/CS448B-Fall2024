hi this is Alex from PHP academy' no org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to look at the select jQuery event handler and we're going to be creating a text area which allows us to type and select text once we've selected text jQuery is going to catch this event and it's going to alert something back to us inside of a div okay so the first thing we're going to do is create the text area then we're going to create our external javascript file that's going to handle this event okay so I'm creating a text with a type of an input field with the type of text and I need to give this an ID so we can reference it in jQuery I'm just going to call this sum underscore text I'm then going to create a span with an ID as well and this is going to have the value of sum underscore feedback now once we type some text into the text area and then highlight it like so some text some feedback is going to produce some text for us so we're using a span to feedback some text okay so let's go ahead and create our external javascript file I'm just going to create a new document in my text editor and inside my J's folder I'm going to call this select Jas so we need to include select Jas into our page so I can simply go ahead and copy this here and paste it here and then just change this to select Jas now that we've included select Jas we can start to write our code beforehand let's just preview this in our browser you can see that we just have a symbol text field we can type something in here and then we can go ahead and select something and once we have finished our selection will have the span just give us some text out here letting us know that we've selected the text now first of all the reason you might incorporate this method into a text area for an example for an example if you are allowing your user to type some text and then they want you want to be notified or notify the user or some backend functionality when they've selected text for example changing font color if you're using if you're creating some kind of text editor there's a variety of options for this select event handler and I'll leave that up to you to implement into your own website okay so in select is we need to reference our text area which is hash text or some text we then need to append on the event handler which is select and inside these parentheses we need to create a function and that function is obviously going to have a block which we will start to execute code here so once we've actually selected something inside of some text which is our text field here then we will be able to create you know some something here that lets the user know that they've selected text so obviously this is just an example okay so we're going to reference some feedback which is our span and we're going to apply some HTML to this span using the HTML jQuery function so inside of here we can just type something has been selected so let's return to our browser and refresh the page and let's go ahead and type something in here when we start to select something and then release you can see that something has been selected so we've created the event handler and successfully relayed some information to the user however I did speak about some uses for this functionality if you'd like to create some kind of functionality to actually grab the text that has been current currently selected you can do this so head over to Google and Google around for this and you'll be able to find a function that let you return the text that's currently selected in the text box however I'm not going to cover this in tutorial because this has just been how to actually use the event handler to check if something has been selected
