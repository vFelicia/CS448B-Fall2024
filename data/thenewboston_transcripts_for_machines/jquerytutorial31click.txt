hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be looking at the jQuery click event now as discussed in previous tutorials we are keeping the in inline JavaScript we're basically eradicating and we're not trying to keep it as minimal as possible we're just getting rid of it so in this tutorial we're going to look at the click event which is an extremely well used or highly used event due to the fact that when we click on things we want them to hide show update etc now in this tutorial we're going to look at a button that's going to be able to be clicked we're going to use jQuery to listen for the events so we're going to create an event handler and then we're going to show a particular bit of information such as a paragraph so let's go ahead and first of all create our markup which is going to allow us to see what we need to do so the first thing we're going to create is a button and this button is going to be type button and the value of this is going to be hide the ID of this we're going to give it an ID of hide message now remember that ID uniquely references this button so this element on the page so we can use jQuery to reference when we want the hide message button to be clicked or we're going to look out for when it is clicked the next thing we're going to do is create a paragraph let me just bring this down and this is going to be this is a message so essentially what we're doing is we're clicking this button to show this div or to hide this div sorry let's go back and click refresh our page in our browser you can see that we've got the paragraph here this is a message and also the hide button as well so when we click that that should hide okay so now what we want to do is ensure we have jQuery included on our page at the at the bottom of our body bottom of our body area we now want to create a separate file that's going to handle the clicking of this button so we can call it anything we like we're not really talking about file structure or naming conventions but I'm just going to go ahead and create a file inside the jas folder and I'm just going to call this click J s so click J s is going to handle the event and the function that we carry out when this button is clicked so let's go ahead and do that now so the first thing we want to do is reference the element so we use a dollar sign and then in brackets we use a textual representation of the element name and this starts with a hash and remember the name of the button was hide underscore message so we just go ahead and write hide underscore message now we need the event handler and this is dot click and then we end it with two parenthesis and a line terminator semicolon now dot click handles this event so when hide message is complete everything inside this put in this in in these parentheses will be taken into account now what we need is a function that lets us carry out an event once this click handler has has realized that the button has been clicked so we need to create a function inside of this here so we create a function as we usually would with parentheses we obviously don't take any arguments because we're just going to be carrying out a block of code essentially we need a starting block and an ending block using curly brackets but what I'm going to do is I'm going to bring these down a couple of lines and in so now we have this workspace in here to write the code we want to happen when the hide message button is clicked so essentially this could be written all on one line like this and but you can now understand why we bring it down and start to work in here so now what we want to do is actually hide the button so or hide the paragraph so again reference the paragraph so hache message remember we cooled the paragraph only we didn't so we need to give that an ID so the idea of message so we've given the i/o this paragraph an ID of message then we reference it with here hash message and then we just say dots hide and then we use brackets you'll notice the color difference between click and hide hide is a function well I mean click is an event handler and hide is actually a function so ok now that we've done that when the hide message is clicked we're going to actually hide this message now there's one thing we need to do beforehand and that's include this click j/s file onto our page so we type in here script type is equal to text JavaScript so the type attribute is JavaScript and we also need to give that a source as well as ending the paragraph just ending the script tag just there that's j/s forward slash click J s so now that this now that this is all set up we have no inline code at all but we have an event handler to handle the clicking of this button let's go ahead and test it in our browser I'm just going to go ahead and refresh the page when I click hide you'll see that the message is hidden now a bit later on we're going to be looking more at the hide function in jQuery and things that we can pass to it different parameters we can pass to it however for now we have just created out a first event handler which is click now there are many more event handlers that you'll see coming up in the rest of this series but for now this is probably the most basic and most used event handler which is a clicking on a specific element now you'll also notice that we don't just have to apply this to buttons we could of course get rid of this input here and use a link so let's go ahead and type hide and the hrf is nothing we just put hash in here so we don't reload the current page but we don't not do anything and the ID of this is going to be hide message now this code will work with the change we've just made we're referencing hide message and we're saying when it's clicked hi the message so let's go and look at the difference that we've just made there we've got a link instead of a button when we click it we get exactly the same effect and you'll see this hash here that I was talking about earlier that will crop up and you've probably seen it on a lot of other websites but that's not really anything to worry about so we've now created a link that hides a message and I highly encourage you to go ahead and create some other elements on a page how you'd also you know hide an element it can be used with most HTML elements
