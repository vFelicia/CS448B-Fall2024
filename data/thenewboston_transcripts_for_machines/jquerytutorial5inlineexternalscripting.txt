hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in the last video we looked at testing jQuery once we've included it into our page using our script tag and we looked at an example that included a paragraph with an onclick event attribute now the difference between inline and external coding is extremely important the main uh difference is that we well the main goal is to keep our JavaScript as separate from our HTML as possible so how do we solve something like not using this here but instead just having a paragraph on its own now the one thing to look for is um well in the example that I used in the uh few tutorials back I included another uh Javascript file into my page that allowed me to use this functionality so the difference between inline and external is that we don't actually have any code inside of our tags but we can still use the same functionality so let's go ahead and create a new file um I'm going to leave this blank for now but inside of our G folder I'm going to call this hide. JS now inside of hide. JS I'm going to include some functionality uh the same as we did in the last example that actually allows us to hide this paragraph when we click on it but we're not going to include any code on the paragraph instead what we're going to do is reference the paragraph um as opposed to include this code in here so the first thing we need to do is give an ID to this paragraph and this will allow us to uniquely identify the paragraph so I'm just going to call this paragraph now now that we have an ID we can use paragraph inside hide. JS to actually reference this but beforehand we need to actually include this hide. JS file under here which will allow us to use the functionality within it so I'm going to say script type is equal to and I'm just going to end that tag the type is text/javascript exactly the same and the source is Js slide. Js so now we included this hide. JS file we can start to write the code within it and check for when the user has actually clicked on this paragraph So let's go ahead to hide. JS what we're going to do is we're going to use the same notation so a dollar sign inside we're going to reference remember before we used this to reference it inside we're going to reference it with the hash and that's paragraph we're then going to say um dot click and in Brackets and then inside of here we need to create a function now don't worry too much if you are actually uh or you're unsure of the syntax or unsure of the method method that I'm using this is just an example to demonstrate the difference between inline and external uh code so we're going to be looking at this click uh event handler a bit later on um so if you're unsure uh as of yet then continue watching and you'll understand it a bit later on in the series so inside of Click we need to create a function and we need to write our um block out here which we're just going to pull down so inside of here is our code that happens when we actually click this paragraph So when the user clicks this paragraph it'll be identified by paragraph it will be picked up in hide. JS here so when the user clicks and we carry out this function and this function will be hash sorry hash paragraph. hide okay so now when the user clicks on this paragraph it will hide it this is essentially what is happening here so let's go back to our page and refresh you'll see that we've got the paragraph here however we don't have any inline JavaScript at all we just use this high hide .js to look for a click and that hide. JS file is included under here so let's go ahead and click the paragraph and see what happens well now the paragraph has been hidden and we know it's been hidden because we included the same functionality in hide. JS as we essentially or or previously did inside parag inside the paragraph tag so now you can see that using jQuery is extremely easy to stop inline writing of code and in instead use an external file that checks for event handlers now as I said if you don't quite understand the code that's not a problem uh the main point of this tutorial was to demonstrate the difference between inline and external and we've now actually eliminated the need for in uh inline coding so throughout the tutorial series we're not going to be using inline coding everything's going to be done from external files and the reason for this is that it's best practice to keep everything external and keep JavaScript away from HTML
