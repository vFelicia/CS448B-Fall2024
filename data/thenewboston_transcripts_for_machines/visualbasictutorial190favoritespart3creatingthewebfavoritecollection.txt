hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on the favorites viewer now before we get started I just wanted to say um like I do in every single tutorial um where I don't where I use a program that isn't made by me um all the credit goes to the authors of beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 um the authors are theoren Willis and Brian Newsome they created this great program that I'm using um to teach you guys um some objectoriented programming techniques and I'm going to explain it to you um in a lot of detail and you don't have to have the book yourself so if you don't know what you see right here and you don't know what that is then you may want to move back to one of the previous tutorials so we'll go ahead and let's create a 4 each Loop that will process each line in our file so we'll start off by typing for each and we're going to do we're going to use string line in string lines so basically what we're saying is for each of the lines in our array of lines so we've got our file and we split it up into separate lines for each line in there what do we want to do well we want to search for our URL so we can use a simple if statement so if String Line do starts with now this is pretty selfexplanatory determines whether the beginning of the string instance match matches the specified string so if it starts with URL equals then what do we want to do we want to set URL equal to string line do substring at index of four so and if this happens we just want to exit our for Loop because we have found what we're looking for and we don't need to go through the rest of the for Loop so what this does is it checks to see if the line starts with URL or URL equals and after URL equals it's going to contain uh the URL of the website that's our favorite so what we do is we set URL which is a public variable um it's a string we're going to set that equal to the line at substring and we start at index 4 so we have index 0 1 2 3 and start at index 4 so it's going to set our URL to the URL that we want and it's going to leave out URL equals right here because we're starting at index 4 now let's go ahead and we need to read the uh the file or the um data that's in the file I don't know how I forgot this in the last tutorial but we're going to set string data equal to my do computer computer. fil system. readall text and we're reading all the text from the file name which has been passed to this method so let's just enclose all of this in a tri triy block so we're going to try and if for some reason we get an error in here let's go ahead and catch it now we're going to catch an error um of type IO exception so if we get an error reading or writing or something um then it's going to catch that so whenever we catch that we'll just show it so messagebox messagebox Dosh show ex. message okay so now that we've created our um web favorites class um remember to put this line in right here that I forgot from the previous tutorial which basically reads the lines reads all the text of the file into string data so now what we need to do is we need to continue uh by creating a another class so we'll come over here to favorites viewer YouTube we'll right click and we will add another class now let me go ahead and Shrink this down now this class is going to be called web favorite collection now this is going to hold objects um for each of our favorites that um has that have been read from our computer so what we need to do is type inherits collection base now it says provides the abstract Base Class for a strongly typed collection so what this means is that it's a collection and we can store a bunch of objects in it now um we're going to be storing objects of type web favorite now you said it you saw it said um strongly typed collection and what it means by that is that you can only use a certain type of data in it and it's whatever you specify so whenever we inherit from collection base we need to add some stuff to the class so we need to add a method called add so this is going to take an argument and we'll call it favorite as web favorite so it's going to be a type web favorite which is this class that we've created right here so whenever they add we want to add the item to the collection so we'll just type list. add favorite now you may be you may be wondering where we got list from well list is what this class uses to store um all of its items or its objects because it inherits from collection based we can use list so the list in this class is going to store all of our objects now we need to create a remove method so Public Sub remove and this is going to take an argument of an index so we want to remove something at a certain index so we'll type if index is greater than or equal to zero and index is less than count you can see that counts gets the number of elements contained in the collection based instance so if it's less than the uh number of items in our list then we can go ahead and remove it so the um list starts at index zero and then it has a certain count so if the index isn't outside of these bounds then we can go ahead and type list. remove and this is going to take an argument so we'll just type index so now what we need to do is we need to come down below in sub and we'll type public readon property so we're making a readon property now here's something I just uh realized the writers of this book have messed up they took an index for the argument of this but when they removed they removed they used remove and used an index and it will never find that because when it tries to remove it'll look at that number and be like well there's nothing in here um with that value so we're not remove it so we need to use list. remove at index so we'll create a readon property called item and it's going to take an argument byal index as integer so whenever they access the item property they're going to have to put an index in as the integer and it's going to give them back um the item at that index and we want to make it of type web favorite because this collection holds uh a whole bunch of web favorite objects so what we want to do is we want to give them back an uh an item from our colle ction or our list um based on what its index is so we want to return and we want to use C type because we're going to be converting um object types so we'll type list. item at index and we want to convert that to type web favorite so what does is it's going to return a value and it's going to take the value at in our list which is our collection that we have for this class at the item at the index of the index that they gave us so let's say we've got a web favorite at index of five and it's equal to um to YouTube so it's going to get the item at index to five and it's going to be YouTube and it's going to convert that to type web favorite now because it's already a web favorite we will have no problems with converting it to web favorite and it'll work just fine so go ahead put this code in if you haven't um if you're confused with anything leave it in the comments maybe somebody will be able to help you um I might even be able to monitor the comments and see if people need help so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
