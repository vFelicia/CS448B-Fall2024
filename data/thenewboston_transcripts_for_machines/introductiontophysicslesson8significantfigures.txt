what is going on guys it's buy and welcome to your eth physics tutorial and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about something called significant figures now a significant figure is basically a way of saying how precise should your answers be whenever you're working with scientific notation so you know before when we were working scientific notation we got numbers like 1.53 2 1 7 and maybe those numbers went on and on forever well if you're saying all right so so how do I know how many decimal places I'm supposed to write in my answer well there actually is an answer to that question and it isn't just basically however many you feel like there's actually a rhyme and a reason to it and it makes a lot of sense so hopefully by the end of these tutorials you guys are going to understand the importance and the significance to significant figures should I have said it like that probably not but you guys know what I mean so basically let me go ahead and tell you a story from my childhood and this is going to you know definitely um explain to you guys how and why significant figures are important so when I was in high school I used to be on the wrestling team and I was always obsessed about my weight so I had a scale at my house that I weighed myself multiple times a day so one day I weighed myself and the scale said 165 PBS it only had enough data to round it to the nearest pound again if you wanted to buy a scale that you know gave you a tenth of a pound like 165.1 75 those cost like thousands and thousands of dollars to get a scale that accurate so we only had you know a dumb scale that we bought at Kmart so it only gave us my weight to the nearest pound so I walk in wrestling practice one day and my coach says all right Bucky how much do you weigh and I tell him 165 lbs and he looks at me I look a little bit chubby like I'm overweight like I'm not going to make weight for the tournament and he says you know what I don't believe you get on the scale so I go ahead and hop on the scale and if you never wrestled in high school before they have really precise expensive scales so in fact whenever I got on that scale it said 16538 so he's like bucky bucky bucky you you lied to me you told me you weighed 165 and whenever I said that he was assuming it was 165.000 when in fact I weighed more than 165 so was I lying to him well I wasn't exactly lying to them but you know the results were different so with that being said that is basically the importance of significant figures whenever you're working with significant figures you can only claim your answer to be is accurate is the least accurate factor and you're going to see what I'm talking about whenever I'm working with this in scientific notation but basically what I'm trying to say is whenever you're using scientific notation especially with multiplication and division your answer can't be more precise than your least precise factor and by that I mean you can't assume this number is 165.000 because we don't have the equipment to verify that we can only assume we can only basically work with whole numbers since this information right here is unknown so we can't just claim it to be whatever we want it to so let me go ahead and give you guys another example go ahead and change my color a little bit I change it to green or something like that so basically say you and your friend wanted to start uh I don't know like selling potatoes on the side of the road like that's a good idea so you go ahead and I'm going to go ahead and weigh all the potatoes I own first and remember I have that cheap scale from Kmart or Walmart wherever I said I got it from so I only can wait to the nearest whole pound so it says I have 20 pounds of potatoes pretty cool so I call up my friend and his dad is a doctor he always gets the nicest clothes the nicest shoes so he has this super fancy Mega scale so he weighs his potatoes and of course he has more potatoes than I do he has 3287 pounds of potatoes so we say all right we're going to go ahead and add up our potatoes to see how much money we can make however we can't say that we have 50 2.87 lbs of potatoes because that number May or may not be accurate and the reason for that is because if you guys don't understand this 20 right here it may or may not be 20.0 this number 20 accidentally deleted that okay let's clear this up this number 20 right here can be anything from like 19.5 to 2049 and we really don't know to add 19.5 to this or to add 2049 or anything in between so really all this information to the right of the decimal point is pretty much just a guess so the only information that we really want to work with is this what we need to do is whenever we add this together together what the heck together we basically need to round in other words get rid of this so we can only say we have 50 three and we can't even use a decimal place we can only say we have 53 pounds of potatoes if we want around or to be on the safe side we can just say we have 52 and you know it will work out like that but basically what I'm trying to say is whenever you work with significant figures you can't claim to have more information than you really do because these numbers right here are basically just question marks so you can't just go ahead and throw in anything there you like you can only have an answer that's as accurate as your least precise piece of equipment so that's basically what I'm trying to say hopefully you understand the importance of significant figures and why and how we need to use them so in the next tutorials what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be showing you a real quick example of multiplication and division and I'm going to show you how what we did in the last tutorials were wrong and how to correct it so so with that being said thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
