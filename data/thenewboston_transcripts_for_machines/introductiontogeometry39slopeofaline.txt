so today our focus is on slope and the slope of a line is equal to the ratio of rise over run so if I have this line right here and this is 0 one and this is point 2 how high does it go and then how far over does it go and a mathematical formula for this is Y 2 minus y1 because that will give you the distance traveled upwards over X2 X1 which will give you the distance traveled over so for example if this coordinate was 0 1 and this was 34 we would take Y 2 which is 4 y1 which is 1 over X2 X1 so we'd get 4 3 3 and then 3 0 three so that has a slope of one and we always write slope with a M so M of this line equals 1 so there are four types of slopes you can have a positive slope which means that your line is increasing you can have a negative slope which is decreasing you could have a slope who equals zero which means that which is a horizontal line it's always a horizontal line because this line right here this point right here has a different x value but it has the same y value so if you were to put that in the formula You' get y oh I'm sorry it has the same y value because they're on the same place on a graph so if you had if you were going to put this in the formula you'd get y1 minus y1 which would give you zero over whatever this equals so you get zero over a number so you have a slope of zero if you have a vertical line it's it has an undefined slope because if you think about it this point is X1 y1 and this point would have the same x value but a different y value so if you were to plug it in the formula you'd get Y2 minus y1 over X1 X1 so you get a zero on the bottom and some number on top and you cannot divide a number by zero you can't take a number and divide it by nothing because that mean like you just you just can't do it so whenever we get a number over zero it is an undefined slope so now we're going to do some examples find the slope of each line so we're going to do the two easiest ones first first this horizontal line This is line one line two line three and line four so the slope of line one equals well this has it's a horizontal line so that means that it has a zero slope because it's not moving up any it's staying constant across the board so the slope of line two we have two points right here and there's two different ways you can do it you could literally count and say I go up one and over two and you'd find you have a slope of 1/2 but just to be safe we're going to plug it into the formula so I have two points right here and if you look on the graph you can figure out what they are this point right here is 2 2 and this point right here is 0 1 2 3 3 so if I plug this into the formula I get y1 2 Y 2 3 over x 1 minus or sorry X2 X1 and 2 minus a negative is the same thing is adding a positive so 2 + 3 is 1 over 2 0 is 2 so either way you'd get 1/2 so the slope of line 3 equals line three is right here and it's a vertical line so right away you should think it's an undefined slope there's no other way to write that all you do is say line three is undefined so we have another one line four so the slope of line four so we're going to do it both ways again we could say we go from this point we go up to two and left one so that we have positive 2 over1 which would give you 1 or you could plug plug it into the formula so this point here is 22 this point here is 1 one oh sorry1 2 so y us y1 over x X1 so 1 2 is 1 over 1 + pos2 which gives me positive 1 and if you divide a negative by a positive you get another negative so the slope of that line is Nega 1 so now we're going to talk about lines that have special kinds of slopes so the slope of a parallel and perpendicular lines parallel lines have equal slopes so the M of line one would equal the M of line two perpendicular lines have opposite reciprocal slopes so if this if the slope of line one equals m and line one is perpendicular to line two I'm going to take the opposite of M which opposite is another word for um opposite means take the opposite sign so if this is positive M for line two I want M and then I want the reciprocal of M and the only and the reciprocal is just 1 over M so the slope of a perpendicular line is 1/ M if m is your slope I know that's a little confusing so we're going to do some examples so we want a line parallel to a line with a positive rise of Two and a run of Nega 3 so our formula is rise over run so I have a positive rise of Two positive2 and a run of 3 so if we want a line parallel to this line we want it to have a slope of 2/3 so line perpendicular to a line whose slope is four so line one the slope of of line 1 equals 4 so to find the slope of line two I'm going to take first the opposite so I'm going to so since this is positive I'm going to make it negative and then I want the reciprocal of it so the reciprocal of four is 1 over 4 so the slope of line two would equal ne1 over 4 uh and that's all we're going to do with slope today but this is gonna help us when we do the equation of line of a line in uh a couple videos
