hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be working more on the car program now if you don't know what this is and this code isn't familiar to you you might want to move back to the beginning of the program so let's go ahead and get started let's come down here and we'll go ahead and minimize our sports car class so we'll just comment it sports car and then we'll call it class okay so now let's make a truck class so we're going to go ahead and Define our class so we'll just call it truck and we'll add car uh to simplify it so we know uh that it inherits from the car class so to make it inherit all this stuff that the car class has we just want to type inherits car so now everything car has we can use and I'll just add some stuff in here um to that's specific to a truck so let's go ahead and create an enumeration so private en num and then we'll just do bed length for the length of the truck bed as let's do integer so we need to fill this with some values so we'll set short equal to zero so if they have a short bed it's going to be equal to Z and we need to do short bed because short is a keyword in visual BAS basic and it doesn't like it when we use that so we'll do um medium bed equals 1 and long bed equals 2 so now that we have our bed link bed length enumeration let's go ahead and make a uh cab size enumeration so we'll just go ahead and comment this so we got short medium and long and they'll do cab length enumeration okay so we'll start off by declaring this private so private in um and we'll do cab length as and we'll do it with type integer again and we will set single equal to zero and looks like we are getting an error again because single is a keyword too uh we'll do extended cab and let's just do one more so let's do something like uh what a tundra would have a crew Max so we got single single cab uh extend cab and crew Max so now what we need to do is create a variable or two variables that will store uh values from these enumerations so we'll just type private uh truck bed length and then we'll do it of type bed length so as bed length and then we'll go ahead and do uh the cab length so private truck cab length as cab length Okay so now we've got uh two data types of our enumerations that are going to store some information about our truck so what we need to do is create some properties that will allow that will allow us to get these and set these so we'll just type public property and then we'll do let's go ahead and call it the bed length so and then we want it to be of type bed length okay so now what we need to do is we need to add some parentheses right here we'll type get and it'll fill in the rest of it for us so what do we want to get we need to go ahead and return truck bed length so whenever they access this property is going to give them back uh the bed length so what are we going to to set it we're going to type if value numeration bed length so now uh this will work as we intended it to so we'll just Ty get and sets the bed length so now we're going to need to do this again for the cab length so gets and sets truck cab length so we'll type public property the cab length and what we're going to need to do is set it of type cab length so the reason we made uh these enumerations is to keep out certain values and make it easier to use our code so when we type in get here it's going to fill in the rest for us so to get it all we have to do is return truck cab length and to set it once again we're going to use an statement to see if it is a valid number so we'll just type if value is greater than or equal to zero and value is less than or equal to two then go ahead and set the uh the cab length so truck cab length is going to be equal to value
