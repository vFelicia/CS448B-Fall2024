hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to look at the jQuery change event handler now in previous parts of the tutorial set we've looked at using the click event handler for example however if we have elements on a page such as a drop down list you'll want to use the change event handler to actually allow this event to take place or the function inside of this event to take place when a new value has been selected for example so the first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and build a dropdown list so I'm going to use the Select element and I'm going to give this an ID of list now inside of here I want to choose some options that will be displayed in the list and I'm going to give each of them a value so the first value is going to be one and I'll just write one in here which is the text displayed to the user this is the value that's returned I then go ahead and just copy and paste this down and change these values so we've got one two and three and we'll just change these accordingly so let's go over to our page and refresh you can see we've now got a dropdown box with one two and three okay so what we want to do now is create a page a javascript page that we can include that it's going to include the event handler for when this list changes ie when someone clicks the drop down list and then selects a new value so whenever they click on a new value here that's classed as the element changing so let's go ahead and create our new file I'm going to place this inside my jquery folder with jquery jas and i'm going to call this change j/s okay so now I'm going to need to include this change j/s file on my page so I'm going to say script type is equal to text forward slash javascript the source is going to be Jay s /jj s and then I'll end the script there okay so now that we've done that we should have functionality from this change J s file and we can create an event handler for when this list changes so we're also going to go down here and create a span and that's going to be the feedback from what's being selected so I'm going to call this list feedback so inside this span we're going to create some text that lets the user know what they've selected from the list now this isn't just useful for relaying what the user selected obviously the user knows what they've selected but let's say you wanted to show another dropdown list when a user had selected a particular element in here or a particular option from this list we can do that as well we're not going to be looking in this tutorial because I'm just demonstrating the event handler however it is a possibility and you will you will see the methods that you can use to create this for yourself so for now we're just displaying the feedback from the user so let's go ahead and reference the list that'll be hash lists now we need to create the event handler and this is change so it's the dollar sign inside brackets we textually represent that or refer to this list using a hash then we say dot change and we have parentheses here and then a semicolon instead of here we need to create a function with our block which will then pull down and we can start writing our code in here now let's go ahead and just alert something out and that's going to be changed now what's going to happen is when we actually change the list option so when we choose a different option in the list we'll get an alert box to show that this has worked it's important that we test that is worked before we continue with the rest of our code so I'm clicking on this but nothing's happening however when I select a different option from the list you'll see that we get this alert box saying changed as we specified so now that we know it works we can actually retrieve the value from here and then relay it to the user so I'm going to create a new file called list value and that's going to be equal to again we're referencing list up here so we do exactly the same thing hash lists and then dot Val which we've spoken about in some of the other parts of the tutorial this here is going to retrieve the value here okay so for each element or for each option okay so now that we've got this list value we can then go ahead and actually relay this to the user so inside of and well by referencing another element which is list feedback we can say dot HTML and then we can insert the list value so now when we've well when jQuery has picked up on this change we grab the current value and then we relay it back to the user using the HTML function which will just put some value inside this list feedback span okay so let's go ahead and let's go ahead and test this in fact beforehand I think we'll just add some more text to here so you've you have selected area so you have selected a space an depending on the list value okay just put a colon in there okay so now let's go ahead and test this so I'm going to choose two and it says you have selected two I'm going to choose three you have selected three and then one you have selected one so you can see with this change event handler we can extremely easily check for the change of different elements now this doesn't have to just be used for lists it can be used for a variety of elements input fields text areas you know as many elements as you can think that with that would have some use in this event handler so it's not just limited to this select option element or the select option at sorry the select element it can be applied to variety of other elements as well
