hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about Graphics now we're going to be working with Graphics a lot throughout the next couple tutorials so let's go ahead and create a new project we will select a Windows forms application and we will just call it Graphics demo now in this program we're going to be making some of the simplest um graphic drawings that you can do so we'll just wait for that to load and once it's done we'll just resize the form sum and then let's come over here to our toolbox and we'll add a button make it a little bit bigger we'll set the text to draw rectangle and we will set the name to button draw so let's go ahead and Center it some and we'll double click on draw a rectangle to open up the event handler so whenever button draws clicked it's going to run this so what we need to do first is create a graphics object or it would be more like a variable because we're not creating a new instance of the object so we'll just do private and we'll call it g as system. drawing. Graphics now I believe system. drawing is already imported so let's just go ahead and see if graphic shows up so system. drawing is already imported but if you ever need to access graphics and it's not imported you can just go ahead and use the long hand version of that so now that we have our G what we want to do is set it equal to something so we'll do that whenever the form loads so we'll set g equals and then we'll type in me now now me refers to the form one class uh which is the form one right here so what we need to do is create graphics for that so we'll just call me do create Graphics it says a public function create Graphics as system. drawing. Graphics creates the graphics for the control so basically lets us draw stuff on our form so G is going to be equal to me. create Graphics so whenever we draw anything uh with G is going to be drawn directly to the form now you can set G equal to say um button draw. create Graphics I think but you can set it um don't quote me on that but you can set it equal to other things to draw on certain parts of your program so whenever they click draw what we want to do is draw a rectangle so g. draw and you can see that there's a whole bunch of stuff here that we can use what we want to do is Select draw rectang rectangle now draw a rectangle is going to take some arguments the first um version of draw a rectangle takes a pen and a rectangle now you can make objects of rectangles um and you need four points to that and we'll go into that later but for now we're just going to use this version of draw a rectangle which takes a pin object and then our X position and our y position which is the top left corner of our rectangle the width and the height so to specify our pin what we want to do is just type pin Dot and this I believe is an enumeration um and we can just select uh any color we want so we'll just do pins. black our X position I'll show I'll start it off at let's say 1 one so you can so you guys can see where that is that's going to be somewhere right up in here close to the corner form one and the bigger these numbers are the farther away it gets so this is the starting point for your X position and Y position this will be 0 0 and it goes all the way down to right here and this will be the biggest so we'll do one one and for our width we'll just make it 20 pixels long and or let's make that a little bit bigger 30 pixels long and 20 pixels wide so go ahead and run this and you can see when we click draw a rectangle it draws a rectangle right here in our form so let's just move that away from the top left corner so you can see it a little bit better so we'll do it 30 pixels down and 30 pixels across or 30 pixels across and 30 pixels down go ahead and run this and when we click draw a rectangle you can see that it draws the rectangle for us so let's go ahead and close out of that we can also use fill rectangle so let's go ahead and run this and for fill rectangle what we're going to need is a brush so we'll just type brushes do black so whenever you're filling something use a brush to fill it and whenever you're drawing the outline or just draw you're going to use a pin so go ahead and run this we'll click draw a rectangle and you can see that it fills a rectangle on our form one so go ahead practice a little bit with Graphics um look at some of the methods that you can use um by typing draw and see what kind of stuff you can draw um and once you've played around with that a little bit maybe there's something you don't know just move on to the next tutorial and your questions uh will probably be answered and we'll look more at Graphics so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
