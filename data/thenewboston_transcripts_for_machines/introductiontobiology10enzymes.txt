welcome back everyone my name is Sarah sorry it's been a couple of days since I actually made a video I've been really busy with school got some food poisoning a couple of days ago stay away from the seafood that's all I'm saying but anyways I'm back now and in this video I'm going to be talking about enzymes and biochemical reactions cells are constantly engaged in chemical activity and the major difference between living things and nonliving things is that living things carry out chemical activities on a continuous and controlled basis if this wasn't the case we would not be alive because most of the reactions that happen with within a cell are really freaking slow but living things have these things called enzymes and enzymes are biological catalysts a catalyst is a molecule that can change the rate of reaction but is not consumed in the process and catalysts do this by lowering what is called the energy of activation in chemical systems the amount of energy that is available to a reaction is called the free energy also known as Delta G which stands for Gibs free energy blah blah blah blah blah normally you have your reactants are going to be at higher energy than your products and things like to be at lower energy they like to have as little energy as possible so during a chemical reaction you're going to have your reactants they've got to cross this energy barrier called the energy of activation but once they cross this barrier they're going to be transformed into products and they're nice and happy normally the energy of activation without a catalyst is going to be pretty large you can see here but the energy of activation with a catalyst is much much smaller so so it's a lot easier for reactants to be converted into products enzymes are normally composed of one or more polypeptide chains this means they are normally proteins however there are some RNA molecules that act as Catalyst anyways the basic structure of an enzyme is you've got your binding site you've got your enzyme here You've Got The Binding site there and then you got the acis site what going to happen is you have your substrate which is your reactant substrate is going to come in and bind at the in The Binding site once the substrate binds the enzyme is going to change its configuration it's going to change its shape the substrate is then going to be pushed back into the active site where it is going to be changed into the product product is going to be released and then the enzyme changes back to its original shape the enzyme has not been changed at all some enzymes or some reactions require something that is called a coenzyme these are also known as vitamins like vitamin A or vitamin D or something like that but that doesn't really matter I don't know why I mentioned it I'm sorry sometimes when I don't have enough caffeine I tend to get a little scatter brained anyways moving on to these specificity of enzymes there are a couple of different theories on the specificity of enzymes the first is the lock and key mod this means there's one enzyme one substrate it's exactly like a padlock and a key there's only one key that opens each padlock the induced fit Theory say that the active site allows for some change in shape to fit the substrate so say the substrate has a slightly different shape than what the enzyme is used to it's kind of like a lock pick you can always you know it takes a minute but you can you can pick a lock as long as you have something that looks kind of like the key that you're using and there are also a couple of things that affect the actual enzyme function there is temperature which is the rate at which molecules move kinetic energy it's measure of K kinetic energy pH is the concentration of hydrogen ions these two things when altered can disrupt the actual shape of the protein protein folding you got substrate analoges these are molecules that look really really really similar to the actual substrate but may have some different chemical properties they might bind too tightly to the active site and will be unable like the enzyme is actually unable to release this analog so the enzyme is enzyme is rendered useless and you also have these things called alisic affectors These are molecules that bind somewhere else on the enzyme and change the shape of the enzyme so you can see we have our enzyme here substrate here binding site you've also got this thing called the alisic site so you have this little alisic effector it can come in and bed to this aleric site and it's going to change the shape of the enzyme therefore the enzyme is not going to be able to bind this substrate the enzyme is not going to work temporarily whenever this alisic eector unbinds the enzyme comes back to its original shape and then it combind the substrate but that's all I have for enzymes
