hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at The Preserve keyword now if you remember in the last tutorial we created a little application that has two list boxes it has the first array and then the new array after we redeclare it by using the redm keyword and we went through and we used the four each Loop to add each item to the first list box before it changed then we redeclared it using redim and then we added the um two values to the end of it that weren't already there and then when we added them again you can see that we get a problem here we have blank um values inside of our uh array now here I'll just show you guys what will happen if we don't have the brackets here so if we go ahead and delete these you're going to see that we get an error because it cannot reference NES and place them in a list box so we'll go ahead and click redem and you can see that the application freezes up says value cannot be null parameter name item so the way we fix this is just by adding the brackets around it so at least there's something being put into the list box so we'll go ahead and stop it here or we can drag this Arrow right up there and then continue running it and we close close out of that and you can see that it works just fine so now what we're going to do is we're going to talk about The Preserve keyword so sorry I had to pause there so I may be off topic a little bit but um after we use the redim keyword we can use the keyword preserve now if you read the description for this it says prevents the content contents of an array from being cleared when the dimensions of the array are of the array are changed so it just preserves the the original AR array you had and adds on the existing items and now redim that stands for red Dimension so um if we go ahead and run this you can see that if we click redem we get basketball I mean baseball basketball and football over here then baseball basketball football wakeboarding and soccer so you can see that preserved all the items in our string Sports now let's go ahead and make the array smaller and you will see that data is lost even though we use um preserve so we'll just add soccer here so if we redeclare and preserve or redeem and preserve string sports but this time we only let it hold four spaces or let's say four spaces instead of five if we go ahead and run this you can see that we get baseball basketball football wakeboarding and soccer and down here we get baseball basketball ball football and wakeboarding so even though you use the preserved keyword uh data is still going to be lost if you make your array smaller now if we just redeclare it right here and run it you can see that it gives us four blank spots because we did not preserve what we already had in there and we made it smaller so even so data is lost and there is nothing down here um after wake boarding so we just have an empty array that holds four spaces so preserve is a very simple concept it should be you should catch on to it really quick um once you practice a little bit with redm and preserving arrays um go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and if it's not out yet just uh wait a little bit and it'll probably be posted soon so thanks for watching guys
