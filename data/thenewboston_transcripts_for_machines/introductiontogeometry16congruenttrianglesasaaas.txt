so now we're going to go into our second lesson of congruent triangles and this time we're going to learn about angle side angle and angle angle side which are two other methods of proving triangles are congruent so for the first one angle side angle we know that two angles and the included side of one Tri of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle so for these ones I know that this angle and this angle are congruent I know this angle and this angle are congruent and since I know that this side which Falls between these two angles is congruent to this side which Falls between these two angles I can say therefore triangle a is congruent to Triangle B by angle side angle we always want to give a reason as to why they're congruent so angle angle side is the fourth one we're going to learn so we know that two angles and the nonincluded the non included side of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle so I know that this is congruent to this this is congruent to this and that this Ang this side which does not fall between these two angles because that would be angle side angle and this side which does not fall between these two angles are congruent therefore for triangle a is congruent to Triangle B by angle angle side so now that we know two more ways to prove triangles are congruent we're going to um see what's going on with these triangles right here so for the first one I know that this angle is congruent to this angle this angle is conr to this angle and this side is congruent to this side well to know if we're going to use angle side angle or angle angle side the thing that really matters is which sides are which sides are congruent since this side is included between these two angles and this side is also included between these two angles we know that we're going to use angle Le side angle because we have an angle and a side and an angle congruent to an angle a side and an angle so therefore I call this a and this B triangle a is congruent to Triangle B by angle side angle now we have this one we know these two angles are congruent and this angle is congruent to this angle well we don't know that any sides are congruent but since this these two triangles share this side right here we can say that it's congruent to itself so we have an angle a non included side and another angle congruent to to an angle a nonincluded side and another angle so therefore we'll call this C and this is D Triangle C is congruent to Triangle d by angle angle side now we have one more so this triangle is congruent to this triangle this angle is congruent to this angle and they share this side so since this side Falls between the two congruent angles we're going to use angle side angle and we can say that triangle e is congruent to to Triangle F by angle side angle so next lesson we're going to learn about the last way to prove triangles are congruent so make sure you check it out
