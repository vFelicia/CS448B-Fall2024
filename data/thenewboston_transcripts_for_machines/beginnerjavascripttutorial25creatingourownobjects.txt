all right guys welcome back to your 25th JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to teach you guys how to create your own objects so like I said before an object is pretty much a special type of data that has its own properties and its own methods and today we're going to be creating an object that has a couple properties with it we won't be talking about methods now but maybe in the future tutorial or definitely in future tutorial we will so basically there are a couple different ways that we can make our own own objects one of the ways and probably the easiest way is to use something called a Constructor function and like I said before an object is pretty pretty much a blueprint so that's what we're going to be doing in this tutorial so in order to make our own object what people typically do is whenever they're making this blueprint they go ahead and take the script and they stick it in the head so let's go ahead and do that put your script tags in the head and whenever we're printing stuff out we try to do that in the body so for now since we're not printing anything out let's just go ahead and stick this in the head so in order to create this special thing called a Constructor function it looks basically just like any other function go ahead and tape the name function just like that and we're going to be making a blueprint or AKA object for people so go ahead and name it like person or people or whatever you want so we have an object called person now let's go ahead and let right we want to work with this current object you need to give it a special keyword called this I know it's weird but this is what you have to do and this basically means is we're working with the current object why it would ever work with another another object I don't know but trust me it's stupid I understand but it's what you have to do so this current object's name is whatever name we pass in there so it's going to take like Bucky Roberts and it's going to assign it to the object's name this is pretty much saying this whatever information we pass in and whatever information we want to assign to the object that's all it does really so now we have to do it with age this object's age is going to be equal to whatever the age we tell it to pass in simple enough so I saying all right this is basically called a Constructor function and it's basically a blueprint for a function so now we have the blueprints right here but we really don't have an object yet all we have is the instructions telling us how to make one so let's go ahead and make a couple objects right now in order to make a new object and by the way let me just tell you guys this I say make a new object but if you're taking a test uh for college or something it's actually called creating a new instance of an object so I say it like you know the straightup way but the technical term put on your quiz create a new instance of an object so you know say that and your teacher will probably you know I don't know want to say get a hard on or something so in order to create a new object is just like creating a new variable variable and then you list the name of your object I'm going to create a Bucky object so in order to do that go ahead and set it equal to this whenever you create a new instance AKA whenever you create an object you have to use the keyword new this is telling JavaScript we're about to create a new object so after this we write what blueprint do we want to use well since we're going to be creating a new Bucky object and we only have one blueprint obviously it's going to be the person blueprint so it says all right since you're using that person blueprint it takes two pieces of information the first thing that I need is the name and the second thing I need is the age okay let's go ahead and give that to you name Bucky Roberts age 24 and make sure remember any strings have to be in quotation marks in any numbers don't have to be so that is basically how you create a new object your object's name what blueprint you want to use in any information it needs so let's go ahead and create another one real quick um VAR let's make one for Taylor St since she is cute uh new of course she's a person too but her name whoa Taylor Swift and I don't know her age but I'm going to guess like 20 or something I don't know who knows either she was 20 or she is going to be 20 at one point so good enough so now we have two objects a Bucky object and a Taylor object Bucky object now has two properties its name is Bucky Roberts and its age is 24 oh I got like kennel Cofer something and then we have a tailor object the tailor object's name is Taylor Swift and the tailor objects age is 20 so that's pretty cool we have a blueprint right here and we actually created the objects down here but why is this useful well can we print it out or something oh yes we can so remember like I said anytime you want to print something out you should do so in the body so let's go ahead and print out this stuff right now document WR so anytime just like before in the last tutorial I told you guys you want to use an object's properties you need to list the name of the object and let's go ahead we have two objects to choose from Bucky and Taylor let's go ahead and print out my name first so list the name of your object Bucky and then using a DOT separator you list the name of its property or variables so Bucky's name should print out out Bucky Roberts pretty cool huh so let's go ahead and see another example if we wanted to print out um Taylor Swifts Age We to write the object Taylor and the property we want to access is age so let's go ahead and save this and it should print out 20 just like that so like I said this is just a better way of organizing data instead of going you know calling a function or anything like that to access Tyler so H the only thing we need to do now is just the name of the object and what property we want to access so Buy's name Bucky's age Taylor tr's name Taylor tr's age it's a whole lot easier than creating a bunch of functions to display all that information so again to recap one last time in order to create the blueprint for an object you pretty much do something called create a Constructor function and that is the technical name and in order to do that you write what type of object do you want to be making and then list the information that it needs and then say all right with that information that we're going to pass in we want to assign it to that object so Bucky's name is going to be Bucky Roberts Taylor's age is going to be 20 and then now that we have a blueprint we can go ahead and make as many objects as we want I made two in this example but we can either make 5 10 5,000 if we want it doesn't matter and after that whenever you want to use any information from an object you go ahead and write the object's name and the variable or the properties associated with it and again don't forget if you're watching this tutorial because your teacher confused you in JavaScript class or something like that whenever you're creating objects I say creating objects but the technical term is creating an instance of an object and the technical term for this is called a Constructor function so there there you go there's your answers for your test and uh that's the basics of how to create our very own objects so this is one way we can create objects another way I'm going to be teaching you that in maybe couple tutorials maybe the next tutorial I haven't decided yet but for now that's all you get so thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to subscribe don't forget to check out my website and I will see you guys later
