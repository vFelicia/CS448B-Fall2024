what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to another update video um it's been like a week since I made the last update video so a couple things have changed since then so I just want to keep you guys updated about what's going on with the new and improved the New Boston so the main things that have changed is I've been busy this week not only making tutorials but I also hired three new people so we have three new employees to help us make tutorials so we're going to be making of course I'm going to be sticking with my xhtml tutorials for now and they are going to be making let's see if I can remember all this um they're going to be working on one subject at a time but the first subjects that we decided to cover are biology chemistry prealgebra geometry and uh statistics and I think that's it for now but you know they're going to be working on one of those subjects um so three subjects plus my xhtml and after my xhtml I decided that I'm going to do JavaScript so I know a lot of you guys um want to dive into Android but I owe it to the people that have been following me forever been following my JavaScript tutorials to finish that series to be honest I messed up and I should have finished it a long a long time ago and I'm sorry but I owe it to you guys to finish what I started so as promised that's what I'm going to do that's what I'm doing with my xhtml tutorials that's what I'm going to be doing in my JavaScript tutorials I'm going to get as them done as fast as I can um since I owe it to you guys at least that much so I know you guys are like oh it's going to be like months before I get into the topic that I want to learn well actually I started with my xhtml tutorials this month I mean this week and I'm already like halfway done with them so the topics that some teachers take like 4 and a half months or an entire semester to cover I'm going to be covering it in like a week so I'm guessing once I start teaching JavaScript or anything that it's going to take like a week or two maximum to cover and then I'm going to be on with something new and hopefully that's the same um once we get rolling and once they get familiar my employees how to make tutorials and how to make them good then hopefully we'll be ripping through those as well and trust me the quality is still going to be amazing we're going to be covering everything in detail so don't worry about that and I I read a lot of you guys coms like Bucky you don't have to make these tutorials for us um you already done so much for us guys I love making tutorials for you guys I love reading all the comments I love getting the feedback so I mean don't feel sorry for me at all because I enjoy it more than you guys can even imagine so uh I just want to get that out of the way so don't feel sorry for me at all cuz I enjoy doing this um aside from that recently and I didn't even notice this until people started leaving comments I guess I hit myund I mean a thousandth video on one of my xhtml tutorials so I should have done something special for my thousandth video but I was so zoomed in on making tutorials that it kind of just passed me by so one of those tutorials was my thousandth video so congratulations to us all we finally made it to 1,000 videos and uh hopefully it's just one of the Milestones on the path to the New Boston Empire so we are doing it guys uh I'm so proud of you guys for sticking with me watching these tutorials so anyways the main thing I want to go over is that we got three new employees so um yeah that's it so anyway I got one more other small thing to show you so uh just hold on one second I'll show you all right guys now don't get too excited because this surprise is pretty much the dumbest surprise ever but I just want to show you guys we finally got my bookcase yeah I finally figured out how to squeeze it in my car so uh yeah I finally have completed my awesome Furniture section for the office so here's what we got going on here is going to be for our employees and the bookcase where we're going to be uh you know keep track of all the subjects and my office and actually I told you guys that that was what I wanted to talk to you guys about but I got one more thing and maybe you guys can help me out with this see on my walls let me try to zoom in here on my walls I got these Hooks and I think that paintings or you know probably a lot of people who went to college put all their degrees and fancy stuff there but uh I don't have a whole lot of you know pictures of me shaking hands with the president so if you guys have any photos or paintings even if you made them yourself I don't care but I need something to put on my wall because it feels kind of empty and also there's another one right here right there so anyways I got all these hooks on my walls and I'm supposed to be I'm supposed to be hanging stuff from them but I don't have any paintings or photographs or anything so if you have guys if you guys have anything you can send me I have my address on my main YouTube channel youtube.com/ newboston and I also put it in the uh section below so if you guys have anything you can send me my walls are naked and they're lonely and they have nothing so put something and I'll hang them up even if it's stupid I'm going to hang it up anyways who the heck cares so um thank you guys for watching this update I'll try to do an update every week but that's not a promise I'm just going to try so uh thank you guys and uh I look forward to uh getting all your stuff in the mail so um I guess I'll see you later
