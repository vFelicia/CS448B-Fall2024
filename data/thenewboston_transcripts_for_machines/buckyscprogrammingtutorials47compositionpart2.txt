alright guys welcome back to your 47th C++ tutorial and this tutorial is just a continuation from the last oriole so what we did in the last tutorial is we pretty much we're working on the people h header file and now we're going to hop over to the people dot cpp to start actually building our functions but now that I think about let's go ahead and have hop back over to the people header file and aside from just the constructor let's go ahead and build another function just so we can print it out it will make everything a lot easier to see so let's go ahead and make a function called what was of this one called I want to make sure I don't name the same thing this one is called print date so we'll call this one print info I guess so print info so this is pretty much going to create our object and this is going to print out the information simple enough so now that we have this people class created in our constructor we said it was going to take two things every person needs two pieces of information a name and a birthday so what we need to do is we need to assign the name that they passed in and the birthday that the pass then to the private variables name and date of birth so in order to do that what we need to use is a member initializer list anytime you're working with um a class inside of another class you need to use a member initializer list so go ahead and remember don't put it inside your body right here you put it between your parameters in your body and again all a member initializer list is it's basically setting name equal to X and it's going to set the variable date of birth equal to Oh would we pass in Bo so Bo and also remember that you don't put a semicolon at the end of this it already knows it's done because the body will start so that's all we need to do for this right here so again we're going to be passing in two pieces of information we're going to be passing in a string and then a birthday object it's going to take that string and set it equal to name and it's going to tape that birthday object and set it equal to the day of birth so now this class has a name and now it has a birthday object that you can use so let's take the information and we can use that whenever we're building this other function print info so let's go ahead and um yeah I guess I don't need to do anything before that so let's go ahead and put void people print info and of course this print info doesn't take any information but it's just going to print something out on the screen so what it's going to do is see out your name variable which would be Bucky Roberts and then go ahead and write something like was born on and then make sure you don't end the line because I want all this to be on one line and then after this in order to print that date remember we have a function inside our birthday class that prints the date right here and we already passed in a birthday object inside this class so now this class has access to the birthday functions so we can go ahead and use this date of birth object right here that we created in order to use this print date function so let's go ahead and just write date of birth right there dot print date pretty cool huh so now whenever we print the info it's basically going to say Bucky Roberts excuse me Bucky Roberts was born on twelve 2886 pretty cool huh so now let's go over oh wait a minute I almost forgot to do this we need to include a bunch of stuff inside this people class um I'll talk you guys through it the first thing we need to include is our iostream and STD because you know we need to include those basically in every class and aside from that we also need to include this birthday header right here and the reason we need to do that is because whenever basically whenever you're working with another class you need to include the header so yeah I definitely just messed that up accidentally highlighted something so one more time okay let's not copy and paste it or in spots this time all right so let's go ahead and in our main CPP um everything looks good go so far actually what we need to do is since we're going to be working with birthday objects and people objects in this one we need to include include those headers as well so go ahead and grab this and include it right there and go ahead and grab this and include it right there so basically you see whenever you're working with the object you need to include it simple enough so check this out since the people class in order to create an object you need a birthday object whenever we run our main we need to create that birthday object first so remember in our birthday object when we first created our object needs three pieces of information a month a day in the year so let's go ahead and create a birthday object if I spell write birthday and we'll just name it birth object and then these those three pieces of information a month a day and a year so now we have a birthday object created called birth object and this birthday object pretty much took month day and year and set equal to twelve 2886 so now we can go ahead and create a people object people I'm just going to name mine Bucky Roberts and you're saying all right well what information does the people class need well whenever we create a people object it needs a string as the name and it needs a birthday object right there so first let's give it a name Bucky the King and the second piece of information it needed was a birthday object well it just so happens that we created one up here so let's go ahead and pass that in right there so after this what we need to do is might as well just print out the info right here so remember in the people class we had a function called print info and it just printed out the name and the birthday so go ahead and type your object named Bucky Roberts dot print info and remember it doesn't take any parameters and let's run this and see how many errors I got one so hold on once and I see what's going on all right see this up whenever we create this constructor we forgot to pass it in the parameters so just go ahead and copy these parameters copy and paste so hopefully that's the only errors we got and it looks good go so Bucky the King was born on 12 28 1986 works awesome so let me talk you guys through one last time what we did we just created a basic birthday class and this birthday class had three variables a month a day in a year so whenever we created a birthday object it took that month day in a year and assigned it to the three birthday variables month day in a year so we got the birthday class taken care of and then we decided to build another people class now the people class whenever you built a person and need the two pieces of information and needed a string which we gave it Bucky the King and it needed a birthday object so when for example whenever we had a birthday object right here we could pass it in second and what it did is in the main program it took that name and set it equal to the variable name and it took the birthday object and set it equal to the object date of birth so that basically gave us access to the birthday class so from there we were able to use data birth and the function in the birthday class to print out the birthday so basically whenever I run this this is a function from the people class and this is actually a function from the birthday class we just tied them together in one function right here pretty cool so that is basically what our composition is compositions basically using other classes inside your class using objects of other classes inside your class um that's all I'm going to go over for composition now hopefully you guys understand if you don't definitely go check out my forum and just type in whatever question you have and a ton of people are willing to help you but for now that's all I have for you guys this is a pretty long tutorial so go take a break go grab a milkshake or some and when you're done you're ready to move on to the next tutorial so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
