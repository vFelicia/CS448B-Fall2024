hi this is Alex from PHP academy' back with another video for the new Boston now in the last part of the tutorial we created our table which is inside our database called a database we created table could users then we inserted some manual data in just so we can test our login process so we're going to write a process to log this use it in and we inserted this data here the username with Alex the password was this md5 hash which we'll deal with later and we've got first name and surname so we've got our hash for security reasons when we're logging in let's just get rid of this that we used earlier when we're logging in we need to convert the the password that the user specifies and see if that matches that same hash because as you know md5 is a oneway algorithm and the result will always be the same ok so we need to think about how we're going to set up our files now I'm going to have an index.php which is going to check if the users logged in and display specific content if they are logged in or if they're not logged in so we're going to have something similar to the following we're going to say if logged in display something otherwise display something else we could even use an if and ifelse if statement your if elseif sorry and we could say not logged in I'm going to create this function which is going to check to see if session data exists or if a session has been set and if the session isn't empty so we'll get rid of that for now but that's just a general idea we're going to sort of say in here we're going to say something like welcome and maybe specify the user's name here and then for this we're going to say please login ok and perhaps display our login form so we'll leave in next stop PHP for now we're going to create a new file which is going to connect to our database so let's say connect in PHP will call that connect our interesting dot PHP so the first thing we want to do is we want to specify the hostname the username and the password so MySQL host in my case that's equal to localhost and in most cases that is if you're running on a local server if you're trying to connect to a remote database you'll need to specify the hostname but for now it's localhost for me the MySQL user is called root this is these are the default settings and because I'm using default settings my password is equal to nothing okay so now what we need to do is we need to specify what table we're going to connect to and that is or the database sorry MySQL database the database is called a underscore database and this sir is found let's just pop into phpMyAdmin here so i underscore database okay so now we can connect so I'm going to say if MySQL Connect and then we can pop out variables in here so the first variable is MySQL house that's the first argument we pass through to this MySQL connect function and then we say MySQL user and then we say MySQL password so if this function connect successfully anything inside this block here will be executed so we can then say let's say if MySQL connect and then we can say um we could say and MySQL select database and the database we've obviously predefined in this variable mysqldb what I'm going to do is I'm going to change this around and I'm going to say if this is unsuccessful or this is unsuccessful then we want to kill the page and we want to specify the MySQL error and acetic brackets there so this where we're echoing out the contents of this function or the value returned from this function which is the error last received from MySQL so if either of these don't connect so if we don't connect to the database itself at the server itself or we don't select the database correctly then we kill with an error otherwise we just carry on with our code normally so we're going to declare or require this file at the top of everywhere where we need to connect and the reason we do this is if we had say five ten files here instead of writing this code five or ten times we just include this file here so let's go ahead and test this connecting dot PHP by including it inside index dot PHP but I'm going to require it so we kill the page if this pay if this file cannot be found so connecting dot PHP let's come on to our browser and refresh the page okay you can see that nothing's come up so hopefully we haven't returned an error but now let's force an error so I'm going to put a local horse instead of localhost let's refresh and you can see that unknown MySQL server host local ISO have retrieved an error so okay let's change that back and we'll change the database name to a database one and let's refresh and you can see we've returned an error saying this is an unknown database so we know that either way if we don't connect to the server correctly or we don't select our database correctly we always echo a MySQL error out now upon completion of development you may want to change this to a error message in here as a string this just means that then it's a bit more user friendly for your users rather than outputting the contour the return value of MySQL error function so for now connector inkedup PHP is complete so now what we want to do is we want to create a page where the user can log in so I'm going to create this as an include file so what I can do is then in this if statement that I create inside index dot PHP I want to show that I want to show that form if you like to the user so let's go ahead and open up a new file we'll start some PHP tags and I'm going to call this login form dot Inc PHP so let's go ahead and start creating the form itself let's go down and start to create our form so this form is called oh and just by the way these includes depend on how your website works so when we're using let's say form action equals something there which to end our form when we say form action I'm going to specify the page that this is currently included in so evident eventually this is going to this actions going to equal index dot PHP but I'm actually going to be using one of the predefined server variables to determine which page this is included in that doesn't make sense now it will do later but for now our method is going to be post okay so our action what's going to happen here we need to specify a variable up here that's going to tell us what our pages logged it at what what page we're currently on in fact I might create a new a new file called will call this call in PHP and when including just variables has some predefined variables in here
