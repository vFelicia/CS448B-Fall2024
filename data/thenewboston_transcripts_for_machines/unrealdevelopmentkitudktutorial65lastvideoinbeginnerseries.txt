what is going on guys welcome to your 65th and last tutorial for this udk beginner series now before you guys start freaking out trust me we are nowhere near finish learning the udk we have so much stuff to go over however every tutorial after this one is going to be rather advanced so what i want to do on my website is i'm going to split all these videos up one through 65 in the udk beginner series and then instead of making this series like 500 videos long i'm just going to be making another series that is going to be you know my intermediate and advanced series that i'm going to be putting the rest of the videos in so i just think that's a better way to organize these videos like i said instead of having just one series that's super long i'm going to be putting the rest of these videos that i make in an intermediate and advanced playlist so trust me guys we are nowhere near finished learning the uk this is basically just a way that i can organize my videos better because like i said from here on out things are going to get a little more advanced so if you're saying all right what exactly are we going to be learning because a lot of people have been messaging me and wanting to know i'm going to be going over things such as and this is just a few things physics um particle systems i'm gonna be teaching you guys how to create user interfaces i'm gonna be teaching you guys like when you have a character that we're gonna bring in how to animate him make his arms move walk around jump and after all that i'm also going to be making another series that is called unreal script now this is pretty much coding you know how kismet was kind of like visual coding well unreal script is unreal's custom programming language so i'm going to be teaching that in another series so again the plans for the udk are i'm going to finish up this series in this video and then we're going to be teaching intermediate concepts in intermediate udk series and then after that we're going to be teaching unreal script and if i have anything to teach after that it's probably going to be in advance so anyways i'm out of breath so that's actually why i made this video i wanted to explain that but i guess since we're already here i might as well teach you guys about you know i might as well teach you guys something since this is a tutorial so i know that i told you guys that i was going to be going over these volumes but a lot of these volumes kind of have concepts that go behind them that i can't really explain now for example physics volumes i can't teach this because i didn't teach you guys about physics yet um level streaming of course we need to know about level streaming which is like kind of a way to optimize your game light mass deals with lighting basically but i again so a lot of these volumes the concepts that go behind it i didn't teach you guys yet so i can't really go over all of them in a way that you can understand however one of the most common volumes if not the most common volumes is blocking volume so i guess i can finish up the series with that blocking volume is just basically a volume that deals with collision and we already know what collision is so let me go ahead and right click my builder brush and i'm going to set this equal to 512 and 512 and 256 for height looks pretty good so just go ahead and build that and now if i pop b and open my builder brush actually i want to bring this down right there i'm trying to make a force field around this object right here so i'm just gonna center it in all my hey might as well move my stacked mesh if i need to and right there so this volume is pretty much surrounding the static mesh i just want to get somewhere in the center just so i can demonstrate so now we have to go ahead and add a blocking volume so if you go ahead and select your builder brush and right click on your volumes just go ahead and hit blocking volume and it's going to add a blocking volume so if we go ahead and slide up our builder brush or we can just go ahead and hit b to delete it or excuse me hide it rather then we can see that we now have a blocking volume around the static mesh so you're saying all right so does this block everything or only vehicles or you know does it block bullets well in order to tell it what we want it to block go ahead and select it and hit f4 this is going to bring up the properties for that blocking volume now under collision this is where we tell it what we want it to block now no collision is worthless because if it was no collision it basically we wouldn't have even had to make a collision whatsoever or volume so this is pretty much means anything can get through it block all blocks everything well i can't explain it better than that so the two most common volumes you probably want to use or excuse me types of collision is block all which means nothing can get through it and for this example i'm going to go ahead and just choose block all but weapons so what that means is whenever we play our level our character is going to bump into it and not be able to get through it but it can shoot through if it wants to so let me go ahead and hit play from here and i'll show you guys and let me go ahead and rebuild my lighting since i didn't move that static mesh so i guess that now i can i was getting caught now so that's a nice little break from that but yeah like i said i can't teach you all these volumes yet because i need to teach you guys the concepts and once i'm done teaching the concepts the volumes will just make sense to you so let me go ahead and hit play from here and now my static mesh is lit up and remember we have an invisible force field around the static mesh now which if we try to run into it look my user is stopping right there he can't get to that static mesh because that their invisible box is behind it or excuse me around it so now let me go ahead and try to run it from this side not happening haas so what i can do is since i set up block all but weapons i can shoot through it and check it out my weapon still hits it and leaves a mark right on the aesthetic mesh however it does block my user from getting to it so again this isn't really useful and you probably wouldn't set up a volume they actually did this because by the way static meshes already have collision built into them by default so i just want to explain you guys what a blocking volume was because you know it's probably the most common type of volume that we're gonna be using i just mumble that that you're gonna be using so i thought i'd get that out of the way but anyways that's all i have for you guys for this tutorial thank you guys so much for watching and thank you guys for completing my udk beginner series so from now what you need to do is move on to my udk intermediate series to get all the rest of my videos so again one last time thank you guys for watching and i trust me we are nowhere near done learning the udk we have so much to look forward to so uh with that being said i guess i'll see you guys in next series
