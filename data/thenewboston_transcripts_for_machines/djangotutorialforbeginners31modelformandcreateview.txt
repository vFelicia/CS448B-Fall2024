alright guys so now that we made a form using model forms what we need to do now is we actually need to make a template using HTML so we have somewhere to plug it into so this is actually pretty important the way that you name it whenever you're using model forms the default name actually let me go ahead and rightclick and make a new HTML file again make sure it's in templates and then your apps directory which should be music or whatever your app name is it needs to be the model name underscore form in the model name is in lower case so in this case I am making a form for creating new albums so I'm just going to album underscore form whenever we make a form for making new songs it's going to be song underscore form but again it's whatever the name of your model is all in lowercase that I say under case I don't think I did if I did that would be embarrassing underscore form so that's the default file that it's going to look at and that is why if you're looking through reviews in like alright where did I specify the template name we didn't because we don't need to pretty cool and actually let me go ahead and pause my video and make the core bootstrap shell alright so I just made an empty panel in other words we're just going to have a white square and then my form is going to go right in here but again it doesn't really matter how you design your page this is just my personal preference just to make it easy so inside here that's where we start making our form so the class again this is just styling I'm going to put form horizontal and then for action you set this equal to nothing because it's going to be redirected to the same view and that word is where it gets handled behind the scenes now the method is going to be equal to post and right now what we're doing is whenever the user adds a new album we just say hey go ahead and paste in some URL of the album cover but later on we're actually going to let them upload a file so even though we don't need this now I'm going to set this equal to multipart form data and that just making sure that we can handle whatever files they upload in the forum whenever we need it later on so now I just want to add that token that crosssite request forgery token this is just for common security practices and let's go ahead and think about this so whenever Django generates these forms for us what it does is it gives us some pieces of information so for each model that we generated from it's going to give us a label which basically says artist album title genre or logo so it does that and another thing it does for each one is it gives us that form field so all of these right here are just going to be inputs so it's pretty much it's going to give us a huge dictionary of labels and inputs so what we could do is we could go through and in this form handle each one so okay I want to make a for group and I want to put the label to the left and the input to the right and then I'm gonna do it for the other one make sure it's lined up and then do it to the right and then later on whenever we make another form have to do it again and again and again and again but that again it breaks the number one rule of software development never repeat yourself so instead the proper way to handle these is even though you can do it the long way if you want it's better to make a generic form template and then just include it so what I'm going to do right here is even though we don't have this file carry to get go ahead and write include also music form templates HTML so all this file is going to be and you see it's highlighted in yellow says um you didn't make this yet but we will in just a second this is just going to be a simple template for how we want our labels and the form fields to be laid out and I'm just going to lay them out left and right right next to each other like a nice grid or table but you can do whatever you want all right so we have all the fields all the places that the user can type in the information so the last thing that we need to put in here is a button what am i clicking on take easy bunky all right so I'll actually do it this way so guys got a little preview of what's to come so the class is just a forum group and again this is just how bootstrap stuff and all right now I just want to make a div in here because I need to offset it so class small offset to that means I'm not going to take up the first two areas because that's generally where the label is going to be and cold small ten so in bootstrap you always need to fill up ten columns so that gives me that and now I'm just going to add a button here so button words Smiths and it'll be submit button and now I just need to style it fun we had success re so I want to make it green so that's what I did right there all right so now we need to make this file right here so I'm going to right click new HTML file form template garroted this shiz so again whenever Django generates these forms for you they're going to give you each field one by one so in this model right here they're just basically a whole bunch of input areas but they can also be maybe a dropdown or whenever you let the user upload files it can be a little button that says choose a file whatever so it comes in list called forms and we're just going to name each one field so for filled in form and let me just end my loop so I don't forget and for so now you can loop through these and style them however you want so for each one in bootstrap I'm just going to put mine in a form group and I'll just say this so whenever they have an error like let's say they didn't fill out the artist name then I'm going to want that error message to appear right above the input so they know you know what feel they're getting an error message on so I'm actually going to do this copy this and put my error message right there now you can style this however you want I'm just going to make it tiny in red so span class just say a text danger which makes it red and also small and all right that'll be good enough all right so the name of this is whatever you name your object I named mine field error so hopefully this will never even display if they never have any errors for some reason but now I can start making the part that is always going to display and the first thing is label in other words to the left is just going to say artist and then it's going to have an input box then it's going to say album title for the label and then it's going to have an input area so let me just make this label right now and I'll just name it class control label and also Col small too so this is going to be two columns wide and now for the actual label is the label tag so that's the actual text what essentially the label is and now for the actual inputs this is the easy part with the class just write coal smell 10 and field so this is going to be the actual input area or dropdown or whatever so there you go that is looking good and alright this is looking good now the last thing we need to do is actually add a link to make sure that the user has some way of getting to this form so since we have this add album button on every single page that is in our base template so if we scroll down to write here add album this is this button right here now we can make a link and what did we name that album ad arranged is properly and alright so the link for this is URL music album ad everything should be good to go now and check it out just refresh this to make sure our link updates now I'm going to go ahead and click add album and look at that me so the cell what I was talking about with the label right here and this is the actual field now just I'm going to hit submit right now and notice that it's going to generate an error and then this field is required you see how it's small in a red that is what I was referencing right here so I needed it to appear above the actual field so that's why I offset it by 2 and there you go and of course you may want to style this up looks a little bit better you know remove these list item decorators or decorations whatever they're called and there you go so go ahead and click this again and let's actually fill this bad boy out so let me go ahead and just get a picture what can be my album cover how about me standing by the lake so the artist of this album is of course Bucky and I'll just name it the lake genre rap of course an album logo is that right there just some URL of an image I'm going to hit submit and boom look at that so it redirects you to the details page and remember we already plugged in by getting the primary key of this object and now whenever I look at albums again I now have a new album boom roasted look at that and of course if I want to add another one just click this and how awesome is that so that is the basics of using model forms it makes it a whole lot easier because we didn't need to generate any of this form HTML it does simple data validation and also took care of adding it to the dead base all for us pretty sweet
