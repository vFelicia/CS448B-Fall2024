So today we're talking about arcs and angles of a circle so first there are three types of arcs we have a what's called a semicircle which is Arc P RH and you have to go in the order of points so you start with P you go to R you go to H and that's half a rotation of a circle which is equal to 180° so a semicircle is always equal to 180° an arc of 180° that's not the length of it length of it that's just how how this Arc is a major arc is greater than half a rotation so if I go to P to H to m see how this Arc is bigger than this semicircle Arc so that's called a major arc and a minor Arc and a minor Arc is less than half a rotation so it's less than 180° so this Arc we have right here would be Arc CH or you can do HC it doesn't matter so this Arc right here Which is less than a semicircle Arc so now we have what's called a central angle and a central angle has its vertex at the center of a circle and its measure is equal to the measure of its minor Arc so if this angle equals 50° then this Arc right here and it's a minor Arc because it's um less than half a rotation so the measure of Arc l k is 50° now that only works with central angles so don't try and use that principle for any other kind of angle only a central angle so now we're going to find the indicated measures so they want the measure of Arc C D or DC so since we know we know that b is the center of the circle so this angle DBC is a central angle so that means this Arc is equal to the measure of the central angle so Arc DC is equal to 51° now they want the measure of DB which is this Arc right here now if you think about it this line right here DB is the diameter of the circle so if I go from D all the way to the other side of the circle on B I've completed half of rotation so this um Arc right here is a semicircle so that means its measure has to be 180° now they want me to find this part just this section of the arc Arc CB well if you remember those rules we had about segments where you could add the parts to find the total or subtract one of the parts to find the other part well we can do the same thing here since this Big Arc C DB is 180° and this smaller Arc right here is 51° we can minus 51° from 80° to find out what just this Arc equals so we're just going to call that X so 180° minus 51° is 129 degrees so the Arc Length of CB or the Arc of CB is 129 degrees now they want this Arc right here a well if you look c b c is a DBC is a central angle a b oh that should have been Point e right there let me just change that I had two point B's for a second okay so we want so DBC is a central angle and ab e is a central angle so that means that this Arc is equal to this angle well if you look at these two angles right here they are vertical angles and if you remember our rule about vertical angles they have the same measure so the measure of this angle is 51° now because this is a central angle that must mean that the measure of AE is also 51° now they want us to find the measure of Da so we're going to do the same thing we did to find the measure of C e so da is part of this Big Arc de which is equal to 180° so we can take 180° minus this piece right here which is 51° and we'll get 129° equals x which makes sense if you think about it because these two angles right here are also vertical angles so they have to have the same measure so that's all we're going to do with arcs and angles today but make sure you come back when we talk about other kinds of angles of a circle
