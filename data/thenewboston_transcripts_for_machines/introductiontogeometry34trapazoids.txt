okay so today we're going to talk about trapezoids and the trapezoid is a quadrilateral which just means that it has four sides so it's a quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides right here and right here and these pair of parallel sides are called the bases so this is base one and this is base two and exactly two pairs of consecutive angles that are supplementary so one and two are supplementary and three and four are supplementary but one and three and two and four are not supplementary so like i said that the bases the parallel sides are called the bases and the nonparallel sides are called legs so these two right here are legs and in an isoscele trapezoid these legs are congruent but that's only in an isosceles trapezoid so we have tropid trapezoid a b c d name the bases so like we said the bases are the parallel sides so these two sides are parallel so that means that c d and a b are the bases of this trapezoid if the measure of angle b equals 90 degrees what is the measure of angle c well we said that these two we said that there can only be two pairs of congruent or sorry there can only be two pairs of supplementary angles so for this particular triangle these two and these two are supplementary so to solve x we get we set x plus 90 equals 180. if you subtract the 90 over you get x equals 90. if d is a hundred and two what's the measure of a so y plus a 102 equals 180 subtract that over and you get 98. sorry you get 78. so if ad is equal to 5 cb has to equal well this is an isosceles trapezoid because the legs are congruent so if the legs are congruent that means they have equal length so if 80 equals 5 then cb also has to equal 5. if the measure so if the measure of angle d equals the measure of angle c and the measure so that means that these two angles are congruent and the measure of angle a is 45 degrees what's the measure of angle what's the measure of angle c so we know these two are congruent and these two angles have to be supplementary so we're going to call this we're just going to call this d so d plus 45 equals 180 so you subtract that 45 over you get d equals 130 so that means c also equal 135 degrees if the measure of the measure of angle a plus the measure of angle who equals 80. well we did we just did that right here so the measure of angle d dc is parallel to this line right underneath it a b because these two lines will never intersect so now we have true or false so there exists a trapezoid with three congruent sides well say we have this trapezoid we're just going to call this trapezoid f and it's an isosceles trapezoid so these two sides are the same length well all four sides couldn't be the same length because then it would be a square not a trapezoid but this side could equal the length of of the legs and it'd still be a trapezoid so that is true the bases of an isosceles trapezoid are congruent well we just answered that it's the legs that are congruent so that is false so that's all we have on trapezoids but make sure you come watch the next lesson where we're going to talk about midpoints and the median of a trapezoid
