hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial from the new Boston in the last video we looked at removing classes and we use the toggle event handler to actually add and then remove a class simultaneously however we actually have an attribute called toggle class which will remove this functionality altogether I use this example previously because I know it's something that is popularly used to toggle an element so when you click for example an image you might want to highlight that image or you might want to add a border around it for example our current page looks like this we have some text when we click on it we add the highlight and bold attributes that are found in our style CSS file which we've obviously included in our page as well as our class J s however we can remove the need for this toggle event handler all together so let's go ahead and get rid of this altogether we can then just reference the some text span so let's say hash some text and we can actually then bind the toggle class attribute on to this and again with toggle class you can apply an unlimited amount of classes so at the moment we have highlight and bold so let's go ahead and in here write highlight and bold and now when we return to our page you can see that we have oh it's not working okay so we need to add an event handler for this sorry that's me thinking this was way too simple let's go ahead and add an event handler for when we click on some text so some text click we need to add a function as we've seen before and then this can just be in here so when we click on the text and the span we will toggle the highlight and bold classes that are found in our style CSS file so now when we click on it we get exactly the same effect without actually having to use the toggle event handler so with the toggle class attribute we're now going to go ahead and look at a slightly more interesting example and we're actually going to create an input field on our main page so this is going to be type of text and let's go ahead and well we don't really need to supply anything else but we do need to supply an ID for this so I'm just going to call this an input ok so now that we have this input field let's go and refresh our browser you can see that we've just got an input field now what I want to happen is when I click on this I want the background color to change inside of this field and we're going to use the toggle class functionality to do this the attribute in jQuery so inside class Jas we need to reference the first of all the focus in and out of this input field so let's go ahead and say let's go ahead and say referencing this field which I've called input we're going to say input focus so we're going to use the focus event handler instead of here we can go ahead then and add in our toggle so I'm going to say hash input dot toggle clasp and then we want to choose a class so we'll choose the well we'll say background color yellow like that because that's going to work for our text field so we've got background color yellow and then that's highlight so toggle class highlight and let's go back to our browser when we click inside of here you can see that highlights when we move away however it doesn't you can notice that it's just every time we click inside of it so we could then expand on this code so when we blur away from it then we actually toggle the class again however this is a quick demonstration of toggle class and how you can combine the add class and remove class based on a single action just by using the toggle class attribute
