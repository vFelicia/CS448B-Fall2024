hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked with another video for the new boss turn in this tutorial we're going to be looking at jquery ajax requests but we're also then going to look at how to handle different status codes for example a 404 page not found error so just to start with we have a simple button in our page with the idea button and we have a div area with the ID of content so when our page it looks like this this load button is then going to load a page onto our into our div and that is page to HTML and there's just some content written in here Ajax Doge is is going to handle this request for us I've already set up a selector for the button and an on click event or a click event and that will handle the clicking of the button will now go ahead and create the Ajax request but then just put these status code in there as well so it's dollar sign Ajax and then in brackets we create our our curly brackets in rounded parentheses we create curly brackets now I'm going to specify a URL and this is going to be page dot HTML and I'm going to come and separate that with success and this is going to be a function and the function contents is going to make use of the data that's returned from this from this page ie the content which will be some content and then what we're going to do is we're going to apply this to the div just here so the Content ID div so I'm going to I'm going to select that div which is called content and then I'm going to apply the HTML code to there or in this case it's just plain text ok so let's go ahead and run this and see what result we get we taking the data from page to HTML and applying it to the content div so everything should work ok so you can see some content ok so now what happens if we were to change this so it didn't exist so page wonder HTM let's refresh click load you'll see that nothing happens so what we can actually do is we can use the status code property I guess of age of this Ajax request and actually return errors based on the status code that's returned so all we need to do is write status code so with a capital C and then after this we need more square brackets and I'll bring this down and go ahead and indent that in a bit now we're going to say 404 so this is the error that we that we are looking out for and if we do have a 404 error we create a new function here with the block and then we can do something depending on whether the pages and found or not for example so in that case I'm going to place some data into the content con let's just spell that quickly content dot HTML I'm going to say just a page not found so what's happening now is we're attempting to open page to HTML we're checking for a status code if we have a status code 404 we're creating a function and the contents of that function is to apply the text page not found in fact we can go ahead and change this to text the text page not found in to the content div here otherwise if we have a success we can we're returning this data which is the contents of page to HTML and applying that to the contents div so let's go ahead and save that out we've automatically now got page to HTML back up remove the 1 so that successfully loads or should successfully load our page let's go ahead and refresh this page okay so for some reason it doesn't seem to be loading in okay so yeah if we just place a comma after this two comma separate that from the success then that should now work so a slight error there on my part so click load and some content is loaded now we can go ahead and change page to page one now this page is not going to be found so we're going to return a 404 status code error and then therefore we're going to play some text page not found inside of our content div let's go ahead and refresh and try that so click load page not found so you can add more status codes down here if you'd like so what you can do is go ahead and comment separate these as well so where any other status code that you'd like to display for example I'll just put zero zero zero to demonstrate it you then go ahead and create a new function and then you would use exactly the same code that we've just used there so you can handle different status codes in different ways so this is extremely useful if you want to relay back to your user that a particular page that is trying to be accessed can't be found as well as other error codes that might relate to more server related errors
