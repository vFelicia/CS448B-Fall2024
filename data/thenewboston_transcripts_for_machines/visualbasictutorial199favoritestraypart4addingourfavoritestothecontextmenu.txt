hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be working more on our favorites viewer for the tray so before we get started I just want to give full credit to the authors of beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 uh by theoren Willis and Brian Newsome uh they created this app and I'm using it to teach you guys um how to make it and some concepts with Visual Basic okay so now what we need to do after we've created our favorite and we've scanned through the favorites um and sort it in the collection that is inside of this favorites object and we created a context menu which would be like this whole menu right here so we created this and the context menu so now we need to process each favorite so we can use a for each Loop so for each object web favorite as web favorite and what we need to do is when need to type internet favorites. web favorite and then we're going to do in favorites. favorites collection so for each of the web favorite objects that are in the collection that is stored in this favorite class um what we want to do is we want we want to add those to the menu so we will declare object item as a new web favorite me menu item so this is going to create an item with the name name um and it will allow us to click on that to open the URL so for the Constructor we're going to use object web favorite because it takes a a web favorite so it's going to use our object web favorite that is in the list of our favorites um favorite uh object so it's it's going to go through each of the um web favorites in this collection and it's going to create a new menu item based on the web favorite that it's given so what do we want to do with that menu item well we want to add it to the context menu so we'll do object menu items or object menu do menu items do add and we'll add object item so what this is doing is it uses our object menu object which is a context menu and it's going to add a menu item to it so menu items. add so we're telling you we're going to add an item and we want we want to add object item so object item is a web favorite menu item and it uses the web favorite that is in the collection of scan favorites now it's going to do this for each of those favorites so each time it's going to add it with the new favorite um the new menu item based on each favorite in the list so now what we need to do is we need to separate it um from the exit so we'll just type object menu. menu items. add and when we add this right here it's going to add a separator um in between our each of our favorites right here and then there's nothing under it so what we need to do is we need to add that so we'll type object menu. menu items. add and we want to create a new instance of our exit menu item so instead of having to create a whole new object for exit menu item um even though we're only going to be using it once we can just skip declaring it and we can just create a new exit menu item inside the arguments of the menu items now whenever we add a menu item to a context menu we have to give it something that inherits from menu item or else it will not work so we'll come back to form 1vb and underneath this we need to um tell our tray icon to use this context menu so that when it's right clicked it's going to use um the menu so we'll just say icon notify do context menu is going to be equal to our object menu and so let's create a Bine and we'll call it Bine load called and we'll set it equal to True right here now you can see we get an error because cuz that's not declared yet so we'll come up here and we'll just say private booing load called as boine and we'll set it equal to false so basically what this does is it's going to be equal to false and then once all of these processes are done it's going to set it equal to true and then we'll just type me. hiide so it'll hide the form and it'll only show the icon so we'll come down here to this um form one visible change and what we'll do is we'll only have it change to visible equal to to false um if all of this has already processed so if button load I mean if Boolean load called um is equal to false then we'll just um get out of the sub so if ban load called ah is equal to false then we don't want to change anything so we'll just type exit sub now in the book it says to type return and that will also work the same way so return and exit sub will both um get us out of the sub and it won't um run any of this code right here so we'll just use return right there so now let's go ahead and and we will run our program and you can't see anything but if we come down here and let's look at my tray you can see that we have our favorites icon it says right click for favorites so if I write click you can see we have Gmail the New Boston and YouTube and this little bubble right here is from my tutorial timer that I created for each of these so we can open one of these so let's open the New Boston you can see here that it opens it up in my default web browser
