So today we're going to talk about corresponding angles formed by parallel lines and it's going to and these angles are going to help us solve some triangle problems later on so when you have two or more parallel lines right here as you know we denote that with these little arrows that are cut by a transversal which is this line which we're going to call line T corresponding angles are congruent so like this angle of this line and this transversal is congruent to this angle of this second line and this same transversal just like this one right here is congruent to here and the same goes for the angle on this side so this angle is congruent to this angle and this angle is congruent to this angle so knowing that we need to find the measure of angle one and angle two so these are the two parallel lines so their corresponding parts are congruent so like we said before the measure of angle one since angle one is congruent to this angle right here has to be 106 because congruent angles have equal measure and angle two is congruent to this angle right here so angle two has to measure 74° Okay so so our directions are to find the missing angle measurements okay so we want angle one and angle two so these lines are um parallel and these lines are parallel so there's a couple ways we can find out these angle measures we're going to do both of them so first if you look at these two parallel lines this one and this one we'll call this one a this one b and this one's C and this one's D so if you look at this one the these lines are cut by this transversal so that means that corresponding angles have to be congruent so this angle between line on line a and line C is congruent to this angle right here line B on line C so we can find out that the measure of angle 1 is 87° just using that or what we could do is since these two angles are supplementary we could set 93 plus we'll call this x right here equal to 180 and if you subtract that over you find out that this angle rate here equals 87° and since these two parallel lines C and D are cut by this transversal line a that means that this line or this angle is congruent to this angle so one would have to equal 87 as well so those are just two different ways you can do it and you can do the same thing to find the measure of angle two you can look at it as these two lines are parallel and they're cut by this transversal D so this angle has to be congruent to this angle angle so the measure of angle 2 has to equal 93° or like we did with the other one you can say that these two are supplementary so you set 87 plus we'll call this y = to 180 if you subtract it over you get yal 93 and since these two parallel lines C and D are cut by this transversal B this line has to be or this angle has to be congruent with this angle so measure of angle two has to be 93 so either way you do it you'll get the right answer it's just one way might be a little quicker than the other so again we are told to find the missing angle measurements so we're going to start by finding the measure of angle 16 so if you look this line this line a and this line B are parallel and right here they're cut by this transversal G to form angle 16 so this angle has to be congruent to this angle so the measure of angle 16 has to equal 120 so to find the measure of angle 17 we have to do a little something a little different so first we have to find out what the measure of this angle X right here is and then this these two angles are supplementary angles so we can find out the measure of 17 from there so since these two angles are supplementary we can add 120 + x set it equal to 180 subtract the 120 over and we get X is equal to 60 so then these two angles are also supplementary so we set one or sorry 60 + 17 well plus angle 17 is equal to 180 we get angle 17 is equal to 120 and to find 18 you can look at it as these two lines b and a are parallel they're cut by this transversal Z so this angle has to be congruent to this angle so the measure of 18 has to be 120° so we learned about transverse angles today and how they're congruent but next lesson we're going to go into other kinds of angles formed by parallel lines so make sure you come back and watch that
