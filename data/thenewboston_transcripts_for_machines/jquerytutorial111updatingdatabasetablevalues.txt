hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new bustin in this example application we're going to take a look at updating database table values with jQuery and we're going to be using the same methods that we've used with Ajax but in this application we're gonna make it a little easier for you to update multiple fields at one time and I'm going to show you and take you through how you would do this now the one thing I have not done in this tutorial is created some kind of PHP code that will actually retrieve the initial values from our database now let's take a look first of all at the table that we're going to be using I've created a database called jQuery and I have a table called users just in here and we have first of all a user ID which is extremely important because if you are updating users values they will always have a unique ID and this is where you will use or your where clause in your MySQL query in order to update it so for example at the name at the moment the name here is Alex just go ahead and browse and refresh that so we can see so that's Alex this form here and I've given it a just a simple header to make it look a bit more user friendly it's called name now assuming you've created a some code that will actually take the value from here based on the user ID it will input the field data here so Alex would be written in here so that's the first thing that you would have to go ahead and do yourself you'd probably have some kind of system in place if you are updating values to actually retrieve the initial value first however if I were to go ahead and modify this for example add a surname and then click Save you can see that we've now got this your settings have been updated now just before that there was a tiny flicker of a loading message that came up so if you were to say update you know if the user was updating a long a string of data raw or several fields at a time with lots of data in you would have a loading sign come up beforehand and I'll demonstrate this a bit later when we actually create this by using the sleep function in PHP to actually pause the script however we have this confirmation message your settings have been updated let's go back to our table and click browse and you can see that where my name was originally Alex we now have a surname added in as well so this form here has actually updated this value here and that's based on a user ID that I've sort of forced to be set so you'll see you'll see that a bit later on anyway okay so essentially what this is doing is actually just updating the database table value based on the fields that we're going to be adding in here we're just going to be using the name field in this tutorial however obviously once you've completed the tutorial and you're comfortable with it you can go ahead and update multiple fields at a time okay so to begin let's first of all take a look at the files that we're going to be using in this tutorial now the first file is Ajax jeaious if you've looked at my other example applications in this series you'll note that we include this in the page as well as jQuery so we have use of this javascript file all this javascript file is going to do is it's going to take the fields that we've created all the button that we've created and it's actually going to handle this event and you know perform the ajax or the post HTTP request in jQuery settings is the file that we're calling from Ajax in order to actually go ahead and update these values here this value here and init dot PHP is going to start our sessions in PHP so we're going to start the ability to use sessions we're going to set a current session to one the value one remember that corresponds to this here so essentially what we're doing is we're forcing a session to equal one and this is just for the purposes of the tutorial however you'll probably have some kind of registration and login system in place if you don't you can follow along by forcing this value otherwise you can use the session data that you've already already have in place on your website the third thing that this is is going to do is connect our data connect to a MySQL sit there server and then select the jQuery database so the first thing we want to do is go ahead and build the front end of this and this is the page where we have the form field and the button to update so I'm first of all going to create a h3 tag and I'm just gonna give this a name of settings or title of settings I'm then gonna go ahead and create the name label and as well as that the input field as well let's just around these in paragraph tags the idea of this is going to just be name and we also need a button a bit further down so the type is button the value is going to be save and the ID is going to be save underscore button now we also need a span as well which is going to handle the information that's fed back so we need a span element and the idea of this is going to be save underscore status so this will either show the loading text which we're going to talk about a bit later it's either going to show successfully updated or could not update your settings for example if the query fails for any reason
