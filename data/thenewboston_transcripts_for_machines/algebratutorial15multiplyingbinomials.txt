so today we're going to talk about multiplying binomials well a binomial is a twoterm expression and when we multiply binomials we're going to use this method called foiling where we multiply the first two terms of each binomial so x times x plus the outside terms which of each binomial x times negative three plus the inner terms five times x and the last two terms so plus five times negative three and then we multiply each one in the parentheses and then we'll combine our like terms so x squared plus x times negative three negative three x plus five x minus fifteen we can combine these middle terms x squared plus 2 x minus 15 and your binomial or excuse me your trinomial answer that you get for multiplying two binomials are is always going to come in this form where you have the two middle terms combined so you only have one term so now we're just going to do some examples so remember we foil we multiply first outside inside last so the first is 2x times 4x plus outside 2x times 3 plus the inside which is 5 times 4x plus the two last terms three times five so 2x times 4x gives me 8x squared plus 2 times 3 x plus five times four twenty x plus fifteen we're gonna combine these like terms we're gonna get eight x squared plus twenty six x plus 15. we're going to do the same thing for this one this time i'm not going to draw the arrows because i don't have room but just talk through it when while you multiply first which is x times two x plus outside x and three y plus inside times la plus the last so x times 2x is 2x squared plus 3x times y is just 3xy plus 2y times 2x is just 4y x plus 2y times 3y 6y squared now remember i said you'll always be able to combine these terms well if you look this is x y is your variable and why x is your variable now what's the one thing that we always need to remember about multiplication well multiplication is commutative so that means writing 3 x y is the same as writing 3y so those still those are still like terms in the middle so we get 2x squared plus 3 plus 4 is 7 yx plus 6y squared and i could have written this middle term as 7xy it really doesn't matter it's whatever you personally prefer so that's all we're going to do with binomials today but make sure you come back and check out our next lesson which is going to be on multiplying polynomials together
