hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ OnLive gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about multidimensional arrays now the best way for me to explain this is think of a graph and on that graph you have points so let's say you have the point 35 well when you make a multidimensional array it's pretty much a graph so when you reference point 35 you can hold an item there and you can also hold an item at 36 or 37 and it's just a big 2D graph of um different items that you want to store so let's go ahead and make a little demo project and work some with multidimensional arrays so we go ahead and select new project and we will select Windows forms application and we will set the name to um let's just do we'll do 2D arrays and we'll go ahead and click okay and wait for that to load okay so we'll go ahead and Shrink our formula a little bit here and we're going to add a button and two text boxes so let's go over here to to our toolbox we'll select button and where's the text box right here and we'll add another text box okay so we'll just go ahead and Shrink this down a little bit okay so let's go ahead and set the text property for button one to um get array element and we'll make it bigger so it'll all show up and we will set the name to button get element and we'll set the text box one to um text First Dimension and the next one to text third dimens I mean second dimension okay so we'll go ahead and double click on get array element and we will zoom in here now let's come up here and create an array now this isn't going to be any type of array this is going to be a multidimensional array now the way we do this is we can type the word the keyword private then we will type the name of our array so we'll just type um multiarray and now inside of our parentheses we're going to specify how many dimensions it has now we can do this by just typing two and comma two and now we have to specify a type so we'll just do string okay so what this means is that the array is going to have is going to be two long and two down so picture a grid and um picture it three across and three down so a square of three across and three down because this starts with zero so it Go 012 across uh 012 and 012 so our uh bottom right hand corner corner of that would be 22 and the top would be 0 0 so let's go ahead and this might be a little confusing to you let's go ahead and assign some values for this so we will type multiarray and we will assign 0 0 and we will set that equal to hello or let's do um position 0 0 and we will do that for some of the other spots in the array so we'll do 0 one and then we will set the text to position 01 and we'll do that one more time and let's just copy this okay so now what we want to do is we want to show whichever one they've picked in a message box so they will type the let's say this is the X length um because we're looking at a grid so this right here would be X and then this right here would be Y and if you have a threedimensional array you could use the z um the Z line but we aren't doing that in this tutorial so this is the X position and this is the Y position and unlike a normal grid which starts in the uh in the middle let's say you have like a a cross um in Visual Basic it's just like a big Square so in Visual Basic it starts from let's say the top right hand corner so it would start up here and it would go like let's say three across and then two down instead of starting in the middle so let's go ahead and get what the user has typed in so we'll type messagebox do show and let's come up here and store what they typed in a couple variables first so dim Exposition as integer and we will set that equal to uh C type so we're going to convert what they got we'll type text first dimension. text and then we will convert that to an integer type so then we'll declare y position as integer and we will convert the text second dimension. text to an integer okay so now we're going to go ahead and show the position so we'll type message box show multiarray and then we will type X position and Y position so what this is going to do is it's going to get the string at um whatever they typed in for x and whatever they typed in for y now currently we only have three possible answers so let's go ahead and run that and see what happens so we will do Zer and one and get a right element we get position 01 and we can do 02 and we get position 02 so go ahead make some multidimensional arrays um and you can fill in each of the items in the array so if I were to um fill in the next part of the array I would do something like 1 Z and then 1 one and then one two and then uh two 0 2 1 2 two so go ahead you can make that and set the values for it and uh make a little program that lets you type in the X pos position and the Y position so that you can get whatever is stored at that um and then once you've practiced a little bit with multidimensional arrays go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
