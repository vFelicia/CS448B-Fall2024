so 40% less than it originally was and I guess this is just an aesthetic choice but it makes it perhaps look a bit better when you've when you're actually dragging something and something is applied to the drag so when we're dragging something we know which item we're dragging okay so that's it for the options for now what we're going to do now is create another list and actually connect this list with it so let's go ahead and copy this unordered list and come down and paste it just in here and I'm just going to call this places instead of names and I'm going to type the names of a few places okay so now that we've got this list let's just go ahead and look at that in our browser you can see that we've got a list here and we're not unable to sort it obviously because we haven't allowed it to be sorted however this list is still available to be sorted now what we can actually do is inside the selector we can use a comma to actually specify another list we want to be sortable so in this case it's places so when we refresh we can actually sort this list here as well sorry places that was a spelling mistake so now we can actually sort this list as well as this one however you'll notice that we can't actually drag this down into this list because it doesn't connect with it so if for some reason you wanted to connect two different lists for example lists of options that have been generated from the database or any other lists and you wanted to actually allow them to interact with each other for example you might have two different lists and like this and you might want to associate particular elements with the other list you can use the connect with option in here now the connect with option takes as many different elements as you like and we specify these elements like so so for example if we wanted as we've selected names and places we can't really say that we want to connect this just with names because connecting their names with names and places with names so places will be connected with names but names won't be connected with places so you can see that we'll have this problem we can't drag this into here but we can drag this into here so now what we want to do is just go ahead and select places as well and that allows us to interchange items from each list so we can move things around and essentially what I've done here is just switch the contents of the list around so that's how we use connect with okay so the last thing we're going to take a look at is the events I'm only going to just demonstrate one event and that is update the reason for this is that update is probably the most useful event in terms of if you wanted to perhaps store a list in order that it's been moved around in in a database for example a database table there are quite a few events for this sortable interaction however I'm just going to take a look at update how we implement update how we can display data from this and then we're going to go ahead and end the tutorial but then afterwards go ahead to the jQuery documentation and you'll find a list of other events that might apply to you so I'm going to come and separate this and just down here I'm going to go ahead and use and set the update event and this is going to be equal to a function now inside this function is what's going to happen when the event has taken place so I'm going to say sorted now update will actually only update is the event that essentially happens when we move something then we let go and then when the when the element is updated so when the list has been updated so if we refresh the page you can see that as I move this just below here as soon as that's sorted we get this alert box sorted now this is the reason I'm looking into the update option update event and showing you this only for the simple fact that if you wanted to sort a list and then store the list the order that it's been stored in this will be the event you would use there are other events such as when the dragging dragging of each element starts etc but we're not going to be taking a look at them just yet okay so now that we've got this update function working we're not going to alert but what we're going to do is we're going to grab the contents of the div that spell these lists that's just been updated and we're going to display it just down here in a div so inside index dot PHP I'm just going to come down here and I'm going to create a div here and I'm going to call this sort status so now inside you ijs we're going to grab the contents of the list that we've just sorted into for example if I was to move that to there this list has now been updated so we can we can display the contents of this list if I was to move this here then we can display the contents of this list so we can update each list accordingly so let's go ahead and undo this so I'm going to take content is equal to and I'm going to select this dot text now this dot text is going to take the current text that's inside of here minus the tags or the HTML elements themselves so now what we can do is go ahead and apply this to the sort status div so store status text content so now what we're going to do is we're going to just go ahead and drag something you can see that now we've got Billy Alex and Ashley which is the order that this particular list is in and then again if I was to move that up there it would be the same it would update it if I was to move an item down here we would then have Billy London and Sheffield so we're essentially just returning the list in its text format depending on which list we've commonly dragged into so this is a particularly brief overview of the sortable interaction in jQuery however it's not mainly used in terms of actually sorting lists it's more like menu options for example if we had these li elements instead and didn't have an unordered list these might be divs for for example and menu options down a page or foreign categories it could be absolutely anything and you could use this sort status this sort sortable interaction to actually sort particular lists you could also then in here once the update has been complete update a database with the order that the user has placed these lists in I'm not going to be covering in this tutorial because I've just taken a basic look at some of the options and one of the events available to sortable however if you do need any more information the jQuery library has everything you might need so if you are wondering how you might do a particular particular thing with this you can go ahead and look that up but for now this is just a basic overview of sortable list interaction in jQuery
