so let's just get rid of style.css I went in for actual fatiah we could could go ahead and use that so star dot CSS um okay so what we want to do is we want the user to be able to click on in fact no we won't make it animated because that's to sort of far away from the tutorial what we'll do is we just want to make the first element here bold so for example what we could do here is we could say dot menu down sorry no we use a selector I mean and we could say inside menu dot first dot add Clark or sorry doc find Li dot first so the first Li in this list which is user and then we could say dot add class bold and inside star dot CSS we can go ahead and add that class or create that class and that will be font weight field sorry not null bold so now when we refresh you can see that the first element is bold and now what we could go ahead and do is say let's just say dot next all dot hi it okay so what we've done now is I think this should work with this combination but what we've done is we've from the menu found the first li sort of in the wrong order if you know what I mean so we're finding the Li the first one we're adding the class bold which we've already seen has created it bold and now we're using next all and hiding everything after that particular class so now you can see that all of the different options are hidden in actual fact let's go ahead and make this animated we might as well let's just say we'll keep that there let's just say dot menu and then we'll say dot find Li in actual fact no we can go ahead and append this on to here I'm going to say dot click and then create a function inside of here okay so let me just go ahead and explain for those of you that you know so struggling with this which I can understand we're selecting the first menu with finding the Li and we've seen that we've made that bold by adding the class bold that we created inside star dot CSS within appending on a click event handler which is going to do something when we click it for example at the moment alert you clicked me and then everything else after that we're going to hide so let's go ahead and click that it says you clicked me so now once we've clicked it I want to go ahead and I want to say this dot find Li dot o we could say first and then dot next all dot show don't remember or don't forget the brackets let's see if that works when we click it no it's not so click function this dot find also this dot next all yeah there we go okay so let me just go let me just change this here to toggle and that should now allow us to yet hide and show this menu okay so let me just run through it and I'll sort of explain why I've done this if for example you wanted your users for example on a website that you or template that you've created you might have wanted them to actually go ahead and allow them to create their own simple menus now in the case that your user or the persons are viewing your page can see UL class equals menu they automatically know that this is a menu now they might see that the first one I mean it's slightly tricky to see but the first one says user so by viewing the page you can automatically assume now that this is the menu title and then anything after it so you know when we go ahead and add some more elements on or some more Li elements on so for example something else now we know that when we click we just you know gain these menu items on and we can click this and click it again to get rid of it I guess we could even go ahead and just add on an href that goes to nothing just to make it look a bit more like a menu item and it will essentially what we're doing now is we're finding Li which we've talked about the first one we'll add in class to bold and but we're also then appending on an event handler for the click event so once this is clicked everything else after this ie the first menu item this being this here will be shown or but will be toggled the reason I use toggle is because if I was to you show up I would have had to then go ahead and create something else you know highlight toggle just does it for you and then next door dot hide now this is the initial stage of when we come into the page so if we were to get rid of this we would get the same effect but the settings would just be shown initially so obviously these two on the end just depend you could even change that to show but really it's a waste of code having it in if you you know want them to be hidden or shown so you know that's something I've sort of gone over over a bit on this but that's something that you could bear in mind with this first and next all and this first all as well so you can go back and say first or but you know the next nextdoor first first or find or all sort of useful things that can be tied in together and you can see we've created a nice little menu here and this could even be something you know that's been really nicely styled and it could be you know a nice menu at the top you can either either change that it sorry even change this to something like and then when we hover over it we get the menu items come out again so you're thinking sort of dropdown menus at the top of a page so you know using these in combination are really you know effective and we've done this with you know three lines of code which you know is pretty impressive actually so just by creating this li we've demonstrated how we can use next nextdoor first and first or we've also used toggle in here and we've also used find to help us find the element that we want to apply this to so a nice example pretty straightforward and a lot here that could be put into practice
