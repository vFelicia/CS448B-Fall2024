so today we're gonna focus on solving equations with variable terms on both sides so what we're always gonna do first is collect our like terms and then we're gonna after we do that we're going to solve our equation so first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna collect all of our X's together and then all of our numbers together so for X and then remember how we solve equations we would subtract this from both sides so for X minus X is 3x and then I'm going to move this six over so I'm going to plus 6 on the side and plus 6 on this side so we get 3x is equal to 15 and now that we've collected our terms we're gonna solve this just like any other equation by dividing by 3 and getting x equals 5 ok so let's do some more examples so remember the property we use when we have something written like this we're always gonna do this first before we collect our like terms so 2 times negative 3a gives me negative 6a plus 2 times 5 which is 10 is equal to negative 4 times 9 which is negative 36 minus 4 times 4 16 I mean mistake this should this is an a not a nine so this should say negative for a so now we're gonna collect our terms together so I'm gonna move this six this way and this 16 this way so I'm going to plus 6a to both sides and I get 10 8 I'm going to plus 16 to both sides and then when I get 26 is equal to 10 a oh sorry that was a negative so this should say negative 4a plus 6a which is 2a divide both sides by 2 and we get a is equal to 13 now we're gonna do the same thing down here distribute this 2 and 2x minus 6 is equal to X minus 1 plus 7 we can drop these bars or these parenthesis because we're gonna collect all of our like terms anyway so we're gonna subtract this x over we get X minus 6 equals negative 1 plus 7 we're gonna add 6 over get X is equal to negative 1 plus 7 which is positive 6 plus 6 which is 12 so now we have fractions and you can do this a couple different ways but I think the easiest way is to multiply your fraction in and reduce so for this we would take one one six times 12 which is 12 divided by 6 minus 6 times 1/6 which is divided by 6 is equal to 5x plus 20 so 12 divided by 6 is 2 minus X is equal to 5x plus 20 so I'm gonna bring the X's over here and the constants over here I'm gonna subtract 5x from both sides and I get negative 6x is equal to subtract 2 from both sides it's equal to 18 divided by negative 6 and I get X is equal to negative 3 we have one more problem and we're gonna do it the same way 6 divided by 3 times y minus 9 divided by 3 is equal to negative 2y plus 13 6 divided by 3 is 2 2y minus 9 divided by 3 which is 3 it was negative 2y plus 13 I'm gonna add 2y to both sides get 4y is equal to add 3 to both sides 16 y is equal to 4 now if you weren't being careful and you didn't want your sign right here you would have subtracted 2y from both sides and then you would have ended up cancelling out your Y so you should always be left with a y if not that means you probably made addition mistake so you should go back and check that so that's all we're gonna do with solving equations today make sure here you come back when we talk about using equations to solve word problems
