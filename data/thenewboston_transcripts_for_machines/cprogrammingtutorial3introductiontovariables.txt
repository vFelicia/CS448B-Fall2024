what is going on everybody welcome back to your third C++ tutorial and in this tutorial what we're going to be covering is something called variables now variables are extremely important in C++ every single program we're going to be building is going to have variables in it so you know we obviously need to know how to use them and what they are so let's go ahead and revisit the history of variables so let's travel back to let's say 5th grade math class when we first learn about variables now what variable is is pretty much a placeholder for something else it's something that you you know can change if you need to that's probably why they call it a variable and like I said it takes the place of something else so let me go ahead and type something and by the way this isn't code or anything I'm just typing this uh to show you guys an example so if your fifth grade teacher went ahead and wrote on the board x equals ham and then under it she wrote I like X then you knew she was trying to say I like ham because all you do is you take ham and you plug it in for X now if you change ham to Oreos like my math is you're loved she was huge and now same sentence I like X now it can mean something totally different I like Oreos so that pretty much is what a variable is it's something that you can use to store something else pretty useful but how would this be useful in computer programming well let's go ahead and start talking about that now so there is my little you know background history lesson of variables and my fifth grade math class now let's go ahead and start typing some code whenever we create a variable what we have to do first is write something called the Declaration now what the declaration does is it says first of all what's the name of your variable and what type of data are you going to be storing in it well you write the type of data first and we're going to go ahead and write int now what it is short for it is integer and in case you can't remember this is whole numbers like 34 16 1 it can even be 0 it can be any whole number but it can't have a fraction it can't be like sixteen point two or eighteen point one seven eight it has to be a whole number so that's what it is now go ahead and name your variable anything you want I'm going to name mine you know X looks good and go ahead and add a semicolon BAM that's the declaration statement that's all you need now the second part of creating a variable is you need to make an assignment statement you need to take a value and assign it to this variable so let's go ahead and hit X and your assignment operator is equals x equals and go ahead and write any integer number I'm going to write 23 because that's my age so now what we have right here is the declaration statement in the assignment statement and now we have a variable called X and it's equal to 23 so now whenever we use X in our program instead of just printing out X it's going to print out 23 pretty cool long so let's go ahead and do that right now so see out let's make a short little program Bucky is and out of space and now check this out instead of using quotation marks like this and writing a word in between just go ahead and write X whenever you use variables they can't be in between quotation marks because if you do this then it's going to print out the letter X so go ahead and get rid of those quotation marks and just hit X so now our program is going to read a Bucky is 23 and let's just add one more line years old to finish up the program and now actually let me just saw n that line which is like hitting the return key and let me check for errors real quick looks good compiling around this baby and check this out it says Bucky is and instead of writing x it plugged in the value we wanted for X this little thing popped away 23 years old so how awesome is that we finally learn how to use variables and what the program did is automatically substituted that value for the variable and you know it did the rest of the work for us pretty sweet huh so now let's go ahead and let me teach you guys something else you cool you can do with variables and that's changing the value so what you can do is since they are variables and since the value can change let's go ahead and change that right now go ahead and take that X variable and set it equal to I don't know X minus 10 so what this is going to do is it's going to use arithmetic to take the old x value which was 23 subtract 10 from it which gets the new value of 13 and stores it in X again so now after this line whenever we use X it now has the new value of 13 so let me prove that to you guys um Bucky is now X years old and now let me just go ahead and might as well end that line so it looks good and yeah it looks good so let's go ahead execute pile and run this and check this out the first line it says Bucky is 23 years old we already know that and now we change the variable and set a new value for X so now the program reads Bucky is now 13 years old so again Bucky is 23 years old we change the variable right here so now whenever you're ready code in the program it changed to Bucky is now 13 years old so that is how you can use arithmetic and mathematical functions to change the value of x another thing you can do is simply reassign X put like 34 you don't need to use arithmetic if you go ahead compile and run this it says Bucky is 23 years old Bucky is now 34 years old since we plugged in a new Val you forex but that's just a you know a way of looking at how you can take a variable and assign different values to it and you know it's pretty obvious what went on here so no need to explain so that is basics of variables and I mean this wasn't a very useful program we could have just wrote Bucky is 23 years old or Bucky is 34 years old on one line of text but in the future you're going to see why variables are useful and they're going to be most of the time you're not just going to be able to write everything on one line for example if you want the user to enter their own custom number and print that out then that would be an example of when a variable would be useful so that's all I have for you guys for this story I'm going to quit rambling now but thank you guys for watching hopefully you guys understand a little bit what a variable is we're going to be covering more in the upcoming Orioles anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribing I'll see you guys later
