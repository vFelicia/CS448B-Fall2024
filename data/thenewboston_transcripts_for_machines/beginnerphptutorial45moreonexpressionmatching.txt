and this is we're basically using pattern matching to ensure that it adheres to a certain standard so we can use PR rag match for the P rag match for this is a very very very powerful function like I said I'm not going to go through how we're going to check the patterns if you go over to the php.net manual you'll find plenty of information on how to match specific things whether it be URL so we could take out a hostname from a URL but basically we're basically looking for patterns within strings and doing things with that and there's a variety of ways you can do this returned as an array etc etc so what just for now that's basically the P redred P reg match function let's go ahead and make this a bit more interesting we're going to feed in a string to a function and check if it's got spaces so let's go ahead and create our function and if you haven't already looked at functions don't worry follow it along the example anyway and if you want to go back and look at functions and how they work feel free to do so and come back to the tutorial if you don't understand what's going on so I'm going to create a function called has space and what we're going to do is we're going to return true if this if the specific string has a space and we're going to return false if it doesn't so we're going to feed in the string as an argument up here so now what we're going to do is we're going to say if and we're going to use the pewag match function again to see if we have likely defined before a space inside a specific string now the string comes from the argument that we've just fed in so if this does match then we can return a value of true so we can return true here otherwise we can return false okay so now what we want to do is we want to call this function down here but we want to cool it inside an if statement because we've got our function but as far as it goes at the moment when we refresh we don't have anything we haven't called it so let's create an if statement and say if has space and let's feed in some text so this doesn't have a space if this has space echo has a space else has no spaces okay so ore has at least one space now let's take this string out because I've just thought we it would better defined inside variable here and then we can just feed this variable in through there so let's recap of what we've done we've created a string here cool this doesn't have a space or with a value this doesn't have a space with absolutely no spaces in it and then we're calling our function here and feeding in this argument which is essentially equal to this string here and that's been processed here we're checking on the pre mag a PRP reg match which we've already looked at in the last part in the first part of the tutorial and then if this function returns true which it will if it does have a space then we're going to say a have at least one space or has at least one space otherwise we're going to return false and we're going to say it has no spaces so let's double check and see if this works okay so it says now has no spaces because this string doesn't in fact have any spaces let's just create one space in it and see what happens okay so it now says has at least one space now if we just create all the spaces in it we need let's just put a single quotation mark there and remember to escape single quotation marks when you're using single quotation marks outside of your string data let's refresh and it still says has at least one space so that's a brief overview if you like of the P reg match function and we've created our own little application here to check if a string data has a space or not and but do feel free to go and look up the P welcome P reg match pattern checking and it's very very very indepth but once you do get your head around it you'll be able to look it and realize actually how useful it is for checking patterns within strings
