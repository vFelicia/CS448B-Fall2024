all righty mace welcome back and let's go ahead and start writing some code shall we so redux how the heck does this thing work all right what is the first thing that we need to make well my guess is this big store right here so what does this say this is pretty much as one big JavaScript object that stores all of the data for your entire application simple enough so how do we go ahead and actually make this thing well what we do is we need to import a function called create store big surprise there from the redux modules so imports create store and this is in the module burritos so we already installed that should be in your node modules and there you go now one other thing that I probably just want to mention real quick you see whenever we import this and this then this was kind of generic but then we imported create store and we surrounded it with curly braces why the heck did we do that well you know how whenever you import a module you can use things from those modules well if you just want to use like one variable or one function from it and you can wrap it in curly braces and what this saves you from doing is instead of writing bar great store equals redux great store since this is such a common technique instead of having to make a separate variable and transfer it over and then you had the ability to use it whenever you wrap it in these curly braces you're pretty much doing that in one big Spang so right now already we can just use create store and just use the like a function so let's actually go ahead and do that so I'm going to make this a constant and anytime you're pretty much using a variable and you're only going to be making it one time in not changing its value at all you probably want to make it a constant in the reason for this is because first of all if you try to change it later on then you're going to throw air so it ensures that you don't accidentally change value and also it helps with performance so Const store is going to be equal to create story now again the store is all of the data for your entire application now this is actually going to be changing but we are not changing in code we're not going to say something like store equals something new or else that will throw an error if you guys want to see how that works then just stick around it's actually pretty interesting now the store is all the data for your application but how does it know what data it's supposed to store I think that's what it stands for a data storage by the way just between me new alright let's look at this handy diagram so the data that gets saved in the store is determined by things called reducers so a reducer is pretty much just like I said it's a function that says what data were supposed to save in our store now whenever we make our application we're going to have a bunch of different parts of data we're going to need to save a bunch of users we're going to need to save a bunch of videos a bunch of songs or ages of people who knows whatever the heck we want to save on our website now instead of just making one big function to kind of manage all this what we do is we break it up into separate reducers so we're going to have a movies reducer users reducer users reducer users reducer can make a rap song out of that so since we're going to have all these reducers let's just go ahead and make a new directory so we can kind of organize everything so this directory is just going to be named reducers and by the way this application that I'm making is going to be really easy arm all I'm going to have is a bunch of users names at the top and then whenever you click one it displays your profile or details below so again it's a really kind of dumb application you're probably not going to make millions of dollars from it but to explain redux it's perfect and I can print my to explain all the concepts so that's why I decided to go with this anyways moving on inside this reducers directory I'm going to go ahead and make a new javascript file and I'm just going to name it reducer users so again inside here what I'm going to have is a function that returns the part of application responsible for storing the users so later on whenever we delete users whenever we add new users whenever we change a user's name this function is going to be used so that's all we're doing and again since we're going to want to include this in another part of our application we actually need to export it so export default function so all this function is going to do is return an array of users that's it how easy is that so I'm going to hit return an array and now I just have to type in a bunch of users and let me actually pause the video because I don't think you guys want to see me take 10 minutes typing in users
