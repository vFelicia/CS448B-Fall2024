hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about the finally statement now what the finally statement does is this place inside of a try block and it's run no matter what so let's say we have this try right here and we go through this for loop and just gonna add each one of those items to our ArrayList and then it's gonna try to access an index that's out of range so what we're gonna do when that happens its type message box not show don't access memory that isn't there and then we can add a finally now if you read the description it says introduces a statement block to be run before exiting a try structure so this is run before the try is ended and it's run no matter what so it was type message box show I am the finally and then we'll go ahead and just beep now this is the sound that is played when an error occurs and this is just to show you how what you can do in the finally with the finally keyword so let's go ahead and run this you can see if we click add all we get don't access memory that isn't there and then if we click OK just listen and you'll hear the beep so it says I am the finally and there's our beep right there now we can also use finally with multiple catch statements so let's go ahead and catch e X as no reference exception and then we'll just message box that show that is no so we'll go ahead and create one of those exceptions here so we'll just throw a new null reference exception so let's go ahead and run this you can see that if we click at all it's gonna throw that throw this first even though these catch statements are in different order they do not go by order so since the null reference exception is the first one that is thrown it's gonna go straight to this and do whatever is inside here and then after that comes our out of range exception it's gonna catch that in this so let's switch back to the program it says that as Noah will click OK and it says I am the finally and then if you listen closely there's the beep that we added so go ahead and practice with the finally practice a lot with trycatch statements because you're gonna be using using them a lot inside of your programs they're very helpful and I highly suggest you look through a whole buck a whole bunch of the different types of exceptions that are built into Visual Basic and read the description so you can know when to use them and what exceptions to use so you're not just using a default exception each time now what you can do is use catch and then catch an exception and when it shows the method the message it's gonna tell you what type of exception that is so then you can go back into your code and add a specific type of exception instead of just a default one so like I've said before go ahead and practice this and then once you have once you understand try catch statements and finally go ahead and move on to the next tutorial well we're where we will be learning about the win keyword so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
