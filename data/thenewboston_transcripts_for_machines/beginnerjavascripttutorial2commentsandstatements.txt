well it is up guys it's Bucky and welcome back to your second JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I want to start out by talking to you guys about something called comments now if you're familiar with XHTML you know that sometimes you can leave comments to yourself and if you guys don't know what a comment is a comment is basically a line of text or a line of code that your browser ignores completely so why would you want to leave these comments in your code and why are they useful well a comment is basically just like a sticky note or a reminder telling you to do something like maybe edit a line of code or add something else to your web page it's going to be a line that your browser just ignores just so you know it's just so the programmer or whoever created the web page can follow along easier so go ahead and in order to add a comment in JavaScript go ahead and press forward slash forward slash and then type comment goes here now whenever you go ahead and run your webpage save it and run it you see that nothing happens because your browser knows to ignore that that it was just a comment maybe a little reminder that you're just doing something so just forget about it it pretends like it isn't even there so anyways like I said it's just like a basically a little sticky note to yourself but you're saying all right that's good for one line of code but what if you have a longer comment what if you want to leave a comment that's like alright go ahead edit this webpage and wash my dog then go to eBay and buy some items and then you know finish this webpage yada yada yada yada yada yada well you need more than a single line comment and you need something called a multiline comment so in order to leave a multiline comment go ahead and write /a strix and then after this right this is comment yada yada go buy stuff on eBay yadda yadda yadda and then in order to end it go ahead and press asterisk for slash now I wrote two lines but you can have as many lines as you want so that's the difference between writing a comment on a single line and writing one over multiple lines it just depends on how long your comment is basically so go ahead and delete all your comments and now that we're done with that let me tell you guys the basics behind not only JavaScript but every single computer programming language a computer program is just at the core it's just going to follow instructions for example if you want to tell your friend how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you would say step number one get out the bread step number two put peanut butter on one piece step number three put jelly on one piece step number four put it in your mouth so just like a computer program it's going to follow instructions step by step now each instruction is called a statement now every statement is going to end in a semicolon so we already saw one of these statements right here and that's how to print things out on the screen and that's document dot right now that's why we ended it with a semicolon and in order to print something on screen we just add those quotation marks and right like I love ham so whenever we save this it's going to see that all right print something out on the screen that's my one job I go ahead and I printed it out on the screen and if we have another instruction under this let's just go ahead and print something else out copy and paste it I love ham and I love bacon too so it's going to say alright print out I love ham that's instruction number one print out I love bacon that's instruction number two and notice that each instruction ends with a semicolon and again these are called statements so let's go ahead and save this refresh it and see it said I love ham and then it told me to do I love bacon and then BAM computer programming is over so that's the basics behind every single computer program it just starts at the top it does all your statements and then it ends how simple is that so well I guess that's all I want to give you guys for the story because the next subject is kind of a lengthy one and it's going to take a whole video to learn but remember in order to leave a comment you need either to four slashes for a single line or that four slash Astrix Astrix forward slash if you want to leave a comment over multiple lines and all a computer program does is it goes line by line AKA statement by statement as long as they end with a semicolon and it does this then this until it gets to the end of your script so we're saying re do the first thing do the second thing and then end so that's basically how a computer program works so in the next tutorial i'm going to be teaching you probably the biggest most important concept behind computer programming and that is called variables so it's going to be a super important tutorial you definitely want to check it out and it's definitely going to help you understand JavaScript so much more so thank you guys for watching this one and i'll see in that video
