hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about shared variables properties and methods so let's go ahead and create a new project we will select a windows forms application and we will call it shared and we'll go ahead and click OK we'll wait for that to load and let's open up our form or VB file now let's just go ahead and zoom in some and we'll create a class inside of here so that we don't have to create a another file so let's go ahead and make it public so public class and we'll just call it person so now what we want to do is make some public variables so public P named as string and then public shared min age as let's make it an integer and we'll go ahead and set it equal to something let's set it equal to 16 so when we share it what this means is that no matter how many instances or objects a person we make min age is only going to be stored once it's gonna be shared throughout all of them so let's say we if we didn't make it shared and we made a hundred person objects we would have a hundred copies of min age but because we make it shared no matter how many objects a person we create there's only going to be one instance of minimum age and if we just changed it once then it's going to go ahead and change it throughout all the classes so now what we can do is let's go ahead and come up here to the form unload so when the form one loads what we want to do is add that a bunch of people to a list box so first we're going to need a list box so we'll drag it over here and we will make it a little bit bigger so we'll go ahead and create a for loop right here so for int index as integer and we'll just go ahead and set it equal to 50 or no one 250 what we're gonna do is create a new person object so dim new purse as new person and what we're gonna do is we're gonna set the name and the we're gonna set the name of it and we're going to add it to an ArrayList so let's come up here and we will type private purse array as new ArrayList so now we're going to do is we're going to set the name of that person so let's just do new purse dot name or dot P name is going to be equal to and we'll just do Sam and we'll go ahead and add the current int index so and int index so it'll just give the numbers of Sam so whenever we after we've set the name for the person let's go ahead and add that person to the list so purse array dot add and then we'll do a new person so now we need to update the list box so let's just call update list now we haven't created this yet so let's come down here and create it so we'll go right before this or right out to the sub we will type private sub update list now what we want to do to update the list is type list box 1 dot items dot clear so we can get everything out of the list and now what we need to do is we need to add all of those users back to the list box so the way we're going to do this is type use a for each loop so for each the person as person in our person array we're gonna go ahead and add that to the list box so list box 1 dot items dot add and we will add the person dot name and then we'll go ahead and add a space or will add minimum age and we'll add the person dot min age and let's see here okay hold on okay so let's go ahead and just ignore this warning right here because it's gonna work either way so let's come back over here to our form 1 DB and let's add a numeric updown picker so we'll go ahead and set the the value that has been selected so whatever the form 1 loads we will go ahead and set numeric updown 1 dot value and we're going to set that equal to new purse dot min age now you can see we're gonna get an error because new person is not initialized yet so we'll just cut that and we will paste it right down here okay so it's gonna go ahead and set this to the automatic minimum age now let's go ahead and click the lightning bolt right here and whenever the value has changed what we want to do is set the value of minimum age now right here I forgot to mention this because it's shared instead of type of new person will just type person dot minimum age and this will access all person all person objects the minimum age and all of them so we'll just type person and what we want to do is set person dot min age equal to numeric up/down 1 dot value so whatever the value is in there it's going to set the minimum age to that and then after we do that we want to update list so I messed up a couple of times in here because I didn't really review this before I went to make this toriel but just remember that you used the whole class instead of the object of the class that you have so let's go ahead and run this and you can see here that we've got Sam all the way to 50 and it's got the minimum age is 16 now you can see that when we update this it's gonna update all of them so I set the minimum age equal to whatever you set it and there's only one instance of minimum age so we can keep changing this as much as we want and it's only changing one value now shared can also be applied to methods functions properties pretty much anything that did you that you can put in a class can be marked as shared so that only one copy is made so go ahead practices a little bit with shared and then once we got that down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
