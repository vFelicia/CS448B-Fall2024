all righty hostes welcome back and in this video now that we have everything set up I want to go ahead and show you guys a really basic example and the most basic example I can think of is just displaying some text on the screen so this is going to be the dumbest react project ever but we'll get the basics out of the way taken care of so the way that this is going to work is whenever you make something in react whenever you make a website or an application you're going to use react to essentially generate some HTML now usually this is going to be generated by you know doing something fancy like connecting to a database or some API um like getting a list of users and then generating everyone's profile picture or username or something but for now what we're going to do is we're just going to throw some you know like a heading one or heading two in there and essentially whenever it generates this HTML we need somewhere to stick it so we're going to say all right this is the code we're generating with react where are we going to put it on our website so I'm going to go ahead and make a div and by the way if you're using a JY Rin if you just write div or any tag name and hit tab then it's kind of a shortcut fills the rest out for you so I'm just going to go ahead and give this an ID of example and all this is is it's basically a target for later on whenever we write our react down here it's going to generate a bunch of HTML and we're going to say just stick it inside example so it's pretty much container um you know just normal HTML so now we can actually start writing our react code so I'm going to go ahead and make a script tag Now by default this is just normal JavaScript that's what the browser is going to see but remember I said that we aren't going to write plain old vanilla JavaScript what we are going to do is we're actually going to bew writing something called jsx it's a special type of JavaScript that allows us to use HTML syntax in it and it makes it really really easy to program so what we actually need to do is we need to add an attribute right here and say text Babel and if I say Babel sometimes that's actually because there's a kid in my class named Andy Babel and before I learn Babble um I don't know that's kind of what I see in here so again if I say Babel it's actually Babble but anyways inside here what's going to happen is we're going to type jsx and since we have this script this is actually the um Babel transpiler it's basically a translator that's going to take anything in between here and translate it to normal JavaScript so our browser doesn't freak out all right guys so for this example I'm going to be showing you guys one line of code and we'll just go ahead and run this and make sure that everything is working properly so from react Dom call one method called render now eventually whenever I talk to you guys about components which are essentially just part of your website then this is really how you use the render method but for right now I'll explain it like this basically what render does is it takes a bit of HTML and it throws it into a Target in other words wherever you want to display it now since we really only have one place where we can Target we'll just go ahead and use this as a Target so the first parameter again like I said is just some HTML so this can be whatever you know single tag that you want just going to go ahead and make a heading one and I'm going to go ahead and close it and in between here I'll just write uh hi my name is Bucky just like that actually let me just write Bucky make sure I'm not running out of room so this is our HTML and right now this is basically our react component if you don't know what a component is don't worry about it yet so the next parameter and the only other one it takes is where are we going to display this well we need to say um this div right up here so how do we do that well if you just wrate document dog Elements by ID it allows us to throw in the ID of an element which is example and it's going to go ahead and return a reference to this element right here so all we're doing is we're saying all right take this code which is a simple heading and throw into this div right there so now if I refresh this page check it out now if I look at my source code I don't know if you guys can see this it might be a little bit small but we basically have our heading one thrown right up into here and of course we can change this to a heading two and we can write like bacon or whatever we want and it's going to take whatever this code is and it's going to stick it right in between our Target as we can see right there so that's the very basics of react now again if we didn't include this line of code right here then watch what happens whenever you try to run this actually let me print out my console it's going to say whoa whoa whoa what the heck is this you see it's freaking out because this isn't actually JavaScript this is jsx and again it's just a lot easier whenever we can write HTML in our JavaScript so that's why we need to include this to translate it to regular JavaScript so yeah there you go thank you guys for watching I'll see you guys in the next video
