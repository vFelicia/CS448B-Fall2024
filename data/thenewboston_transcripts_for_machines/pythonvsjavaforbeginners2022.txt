hi there and welcome back to another video today we'll be looking at whether you should use python or java for your next project first of all let's start with a basic introduction to both the languages so python is a powerful general purpose programming language which implements many thirdparty libraries to try and cater your needs emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation and the use of many different english keywords java on the other hand is a high level objectoriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible so in this video we'll start off by looking at the basic differences then we'll move on to the performance leading on to the syntax and finally ending off by looking at the jobs and salary also as you've probably noticed by now i'm not the new boston my name is da and it mean the world to me if you'd go ahead and subscribe to my channel it should be the first link in the description thank you so much for that and let's get on to the video so first of all the key differences now java is a compiled language so it's code is directly converted into machine code that the processor can then execute on the other hand however python is an interpreted language hence the interpreter needs to run through a program line by line in order to execute each of the commands this means that the scripts written in dynamically typed programming languages can compile even if they contain errors if a script is written in a static typed programming language such as java and it contains errors it will fail to compile until the errors have been fixed now in terms of speed java is a lot faster than python just due to the fact that it's a compiled language hence it takes less time to execute the code the main reason is the python is an interpreted language hence it has to determine the type of data our runtime which makes it a lot slower let's now compare the syntax between the two languages in python to output the string hello world you need to use only this one line of code however in java you'll need to write all of this out the main reason for this is the java is an objectoriented programming language so everything in the language has to be an object lastly let's have a look at the jobs and savage salary for python and java developers now to be honest both of these languages are extremely popular however python takes on the lead around 7 000 for the average salary and there are about a thousand more python jobs available than java so thank you so much for watching i really do hope that you enjoyed the video if you did please don't forget to like the video and subscribe to both mine and the new boston's channel thank you so much for that and i'll see you next time
