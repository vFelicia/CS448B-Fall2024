hi this is Alex from PHP academy' creating this video for the new Boston and I'm back to tell you how we're going to unset a cookie so we've already set a cookie in the last example we set this for 10 seconds now just for the purpose of this tutorial I'm going to increase this to say a larger time so I'm going to say 1000 seconds just so we can show you shall show that it's working so in view dot PHP we can view the this the contents of the cookie so if we just refresh at the moment we can see that there's nothing set so we go to set PHP that sets it we can go back to view and you can see that the data is being shown and that's a corresponding to this data in here now what if I want to break this before the expiration time that I've set which is a thousand seconds now you might think oh there may be some kind of function you know or unset cookie or that's a sunset to unset cookie or something like that but in actual fact the way to do this is to reset the cookie now by this I mean we use exactly the same line of code however if we want to unset it and we just put a minus value in it's as simple as that and that will unset the cookie so even though in this instance here we're setting the cookie a line down we are unsetting it so even when we access set dot PHP that previously set our cookie we've also unset it as well so now if we were to go back and click on view you can see that the name Alex doesn't appear because it won't be able to find this value because we have set then unset it so why do you need to unset a cookie or why would you ever need to unset a cookie well the answer is quite simple I've already spoken about login and registration systems if you had logged your user in and you're storing the fact that they're logged in in a cookie and you may be logged them in for a thousand seconds if you wanted to log them out you might have a logout button now when I click a logout button we need some way of ensuring that that cookie is deleted and unset so we the users no longer logged in so obviously clicking a logout button would perform some kind of operation like this to ensure that the cookies unset and the users no longer logged in so that's a simple example of why you'd unset a cookie and that's basically a simple way and well I think the only way to unset a cookie in PHP
