hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to look at the submit event handler in jQuery now the submit event handler essentially just checks for a form submission so in this tutorial I'm going to outline an example of an email newsletter sign up we're obviously not going to be creating the functionality to actually sign a user up however we're going to be creating the outline of this so that you can go ahead and validate and then insert a data into a database for example so let's go ahead and outline the or draw up the HTML for this just so we know what we're doing we can see the example on the screen I'm going to create a form with an action of hash so we don't actually submit the form I'm then going to give this an ID as sign up underscore four I'll go ahead and end the form and now we have our actual form now remember the idea is where we reference so we're going to be referencing signup underscore form when we check for the form submission go ahead and create a couple of paragraph areas paragraph tags and I'm going to put first of all in here email and then an input area so an input type of email the idea of this is going to be user underscore email and in this paragraph area I'm going to put the registration button or the submit button so sign up sorry submit there and the value sign up so some pretty standard markup quite easy to understand so when we type in the users email or the user types in their email we want to click signup you'll notice that I'm using html5 so if I was to example type Alex and press sign up html5 automatically validates the email address on the front end for us however if they if you were to exam for example use this as just text you would you would and not have that validation in place so let's go over to our text editor and start to think about what we need to do and we first of all need to create an external javascript file which is going to handle the event so let's create a new add file in our text editor and I'm going to call this submit Jas now that we've got submit is this is where our event handler is going to be placed however we need to include this into our page so let's go ahead and type script type equals text forward slash JavaScript the source is going to be is forward slash submit is and we can end the script there so now that we've included submit jsr into our into our page we can actually go ahead and start to write this now the first thing we need to do is check for the event hand handler we need to check that the submit has happened on the forum currently if we check we click submit and nothing actually happens so inside submit is we need to create an event handler for this so we used dollar and then inside we reference the form that we want to use the sutter the submit event handler on which is signup underscore form signup underscore form now we need to use dot submit as the event handler inside the parentheses we need to create a function that's going to be run when this event handler is triggered triggered so that's function and then our block inside of our block we need to write our code so we can just pull the down now instead of here we want to write the code that's going to be performed when we actually submit the form so at the moment we could test this by saying alert and submitted so inside of our browser let's refresh and click signup you'll see that we get the alert box submitted so let's return to our text editor and start to retrieve this email value here and then we can relay it back to the user now we want to relay it into an inside of a div which is just below the signup form so I'm going to call this signup feedback now the reason I call it signup feedback this could be an area for example where you want to feedback either an error or a confirmation message to say that the user's email address has been registered so we're going to pull that up for now because we're going to use the jQuery HTML function to insert our feedback into here so inside submit j/s we want to first of all take the value of the user's email so I'm creating a new variable called user underscore email and that's going to be equal to again the reference of sign oh no it's not it's the reference of user email remember so user email dot Val we use the valve function to take the current value inside of this field here so now that we have this user email variable stored we can go ahead and relay it back into our user our signup feedback div so we reference this again with a dollar sign and inside of here signup feedback then we can say dot HTML and inside of here we can put some string data that the HTML that we want to put into the div so for now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to type something like thanks your email in fact now we can just say thanks and then plus so it appending on a value and that value is user underscore email and then plus to append the rest of the text has been signed up so bear in mind that if you wanted to actually create this into a functional application and actually store this email address you would write the you would write the code say here for example an ajax request to post this to a PHP page which would then in turn insert the value into the database or it would return an error so you would create this code here however obviously in this tutorial we're just looking at the event itself so we're not going to actually get into that so now what's going to happen is once the form has been submitted we grab the users email referencing this email field here and we then relay it back to the user inside the sign up feedback div that we created under the form so really this could go anywhere for example up here it doesn't matter where we place it it's still going to reference that object so let's go ahead and refresh when I click signup we don't have any validation in place so we will just get a blank a blank email in our div however let's go ahead and properly register so I'm going to type in my email address and I'm going to click signup oh okay so the problem here is that the hash obviously has actually submitted this so I'm just going to get rid of that there and refresh and we'll see if that's worked so Alex at PHP academy' org and then click signup and you'll see that we get this message up here thanks Alex stop Alex at PHP academy' de org has been signed up so this is a frontend example of how you would use submit to actually handle a form submission in jQuery and you can see that the frontend is now complete we just don't have the backend validation so just by using the submit handler we've created an email signup frontend application if you like or front the frontend design and the functionality we just don't have the rest in place to store the email
