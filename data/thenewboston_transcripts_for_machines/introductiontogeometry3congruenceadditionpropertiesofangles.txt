okay so we're gonna start off with congruent angles and congruent angles are just angles that have equal measures and we measure angles in degrees so we have right here angle ABC and if we measured it we would find that the measure of angle ABC is about 63 degrees and over here we have angle D EF and if you measured that you would find out that that is about 63 degrees as well so since the measure of angle ABC equals the measure of angle D EF we can say that angle ABC and angle D EF are congruent angles okay so now that we know that we're gonna go onto something else which is called the addition property of angles so we have Ray I n which is this one directional line right here and it lies between ray I M and Ray I K so that means that the measure of angle mi n plus the measure of angle n I K equals the measure of this entire angle which makes sense because if you add up the parts of something you're going to get the total of the whole so say I know that the measure of M I n is equal to 63 degrees and I know that the measure of n I K is equal to 55 degrees I can take each one of those parts and add them together in order to get what the whole angle is equal to and if you add 63 plus 55 you get a hundred and eighteen degrees so therefore the measure of angle M I K is equal to 118 degrees okay so now that we know that we're gonna do a couple examples using these two properties okay so I know that angle QR T is equal to 62 degrees if the measure of angle TRS which is this angle right here is equal to 43 degrees what is the measure of this whole angle so I can take 62 plus 43 and I get a hundred and five so the big angle angle Q RS is equal to a hundred and five so for number two I know that the measure of h IJ which is this entire angle is 138 and I know that the measure of this part angle H I K is equal to 30 degrees so what is the measure of K of angle K IJ which is this part right here so since I know the measure of the total I can take the sum of the parts and set it equal to 138 with X being the measure of this angle so if I subtract 38 from 138 I'm gonna find out what the other part equals which is a hundred so therefore the measure of angle K IJ is equal to a hundred degrees that's using the same property I'm just doing the opposite okay so now we have one more example example three angle ABC and angle CBD are congruent if measure of angle ABC or excuse me measure of angle abd is equal to 120 what is the measure of angle a B what is the measure of angle ABC and CBD well since these two angles are congruent that means that they have the same measure so if we let the measure of ABC equal x equals x we can take 2x and set it to the total because these two angles represent two equal parts of the whole angle so to find out what each angle equals we can just take 120 and divide it by 2 and you'll find that each angle equals 60 degrees okay so now that you know the properties of angles be sure to watch the next video which will go over special angle pairs and how they relate to one another
