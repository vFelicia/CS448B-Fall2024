So today we're going to talk about how we can use algebra to solve geometry problems so we're going to use these pooms to find the perimeter of this rectangle now if you remember from geometry or if you haven't taken it yet just um to remind you that the perimeter is the sum of the length of each side of a shape so it' be width plus width plus length plus length so we have to add up each one of these pols to find what the perimeter of this shape is and we're going to leave it in the polom format because we don't have any idea what the perimeter equals we're just going to express it using polinomial so we're going to take y^ 2 + 2 y 4 + y^ 2 3 + y^ 2 + 2 y 4 + y^ 2 3 so we're going to combine all our like terms so we have 1 2 3 4 4 y^ 2 and 1 2 2 2 y's so that's 2 y + 2 y is 4 Y and we have 4 3 43 it's 4 + 4 it's 8 3 + 3 is 68 + 6 is 14 so this polom right here tells us what the perimeter of this shape is in terms of Y so now we're going to do another example so for any shape the perimeter the way we find the perimeter is the same so we're still going to add up each one of these sides and combine our like terms so X2 6 x + 4 + X2 6 x + 4 + y^2 7 x excuse me x^2 7x + 13 so we're going to combine our X squar and we have three of them X SAR 6x 6x makes 12x and + 7 x makes 19 X and 4 + 4 is 8 + 13 is 25 so once again this polom that we ended up with at the end expresses the perimeter of this shape in terms of X so now we're going to do the same thing but with area now if you remember the formula for area of a rectangle is length time width but this little note right here that says it is a square lets us know that we can use the the area of a square formula which is just side squared so we have to square out this binomial in order to get our area polom so remember when we Square binomials we write it as two binomials and then we foil it out so first is 2x * 2x which is 4x^2 plus outer 2x * 3 so 6x 3 * 2x another 6x and 3 * 3 is POS 9 so this is 4x^ 2 12x + 9 we're going to do one more example with area and this time it's with a triangle so I I wrote a little note over here of the area of a triangle in case you either don't remember from geometry or you haven't taken it yet so area is equal to 12 base which is this one x^2 2x + 6 time the height which is x + 4 and remember we always use the perpendicular height so that has to be right angle right there so the first thing that we're going to do is distribute this x + 4 to this polinomial and then we'll distribute the 1/2 later so 12 X2 * X is X cubed x * 2X 2 x^ 2 x * 6 POS 6 x 4 * X2 POS 4x^2 4 * 2 2x 8x 4 * 6 POS 24 so now I think it's easier if you combine your like terms first and then distribute this 1/2 so 12 we only have 1 x cubed 2 x^2 + 4x^2 gives you a POS 2x^2 POS 6x +8 8 x is going to give us 2X and we just have a positive 24 at the end so now we're going to distribute this one half so 12 x cubed 12 of two is just one so this is X SED 12 of 2 is 1 x and 1 12 of 24 is 12 so that's the area of that triangle so that's all we're going to do with um our geometry applications of polinomial make sure you come back and check out our next lesson where we're going to talk about how you can use pols to solve word problems
