now storing a different type of data is almost like storing a variable with a different type of data and you can see that we've got a really extensive list of data inside here now through the tutorials that I'm going to be taking you through we're not going to be focusing on lots of different types of data but there for you to play around with and match them to your suitability when you go on and develop further applications now the ID remember is a number that auto increments to give each row a unique value and you'll see how that works in a moment if you don't quite understand it yeah so what I'm going to do is I'm going to choose this as a type int because it's an integer you can also have things like tiny int small and medium and big in so they're all different types of numeric data values decimal float double as well so I'm going to choose int for this you can even choose something like small int or medium in however if you expect say a hundred users on your website this is fine however if you're going to be taking into the millions then you're going to need to stick with int okay so lengths values we don't need to worry about default we don't need to worry about in this case because ID is going to be incrementing the two we need to focus on in this case are the index now remember I said the primary keys is the field or the column that's you the unique column so we have specified unique column this is the unique number color and now we can tick auto increment and this allows us to every time we create a record we are incrementing this value so we'll start at 0 by default and then when you create a record you'll have value 1 & 2 then 3 so you'll never have this will never equal 0 so let's come a little to username and password now obviously we don't want to store user name or password is just int but what we do want is varchar' the vital span stands for variable character so what we can do here is we must specify a length and a value whereas in here oh let's just get rid of that whereas in here we didn't so a username would typically be say no more than 30 characters so we can specify this as 30 password exactly the same it might be it might be less than 30 characters but this is something you're going to have to specify in your program let's say you were to create a user or user login system you'd have to say you know give a max length to your text field and check inside PHP if the password specified are the usernames specified weren't bigger than 30 because anything bigger than 30 attempting to be written into this table is going to be cut off if we were to create a password that was 32 characters it would end up getting rid of the last two characters and we'd just end up with 30 so there's nothing else we need to set for the username and password in this case we can set default values but because we already want these always want these to be specified there's no need default just means you can specify a default value if this isn't if no data is specified to be written so for example we could create a field on the end here called stay logged in and this might be equal to 1 or 0 depending on whether the user want to be logged in but by default it might be 0 if that makes sense so now what we do is we come down and we click Save now what you can see is that we've created now a table here called users and we've got a number 1 in here to show that we've got one table so let's click back on this table so we can have a look inside and you see we've got the information are outlined here for us in a table you can see that ideas underlined which means it's a primary key and we've got our type here so you can see int is a map is a length of 11 so a length of it 11 digits of integer data this might be considered a bit too much but like I said if you were going to go into say millions of users this is what you specify otherwise you could have something smaller you've got a varchar 30 and we didn't change the password I've just noticed we've kept this as an int so this is a good time to show how we're going to edit some of our values you can check each value that you want to edit and perform an operation underneath here so for example at the moment I just want to edit password and I'm going to click on this change thing here so or pencil so now it's giving me just this password on its own where I can change the type of it to varchar' and I can come down and I can click Save okay so that's safe know that you can see it's updated that we've got everything in here oh you can also individually edit each one so you can see that we've got extra here we've got auto increment now how do we go about inserting some data into this table because at the moment we've got the table but we've got no data now this would usually be done for PHP if you were say registering users you'd be inserting this data from PHP once the form has been checked for example you'd certainly use them a password however we can do it manually from PHP myadmin if we wish to do so so I'm going to click on insert and I'm going to scroll along a bit an ID we can leave blank because remember this is an also incremented field we can specify it being left blank and it will automatically update for us we've got user name and password so let's enter a user name and let's enter a password what we can also do is specify the amount of rows we want to insert so we can say restart in citation with 40 rows for example but for now I'm just going to insert the data Alex and password and I'm just going to click go
