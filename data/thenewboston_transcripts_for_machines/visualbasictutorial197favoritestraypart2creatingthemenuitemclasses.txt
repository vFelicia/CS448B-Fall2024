hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on the tray icon or the tray application that will hold our internet favorites so we need to come over here to favorites view or tray and we need to add a class now we'll go ahead and name it web favorite menu item and we'll go ahead and click Add now what we need to do is we need to have web favorite menu item inherit from something so we'll have it inherits menu item it says represents an individual item that is displayed within a system not window stop forums dot main menu or a context menu so basically what this is would be a menu item would be similar to this file right here so when we click file it shows us a menu so we're creating a menu item that will show when they right click the star in the tray so now that it inherits menu item what we need to do is we need to create a favorite so we'll do public favorite as web favorite and you can see here that web favorite is not available to us so we need to come over here to favorites view or tray YouTube we need to go to project and we need to add a reference it so we'll go to projects and we will just add a reference for internet favorites and click OK so now we can do public favorite as web favorite but we need to import that first so imports internet favorites so now that we've imported our class library we can use the web favorite class so now we need to create a constructor so we do this by using public sub new this should be familiar to you and it's going to take one argument so whenever they create an object of this web favorite menu item it's going they're going to have to give it a web favorite for it to construct it properly so it will do by eval new favorite as web favorite and we'll go ahead and press ENTER and it will add in sub for us so now when you do is set favorite which is this right here equal to new favorite so we have this variable that we've created and when they create an instance of this class right here they have to give us a web favorite and then we set the favorite variable in here the public favorite variable to what they have given us so this basically makes a copy of it so that we can use it throughout this class and now we just need to say text equals favorite dot name so text is pretty much the text of the menu item when we because we inherit from menu item we can access the text value so let's say this is our menu item right here at the text value for this it would be new project so we're sending text equal to favorite name and now in our web favorites class let's go ahead and look at that we have the name which is the name of the website so when they right click is going to show the name of the web site and it's not going to actually show the URL so now what we need to do is we need to access the click event of this class now you may be thinking I thought you could only access click events for objects on your form such as buttons text boxes labels link labels but whenever we inherit from new items so let's say this is a menu item right here it can react to itself being clicked so when we click on new project it's going to do something so we need to access the click event of this so what we can do is we can use this combo box right here so when we drop this down you can see that we have web favorite menu item events and we can come over here to the declarations and we have all these events that we can use so we need to select the click event so whenever web favorite menu item is clicked what do we want to do well we'll say if not favorite is nothing then what do we want to do so basically what this saying well this is saying is if favorite is something because we're using a double negative here so if not favorite is nothing so not nothing would be something so if favorite is actually something and not a null value for all you people who've worked with other languages what we want to do is type process dot start and then we'll do favorite dot URL now what this is going to do is it's going to start the process and it's gonna open this URL so when you open URLs when you click on URLs in any program on your computer your computer knows to open this with your default web browser so it's going to start that process and it's going to basically click on that if you want to say that there's going to open this right here and it's going to open it in your default browser so go ahead and put this code in if you haven't already we created a menu item so that we can add a whole bunch of these web favorite menu items to a menu later on so that they can just right click on the star and it will show them all of their favorites
