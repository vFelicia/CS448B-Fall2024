but I couldn't really find a way to actually disable this so we need to find a way to include something in our code that's going to say temporarily remove it now what we're gonna do here is just before we show our out div we're gonna go ahead and we're actually going to remove the top the tooltip attribute well we're not going to remove it we're just gonna set the value of it to nothing so we want to say this dot attribute and in here we want to say title and we want to set it to nothing here we've just set it to nothing so now what's going to happen is when we hover over we don't get the annoying tooltip appear the only problem we have now is when we come away this title attribute is now set to nothing so when we hover back oh well it has worked but you know depending on how how everything works we've we've removed it we've removed it here and then we could have some problems later on so what we want to do is we want to make sure that we actually reapply the title to a title attribute a bit later on so when the mouse comes out we want to restore the title attribute back to its original value so again we go this dot attribute and obviously attribute is title and we want to set this to title remember the variable that we took earlier so although it worked before we want to make sure that we replace the text before we go ahead and actually actually you know you know so essentially what we've done is removed it and then replaced it now there is a problem that this can cause let me just go ahead and get rid of the resource putting it back in and I'm gonna go ahead and copy this link and we'll just do a line break for now and not very good code but let's go just ahead and do a line break let's go ahead and change this to PHP academy' to org and it's changed the title to PHP or video tutorials and in here let's go ahead and just change the text so now we've got one link underneath each other now the problem at the moment is is that you've already probably seen we've got a powerful search engine here and video tutorials here but when we actually go ahead and hover over both of them they have the same essentially the same value so what we want to do is inside inside of our plugin J s we want to go ahead and actually restore this back to its original title so in here we want to say this dot attribute and the title set back to the initial title and now when we hover over oh no it's still the same and let's go ahead and work out why that might be okay so maybe this is something that I haven't actually thought out ok yes so I get it basically what we've done is we've included this in the wrong place so what we want to do is we want to go ahead and actually put this inside of the mouse mover then altogether so let's go ahead and just rearrange this around a bit this is good that we've caused a problem because we can go and actually look at the solution to this where it has the same description for each link when we come in here and when we come in here so we'll go ahead and obviously this was unplanned but we'll go ahead and change this around a bit so let's go ahead and just the first thing I'm going to do is just get rid of this and I'm going to place this inside of here and now I want to take this loop here all this if statement here and just get rid of it and pull this up and then I want to go ahead and delete this here so now I'm gonna just read sort of indent that or take it back a bit and we can go ahead and apply this if statement inside of here right so let's let's take a look at the code as it stands okay we've got nothing obviously okay so this mouse move and then we having the title attribute of the current element so so now what we want to do is this is causing the problem because we're setting the attribute to nothing I think that should be the problem maybe not let's come back and just take a look at how this is working so let's just run through this again we're applying the DIF afterwards the mouse the mouse move event here we're grabbing the title from here using the attribute from the currently hovered over link and that's applied to all h raf all a tags we're grabbing the top setting the ties well let's just comment this out for now and see what happens okay yes so now you can see that that was the problem we're removing the title attribute so we're still getting this sort of that title attribute you know sort of pop up and also we've still got the problem of this not being moved that's not a problem we can go ahead and just rearrange this let's go ahead and cut that and just paste it underneath here so it doesn't interfere with anything oh and it has interfered okay so let's just get rid of that altogether and we'll deal with that as we go so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of this as well so hover text art hide when the mouse comes out let's just check yeah that's working so we've got the we've got the functionality of it working now with both links and it's actually going ahead and taking the title from each one as we wanted it to however we've now got this problem of the hover over taught it
