so now we need to check for a state change or a ready state change from from our XML HTTP object so we say XML HTTP dot on ready state to change and then we equal this to a function so it so basically based on this event we create a new function and then inside here we can start checking our ready State and our status of our of our request so we say if and we say XML HTTP dot ready state remember our capital S here so case sensitive is equal to 4 and our XML HTTP status is also a status is equal to 200 this just means if the page is not blank or the request isn't blank coming then we complete the rest this block so if this is but if these are both true then we create what's in here so now under our insert field if you like here where we're typing our the value that we want to insert into our database we're going to create a div and what this div is going to do is it's going to feed back in information from our updating PHP file when we create it and the reason for this is when we've inserted the data we're going to tell the user that the data is being inserted but because we're doing this without refreshing the page we want to give a confirmation message inside a div so I'm going to call this div I've created a structure of the div here we don't need to put anything in here at the moment well at all I'm going to call the div message so this is just going to feed back information from our from our request our Ajax request and the the output in updating PHP is going to be put into this div so hopefully that makes sense otherwise continue to follow along and see what you think so we've got document dot get element by ID what I struggled with earlier and then we specify the name of the dip so in this case it's message and then what we do is we say inner dot sorry dot inner HTML and what this is going to do is it's going to set the HTML within out this specific div that we've specified so what we're going to do is I'm going to equal this to XML HTTP response text and all this basically is is it's the the output sent back from update Inc PHP because we're going to be opening this file later and sending post data to where I'm going to be taking back the response text from this file so that's important that we put that into message in order to let's say if we would say echo failed at any point in our program the in anytime in our script the message div would be updated so now that we've done that we can come down here and we can start to send our post data now if you watch the other tutorials you'll see that we used XML HTTP open and then we've supplied three parameters don't forget the semicolon at the end and we've supplied the first primary parameter was get the next was the file so this was update in PHP and then it was true because we're sending the data synchronously so we need to set this to true it's actually true by default but I tend to put it in anyway just to ensure that it's there etc etc etc just for my own peace of mind so now we set XML HTTP send now there's a few changes that we need to make when we're using post data you'll see that in some of the other tutorials I've put a question mark here to specify that we're going to be sending get data and I've sent some specific data so I've said for example text equals hello okay so what I've done there is I've sent get data because it's as part of the URL so let's go ahead and test this so we we can see that everything's working with regards to the the Ajax so at the moment what what this what this set Ajax will do is it will open this update dot PHP file or will it and it will pass through a variable called text which is a get variable with the value hello so what we can do inside here is just echo out dollar underscore get text and what that should do is it should react oh what we've entered into the text box because remember what we enter into the text box is being picked up sorry let's go back here what we enter into the text box will be picked up eventually by this so this will equal hello just for now and it will put that into our message div down here as I explained earlier so let's go ahead and check that this works let's click Submit and you can see that the value hello has been returned now obviously the problem with this at the moment is we've completely avoided the point of the tutorial we need to post data using post so the first thing we'll do is change this to post and I'm going to get rid of these variables and the end hits we don't post data through the URL
