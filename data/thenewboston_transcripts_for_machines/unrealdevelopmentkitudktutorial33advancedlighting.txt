all right guys welcome to your 33rd udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking to you guys about lighting to be honest I'm probably going to be talking to you guys about lighting for like the next four or five tutorials because there is a ton of stuff to cover so if you were just sitting there saying you know what Bucky I already know everything there is to know about lighting just go ahead and hold L on your keyboard click and Bam all there is to know about lighting we got a light on our level well believe it or not there's actually a lot more that goes into lighting that we can achieve some awesome effects it can pretty much take our levels to the next level H probably shouldn't use a level two times in one sentence it could take our maps to the next level there we go when we learn to use lighting properly so in this tutorial all I'm going to be doing is showing you an alternative way to add lights and taking you through some of the more common interfaces and windows whenever you're working with lights so I'm not going to be teaching you a whole lot of new stuff in this tutorial I just want to show you around the lighting world so to speak so I already taught you guys one way in our last tutorials how to add lights to your maps and that's of course hold L on your keyboard and click and you got a light but this is pretty much like a work light like say you were working in a garage or something and you just needed anything to light up you know a dark area you're like hey dude give me a light and whatever he shine you know whether it's a flashlight or a light bulb or lighter any way that you can light up that dark spot it's fine and that's basically what we're doing here we're basically throwing work lights up but whenever we build our level we want something a little more advanced that we have a lot more control over so typically how I'm going to be adding lights is this actually before I even do that here's my little nice Sample Room I made but it's looking kind of bland so I'm just going to go ahead and add a pillar real quick drag that out right there and let me make sure in my top view it's somewhere around and the reason I'm doing this is whenever I add a light it's going to cast a shadow and I want it you know something to cast a shadow rather than just walls so that's why you needed to add something to your level so now that you got your level with something in it in this case a pillar I'm going to show you guys the more common way that I like to add lights and that's go ahead and in your perspective view right click anywhere on the screen and from here click add actor and add a point light or add light parenthesis point and from here it's basically same as before it adds a light to your scene so go ahead and the first thing you're going to notice is this as soon as you add a light to your scene it changes from unlit mode to LIT mode and that's because udk realizes that now that you have a light you probably want to you know be able to see what's going on with it so the first thing you probably want to do is move it around a little bit using your translation tool translation mode is this called the transl ation tool I'm just going to call it the move tool and you see that the shadow kind of changes depending on how you move the light you know as you could expect so let me go ahead and do this first and foremost notice how the shadow is right now it's kind of crisp and whenever you move your light you can really easily see how your shadows moving but keep your eyes on the shadow right here and I'm going to go ahead and build this all and it's going to build and again keep your eyes on this Shadow right here because I want you guys to Noti what's going on you see how it kind of went from real crisp and really easy to see what was going on to kind of like fuzzy kind of give you a more realistic looking light this realistic looking light is called a shadow map and I just want to I'm not going to be talking about Shadow maps in this tutorial I just want to point out that there is a difference between this Shadow and the fuzzy Shadow and that's and we're going to be talking about that later so if your shadows look different than me right now don't worry about it you're going to understand later on so anyways the other thing I want to talk to you guys about is the light properties trust me there is a lot more properties to This Light than whether it's on or off so in order to access the properties just go ahead and select your light and hit F4 and check it out look at all of these properties just for light I mean we get that and that and this is only like one tab we get movement display look at all this crap you guys are thinking that you know whenever you put a light in your room or hang them up for your Christmas lights that there's on and off and that's it well in the udk it gives you about 6 million options and we're actually going to be understanding what all these options mean but for now I just want to show you guys through the lighting properties window and give you guys a real quick tour of some of the most basic properties oh you have not registered your we project H this is let me just register now right in the middle of my freaking tutorial yeah I'll see you later R I don't care if my computer's vulnerable so anyways go ahead and you're probably going to be looking at this most go ahead and expand light then light component and then light component again you think they would name this tab different than this tab but they don't some of the more common and easy to understand properties are like the brightness which is by default at one but go ahead and slide that up and you can see that it gets brighter obviously um the light color if you want to change the overall color of your light to like green or something and of course if it cast Shadows or not that's one of the more common ones if you uncheck that check that out my shadow is gone we do want that to cast Shadows so these are just a bunch of different properties that you can change to kind of alter the way your light behaves so I'm not going to be talking about all these right now because well it's going to take me like five days first of all and this is tutorials just introduction of Lights I just want to show you guys that there are indeed a lot more light properties than just on and off so with that being said what's what else do I want to go over well probably the only other thing I want to go over in this tutorial is this and I'll leave that light green well green looks good enough for now so the only other thing I want to go over is a nice little tip I want to give you actually this is kind of bugging me so if I can go ahead and change that back to White and hit okay it might be easier to see what I'm about to tell you guys whenever you're working with lights you have these little icons right here and I just move that back wow I am a fool Bucky you fool so let's go ahead and put that back and hit F4 again whenever you're working with lights you have these icons right here now what I like to do is I actually like to change the size of the icon depending on how big the light is for example if I'm like lighting up a road or a pathway and I have little kind of like Night Lights uh going on along the sides of it or nice little lights I like to make the icon smaller whenever I have a big light to like symbolize headlights or a big lamp in the room I like to make the icon bigger it just gives me an idea of it just makes it visually easy to understand because when you have a lot of lights it's hard to imagine what lights are affecting the scene in different ways so in order to make this icon bigger or smaller go ahead to the display tab and go ahead to draw scale and now if you scroll this up and down you can see that your icon either shrinks or grows again all this does is change how it visually looks it doesn't change the properties of your light any it just lets the programmer see either a small icon or a big icon and another reason that you might want to change the size is because maybe you have a model of a lamp and you want to fit this icon inside it so it can't be like that big or else look what happens when I try to move it in the lamp it's not going to work out so you might want to you know make it small so you can fit it inside a modeler or something but that's another property that I use a whole bunch and uh if you guys play around with this you'll probably find that you're using it a bunch too but for now I'm am obviously running out of time so in the next tutorial what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be showing you guys some real cool effects that you can achieve with lights and also probably talking about some of those properties but for now that's all you guys get so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
