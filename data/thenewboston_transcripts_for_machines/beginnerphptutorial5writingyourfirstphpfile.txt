hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video tutorial we're going to get to grips with the basics of creating a PHP file what extension we're going to give it and how we're going to set up the inside of the file to ensure that our web server deals with it correctly because PHP isn't part of our web server package we may need to specify in Apache to look out for PHP files and you can do this in your HTTP comp file that we've already looked at when we've set up our Apache installation now PHP is serverside so whatever you enter whatever you write in between PHP tags will not be no will not be able to be viewed by people usually when you create an HTML HTML document you'd start with your HTML tags you'd obviously do it it do it much more correctly than this we can start with your HTML tags you'd create your body tags and different information and different functions the functionality of the page will go in different places now in PHP it's a lot more loosely structured and the way we do things is we use PHP tags now on their own PHP tags look like this so you can see that it is a it's a mirror image of a less than sign first of all then a greater than sign at the end here in between are these X question marks sorry and then just the words PHP it can also be specified like this now this may look a bit odd to you at first however what we actually do is just after PHP here we come down and everything we want to write in PHP goes in here so every time you set up a new page and you want to include some level of PHP in it for example you can combine PHP and HTML in a page we could have our PHP tags here and we could also have our HTML tags down here so whenever you start up a new page and your going to include PHP you want to create a tags like that or like that I probably recommend the use of the PHP note notation at the end at the start so these your PHP tags PHP code will go inside here so how do we go about saving our file so it can be interpreted properly by our web browser or our web server sorry so we go ahead and we save the file now I have a folder inside my htdocs folder called series and this is where the videos or the code for the videos for the whole series will go I've created a particular folder here called first file so this is how we're going to access it in our web browser we're going to go to localhost series first file and then we're going to have our file name here so let's just call this document let's say well we'll call it in next stop PHP because typically an Apache installation will take an in depth stop PHP and index to HTML files as default files to be loaded inside a folder and by that I mean if your file is named anything else so I'm going to call this just for file dot PHP for now remember we're using dot PHP you can just to be sure choose all files here and enclose that in in double quotation marks just to make sure your text editor saves it with a correct file extension so let's say this we shown that we've saved this as a PHP document my text editor context has automatically turned on syntax highlighting for PHP this just means that PHP code and different different aspects of code will be highlighted so we can read things easier for example variables are green and function names are typically a gray color and things like keywords so for example for each which is a language construct of blue and it depends so strings can be prone for acceptor etc so we've got this file and we've saved that now if we come in here and refresh our browser you can see that the file appears here now if I click on this that's our PHP document ready to go we can start programming and we can start displaying output to the user and calculating and as you can see if you've clicked to view the page source there's nothing there so let's combine some HTML with PHP and see what happens and you can see now that by just including some HTML tags and refreshing the page you can see that these actually show up however our PHP code will be up here however it won't be shown because it's interpreted by our web server program that's where everything's sort of calculated and then we display the output that we want using PHP so it's a serverside scripting language as opposed to HTML which isn't just tags that are interpreted by different browsers ok so like I said earlier you can name your file and give it a specific file name or you can choose to name it index dot PHP so I'm going to set up some PHP tags and I'm going to save this as index dot PHP now this is in this directory if we go back so when i refresh in Lex dot PHP will automatically be opened we won't have this index or forward slash series forward such first file we won't be able to see the files we'll just be presented with the index dot PHP page and to test this I'm going to use a simple command in PHP to demonstrate this I'm going to say echo and this is my output there's a tutorial on echo and what it does or you'll see what it does but how it works and a bit more information about it so for now I'm just going to be outputting this to the screen so let's refresh the page you can see that we've automatically gone to index.php my browser doesn't show it up here but let's just type that in manually so we can definitely see so the page it's automatically gone to index dot PHP if I just choose to go to the file the folder I mean is exactly the same so these are different conventions of naming files if you name something anything else other than what's specified index dot PHP in index dot HTML I think a default specified in an Apache configuration however normal files are not named to open by default so that's a bit about naming files and how you should name and create your files and you've learnt also how to set your PHP tags up ready to code inside them
