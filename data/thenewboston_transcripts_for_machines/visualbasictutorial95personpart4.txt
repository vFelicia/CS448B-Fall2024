hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be working more on the personal application now what we're going to be doing in this tutorial is getting the selected person from our list and updating the current wait money and income based on the person that I selected and we can have them do any of these subs right here so go ahead and double click on list people and it will open up the selected index change so now we need to do is use a simple if statement so if list people dot selected index there's not equal negative one then go ahead and do something so if they're if they selected anything on here it will not equal negative one if nothing is selected then this whatever is inside of this if statement will not run now we need to do is we need to get the person that has been selected so we'll go ahead and type dim selected person as person so we declared a selected person as a person and notice that we didn't set a we didn't use a new keyword to create a new person we're going to set this person equal to my people dot and we'll come down here and you can see that we've got a whole bunch of stuff that we can use and we're going to use index of so we're going to type my people and then we're going to add two parentheses now we are going to reference an index in my people and the index that we're going to use is list people that selected index so whatever the whatever the whatever is selected inside of this list box right here is going to be set to selected person so it's going to reference my people which is our array list at index of list people that selected index so the index of this is going to match the index of that and when we add the people to the list they're added in numerical order so we have Jama index of zero it will also be index of zero in the array list so index of zero on their list and then the array list so they're going to match and we can use list people that selecting index for this I might be a little confusing at first but you'll pick it up later on okay so now we need to do is we need to call the update all but you can see that under here on update money and update way and update update income you can see that we have a problem it will only update for the my default person now what we need to do is we need to by reference person as person so we will reference a person object that is created so now we're going to do is we are going to delete this right here and we will type person dot get money dot to string so instead of making a copy of the person object that we have declared right here we're going to actually use that person object which is referencing it so if we make any changes to this selected person it's going to change it if we make any changes inside of this sub it's going to change it down here so we'll go ahead and minimize that and we'll do that for each one of these right here so we will by ref person as person and we'll do it again for update income so by ref person as person okay so now we'll just go ahead and change this to person dot get income person and then this one to person get wait okay so now that we've updated this to let us reference a person object in our update weight update income and update money we're going to need to do that for the update all and you can see that we're already getting an error so under update all will have it reference a will by ref person as person and down here we'll just type in person person and person again so whoever we whatever person we reference to the update all is going to be referenced to each one of these and it's going to update our text boxes and we'll just type selected person right here now there's going to be one problem that we have with this since we declared selected person inside of the list people got selected index change where we are not going to be able to use that outside of this sub when we need to be using it inside of button income click button exercise click and button work click and you can see we're already getting errors right here because we have not referenced a person so we'll go ahead and copy this right here and we're going to declare it outside of all of these subs just inside our class so type private a selected person as person so now whenever the index has changed it's going to set that to the current person and so now what we're going to do is we are just going under update all we're going to reference selected person and before we do that we need to take this out right here because it has already been declared okay so we will update all for the selected person and selected person selected person again and then one more time for the income okay so now that we've done that what it's going to do is going to update each one of these for the selected person but you can see right here that we have my default person instead of selected person so we'll just go ahead and type that in right there and just to make this go a little bit quicker I'll copy this so copy that right there Oh
