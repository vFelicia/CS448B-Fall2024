in this case the background color is going to be white but we still need to do specify the color of the background using RGB numbers if you like or integers so we need to create the image width and the image height so I'm going to create a variable called image underscore width and that's going to equal in fact we'll do height first because that's the easy one height equals and the function we're using is image font height so we image font height and we've got camel caps he remembers we've got capital H F and a capital I so image front high and all we do is we simply grab the we simply grab the the font size that we're using so we just say font underscore of size simple as that so now what we need to do is determine the width so the width is going to be structured slightly different to this but it's going to be more or less the same we just have one addition to the end of this line so we've got image font width and that's again from the font size so we're taking the width from this font size for now however what we need to do is we need to multiply this by the string length two in order to create a font width there's exactly going to fit our characters in so we need to do is multiply this by email length now like I said what this is going to do is it's going to multiply this by in this case 19 I think like we said so we're going to be multiplying however big one character is or the size that the characters in the in the font go in I'm going to be multiplying that by 19 so we're going to have enough room for our text I'll show you later maybe change it around if not you can you can obviously play around with this value to see what happens and you're cut off your image basically so now what we need to do is create an instance of our image that we are creating so we're going to take into account two arguments this is going to be the image height and the image width so let's go ahead and create a variable just called so this is image create oak create and we first will need to specify the width and the height that's the default ordering for this so we need to say image width comma image underscore height so we've specified the two variables that we've created here now our image is created inside this variable here and we can start doing things like allocating colors to it now the first thing we're going to do is we're going to allocate a background color so our background color is going to be white and our foreground color if you like or our text color because we're going to use a function called image string which basically outputs a horizontal string along our pet along our image rather and we're going to need to take in a couple of parameters so the parameters that we're going to need or one of them is the color so the first one remember I said the function is called image allocate now or image color are allocate sorry this I've used without defining a variable because what we need to do is this will simply just set the background color to our image we're going to specify what we you know the instance of our image in here so we're going to type in image here so we know that we're just getting a general color to this image here okay and that color is going to be 255 for the red 255 for the green and 255 for the blue so we've got an RGB value of 255 255 255 which is some of you may know if you've worked with colors before that is white so we've allocated a general color to our image so we've put a white background in now what we need to do is actually create a variable that's going to we're going to be able to specify the color of our text when we output it so with the fonts as with the font size I'm going to say font underscore color and this is going to be equal to image color allocate so I'm using exactly the same function I'm applying it to exactly the same image so we've got image and image but this time I'm going to set the RGB values to 0 0 0 and again for those of you work with colors or recognize what this could be this is the color black so we've got black here with zero zero zero so we've got opposite ends of the scale zero being the minimum two five five being the max and we've got white and black so that's pretty simple obviously I encourage you to play around with different color values play around with different things like that and you'll get a lot used to using these functions and how they work so now what we need to do is just use a stand on its own we're not going to we're not going to put it into a M into a variable and this is called image string and this in total takes six arguments so we're taking six argument into this image string or parameters so I'm just going to type image string so the title of the function sort of gives it away we've got image which is what we're creating essentially and string so we're creating an and image from a string so the first thing we're going to do is give reference to the image that we've created or the canvas that we've created we've applied our color to our canvas we've created a variable called font color which we're using inside our image and we can specify that color in here we now need to say what the font size is going to be so that is font underscore size remember we set that out there to four we're then going to specify the X and the y coordinates where we're placing this text or this string inside our image now because we've created it with the height of exactly the font height and we've created it the width of exactly the font width we're going to set this to zero zero it's going to be in the top left hand corner and the reason for this is because if we will set this to any positive amount or any negative amount in fact it's going to overlap or underlap and we're not going to be able to see anything but again these are these are values that you can change and play around with after you finish for the tutorial so you can feel free to see how they work okay so the next is the email we need to specify the email address that were we're echoing out which is in fact the string data so we're going to say email that's pretty simple and then last but not least is the font color so font underscore color which we specified here remember notice that no we're inside here are we setting the background color that's why I left it without declaring it and putting it inside a variable so we've done image string you might think that we're done without put a string in image in image format but now what we need to do is finalize and create our image and we do this with the function I mentioned earlier it's image JPEG without the O so what we're doing is we're outputting our image so with this image string we've with we've modified this image this instance of our image here that we created image create now what we're doing is we're outputting it make sure you don't forget your semicolons on the end of the line and now we are pretty much done so now what we can do is test it hopefully it works and then if it doesn't work we can fix it and if it does we can look at how we can use it more practically because you remember I mentioned earlier that we can't use HTML output either before or after our PHP tags because what we've done is we've changed the content type of this entire page to an image
