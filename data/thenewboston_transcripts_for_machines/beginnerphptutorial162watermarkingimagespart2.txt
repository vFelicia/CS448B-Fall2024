so now we need to come down and create a watermark height and also a watermark width value and we can easily do this using the image SX function so it will type image SX and here we just need to supply one argument and that's just the image we've already loaded in so we've got the watermark height so the image watermark hi using this function and just supplying the already opened image so we'll do exactly the same thing for the width as well okay so now we've successfully loaded in the watermark and the watermark height and width from this watermark that we've already created we've basically here created a new image file in Gd but from this so we've almost duplicated the file if you like okay so the next thing to do is set up our canvas now we need to set up our canvas by basically using our image to create true color function and that's going to go inside an image and image a variable called image sorry so the function we need to use is image create true color and we need to supply this with two values and that is going to be watermark height in fact where it's the width first so we're always taking a whip first and water mark height now we're going to redefine the same variable and we're going to say image create from JPEG so this is the important part we're creating the image from our source so remember up here we called our value source or the value that we're reading in source so we can just pop in source there so you can see now why I created this variable it's a lot easier than then keep referencing this long if you like get method way of reading in a value so now what we need to do is get the image size so by image size I mean the image as in the phone image that I showed you earlier this is the size of the source image that we're loading in using this line here so what we want to do is we want to create a new variable so we'll name it properly we'll call it image underscore size and we're going to be using a function called get image size now get image size isn't actually a GD function itself this can be used without Gd so if you find that you might need this function elsewhere and you might need to use this function and you don't have Gd installed you're more than welcome to use this as it's not part of the GD library so obviously we're getting the image file from the image size sorry from the source like I said earlier so we just supply it with the argument source which is the source data we're reading in now you'll notice just just to make know that we use in the image SX function here and here to grab the watermark height and width however why are we using this get image function here the reason we'll get image size function here the reason we're using this down here as opposed to the image SX is we haven't loaded in the source well we have but what we want to do is we want to read the get image size from the source which is the file that we're supplying with so we're using this and without loading the image in first and as we've done here create image from pier we've used this function here but here we're just using the get image size and this is going to read it in as an array so now what we can do is we can set two variables that's x and y now these two variables are going to be the positioning for they're going to be the positioning for our water map now remember I said that we're going to have it 10 pixels from the bottom and 10 pixels from the side so we need to take this into account when we're in values because let's say my text editor at the moment was an image the top here would be at 0 and then we'd go all the way down here positively and all the way down here positively so what we want to do is we want to start here and minus 10 and minus 10 so we can end up around here then we can display our watermark here so let's change this X variable and like I said image size is read in as a array and the first element of the array so element 0 let's just type it out so you can see what we're doing is equal to the width of the image so the first one which is 0 is is equal to the image width so now what we can do is say the image width overall minus the watermark width remember we got the watermark height and width over here earlier I've just noticed that the I've supplied the wrong function in here image sy is for height and image SX is for the width so let's just change these around so they're in order as we're supplying them so yeah sorry about that if you go back if you're following this tutorial as it is we've got image as X and whites we've got X and wife the width and the height so the watermark width is now going to be minus 10 but like I said I want it 10 pixels away width wise now height wise I want it 10 pixels away as well but this time for the image size which is now an array we want that to 1 because that's going to represent the height so one is representing the height so let's do exactly the same we're using exactly the same structure we want to say watermark height minus 10 okay so let's just recap on what we've done we've loaded the image in as a filename we've created the logo which is the watermark evidently we've created that in from a PNG files we're using a PNG file we've grabbed the width and the height of the watermark so we can do things with it down here we've created an image and loaded in our image that we've created from our JPEG so we've image crate from JPEG source which is the file name that we've loaded and we've grabbed the image size and we've created the X&Y position for the watermark which is ten pixels away from the edge of the image okay so the next thing to do is to use the image copy merge function now this has got lots of parameters that we're going to throw at it some of which we need to discuss some of which we probably don't but I'm going to try and go through all of them so the image copy merge function looks like this now what is this function going to do this function is responsible for taking one image and basically merging it with another image and we're going to say we're going to well give give the parameters to this function of how we want to merge and by merging we're doing exactly the same thing as applying a watermark onto our image
