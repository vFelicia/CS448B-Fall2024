hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about open file dialogs now open file dialogues are used to of course open files and they are built into Visual Basic so you know you do not have to create your own form for it and you can just add an object of it to your program and use it whenever you need to so we'll create a new project we will select windows forms application and we will call it open files go ahead and click OK and wait for that to load and once it's done loading we'll go ahead and shrink this a little bit and we need to add three things we need to add a button we will set the text to open and we will set the name of it to button open and we'll add a label so here is our label and we will set the name to label file and we'll go ahead and set the initial text value to no file selected okay so now we need to come back in our tool box will minimize out of common controls containers menus and toolbars data components and now we need to come down here let me just get some of these out of the way we need to use dialogues now select an Open File dialog you do not have to drag this on your form you can just go ahead and double click on that and it adds an object of it to your form to your project I mean so let's double click on open and let's go ahead and zoom in here so what we want to do when they click open is type Open File dialog one dot show dialog so this is going to show a dialog that will allow them to select a file now we want to do is we want to set the label to whatever the name of that file is so label file dot text is going to be equal to Open File dialog or Open File dialog one dot file name so let's go ahead and run this you can see here you can see here we got a form one I want to click when we click open it opens a file open file dialog for us so let's go ahead and navigate here and let's select back check five so we'll go ahead and open that sorry that was out of frame there but we'll select backtrack five which is a Linux distribution well click OK we'll click open and you can see that it gets the full path of our file now we can open another one let's go to development csharp projects signs calculator and we'll select the solution file and you can see that it's going to give us the entire path of that file so we can use this path later on to open the file or maybe read text from it or what else we whatever else we need to do now what we can also do is change some properties and values of our open file dialog before it is shown so we'll just type open file dialog one dot title and we can set it to whatever we want so I can even set it to on live gamer so let's go ahead and run this and see what kind of results we get it says no files selected so we'll go ahead and just open one you can see here that the title says on live gamer now you can change the title to whatever you want and it will also change the icon to whatever your programs default icon is and so we'll just select some here click open and you can see that it gives us the path of that file so we'll go ahead and close out of that so practice a little bit with Open File dialogues later on we're going to be learning more about save file dialogues folder browser dialogues font dialogues print dialogues there's a whole bunch of stuff built into Visual Basic that makes it easy for you to open files print stuff whatever you need to do without having to waste time coding for that and you can focus on what your program is really supposed to do so like I said practice this is a little bit I've changed some attributes of your open file dialog then once you've got that down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
