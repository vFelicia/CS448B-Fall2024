now what happens inside our while loop so while our string position equals STR pause if nothing is found in the STR pause it will return a 0 so remember 0 inside here will mean a false therefore the loop will be broken but for now as long as the string position is found we want to echo out the string position so we just simply do echo string position and I'm just going to append a break on to that let's just make this a bit more userfriendly we could say echo echo found at we can even include the word so let's say find found at ok so what this is going to do is for every every for every time it's found we're going to echo the position and obviously the word we're going to iterate way and then we're going to put a line break on the end but now what we want to do is we want to create a new offset because at the moment we're going to find the we're going to find the string that's that's absolutely fine we're going to echo out the first instance of the string found within here so it will be at position 2 however then all we're going to be doing is searching from the start again so we're going to be searching from position 0 again so we're going to be searching and we're going to find the same string so you'll find that if you do run your page at this point then your page will probably crash it might crash your browser because what we actually have here is now an endless loop so now what we need to do is we need to create the offset value and I'm going to say offset is equal to string position so this is the current position found let's just run through so if we were to find it at position 2 we then need to add 2 on Twitter to begin the search from here so string position add 2 now why is this not good well I've already explained we've got the length of the string to find here so that's the amount of characters just to skip so all I need to do is add on this variable length now we can run and test our program now to see if everything is working so let's just refresh and you can now see Oh oh yeah okay so I'm reading this as is found out but obviously our word is is so let's just make this bold so it doesn't look as confusing confuse me for a minute there okay so okay so we've got is found at two so we found it a position to let's just double check that so we've got one two and then we've found it then what we've done is here within the office Cape we've skipped two so we've started from this position here and the offset has been read in here so the offset has now been read out on to its found it so the offsets now starting at position 4 and now we go one more and we find it at position 5 which is here we skip to and we start at position 7 and then we find it all the way up here at position 25 then we skip another two and it can't be found any more therefore this while loop will be evaluated to false because this value of string position will equal zero so now we've successfully found everything now I know we've used a lot of variables like the find in here and the fine lengths in here and the reason for this is now if I wanted to search for a completely different word inside here for example if I wanted to change this to string everything is now going to be updated so the fine length is going to be updated which is going to be put in here so now instead of skipping two characters we're skipping one two three four five six and we're also updating this inside our function so we've only had to change one value now why is this going to be useful let's just test it out first and we'll see if it works string found at 10 so let's just check this one two three four five six seven eight nine ten yeah it's found that so why is this useful well let's say we had a form down here and we wanted to ask the user to input a certain value we could pass this find variable as say dollar underscore post Abdulla underscore get to find for example so we could specify or we could allow the user to specify a string I wanted to find in another particular string and therefore our program that we've just created here would automatically update for whatever string was entered so that's basically how the string position function works and how useful it can actually be
