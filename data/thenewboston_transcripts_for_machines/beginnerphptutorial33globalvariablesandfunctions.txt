hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is another video tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about global variables and using them inside functions now you may come across the problem that when you're pre defining variables outside of your functions and you're trying to use them within your functions you might find that you're not getting any sort of response from this your the variable will not you know you might be able to do anything with it so let's use the example with an IP address let's create the user's IP address inside a variable so we're going to say structure it like this now don't worry if you don't understand this code if you've never seen this part of the code before all this does is it returns the user's IP address server it's just a preset of environmental variables that we can use so let's just echo this out as it is and then we'll see about creating a function that's going to do something with this IP address what we're going to just be doing is echoing it out but we're going to be doing that inside a function so let's refresh now because I'm on a local on my local host local server I'm working on my computer my IP address is just 1.1 27.0 dot 0 dot 1 which is the standard notation for a local server now what happens if I create a function down here let's say an echo IP and inside here I just want to echo out use now you can imagine in a normal program that you've created however simple or complex it's going to be wherever you echo this variable out or wherever you do something with this variable for example we might say um let's say string equals your IP address is and then we can catenate the user IP on the end of their let's just use this outside the function first of all or you can keep that in the X we're not going to call the function yet let's just use this outside of here and we can yet just echo that out so let's have a look at what it says so we've got your IP address is and then it gives us the IP address let's just put a space there okay so this works you would expect it to work because you've referenced the variable here okay so now what happens if we do this inside a function so I've created the string your IP address is and then I'm going to echo out the string so what you'd expect to happen is for the variable here to be put into here so that will make up this string and then we're echoing out the string so let's refresh the page and see what happens okay so we haven't actually called our function so that's one vital thing I forgot so I'm calling the function down here so presumably once we call the function the two lines of highlighted in blue will be run so let's try this out okay now you'll notice that the string itself has actually been echoed out however the user IP has not but for example if we echo it out out here it still does exist so we're still echoing out this variable still you know holds a value however what's happening here is we're not being able to access it inside this function and there's one simple line of code that you can use to do this and you can put multiple variables within this but now we're just going to be working with one so all we need to do is specify the global keyword and then reference the variable number that we want to make global to this function so global user IP now what will happen is this variable will be able to be picked up from out here and then therefore it will be put into there let's refresh and you can see that it works we are echoing out this string the user IP has been gained from this value here like I said you can do multiple things so if you had say another variable here and another one here you can just separate them by commas so why would we need to do this the answer is simple you might have lots of either static or dynamic variables that you have to define outside for example you might have to define it in an include file you might be including a different file that contains this user IP so to be able to use it inside your function you want to create it and globally first in inside your function and then it will be able to be used so for example this IP this IP address situation we might want to define it somewhere else we might not want to define it within our function because you could in fact just to find it inside and it would still that's just right it would still work so we're still getting exactly the same result from this when we refresh however what happens if we want to use this user IP now outside the function we're going to have to declare it again so it's a waste of you know declaring a function inside the function at outside so we tend to just use the notation that I've explained and that will allow your outsider phone function variable to be used within
