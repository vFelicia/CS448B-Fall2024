hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog and this video is for the new Boston now the next part of exception handling we're going to talk about is try throw and catch now what we do with try thrown catch is we need to try a block of code within this code if we come across an error we throw an exception as we've already looked at but what we do is that we then catch the exception and we can display the custom error message in our own way so to start this we say try we open a new block and then afterwards we say catch and we have a new block and we've got two parentheses here which pick up the exception and give it a variable name so for example exception e^x so what's going to happen now is we're going to try some code in here and if we do need to throw an exception the exception will be caught by here and the exception will be named e^x what we can then do is from e^x we can get the message that has been predefined in the hour after when we throw an exception so if you're having trouble understanding this we'll go ahead and write the code and then wear them we'll understand it a bit later on hopefully so what do I want to try now I need to think of a scenario that I can try in order to throw an error so for example if my age here I set was a 16 let's say in the UK you have to be over 18 to drink alcohol let's try and create and well we're going to create an if statement and we'll try this block of code so if age is greater than 18 we need to say that's fine you're old enough so we can say echo just say old enough else otherwise we want to throw in your exception so we need to throw new exception as we did in the last example and we can supply text so we can say not old enough so we try this block of code let's just indent it so it looks a bit neater we try this block of code in the block of code says if the age is greater than 18 then we can display to the user yes you're old enough that's fine now otherwise we're going to throw a new exception and the exception text or the message if you like is not old enough now because we've thrown in your exception at this part we can catch it with this part and to catch or not to catch something because that's already been done but to display your custom error message we want to echo out and let's just say error and we're going to append on the variable e^x now from the variable e^x we need to call the function that's within throwing new exception which is going to echo out this text here so we need to say e ex greater than sign get message now I haven't predefined ittin this function myself anywhere this is just standard notation for getting the message here that's thrown by a new exception so now you can already see we've come up with a way of throwing an exception and giving up ourselves a custom error message here and you can throw multiple exception throw multiple exceptions which can be caught multi you know multiple times as well so eventually it's going to create a lot better flowing code for now it C does seem a bit sort of pointless to use but we can go ahead with refreshing the page and looking at the example anyway so let's put our age older than 18 for now but it's a 21 so let's refresh and it says old so we've got the we've got the output that we're expecting now let's type 16 and we can see what happens let's press refresh and you can see that we've got this error that we wrote in here and then we've grabbed the error message from when we've thrown our new exception so what we've successfully done is created a try throw and catch method to our program to try a block of code something goes wrong or if something is not right a values not compact you know hasn't been compared or we have an else we're going to throw in your exception and then we're going to catch that exception and display the custom error message to the user so that is try throw and catch in exception handling with PHP
