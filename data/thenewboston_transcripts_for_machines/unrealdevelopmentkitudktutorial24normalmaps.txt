what's up guys welcome to your 24th udk tutorial and in this tutorial i'm going to be enhancing our texture a little bit so in the last tutorial what we did is we gave our material an overall look and we just made it basically to look like bricks but if we scroll around our material a little bit we're going to notice a couple things first of all it looks kind of bland and another thing this material right here it doesn't really pop out because in real life these bricks would kind of stick out and in between the bricks it would have some depth this part would be indented and right now it really doesn't have a lot of bumpiness or depth to it so we can change that right now by applying the normal setting now this normal setting right here is a setting you can use to apply depth or bumpiness to your material so in order to do that what we need to do is we need to include something called a normal map now a normal map has information about which what part of your material you want to stick out what part you want to indent what part you want to apply bumps to this is pretty much the picture of what material you want to use now the normal map is saying what areas you want to have you know indented and stuff like that so enough of me talking let me just go ahead and do it go ahead and in order to apply a normal map go ahead and right click and hit texture new texture sample and now what we need to do is instead of applying just plain old texture to this we need to apply a normal map to it so whenever you import textures into your udk you're going to have two things you're going to have the texture itself and you're going to have a normal map so let me go ahead and see if i can find this texture so whenever they imported this this is the texture itself and this is the normal map right here so go ahead and select this normal map and then go ahead and select this green arrow and this is going to say use the currently selected object in the content browser and whenever i do that you say that it imports the normal map as my texture so let me give you guys a quick little background or history on normal maps like i said a normal map isn't a texture itself it's basically saying all right these are the parts of the texture that you should indent out that and stuff like that so as you can see right now it doesn't really look like a regular picture it has three colors basically a red green and a blue color the red color shows the x pixels that should be intended the green colors show where the y pixels should be indented and the blue color shows which z pixels should be intended basically i'm going to be going over this whenever we make our own normal maps in photoshop but for now just remember normal maps tell your texture which area should be outdented and indented normal maps basically apply depth to your material so in order to apply this normal map to our material we need to go ahead and take this normal map and stick it into our normal right there pretty cool huh so actually let me go ahead and delete that and go ahead and keep your eyes on this while i do it so nothing yet and then go ahead and keep your eyes on that material and when i go ahead and release this you can see that the bricks now look like they're sticking out and it kind of gets indented where the black should be right there so let me go ahead and delete that one more time just so you guys can see the difference and apply it and check it out our bricks now have some depth to them pretty cool huh so now that we have an enhanced material we can go ahead and save this material and then go ahead and x out of this and then you can see our materials if we go ahead and clear this out we want to go ahead and save our package and now we have our new enhanced brick material so now we can use this new brick material which now has the newly uh normal map aka has some depth to it to apply anywhere in our level so go ahead and let me just if i can drag and drop that right there so pretty cool huh we can use our texture to you know make a weirdlooking cube if we want a pink side that glows and two bricks pretty cool huh so that's basically how you use normal maps what they are and again whenever you import textures or excuse me whenever you import yeah textures from photoshop or something into the udk it's going to have two pieces it's going to have the texture itself in the normal map which gives depth information so that's how you apply the texture and the normal map to make one sweet looking material so now that we understand the basics of how to do that we're ready to move on to some more advanced materials but for now thank you guys for watching thank you guys for subscribing and if you have any questions i know this can be a
