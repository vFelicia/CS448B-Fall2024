hi this is alex from phpacademy.org with a video tutorial for the new boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the progress bar widget in jquery ui now the progress bar is essentially a a bar that can contain a specific value and it's filled to that value so any really normal progress bar you've seen we're essentially going to simulate this in the tutorial so the first thing i've done is i've included obviously jquery and jquery ui as well as this css file which is under the ui lightness theme there's more details on how to install themes sorry on how to install uh jquery ui in the installing jq uh jquery ui video i've created in this series so essentially what we're doing in this tutorial is we're gonna be creating a progress bar and then a progress percentage underneath and that's going to feed back the value that the percentage bar will be currently at and then when we get to the end of the percentage i.e 100 we're going to stop the progress bar now obviously with the progress bar in place you can't actually create a process on its own you would have to have some kind of script that would feed back a value of the percentage that it's currently at for example a file upload or something similar so you're going to have to actually have something that gives you the value before you implement it into this progress bar now obviously because we're just taking a look at the widget itself we're not actually going to be able to create a real percentage um and we're not going to be able to generate a real percentage from a particular place so what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to use the set interval function and actually create this uh as an effect rather than an actual function however what you will do is you'll learn how to implement the progress bar and also display the feedback based on this so we're going to be creating a small application that's going to be dealing with this so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a button which is going to activate this progress bar from 0 to 100 so let's go ahead and first of all create a button that's going to have a value of let's just say start or let's just uh call it upload to make it more practical more look more practical and the input id we're just going to have upload just so we can reference this in ui.js our jquery or our javascript external file the next thing to do is create a div that's going to handle the actual progress bar itself so i'm just going to call this pb and then underneath that we want a div that's going to relay the percentage of the bar to us so i'm going to call this percent okay so now that we've done that we can go ahead and create an event handler to handle a particular event which will be the starting of this progress bar and percentage when we click the upload button so inside ui.js we want to go ahead and reference this upload here so we are creating a selector to select upload and the event is on click or dot click so after this we're going to create a function and inside here is going to be our function contents so now once we've clicked this button we want to actually activate the progress bar we're first of all going to take a look at how this works and how it's implemented and then we'll look at changing the value dynamically so to do this we're going to need to use a selector to select the progress bar div that we created on our page and we want to apply the progress bar widget to this okay so now what that's going to have done is it's going to select it's going to have create created a progress bar when we click upload let's go ahead and click upload and you can see that we've created this long massive progress bar across the page now i'm going to go ahead and set a few settings inside star.css which we have implemented into this page and that's just going to make everything look a bit nicer so the first thing i'm going to do is set the text size of the body and i'm going to set that or sorry font size i'm going to set that to 12 pixels and i'm then going to change the width of this progress bar div as well so we reference pb and we set the width here and we'll give it a width of 400 pixels so now it looks like this it's slightly smaller and it fits nicely just under here okay so um let's go ahead and change a value of this progress bar to see what it looks like when we actually have it say half full so we can supply an option inside of the progress bar widget to allow us to set the value so for now i'm going to set the value to 50. now if the value set to 50 when we click upload this is going to go to halfway because we've defined the value as 50. so now if you logically think about it we could set this value here to a vec to a slowly or an increasing uh value so essentially what we could do is we could replace this with another variable for example val
