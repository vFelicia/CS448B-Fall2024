hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this Ajax series we've already looked at using the XML HTTP variables we've been using and we've been we've been posting data to our page using the get get method so we've been picking data up in our include file using dollar underscore get now what if we want to send post data through to another file so we're going to do exactly the same format as we've done before but this time we're going to create a little program or script rather that allows us to have an input box on the page and a submit button now when they user clicks this submit button we're going to be transformed a transferred sorry obviously using Ajax to update dot PHP and what this is going to do is it's going to insert a piece of data if you like into the database so let's first of all have a look at the database structure and what we're actually going to be doing here so ID we can ignore this for now this is a primary key and it's Auto increment so if you're following along this tutorial and you want to create this table we've got the database called Ajax the table called data and inside of this we've got the ID and data field so ID like I just said it's an integer data type it's the primary key and we've got an auto increment so for every insert we make to this thing for every record we create this is going to be an auto incrementing value if you've watched my other tutorials on databases you'll understand what this is if not go back and have a look at them so data is just simply going to be the just a string of data it will literally just be a string of data so where this example is just going to demonstrate how to input something onto there and then hopefully you can come away from this knowing how to use this post this post method through Ajax and you can incorporate this into your own website with posting data okay so the first thing we're going to do is design our form so let's go back over to our index dot PHP file and we'll start to create a rough outline of our page so here we've got our root HTML tags then our head tag and then our body tag so inside head we're going to be putting the function that's actually going to update the database well it's going to cool Ajax and then and then post the data this updating dot PHP so we're going to transfer data from the form to this function or call this function which is going to pick up this specific field on the form using the get element by ID in JavaScript and then we going to get the value of that form and submit it through so that's just a rough outline of what we're going to be doing so first of all we're just going to create an area where we will eventually write our Ajax into so we've got a script type and we'll end the script there remember the type is text JavaScript because Ajax is essentially JavaScript and XML so inside of our body what we need to do well the first thing I'm going to do is just simply create a label so I'm going to say in insert I'm going to say insert and then I'm going to create an input field with a type text and the name of this is going to be let's call it an insert text in fact we'll just call it text for now that will keep things simple okay so now what we want to do is we want to create a button so let's create an input type button will give this a value of submit and we want to say unclick equals and we want to call a function name now the function name will be inside here which will then process this update dot Inc dot PHP using Ajax so I'm going to call the function let's say insert okay so we've called this insert function which obvious obviously at the moment doesn't exist so let's create that now okay so just to give you an idea of what this program well how this is going to work what we're going to do is we're going to make an alert quickly just to check that this function is being cooled properly so I'm just going to write okay in there so let's go back to and preview our our HTML so we've got insert we've got a text value here that we can type in so we can type a value into here and then click Submit and it should be alerted by calling this function so let's try just type in test click Submit and we get okay back now let's try and access this this value here this this text value here so I'm going to say we'll just create a new variable called let's say text value and that's going to equal get element by ID and that is text dot value
