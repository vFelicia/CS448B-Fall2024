and you can see that salad has now come first the same if we is if we were to say ascending but obviously you can see that this is automatically ascending by default so now what happens what we know what happens if we want to select only a certain food type so let's say we are producing a list of healthy food let's just go in and add some more records so we can get a better idea of what's happening so healthy food might be pasta for example so we can say pasta calories might say 600 we might say this is healthy so we'll give this a value of H and down here we can say another unhealthy food will say ice cream calories let's just give it say 700 and we'll say this is unhealthy we'll denote that with au so let's click go and we'll just double check that everything is there now we've automatically put these values in so when we come back to our PHP page this will automatically update so I've refreshed and that's been updated and you can see that it's still in descending on we've got ice cream pasta salad and pizza so now what I want to do is I want to modify my query to work with only healthy food so I'm going to say select food calories from food where so before this order ID we're healthy underscore unhealthy which is our column name remember let's just go back and have a look at that we're healthy unhealthy and we need to say is equal to H so equals H remember this time using single quotation marks rather than apostrophes so now let's refresh our page and you can see that that's been updated with just the healthy food and then the same again with unhealthy we could choose you and then we could list just the unhealthy food so you can see that just by selecting data from our database we're choosing exactly the data we want to sell remember you can also use things like the and keyword as well and you can pretty much change this query to however you need to select your data and how you need to apply conditions to it now there's also a function in in PHP that allows you to return an integer with the amount of rows that have been returned so for example if we return no values so we've got healthy unhealthy equals you I could say and let's just pick something out healthy unhealthy equals are you and calories equal 100 so what we're doing now in our query is we're selecting where the food is unhealthy and the calories are equal to 100 now if you look in our table let's look at the unhealthy so we've got unhealthy Pizza which is a thousand we've got unhealthy icecream which is 700 no record exists where the value is U for unhealthy and the calories match 100 so what's going to happen is when we refresh our page we've returned nothing so what happens if we want to display a message to the user saying nothing's been found so no results has been have been returned from this query it's been run here so what we do in is we use the MySQL num rows function so if we rerun equals MySQL query now inside what we can do is say just above the while loop and then we'll close that just before that we can say if MySQL underscore num underscore Rives we need to reference the query run so the query that has actually been run equals equals zero or null then say something otherwise we can loop through the data there's no point I'm just going to increment that or indent that sorry there's no actual point in looping in running this while loop here if the data returned here is equal to zero so we can put an error message in here saying no results found okay and let's make this a larger so I can understand what's going on so we've run the query now we're running an if statement and we're saying if the number of rows returned from this query are equal to zero say no results found otherwise we're looping through the data that has been found because if it doesn't equal zero it must we must have at least one row then we loop through and got the data so let's just let's just refresh our page and see what happens so you can see no results found now what happens if we change our query around let's just go up to our query and I say ten calories equals 700 now let's go back to our database we can see that an unhealthy food with the calorie amount of 700 is ice cream so therefore this query will have returned one row therefore this if statement will evaluate to false and we'll run this block here so let's just test that we should just get icecream displayed on our page and we have so icecream has 700 calories so using these few simple functions and using a while loop you can see that we can select all rows in our database that have been returned with a specific query now we don't always need to use this while loop to return specific information for example if we know that we're only going to return one row for example the example I've already used with the username and password if if we say return one row we know we're only ever going to return one row we can do this slightly differently and that will be demonstrated in the next video in this series so for now that was selecting data from our database using a loop and the small but very useful functions
