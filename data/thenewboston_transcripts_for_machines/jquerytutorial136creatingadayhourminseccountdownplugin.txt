for example if we use the same notation for hours and same math floor seconds / and for hours it's just 60 times 60 because we don't need to go ahead and use this 24 for every day if we now go ahead and alert out hours you'll notice that we've got 44 hours now obviously we want to keep this it within the 24 hours because if we were to say we've got let's say it's just to let out days as well if we were to say that up until the 10th of August 2011 we've got one day and 44 hours it doesn't make sense because you know there's more hours in a day there's not there's not 44 hours in a day or any more than this we need a maximum of 24 hours in a day so what we need to do is make a calculation under days that will correct the amount of seconds in order to display the hours properly and for this we do seconds equals which is the same as seconds equals seconds so we can do that as well but this is just shorter a notation and then we want to say days times 60 times 60 times 24 so now what will happen is the set this this value here are calling two days will be subtracted off of the seconds and then when we go ahead and calculate the hours it will stick within the well display the correct value so we've got 1 hours and 20 so now that we've got 1 hours and 20 from the 10th of August at 1200 let's go ahead and change this to 13 and refresh and you can see it's changed to 21 so we now know that this works because we're echoing out or alerting out the days and the hours so will not allow out anything else we'll just go ahead and correct each one so now we need to do seconds equals and then we need to do the same but for hours so we say hours times 60 times 6 and then we need to work out the sorry not the seconds we've already have that the minutes and the minutes is equal to mass dot floor and seconds divided by 60 because we're just doing divided by 60 for the minutes and again we're using seconds which has been updated here after our hours as being calculated and we need to go ahead and do this again so let's go ahead and say seconds equals minutes times 60 so now what we've done is we've retrieved the last value of seconds which we can use let's go ahead and just alert all these out again I did say we weren't going to but let's say days and the space and we'll say hours and a space and then we'll say minutes and the space and then we'll say seconds so let's go ahead and refresh you can see that we've got one day 21 hours 11 minutes and 15 seconds until this date let's refresh you can see this has changed well the one hour the one day the 21 hours 11 minutes to change but this is now 7 seconds and you can see that that's just gone to 10 minutes and now 59 seconds so we know that the values are working so we can go ahead and actually do something with these ie place them into the span that we created earlier for each corresponding day hours minutes and seconds so because we've used the selector here countdown inside of our plugin we can use this dot something we've already got this selection up here so we want to just say this underscore cell and we want to say dot find the first thing we're finding is the days class or any element with the class days and we want to place the text in there days so now what's happened is it's placed one in there because we have one day until this particular time we've already echoed them out so we we know what they look like so what we do is we repeat this process for each one so we want to go ahead and find ours and we want texts sorry not in their text hours again this selection dot find dot minutes or mins as we called it text minutes and then this selection dot find and we want to go ahead and find seconds and change the text to seconds so now when we refresh the values that we were echoing out earlier have just been placed into you know the place on our page using find we found this day's element hours minutes and seconds element within this countdown div that we supplied here so pretty straightforward in terms of just sort of traversing through elements on a page however the only problem now is I have to keep refreshing in order to keep this value changing so we want to go ahead and apply at an interval so just underneath here I'm going to say interval equals set interval interval and in here I'm going to give the name of the function which is count execute and I'm not going to put the brackets because that won't work and we want to execute this every 1000 milliseconds so now on the page this function here which returns all of this data will be executed every second and when we refresh the page you can now see that the time decreases and we've got this just updating itself on the page so quite simple however we've obviously got a few things we need to take in take into account I want to display leading zeros before this and this here if we've only got one particular character I wanted to show like it would on you know say like a digital clock or something like that so just up here we want to go ahead and change this around and then we'll start to create our callback function
