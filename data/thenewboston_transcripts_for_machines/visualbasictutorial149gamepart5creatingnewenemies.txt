hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash the on life gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be working on the game now if you remember from the previous tutorial we had it randomly generate an enemy based on well whenever we click spawn enemy it randomly generates an enemy now you can see I set the image of this to a zombie at the beginning because I added some stuff to the button spawned so that it checks to see if there's already an image in there now it didn't actually work out the way I wanted it to but you can look at it if you want I just check to see if the image equals the zombie then I'm just going to go ahead and set enemy type equal to a next to another integer this didn't work out too well because when it does that it doesn't send it back up to the top of the Select case so basically what I wanted to tell you is to set this to 4 and not 3 because it generates 1 it can either be 1 all the way up to 3 it can you don't go one below the max value now this that I added right here works some time sometimes but not all the time so if you want to put that in you can go ahead and do that so go ahead and run this and you can see what happens if you spot an enemy you can see it spawned a villain then a dragon then a zombie a zombie again you can see it's a little more random now and we can spawn different enemies it's not spawning the same one over and over again sometimes we'll get the same one over but it works a little bit better than it did before so I'll just go back to this code you can pause it right here if you need to so put that in if you want it's not necessary but it will help a little bit so what we need to do in order to use our classes from our game class library we need to have game GUI selected and we need to come up here to project and we need to add a reference now we need to reference the dll that we created by you by creating our class library next see there's a whole bunch of stuff that we can reference that's built into the dotnet framework you see I've got a whole bunch of stuff right here we're just gonna select projects and we'll select the game project and we'll click OK ok so we'll come up here and right before forum 1 let's go ahead and create a private variable so we'll do private current enemy now we're not going to set this to an age certain type right now we're gonna do that whenever they spawn an enemy so if they spawn let's say a zombie will type current enemy equals and we want to create a new instance of zombie now since we added a reference to that DLL file what we can do is type enemies library dot Sambi so current enemy is now a zombie and so now that we could our current enemy what we want to do is set some values for this progress bar so we'll come over here and first we need to come over here to the properties and we need to find the max value which is 100 which is what we want it to be so then we'll type progress bar or progress bar enemy sorry I got interrupted there so progress bar enemy dot value is gonna be equal to 100 so let's go ahead and run this and you can see was spawning into me let's spawn until we get a zombie so we spawned a zombie and you can see it set the progress of our value progress bar value equal to 100 now let's go ahead and do this for each of the cases so current enemy it's going to be equal to a new enemies library dot and we're going to do a villain VB now let me get this out of the way real quick you can see that we accidentally made the class villain vbv B instead of just villain but we don't really need to change that so we set the current enemy and to a new villain now let's go ahead and set the progress bar but one thing that we should do instead of just setting the value equal to 100 when you just use indirection so we'll use current enemy dot health so you can see that if we try to access health it's not there that's because when we created this variable it's not said to any sort of data type so what we can do is use polymorphism so if we use enemy's library dot enemy we can create we can make this current enemy any type of enemy we want we can make it a zombie a villain or a dragon and it will it can still be represented as an enemy so if we use current enemy dot health now you can see that it will show up and that we can use it so we just need to use current enemy dot health here so this way instead of having to know the values ourselves and setting them when we create this you know just get the stuff that's already there for us to use so current enemy equals new enemies library dot dragon and then progress bar enemy dot value is going to be equal to current enemy dot health okay so now that we've added the stuff that we need to create a new enemy object and then set the value of the progress bar let's go ahead and test this out and see if everything works fine so let's go ahead and we can spawn an enemy and we spawned a zombie spawn that guy we can spawn the villain we just want the dragon and each time it's actually resetting this progress bar and we just can't see it so go ahead put this code in if you have it you can add this ifelse in diff right here if you want and then make sure you make objects and set the value of the progress bar and once you've done all that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial where we will continue working on this project
