hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about updating the server now we don't want the user to just be able to um put in any server they want and the username um and screw up what's going on and even if they do just put something new in um it's not going to do anything with it because it's already set the username and the password and the server so what we want to do is for each one of these we want to disable them so we'll set enabled equal to false enabled equal to false and then enabled equal to false on this so when they click update server or update settings what we want to do is we want to give them the opportunity to update their settings so let's go ahead and create a bleen up here so private is updating as boine and let's go ahead and set that equal to false so or let's set it equal to yeah false so whenever they click it is updating is going to be equal to not is updating so basically what this means is it's going to um give you the opposite each time you click the button so when you click the the button the first time is updating it's going to be equal to true and then when you click it again it's going to be equal to false so each time this is clicked it just switches this to the opposite and because it's B it's easy to do that so is updating is equal to not is updating which is basically just flip it so if is updating then what do we want to do now we could use if is updating equals to true but we all we have to do is type if is updating so if is updating so if this is true right here then what do we want to do well we want to enable the server um credentials so private sub enable updating so under enable updating we'll just go ahead and type uh text FTP pass. enabled equals true text FTP server. enabled equals true and text FTP user. enabled equals true and what we can do instead of having to create two subs enable updating um and um disable updating we can just do Public Sub updating server and we'll have it take a buen so Bal uh is updating as boine so text FTP F xtp FTP pass. enabled is going to be equal to is updating and now let's go ahead and change this right here to something else so let's just do is up cuz we don't want dup duplicate variables so text FTP server. enabled equals is up and then once again it's going to be equal to is up so if they're updating then what we want to do is type updating server and for the ballen let's just go ahead and do true then what we want to do is we want to set the credentials so FTP downloader uh well before we do that so if it's updating then it's going to enable those and then it's going to change the button label so button update settings. text equals save settings let's make sure this corresponds to what we have or we'll do save server settings so it's going to be equal to that and then what we can do is if not is updating so if they clicked it again um and then um we need to do else if so if they're not updating so if they clicked it and it lets them update it and they it says save server settings and they click it again what we want to do is save those settings so we'll type updating server and we will pass false to that and then we'll set the text button update settings do text is going to be equal to update server okay so now what we want to do is we we want to save their settings so FTP downloader dot username is going to be equal to text FTP user um. text and then we'll set the password and the server and then we'll just go ahead and trim that to get rid of any white spaces so we can go ahead and run this and when we click update server it gives us save server settings and let's just leave it the same and when we click save server settings it's going to save those settings now what we can also do is we can disable all these buttons whenever that's happening so that they can't use them so go ahead put this code in and then once you've done that move on to the next tutorial
