now that we've covered cellular structures it's time to move on to Cellular division my name is Sarah and in this video I'm going to be talking about binary fision and mitosis despite the differences between procaryotic cell division and ukar cell division they do share some common features you have to have DNA replication you have to have segregation of the new DNA molecules and you have to have cyto Kinesis which is where these cells actually split apart procaryotic organisms are going to replicate by what is called binary fision procaryotic organisms are only going to have one circular chromosome so that's going to replicate copies of each chromosome are going to attach to different parts of the cell membrane by what is called a mesosome the cells are going to pull apart and then you have cytokinesis resulting in the parent cell which is the original cell and the daughter cell which is the new cell procaryotic division is very simple compared to eukaryotic cell division eukaryotic organisms are going to go through a cell cycle there are four phases in the cell cycle you have the G1 phase or the Gap one phase which is where growth occurs and synthesis of molecules that the cell needs to grow and function cells that don't divide any longer such as neurons will be in the growth one phase forever they're not going to divide anymore they're not going to need to replicate their DNA or anything like that the S phase is called the DNA synthesis phase the G2 phase or Gap 2 phase is where the cell prepares prepares for mitosis and the M phase is the mitosis phase G1 s and G2 phases are collectively termed interphase which means the cell is not activ actively dividing eukaryotic cell division is going to involve a couple of steps you've got the division of the nucleus which is called Kinesis and then you have the division of the rest of the cell the cytoplasm and all the organel which is called cyto canis somatic cells or body cells are going to um accomplish Karo Kinesis by what is called mitosis sex cells or gates are going to accomplish Kinesis by what is called meiosis and like I said in this video we're going to be covering mitosis so before a cell can divide it has to replicate its DNA which is found in the nucleus cells do this during interphase during interfase the nucleus is a distinct organel it is bound by the nuclear membrane DNA exists as UK chromatin which is just long stringy strands of DNA it's not very coiled and it allows for transcription or the reading of DNA to occur so the cell can synthesize proteins and other molecules it needs to grow and function mitosis is the division of the nucleus it is composed of four different steps you've got prophase metaphase anaphase and tase the way I was always taught to remember this was Preta and aella it sounds kind of dumb but it works during prophase chromatin is going to condense and coil to form what are called chromosomes the nucleoli and nuclear membrane are going to begin to disappear centrioles if the cell has them are going to migrate to opposite ends of the cell and spinal fibers are going to begin to form before we move on to the next step there are a couple of vocabulary terms you need to somatic cells are diploid this means they contain two copies of every chromosome you've got one from the mother and one from the father chromosomes when they condense are composed of what are called chromatids for example this is a chromosome each half of the chromosome is a chromatid these are just identical replications of the same DNA so you've got one chromatid from your mother it replicates to form the chromosome which contains two chromatids and then one chromatid from your father it replicates to form the chromosome from your father chromatids are joined by what is called a centrom miror which is this little black dot in the middle and then you've got homologous chromosomes you've got the chromosome from your mother and the chromosome from your father they contain the exact same DNA the same genes but these genes may be in different forms and these different forms are called Al but anyways as you can see you've got the nuclear membrane is beginning to disappear got your cental here and and your spindle fibers coming out from your centrioles during metaphase all the chromosomes are going to line up in the middle of the cell by this time the nucleus has completely disappeared and the spindle fibers are going to begin to attached to centr at locations called kinetic cor and you can see in this drawing all the chromosomes are lined up in the middle the spindal fibers are attached and the nucleus nuclear MBR is completely gone during anaphase each side of the chromosome which are called the chromatids are going to be pulled to opposite sides of the cell see if you noticed in the last picture it was they were all attached during anaphase these two are going to be pulled apart and during the last phase of mitosis the spindle fibers are going to detach the cytoplasm begins to separate into two parts the plasma membrane is going to pin pch in from both sides and the nucleus is going to reform chromosomes begin to end coil new centrioles are formed and the cell is going to begin to enter reenter interphase and this is just a picture of tase you can see the plasma membrane begin to pinch in all the chromosomes excuse me chromatids are on opposite sides now the last part of cell division is cyto Canis which is the separation of the cytoplasm this is when new organel are going to be synthesized and it forms this thing called a cleavage Furrow which is when the cell is actually going to split and you can see here you've got your mitochondria all your others organel they're going to divide and each like the organells are just going to go to each new cell you've got the parent cell and the daughter cell but that is all I have for mitosis and cellular division for now but in the next video I'll cover meosis which is the process of division for sex cells
