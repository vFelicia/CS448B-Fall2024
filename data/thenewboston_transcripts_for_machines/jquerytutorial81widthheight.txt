hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we're going to be taking a look at the height and width properties in jQuery and how we can retrieve the height and the width of any particular element uh obviously we can also then apply this to the document window or the document itself or the browser window and the document itself so the first thing I'm going to go ahead and do is create a div on the page uh and we'll just put some content in here it doesn't really matter uh what we do um with regards to the ID let's go ahead and give it a name of something just like div something generic uh I'm then going to go ahead and style this uh so we can actually set uh some properties to it ourself so the first thing I'm just going to do is give it a background color uh just so we can see uh the sort of physical height and width of it uh and then I'm going to go ahead and actually set a height and width to it so I'm going to give it 100 pixel and the width I'm going to give it 250 pixels so on our page now we can see uh that we've got a div here with some content and it's 250 width and 100 height so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead uh in actual fact probably better to get rid of this content and I'm going to replace the content inside of the div with the height and the width of the div so we uh come over to ext.js which I have included on my page as well as jQuery and we can start to write our code out in here so I'm first of all going to say document. ready just when the Dom's loaded and we are ready to start um you know start outputting we just do this usually in J uh in jQuery uh and I'm going to go ahead and set uh two variables the first is div height and this is going to be equal to and we're going to reference or we're going to select this div and that's just called div so we can go ahead and say hashd and all we need to do is go ahead and apply the height property so uh yeah I knew I'd spell that wrong so yeah okay now we're going to go ahead and get the width so we do exactly the same thing uh but this time obviously uh it's quite easy to guess we would just apply width to the end so now I'm going to go ahead and output this to the div itself so div. text and in here I can go ahead and write something like um width width yeah that's right width x and or width x height X so X I'm just going to go ahead and replace with uh by appending this on uh and I'm going to replace the div width and I'm going to do the same with X so I can just append this on to the the end of this string uh and that is div height so this is obviously in pixels when we refresh you can see that we get a representation of the div width and the div height there are other ways to do this for example we could go ahead and use the CSS property uh so we could go ahead and use CSS here uh and then Supply or ask for the height and we could go ahead and then say CSS and then Supply width in there uh and what this will do is it will return more or less the same thing but you'll see that we'll get the PX on the end of it um and the there's two ways that why this is unreliable and may require more processing power uh the reason being is that for example if we were to uh use this and we wanted to use it as an integer this doesn't return it as an integer it only returns with uh the absolute value in the style. CSS file uh or the the CSS that's applied to it so what we would need to do is go ahead and use pass int now obviously the first uh downfall of this or the uh downside to this is that we're unnecessarily processing uh this uh and passing it as an integer and pass in it's just going to obviously pass the value as an integer and just go ahead and remove PX uh so we can we can do it that way but you know why write all this out when it's completely unnecessary uh and you could go ahead and use the width and height options uh like this and like this so uh the other reason that we would go ahead and do it like this is because we might not have predefined a uh a height and a width to this div for example the content might have filled up the div to the point where uh it's at a size that we haven't defined you know the content might not overlap but push the div and create more width or more height to it so using height and width will always return an integer which is one benefit less processing power uh and not having to use pass in and the other benefit is that it will get the height and the width reliably you know regardless of the content that we add so for example uh at the moment you can see it's width 250 and height 100 if I was to go ahead and inside of the div write um let's just say text and then break and let's just copy and paste this a few times and then in EXT change this to aend because we obviously don't want to rewrite over our content uh you can now see that oh okay yeah so right uh let's just go ahead and get rid of style in here so we have a div now that will just sort of like overflow the content uh you can now see that the you know the properties have changed for this we've got different width I'm not sure what oh that's just because it automatically went to the edge of the document
