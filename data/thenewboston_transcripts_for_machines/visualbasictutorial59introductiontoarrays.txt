hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be looking at arrays now let's say you have a bunch of values that you want to be stored as the same name such as classes or um clients or something like that but you can't create the same variable over and over again so what you can do is create an array which has one name but it can hold a bunch of different values so let's go ahead and and create a little demo project to take a look and see how arrays work so we'll go ahead and click new project we will select Windows forms application and we will set the name to arrays and we'll go ahead and click okay now we will make our form a little bit bigger and we'll open the tool box and we will add a button and a list box so so we'll stretch out the list box a bit we'll close out of the toolbox and then we'll make the button a little bit bigger so we will set the name of the list box to list arrays so we'll just type list arrays and we'll set the name of the button to button add array now we'll set the text value to add array elements so we'll just go ahead and double click on ADD array elements to open up the click Handler for that so now what we need to do is come down here and create a sub that will clear the list so private sub clear list now inside of this we'll type list arrays. items. CLE so this will clear all the items in the array and we're going to be using clear list a lot and it's easier to type clear list than it is to type all this out right here so whenever the user clicks button add array we want to go ahead and clear the list just in case there's anything else in there and now what we need to do is declare our array so to do this we'll type dim and then we're going to specify a name for our array so string classes and then we're going to have two parentheses and inside these parentheses we're going to tell the compiler um how long we want our array to be so if we type five it's going to be six elements long because when you're counting it starts at zero so it'll go 0 1 2 3 4 5 which is six items now we have to specify what data type it's going to be so we'll just type as string so each one of the items in there is going to be a string so now I'll type string classes and now I need to reference an index of this array so the item at the index of zero we're going to set that equal to web design and we'll go through and do this for each one of the items in the array now you can name them whatever you want I'm just going to do um classes here so we'll type Spanish and we'll just keep adding more for okay so now that we've set a value for each one of the items in our array starting at zero going through five we're going to go ahead and use a for Loop to add all those items to our list so we're going to go ahead and start off by typ typing for Num one or let's just do num as integer now you do not have to use as integer because integer is the default for the for Loop but I'm just going to go ahead and do it anyway so for Num one as integer we're going to set it equal to zero because the starting point is going to be zero and then we're going to do two so let's say that we don't know the length of this array so what we can do to get around uh not knowing the length we can just do string classes. length and this is going to get the length of it now we have one problem here it goes from zero and then the length of string classes is actually going to be six because there's six items in here so to fix that we can just do string classes length minus one which will go from 0 to 5 and so now what we need to do is type list arrays. items. add and we'll do string classes and now for the index we're going to use num so so the first time this Loop is run num is going to be equal to zero so it's going to access string classes and then at the index of zero which is web design and then the next time it goes through it's going to be one which is Spanish and it's going to go through everything until it gets to calculus and then it's going to stop so if we go ahead and run this program you can see here's our form and here's our list and now if we click add array elements you can see that it adds web design Spanish chemistry English History and calculus now if we were to take out one of these lines right here and run it we would get an error because you cannot reference a null value so if you're going to go ahead and practice and make some arrays make sure you populate the whole array and before you try to print it out in a list box or else you're going to get an error so I'm go ahead practice make a couple arrays you don't have to they don't have to be strings they can be doubles ins floats long whatever you like um just just make sure you know how to make arrays you know how to set the values to it and you know how to access different parts of that array and once you've got that down and you know you're not going to forget it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
