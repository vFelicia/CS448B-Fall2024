so today we're going to talk about how we combine like terms and when I say combining like terms what I mean is we're going to collect each term which is each one of these things right here so that the similar ones we add and subtract to each other so for this first one I have 8x plus 5y minus 17 X well since each one of these has an X in it I can add this one and this one together so 8x minus 17 X is negative 9 X plus 5y well since Y this one has X and this one has Y we can't combine those because they're not like terms so this is all we can do with this particular one we're going to do the same thing with this one this has an X this has an X this is just a constant so we're going to combine these 7x night or excuse me 7 X plus negative 11 gives me negative 4x and then minus 8 so sometimes when you start combining like terms you might want to circle it so you see which one's you add together especially when you have more than one term so we have 3 a negative 9 a 2 a 5c and negative C so now we're going to add these together 3 a minus 9 a gives me negative 6 a plus 2 a gives me negative 4a plus 5 C minus C gives me 4 C okay now this one is a little bit more difficult than any of the ones we've done before because we have terms that have a squared in them so first we're going to look for all the similar terms so this is three X Y this is four X Y and this one has x squared Y and Y and X Y squared well these this one is not similar to the other three because this one has x squared Y this one's just X Y XY XY squared and this one is not similar for the exact same reason so we're going to add these two together we're going at 7 X Y and then we just have to recopy this second part because we don't have any terms similar to those okay now this one is a little more tricky so I'm going to just going to circle all the like ones in the same color so this is 5y squared X this is x squared Y this is oh look this is another y squared X here and that's all we have for y squared X's okay look this one is negative 2x squared Y and this is negative x squared Y and then we have 2 XY + 3 X Y so now we're going to add these all each term together so we're going to add these two those two and those two so 5y squared X plus 8y squared X gives me 13 Y squared X negative 2 x squared y minus x squared Y gives me negative 3x squared y and 2xy plus 3xy gives me positive 5x y now this one's a lot simpler each one of these terms has an A in it so we're just going to add them together 11 plus 30 a gives you 41 a minus 18 gives us 23 a so that's how we're doing with combining like terms but make sure you come back and we're going to talk about solving equations
