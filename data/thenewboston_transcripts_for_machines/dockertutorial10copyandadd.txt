all righty guys welcome back to another video and in this tutorial i am gonna be teaching you guys how to use the copy and add keywords to move files from your local operating system your normal working environment into your image in that way the purpose of this and it's typically by the way source code that you're moving over but anyways the point of this is that whenever anyone else builds your container not only do they have all those services like postgres and redis but they have the actual source code as well like your html files your images so on and so forth the total package so just is a quick uh little prerequisite i created this temp2 directory and that's where i'm at right now in my command line and we have a couple assets in here we have this directory called corn which i already packed up into this tar file and then we have a directory called html files which has one apples.html file in it and then a sample text file nothing about these are like special i just wanted to have three different types of assets because the way that we move them over it's it's a little bit different so again it doesn't matter what they're named or you know what's actually in these text files just want to have these different ones to kind of demonstrate some different concepts all right so let's go ahead and get started of course since you know what we're trying to do is create an image from a docker file first thing we need is an actual docker file so i'm gonna go nano and create a docker file now the very first thing that we're gonna need is a base image and we'll just go with alpine since it's the most lightweight really doesn't matter for this tutorial but we'll stick with alpine now the keyword that we're going to be discussing first is the copy keyword now what the copy keyword is going to do is it's going to instruct docker to copy files or directories from the source i'll just uh make a little template there from the source location and this is the location on your local operating system your actual computer and it's going to be copying them over to the destination now the destination is the file system of the container or in other words the image that's going to become a container that we're going to be creating now the very first command i'm going to be showing you guys is actually not going to be part of our final product because it's going to kind of ruin the rest of my tutorial if i include this but i want to show it to you guys anyways because you're going to see this a lot and that is people typically or i don't want to say typically a common thing is to copy all of the content from the current directory over to a target folder so you might see something like this and what this means is take everything inside temp2 where we're at right now and copy over into an app directory in the image now again i don't want to do that because i want to show you some tricky things of copying files one by one so the first thing we actually are going to be doing is taking this html files directory and moving this into a app slash html so you guys can probably guess how you would do this copy again current directory forward slash html files and then i'm going to be copying over to app slash html so again it's going to take all the content from here and copy over to a new folder app slash html and that's where it's going to land up in our final image now if you ever want to copy over a single file then what you can do is well i'll show you guys it's pretty selfexplanatory but walk you through it anyways so copy sample.txt over to app slash sample.txt so again what it's going to do is take this file and just move it to a new folder in our images file system and that location is app sample.txt plain and simple so copy copy take files from here move them over there okay i got it so what's the point of this ad keyword we were talking about so add is actually very similar to copy but it allows us to unpack tar files as well as use a url is the source so it's kind of like copy for um in special cases you can think of it like that a special use case of copy if you will so that is why in case you guys were wondering why i have this tar file because we need to add keyword for that so what i'm going to do is include add corn dot tar and we can just move that into our app directory as our target and last but not least and actually have this copied actually let me pull it up on a browser show you guys what's going on all right so i'm just gonna move this svg and this is just the logo of the new boss then bump it up so you guys can see and i just wanna what is this get out of here thing i just wanna show you guys this because i want to demonstrate the idea of taking a file from a url and including it in your image as well so what we're going to do in that case is just add and then all right so you guys can't see it but all of the uh the entire url is there my screen is just a little bit squished together so i can show it on my tutorial but we're going to take that url that svg file and copy it over to app images and i actually want to rename this one since i don't like that big long name of logo.svg alright so it looks like we have everything ported over and looks good to go so i'm just going to save that and just to show you guys the final product of all right so we have from alpine we're gonna copy over html files this one file and then again what this is gonna do right here is not only just copy this file directly but since we have the add keyword it's going to unpack that and then of course this is just showing that we can grab files from the internet as well so let's clear out in docker build period so docker build period and all right looking good now i'm just gonna get that id for docker image ls and it should be this top one and all right so let's run this container and see if it worked so docker run and we actually want to shell in so we can you know poke around navigate around and make sure that everything worked correctly and that was the id of the image and then i'm just gonna run shell is my default command and let's run ls la and see what we got all right so looks like we got that app folder which is good so let's navigate into that and if we run lsla here all right so first thing it looks like we did indeed copy over that sample.txt file correctly and now what i want to do is just navigate into corn and all right looks like we got corn one in corn two and if you see this this tar file was just this uh directory packed into a tar file and indeed it did have corn one and corn two in it and what else do we got over here so let me navigate out here all right we have html and let's navigate there all right so in html we do have apples.html indeed last but not least let's look in images so cd images and yes we have that logo svg so all right that and i'll pull this up so you guys have something to look at while i'm doing my little outro here but that is the difference between copy and add again both keywords that allow you to take files and folders from your local operating system and copy those over into your image that you can deploy whenever people run the container they can see all those very useful but yeah um nothing else to say really so uh thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and i'll see you in the next video
