so today we're jumping ahead a little bit to surface area of rectangular prism now rectangular prism is a 3d object that has six sides or faces and I'm going to shade in the faces as we talk about them so opposite sides or faces are parallel and congruent so this face right here which is the top of the prism like the top of a box is going to be congruent to the bottom of the prism or the bottom of the box this right side right here is going to be congruent to this left side right here and this is going to be the hard one to see is this front this front of the box is congruent to this back of the box which you can't really see because I can't show you the back of the box on paper so to find the service area find find the area of each face and add so for a rectangular prison prism excuse me we can take the area of the top times two because that's also this the area of the top is equal to the area of the bottom plus the area of the right times 2 plus the area of the front times two now that's only for this for a rectangular prism when we go and talk about triangular prisms it's going to be a little bit different so let's do an example so find the surface area of each prism so first we're going to find the surface area the area of this front and this back if you can see it right there okay so this right here is a rectangle so we're going to take 9 which is the length times if you look at this one this one's 5 and since it's a rectangular prism this one also has to be five so we're going to take nine times five which gives us 45 for the for this front piece and in order to get the back piece as well we're going two times this by 2 which equals 90 so to the front face and the back face together have an area of 90 so now we're going to do this side right here and this left side right here and since those are congruent we're going to do the same thing we did with this one so we're going to take the area of this one which is four times five she'll give us 20 and we're going to times that by 2 to get 40 now that takes care of both this side on this side so now we have one more thing to find the area of which is this top right here and this bottom right here so we're going to do the same thing we're going to take except this time it's going to be nine because that's this side of the box times 4 which is the width of the box so a is equal to 36 and we're going to multiply it by 2 to get the bottom and the top so and we get the area of that part of 72 so now we're going to take this and this and this and add them all together to get the surface area of the whole thing so 90 plus 40 plus 72 and if you type that into a calculator you'll get the surface area is equal to 202 so now we have one more example we're going to do and it's a triangular prism this time so we're going to have this prism does not have six rectangular faces instead it has three this one this right one this left one and then this bottom one so we're going to have three rectangular prisms and then to this front and this back that are triangular so each one of these prisms is going to be congruent because this is 5 and this is 5 so that and then that means this one is also 5 and this was also five so they're all going to have the same dimensions so we're going to take for the area of the rectangle we're going to take 5 times 5 which gives us 25 and we're going to multiply that by 2 because it will give the area because the area across from it is going to be the exact same so 50 for these two for the bottom their area is also going to be 5 times 5 because we have this length and this width so 25 and now we need the area of these two triangles right here so they'd ruin this height for us until this those four millimeters so to find the area of this triangle we're going to take one half base x height one half of 4 is 2 2 times 6 is 12 we're going to multiply that by 2 because we have two triangular faces so x 2 equals 24 now to get the total surface area we're going to take this Plus this Plus this and we get area is equal to 50 + 25 + 24 so area is equal to 50 plus 25 is 75 plus 24 gives us 99 so our surface area is 99 meter squared now even though this is a threedimensional object we're still in meters squared because we're we just want the surface area if we were finding volume then we'd be in meters cubed so I just remembered that we left units off of this one so we're just going to go back and add our units real quick so where was our final answer right here so it should have been two hundred and two inches squared but that's all we're going to do with surface area make sure you come back because in the next lesson we're finally going to get to learn how to do volume of
