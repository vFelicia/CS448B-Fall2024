hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be continuing working on the game so whenever the timer ticks that is used to delay the attack what we want to do is call enemy attack now we haven't created this sub yet so let's go ahead and come down here we'll type private sub enemy attack so whenever they attack what we want to do is type current enemy dot attack so you may be wondering if you already typed this code in why this hasn't shown up well the reason is because I went into each one of these classes and change the attack names or the names of the subs to just attack instead of say zombie attack or villain attack so go ahead ignore the overloads that I have there let's see so change each one of those to attack and then come back in to form one DB so current enemy dot attack and then after we do that what we want to do is update the progress bar so progress bar Popeye dot value is going to be equal to hero dot now you can see that we're getting an error right here that's because we need to reference user health as integer so we'll just type hero health so that we can access the property health now all we need to do is enclose this in a try block so we will try to set the value to the current health of Popeye and if it's below zero it will throw an error and we'll be ready to catch that error so if that happens what we want to do is type message box dot Show Popeye has and then we will type here o dot health equals 100 so it pretty much responds him and then we need to set progress bar pop I dot value equals 0 dot health so we'll update the progress bar and then after all this has done what we need to do is stop the timer so timer delay dot stop and then the timer will be started back up again when they click attack now in order for us to use this attack method right here it may be different for each one of the enemies and it will be different so we've got a default attack inside of enemy it says attack it used to be default attack but I changed it to attack so if we just just leave this the way it is it's going to always call the attack that's used in enemy because we declared current enemy of type enemy so what we need to do is come into our enemy DB class and we need to come into public sub attack and we need to make it over writable so now we can override the attack sub in each one of our classes that inherits from enemy so we'll open up dragon and we need to type overrides so this attack overrides to the one an enemy and we'll do that for each one of these so that it uses the appropriate attack sub each time we call it whenever the villain attacks so public overrides and let's come down here and see what our error is uhhuh so let's make that usual health equals 8 so we'll minimize out of this let's go ahead and come into form 1 and we will run this and hopefully everything will work fine so we can go ahead and attack it takes away some health and then a second later he attacks us we can attack again takes away some health and then he attacks us we can use spinach and then he attack that's again and then each time it will attack so we can attack one more time he'll attack back and then the last time it says Popeye as one and it spawns a new enemy now Popeye barely has any health left so if we attack the enemy the enemy attacks us you can see that Popeye dies and we have created an infinite loop so what we need to do is to find out where this is so we'll just copy this right here and we'll stop the timer before this has done okay so now let's go ahead let's make Popeye lose on the first try so we'll come into the zombie and whenever he eats brains Popeye will lose 50 so we'll open this up and let's spawn an enemy until we get a zombie so here's our zombie we will attack the zombie and then the autonomy I'm the autonomy the zombie will attack back we can attack again and let's wait until it gets the eat brain so you can see that a whole bunch goes away there we can attack again and you see that Popeye loses and Popeye responds so in order to make this look a little bit better let's come back into form on BB and whenever he attacks let's go ahead and update this to zero so before it shows the message box we will type progress for our Popeye dot value equals zero so that the user will see the value and know that he is dead so then we'll come over here to button attack and we'll do that for this tomb so if it's below zero then progress bar enemy thought value equals zero so that they know that the enemy has died so let's go ahead and run this and let's spawn another enemy so we got a villain we can spawn a zombie let's fight a dragon so we can click attack and in a second later is it taxed back and then we can keep fighting this dragon and then hopefully we will win and you see that says Popeye has one and it spawns a new enemy so go ahead put this code in if you have it it'll help you learn a lot faster if you're actually putting the code in and editing it yourself and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
