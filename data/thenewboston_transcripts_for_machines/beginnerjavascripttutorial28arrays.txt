what is going on guys is Bucky and welcome to your 28th JavaScript tutorial now before we continue talking about objects I need to talk to you guys about something called an array and the reason I need to do this is because objects use very often this thing called an array so before I start talking to you about how to use an array with your objects I need to actually teach you guys what an array is why it's useful how to create them and all that fun stuff so basically I'm going to put it as simple as possible an array is basically a way to store multiple values in a single variable or in other words a single object so before we had one variable and one value well now we can have more than one value in the same variable server saying all right Bucky that just seems confusing complex why on earth would you want to do that well believe it or not whenever you're working with long lists of like people's names or ages or maybe a long list of Social Security numbers it's a lot easier and faster to create an array and it's a lot more easier to manage whenever you're working with a long list there you go so let me show you guys a quick example of something you would need to create an array with so for example if you had to list on like a bunch of people's names you might do this far person 1 equals Bucky far person 2 equals Tommy and you do this 800 times well that's going to take 800 lines of code and then if you had print them all out we'll take another 800 lines of code and it just gets all jumbled so an easier way we can do this is to create something called an array and then whenever you had to list them all and print them out and my only take 10 lines of code so now you can begin seeing the advantages so let's go ahead and learn how to first create an array creating an array is similar to creating a new object in by that I mean you go ahead and type a variable and then you type the name of your array so let's go ahead and make an array with a bunch of people's names so I'm going to name my array people make sense so now what you have to do just like when you're creating a new instance a new but instead of your object name you go ahead and write the name over ray and this is builtin this is always going to be named array in this type of JavaScript we're about to create a new array plain and simple now as your parameters you go ahead and type all of the values you want to store in that people array so the first value I want to store is Bucky the second one is Tommy the third one is Sarah um the fourth one is Hannah with one end who cares and the fifth one is um monkey my kitty who the heck cares so now you can see instead of creating five different lines with five different variables and five different values we've made this all on one mine how easy and compact is that starting area saying all right that kind of makes sense so you have five different values and one variable it looks like so whenever I'm trying to use this later on like documents if I spell all right documents dots right okay bulky what how am I supposed to print out like the name Buckey or something well if I go ahead and type people I know that's the name of the array but how does it know what one I'm supposed to be talking about right here well we have an array created right here and whenever we want to access one of the values of it we have to add something called an array index now an array index is basically this each of these values in here is numbered and remember whenever you teach a kid to count you probably tell them to start at 1 1 2 3 4 5 but with computers computers talk in all zeros and ones and just remember anytime you're working with computers computers learn to start counting is you rrrow people learn to start counting the 1 so this computer is going to say 0 1 2 3 4 so whenever you want to access this one it wouldn't be 3 it would be 0 1 2 RA so now we know that each of these values is labeled with a number called in index 0 1 2 3 4 so how do we access that well you go ahead and you write the name of your array and then in between square brackets you write the number of that index so Bucky would be 0 so now if we go ahead and save this and print it out check it out Bucky right there so now let's go ahead and access like something like Hana 0 1 2 3 so people 3 should be Hana save that and print it out Hana simple enough so the only thing that you have to remember is this in order to create an array just go ahead and write the name of your array and then go ahead and write new array and then write as many values as you want inside your array and anytime you want to access it you just write the name of your array and in between square brackets go ahead and write that index and remember unlike whenever people count computers going to start with 1 they start with 0 so 0 1 2 3 4 so you can access any of these elements by using the index 0 through 4 and look what happens whenever you try to access something outside like 5 it's going to give you something called undefined because your computer's not going to know where you're talking about so go ahead and save this and refresh and it says undefined this is pretty much JavaScript's way of saying you got an error you did something wrong go fix it so basically that is how you create an array and in the future tutorials I'm going to be showing you why these are useful and why it's a lot easier than creating just multiple variables but for now that's all I got for you guys so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe
