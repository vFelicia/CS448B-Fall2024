but we're going to be taking a look at the maximum and minimum widths and Heights a bit later on anyway okay so for the rest of the options I'm going to remove the bigger box just so we can see everything a bit better so I'm going to get rid of the bigger box from here and now again we're just left with the smaller box that we can still resize so let's go ahead and take a look at some of the other options that we can define in here now the first one we're going to look at is animate and we can set this to either true or false by default it's false so what's going to happen here is when we drag we don't actually see the drag happen but when we release it resizes to the size that you've defined now there is a problem here that you can't actually see where you're dragging to so I could you know drag over here and it will animate nicely but we can't actually see where we are actually dragging it to before it animates so to fix this we use the ghost option and by default this is set to false but now we're going to set it to true will actually see a lower opacity version of the div that you are or the element that you are resizing before the animation happens so you can see that at the moment I'm dragging that there you can see the opacity set much lower and then that will resize to a particular area so you can see the ghost of the div or the element before you actually decide to drag it or before the user actually drags it with regards to the animation we can set a few different properties here so for example we could set animate duration and this just is the speed of the animation in milliseconds we can also specify things like slow medium and fast or sorry not medium normal and fast so for example if we were to set the animation duration to slow when we go ahead and resize it its well that's that's classed as slow if we were to go ahead and change this to fast you can see that you have a much faster effect when it resizes so it's quite quicker or you can go ahead like I said and define this in milliseconds so we could say 50 for example which would be extremely quick and when we resize it almost snaps to it so depending on what kind of effect you're looking for you can do this obviously if we work out something like three seconds which is 3,000 milliseconds you can see it you know slides a lot quicker at slower sorry and with regards to animation as well we can use animation easing techniques so we can also define anim animate easing and you can set it to by default it's set to swing but you can set it to linear so let's just check out swing that's the default option you can see particularly when it's very slow that as it gets towards the end it slows down so it's almost like a graph that starts low so when the animation starts it starts slowly it speeds up and then it slows down again this is the swing animation easing effect if we were to use linear it will resize exactly the same speed every time you can see then it just stops so depending on again the how you want it to look this will just slide at a constant pace as opposed to swing so I'm just going to remove this animation duration and remove this animate easing so we can see some other options now another useful option is the aspect ratio if you'll try to maintain a particular aspect ratio you can go ahead and turn this on so for example if I was just to say true what will happen now is I can't resize out of the actual aspect ratio the original aspect ratio of the object or the element so now that I've set this to true I can't actually move it for example I can't resize from the sides the aspect ratio is maintained however with the aspect ratio you can also predefined an aspect ratio that you want it to adhere to so for example you could do this in in a point something form so for example 0.40 this would just keep it in this aspect ratio here and then now that object is bound to that particular aspect ratio you can also define a fraction for example 2 over 5 or 2 by 5 and this would also allow you to do this so for example you could do 9/10 and then this would keep a 9/10 aspect ratio so it's 9 width and 10 height so that's the aspect ratio just keeping it to true though will maintain the initial aspect ratio that it holds so let's go ahead and get rid of that okay so back on is more a more aesthetic option we're going to go ahead and enable auto hide now what auto hide does is it hides the tiny triangle that you can see in the corner of this div until the mouse is hovered over the element in which you are reciting so if we were to set auto hide to true and we refresh you can see that the triangle has actually disappeared however when I hover my mouse over this particular element the small triangle appears again so I can now go ahead and resize this so that's quite useful if you don't want to show this on let's say you had a lot of resizable objects you don't want to show this on every single object and if it's obvious that a particular element can be resized you might not want to show this however be careful because if you don't show this initially it does just look like a grey box the small triangle in the corner often represents something that can be resized so it's entirely up to you on whether you were to keep it there I like to keep also hide off generally but again if you had lots of elements that are able to be resized it tends to look better when you enable auto hide okay so another thing we can do is we can specify a grid now we saw this in the draggable interaction in the jQuery UI as well and with the grid we can specify a numerical value with l2 numerical value within square brackets that represent a grid that the element will snap to
