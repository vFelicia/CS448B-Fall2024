what's up guys is Bucky welcome to another PHP tutorial and in this tutorial I'm gonna be talking about inheritance now before I go on you guys probably notice something's different from this story from last tutorial already and that is because I'm working with a new text editor and that is because I have a video uploading on my PC right now so I had to hop over to my Mac to make these tutorials so I had to download this text editor called text Wrangler and never used it before but they didn't have no pad plus plus for a Mac so anyways if I do something stupid like press a button or if I'm doing something weird then you know just let me know but anyways that's why I'm using the new text editor I actually when I uploaded this video I was gonna just play call of duty but I just texted my friend I'm like game time and he's like I'm eating dinner then I'm gonna see my girlfriend and so anyways no call of duty for me tonight so just making stories instead so good for you guys bad for me so anyways let's get right into it inheritance now inheritance is one of the key reasons why people prefer to use objectoriented PHP one of the many reasons but one of the biggest as well now inheritance is a lot like clone I think I taught you guys about clone last time I'm not sure though it's pretty much inheriting all the methods in all the variables from one class it pretty much takes everything from one class and imports it into another class so uh if you ever like read about it in a book they'll give you like eighteen chapters about it but that's basically all it is so let's go ahead and get coding this by the way it's a lot different typing on a Mac than it is BC so yeah you didn't need to know that but anyways class let's go ahead and make a new class the parent now whenever you use inheritance you always have to inherit from some class it's like a hierarchy like whenever you in hair something like if your grandma dies there always has to be someone you inherit from you just don't uninhibit from my god or whatever so anyways the order we say this in is the child inherits from parent so the parent is gonna have the class with all the stuff in it and the child class is gonna be the class where all that stuff goes into so anyways let's go ahead and and by the way they don't need to be named the parent I just want to make a very descriptive name so we don't get confused there so you can name it class anything name it tuna fish ham sandwich for all I care anyways go ahead and make a variable in here make sure it's public by the way okay okay Mac go and crazy on me already okay public and I name something stupid like p1 and go ahead and name this like I am a variable make sure you spell it totally wrong and let's go ahead and make a function like function some function looks like a pretty beautiful function right there okay Mac take it easy I should name my Mac Mac there we go tab what the heck's this little swirly key over here Oh anyways alright let's go ahead and just do something in this function like echo I am a funky monkey why not that sounds ridiculous so anyways so we have a class called the parent with variable and a function this is just a normal regular class but say we had another class right here called class the child and we're saying all right I made this other class called the child and what I want to do is I want to get this variable and this function inside this class but I'm Way too lazy to copy and paste it because you know if I do that that's gonna create a whole bunch of code anyways and you know pretty much lazy is just the biggest factor here so how can I get everything in here in here without having to retype it all well anytime you want to inherit all the stuff from some class what you need to do is this ext en D s extends and write the name of the class you want to inherit from right after it so the parent looking good so anyways before I go on I want to say one thing whoever gave us the keyword extend I just want to tell you this is the worst choice of keyword ever this is called inheritance so why not make this word and hair it or inherits from I don't know but anyways you have to use this dumb word extends and it basically means inherits from so now here's what's happening behind the scenes whenever you write extends the parent where you're telling PHP is this this class right here inherit everything from this class right here so even though there's nothing in this class PHP knows that it inherited everything in this class so whenever we make an object that's of the child and we K say all right the child has a variable called p1 actually let's just go ahead and type it so let's go ahead and make an object child object equals new the child so again what we're doing is we're making an object from this class right here and you're saying Bucky there's nothing in that class well actually there is there's a variable and a function and it thinks to this right here so we can go ahead and echo out something like child object and like p1 and just go ahead and way too lazy to type all that all right copy that and by the way if you have a Mac and a PC you always I always do this instead of hitting like copy and paste i always accidentally hit FN copy and paste and it's annoying because the command key and the control key are different on the two keyboard so anyways watch out for that if you have both computers because it's extremely annoying so well it definitely should change that some I spell that right I guess we'll find out in a little bit so anyways check this out I made a child object right here and I echoed out the variable and the function and you're saying alright Bucky but didn't you forget to type that in that class right there well since it inherited from the parent class what it said it was it take took everything from the parent class and threw in the child class so you though can't see it it's there trust me so let me go ahead and save this and open up my Google Chrome right there refreshing move this over connection what's going on here oh I see like disconnected because I was inactive for 15 seconds okay overwrite that Oh oh my god since I'm uploading this video everything's going slow but let's go ahead and refresh my web page now and check this out I am a variable there's my variable right here and I am funky Munky there's my function right here so what we did if I can move this out of the way where's TextWrangler now all right so what we did is we made a parent class right here and you we pretty much made two classes Class A and Class B now we wanted everything from Class A to go in the Class B but we are way too lazy to type it so what we can do instead is write extends the parent right like that and now this Class B has this variable and this function without without having to retype it and if we went ahead and made another variable and set it equal to like 9 it would have this variable this variable and this function so that's pretty much the concept behind inheritance without my mess up pseudocode right there it's pretty much a way of getting everything from one class into another class without having or type it or copy and paste or anything like that so don't read any books because they give you the most weirdest most messedup analogies and metaphors and it just confuses you that's all inheritance is right there so anyways thank you guys for watching I don't forget to subscribe I'm gonna try to figure out how to use my Mac and I guess I'll see you next tutorial
