hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a PHP video tutorial for the New Boston now in this tutorial I'm going to be demonstrating to how we're going to connect to a mySQL database in some of my previous tutorials we've gone through um creating our database which we've named aore database we've also looked at um privileges with inside so we've I've explained that we've got our um usernames here and everything uh if we just go back to home in general and we click priv privileges sorry we can add a new user but for now I'm using root on Local Host with no password so I'm going to show you how we can connect to our database first of all and then select this database that we've named aore database so this is our page that we're going to preview everything on now the first thing to do is to call the MySQL connect function and this is written like this MySQL connect and because it's a function obviously we've got parentheses in there now this takes three um typically three arguments we're looking at one two three here so we'll set this up the first argument is the host name so this is going to be Local Host the second is the username so we've already established this is Alex and I don't actually have a password so I'm going to leave this blank but I'm still specifying it there okay so how can we make this um a bit better and a bit more easier to specify everything I'm actually going to use variables so I'm going to say um MySQL host equals Local Host MySQL user equals Alex and MySQL pass equals nothing so I'm going to substitute these values in so it's taking the values that I've um specified up there and then just popping them into this function okay so let's run this script to see what happens okay so um right okay sorry yeah the uh the username is not Alex it is root let's just pop back to um my PHP my admin and have a look at that you can see that we've got the username of root there so uh I suppose this is a good example now to look at what error we've uh returned so we've got warning MySQL connect access denied for user Alex obviously because there's no user um called Alex using password no so let's refresh again this time we've got nothing up so we can assume that everything has connected properly so what happens if we don't correct prop connect properly now let's just change this back to uh Alex again so no no user called Alex exists and we refresh the page we've got this error up here now let's say we were running a live website and this this um error was returned to the user this isn't the kind of error that we want to show to a user um if we've incorrectly specified a username or password inside of our code so what I'm going to do is at the end of this I'm going to use um logical operator or and remember this can be written like that with two horizontal lines but I'm going to say or and after that I'm going to say die so this either connects and doesn't return an error or if it does return an error we die and we can print our own error message out to the user so could not connect to datab base so um or could not connect in general now we're going to be introducing other functions and the other function to connect to the database itself so we've connected to the server like this then we want to select a database so I'm going to take this out here and put a general error and I'm going to call that concore error and above here I'm going to write con error equals could oh could not connect just in general so or die con error now um let's have a look at uh the preview of that so remember we've got the username here as Alex and uh that's wrong so if we refresh we get this could not connect now you can also see that we've got this uh warning come up here as well so we can either uh resol we can resolve this in two ways we can use error reporting or we can simply pop an at symbol before that then when we refresh you can see it just shows could not connect so the app symbol will uh will uh basically uh take away the um the default error reporting from PHP just on this line so we've um connected to our database successfully well we haven't at the moment but let's just type in root um down here I'm going to say Echo uh connected pull that up a bit more and we can refresh so now we're saying connected because we're not killing the page at this point because we've connected so we are going to run this line uh we're going to change this a bit later on so it's a bit more uh it's structured a bit better so the next thing we want to do is Select our database now remember the database is called aore database so let's go back to our uh let's go back to PHP writing our code and I'm going to say MySQL select DB so we're using underscores to separate this and then we just take one argument here and we are taking aore database so again we can make this a bit better and under here we can say MySQL DB equals aore database and we can just substitute that variable in there
