hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna continue working on the game so let's go ahead and come into form 1 DB and you can see when they click button spawn it generates a random character now this could cause some problems that are all based on the method that we used so let's go ahead and make another sub called generate enemy and we'll go ahead and bring this down here and we will copy this right here so we need to copy everything and paste it inside here now we are going to get an error right here so let's just go ahead and add and select and so now what we need to do is let's just go ahead and take these and copy them and we'll paste them under generate enemy so let's go ahead and get rid of everything in here and whenever they spawn it will just call generate enemy so this this way we can reuse code and generate enemies whenever we need so let's go ahead and use recursion so if the picture is not already a zombie so if we don't already have a zombie then let's go ahead and create one so we'll cut this right here then we will create a zombie and change the picture and if it already is a zombie so if picture picture enemy dot image that equals the zombie because we use not right here if it does equal that let's go ahead and call generate enemy so this will just start over from the beginning and they will generate a random number so let's go ahead and go through and do that for each one of these cases so we will cut this so if it's not the villain then create a villain and if we already already have a villain in there then we can generate the enemy now by doing this what we can do what we do is we make it so that it will generate a different type of enemy each time and that we will not get the same enemy two times in a row so if the picture is not already a jack and then go ahead and create a dragon and we need to call generate enemy now let's come up here and see here looks like everything's good so let's go ahead and run this now you guys may be wondering why I didn't just do this in one of the previous tutorials it's because I like to show you problems that you might run into and how you can come up with ideas to fix them and hopefully this will give you guys examples of what to do and how to fix problems I've had some people on my youtube channel tell me that they like it when I do that so I just decided to do it with these tutorials so here's our game we've got the default character that it that's on there right now we will run generate an enemy when the form unloads because this isn't really an enemy object that has been created it's just the picture so we could spawn an enemy we could spawn a dragon spawn a villain a dragon zombie dragon zombie villain dragon looks like we're getting a couple of the same in a row but that doesn't matter because it seemed it seems to be working good and it's more random than it was before so let's go ahead come into four Mondavi be the designer for it we'll double click on form one so that we can open up the form one load event okay so whenever the forum unloads what we want to do is generate an enemy okay so now that we've got that that out of the way let's go ahead and come over to game GUI we'll rightclick and we'll add a class now I'll make this a little bit smaller and we will call the class pop I will go ahead and add it so here's our class Popeye now let's go ahead and make some variables so we'll do public shared and we'll go ahead and call it name as string and we will set it equal to Popeye so let's go ahead and make it so that Popeye cannot be edited so we will just make it constant and it looks like if we need if we wanted to be constant we cannot make it shared so every time we create an instance of Popeye it will create a new instance of name so let's go ahead and create another variable so private int health as integer and we'll set that equal to 100 now let's go ahead and create an ArrayList so public readonly and we will just call it attacks as string and we'll just set it equal to punch kick and let's just do anchor throw so now that we have the three different attacks we can use let's come down here and we will create a sub that will attack so public sub attack and then we will by ref enemy health as integer so whenever he attacks let's go ahead and generate a random number
