hi this is Alex from PHP academy' back with another video for the new Boston now in this video we're going to look at a more reliable way at getting a user's IP address now in previous examples we've used dollar underscore server and then we've used remote address now this isn't always an accurate depiction of the users our IP address for example they might be on a shared network so there might be let's say a root two may exist with a few computers or you may have someone using a proxy so what we're going to do in here is we're going to be creating a way to grab the user's IP address based on checking each three elements the first element going to check is the actual IP address say let's say I was on a shared network I don't the IP address to start with 192 I want it to be the actual IP address what we're then going to do is check if the user is using a proxy and then what we're going to do is check if the user and what we're going to do a final result and say well if not we'll use this remote address here so let's have a look at what we need to set to variable wise in order to perform our checks we need some kind of values and we're always going to be using this server preset set of environmental variables but we're going to be doing things slightly differently so the first one is going to be the HTTP client IP and what this is is this is the this is checking the actual internet IP address rather than the individual computer like I said if you're sat at a group of computers all connected to the same like route or hub you'd be getting a like a 192 dot something address perhaps so HTTP client IP we need the dollar underscore server and in here we just do HTTP client IP so that's the first one ticked off the list the second one is HTTP xforwardedfor so that's 8 tt HTTP xforwardedfor and this is when we are checking if the user is using a proxy so let's put HTTP xforwardedfor okay so the last one is the final the final decision if you like you mean this this is going to be this is going to be the last option so that we've already looked at this so its dollar I'm not going really going to talk about it it's just remote address there so we need to come up with an if statement to check each one and we're going to use the dollar and the exclamation mark and then we're going to be using empty so we're going to be saying not empty so the first thing thing we're going to do is we're going to say if not empty HTTP client IP then IP address equals HTTP client IP else here so we're create an else and ifelse statement here or if else if else statement I'm going to say else if HTTP xforwardedfor and we can say not look not empty and we're going to enclose that in brackets as well then the IP address equals HTTP xforwardedfor okay then last we're just going to say if none of these have been detected and they're all empty then the IP address is going to be equal to remote address okay so that's a lot better way of looking at it so because I'm running on a local local my just my computer with my local server I'm not gonna be able to test this very well because these two are definitely going to be empty I already know that they're going to be able to so at the end of this we can echo out the IP address you can even put this into a function if you've already looked at functions and you could supply this data through the function and then return a value at the end of it but for now I'm just demonstrating with an ifelse ifelse statement so we're going to echo the IP address at the end of that up here we haven't defined IP address because I'm just going to leave it until it is set so we're going to echo IP address let's just refresh the page and you can see oh nope nothing's happened so have a look okay yes oh I've missed off addy on there okay so now let's refresh we can see that we'll be given the value one two seven zero zero one however you are feel free to test this on your own thing upload it to a web server connect to the internet test it wherever you can just to check that everything is working so this is a lot better way to grab a user's IP address just by checking three different possibilities before we come to the conclusion that this is the address this isn't entirely foolproof but it is a lot better way so if you are thinking about storing your users IP address try to use this and like I said before if you put it in a function it's going to be a lot better and easier to use and you can reuse that code over and over again
