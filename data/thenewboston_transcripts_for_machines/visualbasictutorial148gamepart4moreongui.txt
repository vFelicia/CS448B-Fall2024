Desktop and let's do our zombie so here we have our cartoon zombie let's add another resource once again we want to add an existing file go to our desktop select a villain so when you're adding resources to your program what it does is it creates copies of that in the directory of your program and whenever you build your program it will run without you having to have those pictures in the same folder so if I didn't have these resources let's say for this for this picture if I didn't have that picture in the same folder it will not be able to load it because it's not actually there so adding resources is a good way to package everything your program needs inside of the program so let's just add our dragon and let's rename this to cartoon dragon and we'll rename this one just to make it look more like the other one so cartoon villain okay so now that we've added our Sambi villain and our dragon let's go ahead and come over here to form one BB we'll just double click on spawn enemy so whenever they click button spawn what we want to do is generate a random number and then pick based on that number so as new random so now that we have our random generator we want to set we want to get a random number from it so dim enemy type as integer I almost had that equal to generator dot next okay sorry about that alarm so generate it on next and we want it to be between 1 so 1 2 or 3 so now I'll just do a select case and we want the enemy type so for case 1 we will type picture enemy dot image is going to be equal to and we're going to have to access the resources of game GUI so to do this we'll just type my dot resources dot and you can see we've got cartoon dragon cartoon villain and cartoon zombie so we'll just do cartoon zombie and we'll do this for each one so picture enemy dot image equals my dot resources dot cartoon let's do a villain and then in case three picture enemy dot image equals my resources dot dragon now this is just a basic outline of what this is going to be doing whenever they spawn an enemy it will also have to create a new enemy object it'll have to set the health back on the progress bar and other stuff but for now we're just gonna worry about this so let's go ahead and run this let's go ahead and we need to come over here to our solution and we need to rightclick on game GUI and let's just go ahead and set it as the startup project so now that it's the startup project we should be able to run this okay so here's our game and when we spawn it into me we can get either the zombie we get the villain and it's generating some weird numbers so go ahead put this code in if you already have it and they wants to do that move on to the next tutorial
