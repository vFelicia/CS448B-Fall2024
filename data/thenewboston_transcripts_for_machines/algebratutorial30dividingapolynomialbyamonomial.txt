okay today we're going to learn how to divide a polom by a monomial so when we do this we have a polinomial on top and a single monomial on the bottom when we do this we're going to rewrite it like like as if we were doing this R 2 / r + 6 R / r + 5 / R cuz when we divide a polom by a monomial what we're saying is R goes into this how many times and this and this so R 2 / R is just r+ 6 R / R the RS are going to cancel we're going to get six and then we're going to be left with a fraction of 5 over R so now we're going to do some examples so the first thing we can do for number one is we can cross out we can cancel this two because two divides evenly into four and two divides evenly into six so now that we we can write this as 2 y^ 2 + 3 y over y now the only reason I could cross out those twos was because both of these terms were divisible by two if they weren't I would have to leave the two on the bottom so now I divide y^2 by y I'm just going to get 2 Y and then y / y those y's are just going to cancel it's just going to be 2 y + 3 so for this example I don't have any numbers to cancel so I'll just go in and first we divide X's by x's and then we divide y's by y so x^2 / X is going to be positive X and then I'm going to going to have something over here and then Min x / X is just 1 now I'm going to divide my y y / Y is 1 and y^2 / Y is positive y so I'm left with x y as an answer so we're going to do a couple more examples okay so m^2 / m is positive m n 2 / n is positive n plus m / m is 1 and since there's not another n on that I have to write this as 1 over n minus since there's no M here I have a 1 / M and then n / n is 1 so now in this last one we have a coefficient that we can divide out so six goes into six evenly one time six goes into 42 evenly seven times and six goes into 72 e evenly 12 times and now I just have A's I can divide so 1 A2 / a cub is 1 over a because the a drops to the bottom plus 7 a / a cubed it's going to give me a seven on top and a squ on the bottom and then this is just going to stay 12 over a cubed because I have no A's to combine so that's all we're going to do with dividing today but make sure you come back and check out the next lesson where we learn how to simplify fractions
