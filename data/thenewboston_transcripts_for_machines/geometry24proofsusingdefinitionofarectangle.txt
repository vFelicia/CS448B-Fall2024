okay so today we're going to use the definition of a rectangle to prove that triangles are congruent so there's two ways you can do this particular one and we're actually going to go over both of them because for every proof that we've done I've only showed you one way to do it and for almost any proof there's more than one way to do it it just depends on what you happen to see first so we're going to go do it two different ways but um know that there's more than two ways to do this one of these ways is going to be a little bit longer not much but I just want to show you your options okay so we know that m n o p is a rectangle and we want to get this up this triangle up here congruent to this triangle up here the two triangles that kind of form a um hourglass so first we're gonna copy our given m n o p is a rectangle I don't know why I just put two right there and that's given to us okay so what do we know about rectangles well we know that their opposite sides are congruent which will help us out because with then we can get MN congruent to P so that's what we're going to do next we're going to say that MN is congruent to p and our reason for that is if rectangle then opposite sides are congruent now in that same step you could also say that MP is congruent to n o but that doesn't help you prove that triangle m qn is congruent to Triangle P qo so we're not going to do that so next what we also know is that opposite opposite sides are parallel now you might not think that that helps but remember parallel lines when cut by a transversal which could be either pn or M O have special angles that are formed so for Next Step we're going to say that MN is paralleled to p o and MP is parallel to n o and that's if rectangle then opposite sides are parallel so if you notice since these two are parallel and they're cut by this transversal PN that means that this angle is congruent to this angle because remember if two lines are parallel alternate interior angles are congruent and since we have two transversals that cut these two parallel lines we can also say that this angle is congruent to this angle so we can do that in the same step we can get angle MN Q congruent to angle uh let me think M and Q congruent to O P Q and we can get angle n m q congruent to angle p o q and that's if lines parallel then alternate interior angles are congruent and then in this last step we can say that the triangles are congruent because we have an angle a side and an angle that are congruent so triangle m q n's congruent to Triangle p q o by angle angle side angle so now we're going to take a same problem and do it a different way so we our first two steps are still going to be the same we're going to rewrite our given rectangle given and we're also going to say that MN is congruent to p and that's if rectangle opposite sides are congruent so we have this congruent to this now if you look angle mqn which is this angle right here and angle pqo right here are a special kind of angle they're vertical angles so we can get those two angles congruent by vertical angles so angle m qn is congruent to angle p q if vertical angles then congruent so now we have a side an a angle and we either need another angle or another side so now we're going to use what we did in the last proof to help us out a little bit since we only need one more angle to be congruent we can use the fact that these two lines are parallel which we would have to rewrite so let's do that first so MN parallel to p o and like I said you could do the same thing and get MP parallel to n o but that doesn't really help you for this particular problem so we're not going to write that so if rectangle opposite sides parallel and then we can get one of these alternate pairs of alternate interior angles congruent it doesn't matter which one so I'm just going to pick and I'm going to make this get find this one congruent to this one now so angle m n o is congruent to angle Q Po and then if lines are parallel then alternate interior angles are congruent so finally we can get our triangles congruent now our reason for this is going to be different because instead of having angle side angle this time we have angle angle side but that's still a valid way to prove that triangles are congruent so M and Q I'm going to write it the same way the given does so M qn congr to Triangle P qo by angle angle C side so this one only took one more step than the last one but I just wanted to show you that there's more than one correct way to do a proof so make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to talk about radians
