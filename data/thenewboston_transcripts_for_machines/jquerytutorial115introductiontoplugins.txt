hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we go we are going to take a look at jQuery plugins just take a look at what they are what they can do how we would search for plugins and some other information as well that might help you when you're going and choosing a plugin to use now obviously when we have a normal file for example I just have index dot PHP open in my browser we've included jQuery and perhaps an external script if required however that's not always necessary obviously the external script just goes ahead and make sure we don't need to use any JavaScript on this page we just include the file now if you wanted to go ahead and actually add to the current jQuery library there's a list of plugins available on the jQuery comm website so if we go over to jQuery comm we can go ahead and click the plugins tab you can browse here the main page that comes up is browsing by type however let's just go ahead to top plugins and take a look down the list now plugins are essentially built for the purpose of if you have some kind of functionality you need to add to your website however you're not comfortable with writing it yourself and you need a quick way to implement something usually visual into your script there's a lot of options available in in the form of plugins so just looking down this list you can see a few already we're gonna go over and we're gonna take a look at the let's have a look let's find it let's just come down the page we've got one here called where was it gone well I can't find the original one I was looking for but let's just go for this one here the rich text HTML editor now once you've found a plugin of your choice go ahead and read the description in this case this one is still in beta testing so obviously looking out for these kinds of things are important now you love and find the Downloads link or you can view the the original page that this is from so it'll be perhaps someone's personal blog or something and then you can go ahead and actually download the plugin so another way you can do this is to go ahead and just perform a simple google search for let's say jQuery plugins just here we found an article 30 fantastic new jQuery plugins 37 more shocking jQuery plugins and these kinds of results often show you quick demos so they have quick online demos as well as linking to the original authors demos as well these might also not be listed on the jQuery website so you might find additional query of jQuery plugins that have been written by people and just posted on their own personal website for example and the other benefit is you'll get reviews as well so people will be reviewing this plugin and giving it a bit of a rating so they'll probably give it some kind of rating as well as that obviously the titles just go to show that they've collected together a good and you know a good collection of plugins to show to the user obviously they wouldn't be blogging about it if they weren't very good so plugins can be implemented into a page once you've downloaded them as you would jQuery we've already mentioned that briefly and you would do it somewhat similar to how we've done it here but obviously you would always go ahead and read the instructions on the user's website or the plugin description on jQuery comm now the majority of the time when serverside processing is required PHP will be used because it's such an available and easy to to write language so if you are downloading plugins make sure you check if you have any additional files there that might use Ajax requests to PHP documents so make sure you have a PHP enabled server before you download these or that we know used to and make sure you're comfortable with using this PHP processing as well obviously there are other web development languages that can be used however the majority of the time PHP is the most popular another thing to point out is that when you return to say jQuery com always take a look at the version number as well we've already noted that this reedit are rich text HTML editor is in beta testing and this will have beta just here so always check back just to see if there's an updated version of a particular plugin this might be for security reasons this might be for functionality reasons it might even be edited or changed to keep up with jQuery original library so you might see new functions appear or if you use a different version of jQuery a more updated version you might see the functionality in the in the plugin disappear because something might have changed so always check back on either the author's website or jQuery comm depending where you got this from to check the latest version now the other thing is if we will return to our text editor if you were to go ahead and install a jQuery plugin for absolutely everything for example there are jQuery plugins that can reference or select a text area and limit the input of text and display how many characters are remaining for example now this is relatively easy to do with jQuery alone so a plugin might not be required if you tend to add a lot of plugins to your page you're gonna find it's going to bloat your document out with lots of unnecessary code so by implementing too many plugins you might be slowing down your script so it's probably better to only use plugins where the work can't be done any more quickly than you'd be able to do it or that might not work as well so if you're new to jQuery you probably might feel the temptation to go ahead and install a load of plugins and use them from different parts of the website now apart from the downsides that I have mentioned you might get plugin conflicts as well depending on how well the plugins are written so there are many problems to adding too much JavaScript to a page you're going to completely decrease the loading time so only look for plugins that you wouldn't be able to write yourself not just saying we wouldn't be able to write yourself off the top of your head but try and research different ways to do things before you go and install plugins the example I gave we could create a text area and for example say you wanted to limit this to a certain amount of characters this might be called text over in another file you might go and write something like text dot counter for example or countdown and this might implement some kind of system to say allow only 200 characters and countdown as the user starts typing now we've already looked at a tutorial in this tutorial series when we can where we can do this therefore if you create your own code and go ahead and keep that up to scratch and keep that working well you are minimizing Maat well you in some cases minimizing the amount of codes you require often plugins come with unnecessary styling and also if you've got if you're going to go ahead and write your own plugins or just include your own function functionality for example in an external javascript file you're also able to style this exactly as you want you could come over to a stylesheet and star this exact exactly as you want not saying that plugins aren't useful but try to only install plugins where you feel like you wouldn't be able to do anything that would produce the same effect so that's a quick introduction on plugins in the next couple of videos we're going to be picking some specific plugins and we're going to be learning how to install them just so we can get to grips with downloading and installing and implementing plugins so that was a quick introduction on jQuery plugins
