hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at converting variables or data types so in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you how to do it with C type now there are many other ways to do it and we may be covering them in the next couple of tutorials so we'll go ahead and create a little demo application for this we'll go ahead and select a new project Windows forms application and we will just call it C type and we'll go ahead and click okay now let's come over here and we will add a button and a text box or several buttons so now we'll add a text box okay here's one so we'll just go ahead and set the text box name to text raw variable and we'll set button one to convert to double not the name but button convert double and we'll go ahead and set the text to double we will set this one to integer and we'll set the text value to button convert int and we'll go ahead and set the name of this one to button convert booing and we'll come down here and set the text value to boing okay so now we go ahead and create an event for each one of these buttons by double clicking on them okay so button convert to double we're just going to go ahead and create a variable so dim raw variable as string is equal to textraw variable. text now this is going to textraw variable. text is going to always be a string because Tex text boxes handle string and then we'll declare final double as double and now what we're going to do is we're going to set final double equal to and now we're going to convert the raw variable to a double so we'll just type c type and this takes two arguments now the first OB the first argument is the variable that we want to convert or the the data that we want to convert we can use variables or we can use numbers or strings so we can go ahead and type raw variable and now for our second argument we have object as type now this is the DAT data type that we want to convert it to so we'll just go ahead and convert it to a double and we will just type messagebox doow final double now let's do this again for converting to integer so we'll go ahead and create take this raw variable and we'll go ahead and paste it down here now we'll create another variable so final int as integer and now what we're going to do is convert raw variable to an INT so final int equals c type now the first argument is going to be our data type or our data that we want to convert so that's going to be raw variable and what do we want to convert that to we want to convert it to an integer and we'll go ahead and show that in a message box now we we will do this one more time and convert it to a Boolean so we're going to go ahead and take our raw variable right here paste it right there and we'll declare final BU as boine and now we're going to type final bu equals c type raw variable and then we want to convert that to a booing so now let's go ahead and run our program so you can see here's our form right here and if we type a number in let's say 10 and convert that to a double it's going to give us the value 10 now it doesn't look like any changes have been made but it is in fact a double value now let's go ahead and type in a different number such as 23 and if we convert that to an integer it's going to give us the value 23 now it looks the same but instead of being a string data type it is an integer now for bllen we're going to have to type either true or false so if we go ahead and type true and click booing let's try false looks like we've got a problem here we didn't show it in the message message box so let's go ahead and add messagebox doow final Po and we'll go ahead and run this once more so we'll type true in here and convert it to a Bine and you can see that it gives us true with a capital T because when you're using booin it's either capital T true or capital F false so if I type false right here and click booing it gives us a capital f false so go ahead and use C type practice with that you can convert variables uh to other data types or you can instead of using raw variable right here you could use the um text true converting that to a booing and uh so go ahead and just play around with that and once you know how to do that you're not going to forget it move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
