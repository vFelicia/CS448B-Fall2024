hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another video for the new Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be talking about error reporting and I'm going to be speaking a bit white every reporting is important during development and then again why it's important to turn it off when you're not developing and when you're releasing software or releasing code rather onto a public web server for public use now let's take a look at what error reporting is now if I was to create a PHP document and I've got my PHP tags here and I was to say writing some invalid code so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to make this equal to Alex but I'm missing out the line terminator which is a semicolon so I'm missing that out on purpose now at the moment my error reporting is turned off so when you're developing you may find that your code will not run even if you have output outside of your PHP tags so let's put this into practice in an example I'm going to refresh my page now you can see that nothing has been returned to us no errors or no output at all let's in fact echo this here and we can demonstrate that we're getting no output whatsoever oh we are okay oh yeah okay well we are because it's the only line in our code so let's create another variable down here called Billy remember PHP works on a line by line basis so if you've got only one line in your program you're not required to use a semicolon but I'm going to put another variable in there as well and I'm going to refresh the page and you'll see that no content appears where as it did before so no content appears but no error message has been given so we need to turn every reporting on to our select value of error reporting I'll select how can I say settings if you like a very reporting and I'll explain this in a minute when we take a look at our PHP dot ini file now if you open up your X our PHP location where the PHP folder exists for me this is C colon backslash 4 sorry C colon backslash xampp backslash PHP and we need this file called PHP to ienai so I'm going to double click on this and open this we open it in notepad and I'm going to go and find on the page error reporting so now you can see we've come down to this error handling and logging place here we have an explanation here of each stage or each setting rather of error reporting so for example if we were to set error reporting to e or this will report all errors and warnings but not including East richt error fatal runtime errors a warning runtime warning so we have all these different types of warnings and errors that we can allow our user to see or or us as a developer to see but by default I think mine is actually set to zero so let's go down okay so we've got error reporting equals zero and this is Error reporting off altogether as we've seen in our browser we've not retrieved an error orbit not being returned with an error even though we're missing a semicolon our pages are working now it's also great to note that if we have outside content outside of our PHP tags this is also not going to going to be displayed now you may have come across this before where you've created a PHP document you've had outside an inside PHP comments you've got HTML comment up content here and then you've got PHP content inside here we are just getting a blank page up take a look inside your PHP 2 ini file and check for this check error reporting and I can pretty much guarantee most of the time it's going to equal 0 so what we need to do is we need to change this to something that's going to give us back an error and there's a few examples here but we can create our own custom if you like in this tutorial I'm just going to be dealing with e all so you can say eat all now bear in mind this doesn't equal East ricked so we'll have a look at that in just a moment so we've got eat all here now let's go and say go ahead and save this so save what we need to do now is we need to restart our Pachi server so we come into our exam control panel click stop and click start this may be slightly different for you you might be using another package installation now what we can do is we can open up our browser and click refresh and you can see that it's giving us our error back so we're saying here pass error expecting a comma or expecting a semicolon on line 4 so what we can do now is go over to line 4 and you might think well I've got a semicolon on line 4 but in actual fact it's referring to the end of this line meaning it's expected either here or in terms of reading it it's expected here so when we fix this and we refresh you can see that it's working fine so we've got our outside content and our inside content
