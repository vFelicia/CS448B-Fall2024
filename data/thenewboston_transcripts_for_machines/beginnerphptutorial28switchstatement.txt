hello this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and in this video that I've created for the new Boston I'm going to be talking about the PHP switch statement now you might have already looked at if and ifelse statements and with incorporating an else if to do multiple checks but what if you've got a lot of numbers or a lot of strings to check or something you need to check in a long list for this we use the switch it's basically a better cleaner and faster way of using an if else if and then else so the syntax for this is switch in here we need simply a variable reference so if up here we were to create number equals let's say 1 we need to switch this number and now we create a block here which is going to have a lot of content inside of it we're basically evaluating this number and we don't evaluate inside here like I couldn't say number equals 1 for example I would evaluate inside here and we do this with the case keyword and we use case and then we say what we want it to equal to so case 1 I want to maybe echo 1 let's just indent this slightly so we can see what we're doing and then we end it with break and we end with a semicolon so this is the basic structure let me just create another one so you can get an idea of what we're doing ok so hopefully by now you've got an idea of the syntax this is basically how it looks and what is this program essentially doing now let me just correct go down and create a case 3 and then we can just demonstrate what this might be useful for so let's tab over so what we have essentially done here is we've created a mini program to convert this number that's entered here into string data so instead of writing if number equals 1 then echo 1 else if number equals 2 echo 2 else if number equals 3 echo 3 end it else and we can blah blah blah and it just gets a lot more confusing this is a really easy way to view yep case 1 we echo 1 case 2 we echo 2 case three we echo 3 and this is basically what our number evaluates to so we could in fact change this to string data this could be text here and exactly the same hit could correspond to a string data here we'll look at an example of that in just a moment but for now my little mini program is going to convert the numbers the integers remember we're not using this a string this is a number in itself we're converting that to the corresponding text so now what we can do is just run the program let's press refresh and you can see that is outputted 1 now if we change this number up here to 2 you can see that we're going to say case yes it does equal to therefore echo 2 so let's refresh that says 2 and the same with number 3 so let's just test that and that says three now what happens if we change this to something like four we don't have a case to handle this being equal to four so what happens you probably guess nothing happens so we need some way of writing here what's going to happen if there's no case to handle the input that we've spent the input that is coming into this switch statement so we use the keyword default and we use a break as well and but in here we can echo out just pull that in a bit echo out let's say number not found okay so by default let's say for example the number is four as we have it at the moment the default the default action would be to echo not not found number not found so if we refresh it says number not found the same of is if as if we were to come up and change this to minus ten for example it's going to do exactly the same thing and we maintain echoing out this number not found thing okay so there's a different way that we can structure this I'm just going to take out the default for now let's just get rid of everything in here as well and we're going to basically start with this completely different concept I'm going to say de equals and at the moment I'm going to set this to same Monday now inside my switch statement remember to change this as well inside my switch statement I basically want a little program that's going to tell me if this day is a weekend or if it's a weekday so or if you know I mean if if it is a weekend we could say day equals Alex and that would not be a weekend because there isn't a weekend day called Alex so to do this I'm basically going to say case and remember I said we can deal with string data as well case Saturday and then underneath in fact that says not a semicolon underneath I'm going to say case um I'm just I'm I'm not even breaking I'm just saying case case case someday okay then I'm going to break and in here I'm going to write my output so it's a weekend now an interesting point here you can see that this bits turn black that's because I'm using a a single quotation mark within single quotation marks I'm going to use my backslash character to escape that now this the program is basically saying we're setting a date at the moment it's Monday if if this variable here remembers we're switching it in here if this equals if this equals Saturday or equals Sunday echoing it's a weekend otherwise just pull that in a bit more echo not a weekend so let's test this program Monday should produce us with the result not a weekend let's refresh not a weekend now let's change this to Saturday we can refresh and you can see it's a weekend so this is a really really good way to compare multiple things at once and then give an output for that and then you can always use your default if data that's being read into this switch statement can't be recognized as one of the cases so that's basically a switch statements in PHP
