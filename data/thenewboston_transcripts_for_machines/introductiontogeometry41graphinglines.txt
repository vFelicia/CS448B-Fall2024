So today we're going to be graphing so our first method of graphing is plotting points so we have this equation y = 2x + 1 we're going to pick these Five Points no particular reason I just wanted you guys to get a good look at what this graph looks like we're going to plug each point in to find out each ordered pair so if I plug 2 in I get 2 * 2 which is 4 + 1 is 3 I plug 1 in I get 2 * 1 which gives you 2 + 1 which is 1 if you plug 0o in you get 2 * 0 which is 0 + 1 is 1 2 * 1 is 2 + 1 is 3 and 2 * 2 is 4 + 1 is five so now what we're going to do is graph each of these points and then connect them together to graph our line so 3 or 23 1 2 1 2 3 this is 0.11 negative 1 one one this is 2 2 0 1 Zer up one 1 3 one three and two up up five so this is our last point so if we connect all these points so if you connect this these points by drawing in this line you'll get the line and mine's a little bit off just because I didn't use actual graph paper but when you do these at home and you use graph paper your lines will be exact method two is um is how we're going to graph it using slope intercept form so this is the more preferred way because it's it's more ex it's easier and it requires less plugging in so since we know that our slope is equal to two and we know that our Y intercept is 33 is where our graph touches the Y AIS and at any Y intercept the x coordinate is zero so the that point is 0 3 so if we draw in our Y intercept and I'm going to name label it with a little y and starting at our Y intercept we're going to use the definition of slope to graph our line so slope is just the ratio of rise over run so if it has a slope of two that means its rise is two and its run is one so starting at 03 we're going to go up two to the right one up two to the right one up two to the right one and then starting at our same Y intercept we're going to go down two and left one and that gives you the same kind of slope because if you take negative right here if you take2 and put it over negative 1 you still will get two so that gives us our points and then we can connect them we're going to connect them and we're going to get the same line This is the line we just got and this is the line we got before and if you look at them both they're the same one so that's all we're going to do with graphing but make sure you come back and watch the next video we're going to we we're going to work on solving systems of equations
