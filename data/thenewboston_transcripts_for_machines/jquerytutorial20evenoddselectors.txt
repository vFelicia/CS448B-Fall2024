hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with the video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we are going to be creating a table and we're going to be using the even and at the even and odd selectors to actually change a class of a particular table row so I have an index page here and what I've done is I've included table J s as part of my JavaScript include files and I've also got style dot CSS which is quite important because we're going to be creating a class that's going to change the tables the rows of the table evenly or oddly now I have an example just here you can see that we've got the first one with the background slightly you know a darker or lighter gray then we have white and then we have this gray again and then white and if this table was longer it would continue to select the first second fourth etc etc rows in the table so this is all done using jQuery so let's just go ahead and open up my text editor again I'm going to go ahead and create this table first of all so we create a table here we're going to give this a class name in just a moment but not for now I'm just going to create some rows and then inside that some table data and for the first one I'm just going to say it first row so first row we can go ahead and copy and paste this down to make four rows and just go ahead and modify these accordingly so just while I'm typing these out this could be for example data that's retrieved from a database table that you might have put into a table for example for each row of data you might be displaying a table row and then the data inside of this so you might want to find an easy way to append a class to this table in order to get the effect that we've just looked at in my browser so let's go ahead and continue filling this in and we'll say which we say last or fourth or so forth okay so we've got these rows in the table let's just go ahead and see what that looks like you can see there's no borders at the moment but we can fix that in style ss in just a moment I'm going to go ahead and give this table a class for now I'm just going to call it table but if you do want to create say tables that display this effect you might want to go ahead get ahead and give it a more distinctive name but for now we're going to keep it as table so inside star dot CSS let's go ahead and change the styling of this and we're just going to go ahead and create some borders on this so we'll say border one pixel solid and black here we're also going to need to say table TR and also table TD and now just ensure that we get borders around everything so now that we've done this we want to go ahead and use jQuery to highlight these even rows or the odd rows depending so we can actually use jQuery to select the even rows on this table or the odd rows on this table and then highlight them accordingly and what we're going to need to do is create a class that we're going to add to each row and that class I'm just going to call highlights so I'm going to do in here is set the background color of this class to F 0 F 0 F 0 which was the color that you saw in the first part of the tutorial now that we've done this we've completely set up our page we've added this highlight class as well as modified this class that we referenced with the table and now we can go ahead and write our jQuery code so we're going to ensure that the document is loaded and the Dom is ready so we're going to say document document ready and then inside here is a function inside these curly brackets here is where our code is going to be so we'll just pull them down slightly ok so now what we want to do is add a class to this table now if for example we wanted to go ahead and add a class to the entire table we would use a selector and we would say dot table remember it's a class selector and then we would say dot CSS and sorry know we could use CSS to manually do it but we want to add this existing class that we've created this highlight class in our style dot CSS file so inside here we just go ahead and specify the class that we want to apply to this particular element and in this case it will just I like the entire table however this is obviously isn't the effect that we're looking for the first thing we want to do is highlight only the rows you can see at the moment we've highlighted the entire table we only want to highlight the Rose so we specify table TR and this will just highlight each table row you can see that the gray has disappeared from the outside borders now what we want to go ahead and do is select only even elements in this set so essentially what we're doing is we're matching this TR set and we use a colon to do this and then we type in either even or odd and this will select the either even or odd table TRS so each one of these elements will select either even or odd and then apply that particular class here using add class to these so now that we've done that we can go ahead and refresh and you can see that the effect that we get is we've highlighted the first row left the second row highlighted the third row and left the fourth row and if we were to go ahead and say modify this and just add some more table rows let's just go down and add some more in you can see that we get exactly the same effect we've highlighted the first third fight fifth sorry yeah and so and so on and so forth so an unlimited amount of data we're going to use the even to select each one and again we can change this to odd as well and that will just change how we do that so these are the even and the odd selectors in jQuery and they don't just need to be applied to tables they can be applied to say a set of paragraphs it entirely depends for example we could change this to a div for example we could say div and then all odd paragraphs we apply the highlight to so we're going ahead and just quickly demonstrate this now let's go ahead and create a div here let's just pull that down and let's just type what's the name that we gave this we will just call it an area for example so we'll give this an ID of area now inside here we could have a few paragraphs and all of them could contain just from some text for example so text 1 text text 3 and text 4 so now we have something looking like this so now what we can do is in table J s we can select all the paragraphs all the odd paragraphs inside area and add this highlight class to them so now when we refresh you can see that we get exactly the same effect where we've added this background color to each paragraph so it's versatile in the sense that you can use it with almost all elements even sort of input fields you could you know highlight every one however the main you know useful demonstration for this is using tables as we did initially so that's the even and odd selectors in jQuery
