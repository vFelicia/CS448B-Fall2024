hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video tutorial series we're going to be looking at Ajax now Ajax isn't specifically relative to PHP however many PHP applications or websites you may create with PHP can be massively enhanced with Ajax because what we can do is we can create applications that allow us to say click a button or type add some kind of data in and we can grab data from a database or a text file or just simply include a pet include a PHP file onto our page that gives us dynamic information so updated information and Ajax has been used for a long time now and recently started to be create more popular we're in 2011 when this video is being recorded so it's extremely popular on the web so why is Ajax special what makes it special I'm just going to talk to you a bit about the features of Ajax that create that create a more dynamic web experience if you like now Ajax first of all stands for a sync RIA a synchronous JavaScript and XML and what this means is that we can process data through well behind the scenes of our website just using a JavaScript and XHTML as well or HTML so it synchronously sends a value and retrieve something without having to reload the entire page so if you think about a web page in general you have let's say we're on index dot PHP at the moment you have some data on a page and you click a form for example to maybe submit a registration or you might just click a button to retrieve a list of values that you've typed in a search box for example so you may have a search box on your web page and this may return a value now usually you would use a form submit so you would say let's just break out our PHP tags we would say form action equals something method equals something come down here we would enter we would create a submit button and what would happen is when we press this submit button we're taken to the forum action then what we can do is we can specify buttons just on their own and what these do is they will send a they will call a function inside of our header so if we were to set up a standard page like this sorry start the head tag and then end the head tag start the body and the body so very badly written out an HTML document here we've got head we can include some JavaScript so you can say script type equals text forward slash JavaScript and then end that there so this is a general setup for a website with one input button here what we can do is we could say unclick equals and then we call a function within JavaScript so we could say update page for example now up here we may have a function in JavaScript called update page which is going to call and work with Ajax we're not going to give any examples in this introduction video but it would call this function and it would process some kind of Ajax code if you like or the methodology or the methods used with Ajax to actually update a certain area on the page so for example below here we can have a div ID equals page for example okay so this might grab an a PHP document and it might update this div with the contents of the PHP document so this is obviously a very basic example we're just updating perhaps some data from a PHP file and popping it onto a page but using this method we won't actually refresh the page now I've just given you sort of like an example of how it may work this this code obviously is not might not be how we actually do it but erm is very similar and this is just the general method that we will use in order to update values without having to refresh a page so why can this be useful in everyday applications well for example when we go to over to Google you'll notice that we have a feature in Google called autosuggest and what happens is is when we I'll just briefly explain when we when we look at Google we type in a value into a text box which is placed in the center of the screen so we start typing let's say PHP now what what Ajax and for the other part that Ajax plays in this is what I'll do it will automatically get the updated value of this text box so let's say we just start typing we'll create an input type so we can search box sorry the type equals text and name equals search box okay so what's going to happen is is we're going to start typing something for example into here so we might start typing PHP now as we type P it's going to get the value of this text box which is equal to P at the moment and it's going to search a database for the most popular searches relating or that start with P then we're going to save pH so it's going to foot and then it's going to then re update itself without obviously having to refresh the page because if you were to refresh the page every time you type something you'd have absolute pandemonium pandemonium pandemonium and it would not work so we've got pH and then we type P and it's going to find the most search for results with PHP so that's just generally oh that's just generally how it works so um this uses Ajax Google or Google Suggest uses Ajax and a variety of other websites too as well Facebook uses Ajax and this is a this uses it in a really interesting way when you're looking at a Facebook say news feed you'll be looking at the news feed straight up and down and you'll have your Mouse still now you look at your you'll look at your page thing will update then what you'll do is you'll move your mouse very slightly it only has to literally be one pixel that you move your mouse and your page will actually update now what happens here is we have an unmask move or on Mouse event trigger so when you move your mouse bits of the page updated using Ajax so it will be automatically updated from the database using Ajax the same with Twitter as well when you create a new tweet you might tweet in a box like this and click Submit or hit enter and it will automatically show your most recent tweet it won't actually refresh the page the same with probably the feeds in Twitter you'll automatically see new feed open so this is why we use Ajax and why it's so important on the web today when we don't want boring static web sites we want everything to be easy to use and dynamic and that's another reason we use ajax is because it's really easy to use a website that's been M enhanced with Ajax particularly with PHP where we're gaining values from a database we can do other things with Ajax but for now we're going to be looking at ajax closely related to PHP because Ajax is so closely related to PHP where we grab things from the database obviously it can be used with other web programming languages but obviously because this is PHP tutorials we're going to be looking at Ajax and PHP so that's a bit about Ajax how it works what it is why we should use it now in the next in the next tutorials coming coming up we're going to be looking at how to first of all the basics of that and I'm going to be creating some sample programs to grab some data from databases depending on what we do on the page
