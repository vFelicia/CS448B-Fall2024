the only issue in this tutorial and the thing I'm not going to be covering is the esses so for example if it was one day you wouldn't want this s suffix you'd just want one day but you know I'm not going to include that in the tutorial that's probably something you can go ahead and do in your own time just sort of give you a little challenge so now that we've done this form we don't really need to touch anything on this main page because ext doc J s is gonna call the countdown plugin and it's going to apply it to this countdown div so let's go ahead and inside here we want to say document dot ready and remember this is the file that's just gonna be calling our plugin as opposed to actually you know performing this functionality so document and we're appending the ready Handler once this is ready we're gonna run everything inside of here and that is selecting our countdown div using the hash because we're selecting by ID we're gonna say countdown dot and then countdown now countdown is the name of our plugin for now I'm not going to specify any options or a callback function in here we're gonna do that I each each stage of creating our plugin itself so we'll leave that for just a moment now let's go over to countdown jQuery j/s and actually start creating the plugin now notice that I've got this included here and then I've got ext no js' included here as well just make sure that this one here comes after jQuery because obviously it needs to take advantage of jQuery so let's go ahead and start to outline our function if you've already looked at creating functions this will be quite you know for me you'll be quite familiar with the code here but what we're essentially saying is function in brackets entirely with the dollar sign here this is just the notation that we're going to be using and inside these curly brackets which we're going to bring down we're going to give a name to our function and create everything to do with it however just after here we want to say jQuery and this allows us to use notation in a different way for example dollar sign dot f n dot and then our function name so before we would have to use jQuery like this here we can just use a dollar sign so dollar sign dot F N and we want to call our function remember countdown so that's quite basic we just write countdown it tells us what we want to do etc and what we're going to do is we're not going to supply prime parentheses sorry what we're going to do is we're going to say equals function now everything inside of here will be our plugin code so at the moment what I want to go ahead and do is just alert out working now what's going to happen is inside ext dot J s because we're making use of this plugin as long as we've declared everything properly we'll just have an alert box come out so let's refresh and you can see that we've got the alert box working so we know that our plugin declaration is working and we can go ahead and start to write the rest of our code now the first thing we want to do is and allow the user to give some options into this and that option is specifying the date that they want to count down to so we're gonna be using date dot parse and this is going to take a string date and it's going to convert it into a timestamp so for example I could write the 10th of August 2011 at 12 o'clock and 30 seconds just as an example this would be a way that we could write our a date that which would then be converted into a timestamp so we want to allow the user to specify this date inside the plugin as we call it so let's go ahead and just inside of here choose an options parameter now we want to go ahead and set a list of settings that we can merge with these options and these will be this will be an array of default values that we apply to each option that we allow our user to give so I'm going to create a an array called settings and inside here the I'm gonna say date and the default value is going to be null because I want the user to actually be able to specify a date I don't want this countdown script to work if I don't if we don't specify a date and later on we're gonna do a check to see if this date value is equal to a number or if it's not n a n in JavaScript and a and like written like this with capital N and capital in here which stands for not a number so we want to make sure that this date is a number as well however we'll be handling the validation a bit later okay so now we want to extend these settings into our options where essentially what we're doing is taking options from the user and if they do exist we are merging them with this here so we'll essentially just be merging the date this string here into this value here so date then equals the right you know setting so we're gonna say if options I has the user specified any options at all so here and I'm doing all this all in one line but feel free to bring it down and indent it if you wish I'll probably go ahead and do that just so we looks a bit better then we're gonna say dollar sign again using dollar sign as opposed to jQuery because this is how we set up our function so dollar sign dot extend and we want to choose our array and then the options that we've passed in so this is settings and options so we've now extended our settings to our options and we've merged the value here and replace this null value here so now what we can do is access our settings through that array so down here I'm just going to go ahead and alert out settings and because we're using an array we need to cut square brackets and I'm gonna say date so we're getting this value here that's been merged with the options that we've passed through let's go ahead and refresh and you can see that we have that string or that yeah that string dates there
