hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston now in the last part we looked at creating an AJAX request sending or retrieving the contents of page dot HTML and then just echoing them out or sorry not echoing them out but placing the contents of this file into our content div just here and that will happen when we press the button now what we're going to do is looking at sending data sent actually sending data to to a file and then returning a result from this so similar to the post request however we're going to do it in a slightly different way so the first thing I'm going to do is reference to a new page we're sending this request to a new page and that's going to be PHP forward slash let's call it page PHP let's go ahead and get rid of this page to HTML from our text editor and let's go ahead and create this new PHP file and I'm going to save that inside PHP the PHP folder so we're now sending data using this Ajax request to page PHP however what we're not doing is sending any variables along with it so let's go ahead and create a text field on our page so the input type is text and we need to give this an ID of let's just say name so now inside Ajax j/s we need to actually grab the value of this field before we pass it to page PHP so I'm going to create a new variable called name and this is going to be equal to and we're using a selector to select the name here so name dot Val so a tip we are essentially putting the value of this text field into this name variable let's just pull that down a bit so it's a bit easier to see okay so we're going to need to supply an additional parameter here in order to pass the data to this page so what we're going to do is we're going to choose a parameter or write the parameter called data so we then supply some data in here and then again it's commaseparated down to success so the data is now going to be named equals and then we're going to append on the name so we've sent name equals and the name so now when page dot PHP we can pick up on this get variable here and actually you know display it back out maybe do something with it so the first thing that we need to do here is actually call this function AB not not function we need to grab this variable name so inside pH page dot PHP we want to do something similar to the what we did before and that's first of all to check if this variable is set so has it been sent to this page so we use the is set in PHP and we say dollar underscore gets because we're sending a get variable and we have called this variable name so we choose name now if we have set this variable we can reassign it or have set this get variable we can reassign it to a variable so dollar underscore get name we can now just simply go ahead and echo that out now inside Ajax PHP what's going to happen is we call this page we send this get data here and then unsuccess we place the data returned by page PHP which is just the name and then we place that into the content area on our index dot PHP page so let's go ahead and check that that works let's go ahead and type in a name click load and you see that that's returned by our PHP page so essentially what we've performed here is a similar way of sending data using the post HTTP request and the get HTTP request but we're using this much better and much more feature full Ajax functionality so in the tutorials that follow this one we're going to look at some more options that we can use inside when we use Ajax and the callbacks that Ajax provides
