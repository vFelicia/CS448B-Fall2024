all righty hoses welcome back and this video is going to be the coolest video yet we're going to talk about keyword research and I'm going to give away all my secrets it's going to be sweet so whenever we're talking about keywords we first need to decide which keywords we should Target so for example let's say that you're making a website like mine where I have a bunch of programming tutorials how do I know to use the keyword programming tutorials why don't I use programming lessons or programming courses is how do you decide which keywords to use well let's go ahead and start with the basics first of all do not Target impossible keywords so say that I'm helping my grandma out with her homemade applesauce business because she is getting pretty successful around town and she wants to expand sell these bad boys online so she says oh why don't we target the keyword Apple but of course even though my grandma is fantastic in making appau she doesn't know a lot about SEO so I told her grandma the keyword apple is basically impossible and you're never going to be able to get number one on this no matter how good your applesauce is because you have to compete with apple the company so it's just not going to happen and to be realistic no matter how great her applesauce is she's probably never going to rank number one for the keyword applesauce I mean there's probably going to be a bunch of recipes and Wikipedia articles and you know maybe like Ms applesauce is always going to rank number one for this so she should probably try to Target some less competitive keywords so in that sense just use common sense don't try to go after you know an incredibly competitive or popular keyword already now another thing that you should think about is what is the customer or user searching for it's not always about what the website is like homemade applesauce but whenever someone actually wants to buy applesauce online what do they type in they don't type in Grandma homemade can I not type homemade applesauce because they don't even know about her business or anything like that what would I type in if I'm trying to buy applesauce online well buy applesauce online so even though the website may be Grandma's homemade applesauce this is what the user is actually going to type in so again this all comes from Common Sense the majority of the time although later on we're going to be taking a look at some tools and check this out so not only what the user is looking for but what type of content they're going after so my website right here like I said I have a bunch of programming videos I don't have a lot of like programming documentation or ebooks or anything like that so whenever I'm just typing or looking to go up programming tutorials I need to think about that so maybe I don't want to Target PR programming guide because people who type programming guide they may be looking for documentation about some language or maybe some text or maybe some ebook or something like that what my website is right here are programming video tutorials so this would be a great keyword for me even though it technically is like a programming guide that you can watch online whatever so just think about that not only what your cont content is but what the user is actually going to be searching for so now I'll tell you guys something cool so that's basically how you can use common sense and try to guess what the user is going to search for there's another thing that you can do and that's let's not guess what the user searching for let's just figure it out so back in the early days of YouTube whenever I was just like first starting out like my very first month I started making tutorials in no one was finding them I thought they were pretty good videos but I wasn't very well known and you know there's just no way that anyone could ever find my videos in the hundreds of millions of search results or whatever so I needed to find a way to have my videos appear at the top whenever a user searched for tutorials so I was doing a bunch of stuff wrong but the main thing that I did that I change that really boosted you know my video popularity is I would go to you YouTube and let's say that I was making a series about Java I would type in Java and then I would say you know what instead of just trying to guess whether to use Java tutorials or Java lessons or Java courses in my title let me just look at autocomplete now the way that this autocomplete works is basically what Google does and by the way Google owns YouTube so whenever I say Google I'm talking about the same thing is it looked at everyone who typed in Java before and then it says the people who typed in Java before the most common thing they typed after this was Java tutorial for beginners so that's what people are most likely to type in now a little less likely is Java brains Java programming for beginners so on and so forth so basically whenever I made a Java video and the results are probably different now than they were back then but I would pretty much name it Java tutorial for beginners So then whenever anyone searched for this look at this we got two ads and boom look at that my playlist number one so again you can either like go with my grandma and just guess try to find out what the user is looking for or you can just use autocomplete and again what this did is it basically was like YouTube handing all of the answers that I ever wanted right to me on a silver platter so after I started doing that My Views went through the roof and that is why again back then I'm like who's going to want to watch programming tutorials online no one was doing it maybe like a th000 subscribers was like the most popular Channel and now I have over a million subscribers because I just I don't know it's pretty cool trick so there you go and again if you guys are like I'm just going to use this trick and then I'm going to get the most popular videos or website in the world you still need to have awesome content so even though now users could actually find my videos I still needed to make the best videos possible so that's what I always try to do so again if you make the best content they're going to find you naturally but there is a nice little tip and another cool thing is let's say um you want to make a website about like Java tutorials so not only can you use autocomplete right there but if you want to get different ideas of kind of simil ilar things people are searching for you're like you know what maybe tutorials isn't the best keyword scroll all the way down and it says oh the people who search for Java tutorials also search for these things Java hello world Java video tutorial Java interview questions so if you're like you know what my video is actually hello world it's the very first introductory video so maybe instead of naming it introduction I'm going to name it hello world and boom I mean guys even though they aren't naming their formulas Google and YouTube is never going to name or give you their formula they're pretty much giving you all the answers slapping it right in your face right in front of you they even bolded certain things I mean oh it's so beautiful guys so the last thing I want to mention before I let you guys go is this if you ever get in a situation where you're like all right so I found two different keywords and they both are really good I can use either or in my title so I'm making Python programming tutorials and I know I want to use Learn Python or learn program what you can do is you can go to Google Trends and this basically allows you to type in two keywords and you can pretty much see the popularity of it so this is essentially the amount of people who search for it so we can see that a lot more people well I don't want to say a lot more but more people search for learn programming than Learn Python on now just keep in mind you don't just always want to choose the one that's more popular because yes the one that's more popular more people are searching for it but it's also more likely more competitive as well so again just keep that in mind and this video is getting kind of long so yeah thank you guys for watching hope you learn a little something and uh well I will see you guys next time
