so let's go into our browser and click refresh and we shared yet there we go so now what we've got is an a textual representation or an image representation of our text by using these functions that I've already mentioned so really it's quite simple if you remember these functions remember what they do and also remember the parameters and in which order they go it hasn't taken me long to learn this you do forget after a while you have to sort of refer back to things but it's generally pretty simple and you get quite a neat output so this is quite cool we've got example at example.com like I said earlier in the tutorial I want this to be dynamic for example you could keep your generate PHP file on your website somewhere and refer back to it every time you wanted to convert say a public email address that's going to be displayed to an image so you want to make this stat the static variable that we've got here more dynamic so we want to take user input or input that's going to be processed through out our code eventually so what I'm going to do is modify this and change it to get email in fact probably the best thing to do would be to make this a bit more just a bit more flowing and working properly I'm going to say if is set dollar underscore get email then set that to then set that to email otherwise I want to say echo oh no so add I want to echo no no no I want to say email equals no email specified okay so what's going to happen now is we're going to check for this get variable and if so we're going to put it into the email variable that's going to be used by our program so we're now working with more dynamic input otherwise the email is just going to equal no email specified so let's go into my generator here again just hit refresh no email specified so now what I can do is I can specify the email here and I can say email equals exactly pull or set example up here to Pia Academy that all just so we've got a bit of change going on and you can see that that email address is now written out so let's try putting some long value in it so let's just say example a Peoria chemita org again but we'll copy and paste this over and over again just so we can see how the length of this image changes now let's say we were to just specify a width for ourselves we could I'm going to cut this so I can use it again later let's take a 20 for example now let's go into our generate file and you can see that it's only just giving us a bit of this a bit of this image so we're using this function we're not we're not we're not creating any code for the sake of it we're doing this so everything is dynamically updated and we don't lose out on any data and also this this also means I'm sorry this also means that we what we're doing is we're not wasting any data I mean we could say well the image width could be a thousand you know pixels long or ten thousand pixels long or something but we're only creating it here the size we actually need it was so is saving up on processing time and we're saving up on space as well or rather memory so now what we need to do is work out how we're going to put this into a form now the problem here is like I said up here I could say yeah I'm going to write email and what should happen now is it should say email it should break down a line and then it should output this image when in actual fact when we refresh the page we get all of this gobbledygook come up cannot modify header information headers already sent in this page and then we get the literal um sort of textual you know representation of the JPEG as if you were to open it up in a text editor so this looks a massive mess at the moment and we also can't put output within our code so I could say well after the header then we can say email and then a break but if you refresh you see that nothing comes up now because you ruined the content of your page this content type is image/jpeg it's nothing else no texts nothing we're just outputting an image and that's here so how do we go about doing this because the image now exists as a PHP file if you look in here where we're essentially dealing with what's a dynamic JPEG we've got generate PHP and we've got a an argument after he'll or an input variable after here so how are we going to insert this what we've got here let me just highlight it and icon so what we're going to do to put this email address inside a natural image on our page because we can't use this at the moment as it is well that's where index dot PHP come comes in like I mentioned earlier I'm going to set up a a profile page if you like with exactly how I do it normally set what I wouldn't do it normally like this but let's say we've got a name and that equals some dynamic value so it could be Alex then we'll break down a couple more times and we'll say email or break down now what we want to do is we want to output this image from generate PHP in here so how we're going to go about doing that well we're going to create an image like we would in also not double equals an image like we normally would in HTML and we'd normally say something like image jpg here or email jpg or something but what we can actually do that you might not already know is we can insert the contents of a file in here and because generate PHP is being processed as an image type it will actually pick up inside image source as an image itself so what we can do is we can say generate dot PHP and what that's going to do now obviously we haven't specified an image so this part of our code is going to take action so let's go ahead and refresh the page the index page this time not the generate dot PHP page so index dot PHP you can see that we've got name Alex and an email no email specified so now inside image source we can now start pre defining post or using get variables so I'm now going to say email equals Alex or example at example.com and we can refresh and you can see now we're on our index page everything's fine but we now just have a graphical representation of an email address now just a few notes the whole purpose of this tutorial was being able to create some text as an image in order to maintain some level of security on the website so this email address cannot be obtained now let's go ahead and look at the page source and you'll see that we've got this image source equals generator PHP email equals example example com now the Lizer problem in in our method because it's flawed what we actually have now is a text representation of our email address still existing in our code now there's a couple of ways that you can solve this and I'm not going to do it I'm just going to talk about it briefly if you've dealt with databases and retrieving values from databases what we could do is we could say email equals and we could maybe supply a user ID here instead now that user ID might correspond to a value in a database in which it an email address is stored in fact let's go ahead and quickly make an example and we're going to need to connect to our database but if you've already look atlook to that you should be comfortable with this
