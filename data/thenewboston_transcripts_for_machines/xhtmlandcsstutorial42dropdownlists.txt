alright guys welcome to your 42nd store I believe and in this story we're gonna be finishing up talking about lists so before we learned how to make check boxes in radio buttons but as you can see whenever we had something that had like 50 choices to choose from it could get kind of clustered on our webpage for example if we had to choose from like what state we lived in we don't want to give them 50 radio buttons or if we had to select I don't know um I don't know what's like a list of countries we don't want to have a checkbox with like 800 different countries on it so in order to kind of conserve that space well HTML did or the developers of it I say like XHTML like it's a guy I know down the street yeah what XHTML 10 last night as the dumbest thing anyways why I say she mo did is they made something called a dropdown list and I dropdown list takes the space of a single element but it allows you to have all those options inside it so you know that's how you say it so anyways in order to make a dropdown list you need two tags the first tag is called the Select tag now this is pretty much well let me make it first select whoa that's not how you make it all right select an ending select now all of your options like all your states are your names or your countries are gonna go in between these two select tags this pretty much defines where all your options are going to go the thing is it takes one attribute and that's the name and that is because if you have more than one select list it needs a way to identify it so I'm gonna name mine like let's make a list of activities that you can do today activities so now we have a list with no choices in them so let's go ahead and start adding some options and in order to do this it's a single tag actually it's the double tag I lied but the beginning one this is a single tag and the first one is option now it of course ends with the ending option and in between it is the value that appears whatever the user is looking at so let me go ahead and put something like um play the guitar and now option takes one attribute by default and that's the value so value equals play so now let's go ahead and let me show you guys an example of what I'm talking about when I say what the user sees I'm talking about this right here so now you know you're not in the dark wondering what's going on whenever I make the rest of them so this text in between here is basically what the user is going to see this value is whenever you're programming this data later on that's what the programmer sees or that's what's stored in the database that's behindthescenes stuff anyways this is what we really have to work about worried about the presentation right now say anyways we have one option here and that's to play the guitar so let's go ahead and let's go ahead and make like four other ones so paste paste paste paste so what other activities do I like to do daily um maybe you could do comb your hair by the way what website would ask what you're gonna do today oh yeah Facebook and Twitter and every other website in the world but anyways uh what else could you do I guess you could comb someone else's hair I guess if you really wanted to um okay fourth thing let's say teach a possum some people spoke awesome like this o P OSS um like a possum who says that is that even how you spell it is that even how you say it I don't know some only may comment and tell me and the last thing mm let's think of something easy shape why not so now we have to change the values uh your someone else's these values don't really matter or not even using them oh possum maybe there's two oh at the end and shave so anyways now we have a list of dropdown this is basically your dropdown list and we have five different options inside play the guitar comb your hair comb someone else's hair teach opossum to tango and shave so let's go ahead and save this and see what we got by default it's gonna be the width of the longest one and that is because whenever you drop down you want to be able to read it and also by default it's gonna be the first option that appears in your list so by default play the guitar is selected but say they go to the site and you should probably include one of these what do you want to do today question so then they know what the heck they're choosing and then they can go in the dropdown list and say hmm I want to teach opossum to tango or hmm I feel like shaving today so now you have this awesome website with five different things that they can do say anyways that is the basics of a dropdown list and how to create a basic dropdown list with as many different options as you want and don't forget to add the unique value because later on whenever we're learning JavaScript and PHP we're gonna know you know how to differentiate them so anyways thank you guys for watching in the next tutorial no idea what I'm going to cover but probably more about forms so thank you for watching and I'll see you next Oriole
