okay so today we're going to switch gears a little bit and talk about the right circular cone and like the other kinds of 3D objects we're going to talk about its volume its lateral area and its total area so the volume of a right circular cone is equal to 1/3 pi r 2 * height now remember when we talk about the height we're talking about this height that is drawn in perpendicular to the base so say this is the center of this circle and it's drawn perpendicular from the top of the cone to the center of the circle okay so to solve the volume of this cone we're going to take 1/3 pi r which is 3 squared time our height which is 4 so V is equal to 1/3 9^ 2 is 9 < * 4 1/3 of 9 is 3 so 3 piun * 4 so volume of this cone is that should be 12 pi and if this had said cenm it would be cenm cubed because volume is always a threedimensional measure okay so to find the lateral area of a cone you take Pi * R time your slant height and this gives you um you know those little paper cups that come with the water bubblers it pretend that's what we had and that's our cone if we were finding the lateral area it would be us unrolling that paper cup and laying it flat and finding the area of the Triangular shape that we have left so to do this it's Pi * R which is 3 times our slant height which is this height right here it's the height that makes a right triangle with the regular height and the radius so to do this we're going to have to use our Pythagorean theorem to find out what our slant height is so 3 S + 4 2 = X2 9 + 16 is = X2 X2 is equal to 25 we take the square root of both sides we get X is equal to 5 so this is five so for our lateral area it's Pi * 3 * 5 so we would have 15 pi and if we had units it would be units squared because whenever we find an area we're finding a twodimensional measure so to find our total area we have to take what our lateral area is which we find by taking Pi time our radius time our slant height we're going to add it to the area of this circle so pi r 2 so Pi * our radius which is three times our slant height which we just found a minute ago to be five plus pi r which which is 3^ sared so our total area is equal to 3 * 5 15 Pi + 9 2ar is 9 or excuse me 3^ squar is 9 so our total area is equal to 24 Pi units squared um that's actually all we have today dealing with the right circular conee um but make sure you come back to our next and watch our next video which is all about logic and certain statements we use to prove things
