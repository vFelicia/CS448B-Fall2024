so today we're going to talk about our third kind of nonlinear graph which is called an ellipse so this is the standard form of ellipse an ellipse X minus K squared over a squared plus y minus H over B squared equals 1 so we're KH is your Center so for this equation we have x squared over a squared plus y squared over B squared equals 1 so for this particular ellipse we have a center at 00 its major axis is going to lie along the x axis because we know that 2 is greater than B if B was greater than to these I mean then two then a then these two would be switched and its major axis has a length of 2a and it's minor axis has a length of to be that probably won't make much sense now but we're going to do an example so we have x squared plus y squared x squared over 9 plus y squared over 4 equals 1 so a is equal to you have to remember that this is a squared and this is B squared so I is equal to the square root of 3 b is equal to 2 ok so for this one since a is greater than B because nine is in fact greater than for its major axis is going to fall along the xaxis and its length is going to be to a so the length of this is going to be 6 so since the center is at 0 0 I'm gonna just do that and label that center so it's major axis so it's gonna go six in this direction and six in this direction or no excuse me it's going to go three in this direction and three in this direction okay so it's going to go one two three one two three it's minor axis is going to be the y axis because b is less than a and it's going to be the length of to be it's going to be the length of two times two so it's going to go up to this way and down to this way and if we connect the points we get this oval shape because since a and B are not equal it's always going to look like an oval with one of the axis is being bigger than the other so now we're going to do X minus 3 squared over 25 plus y minus 4 squared over 16 so first we're going to find out what a so a is equal to 5 b is equal to 4 since a is greater than B our major axis is going to be the xaxis and it's going to have a length of two times five so 10 our minor axis I'm going to put my I from minor axis it's going to be along the y axis and it's going to have a length of two times B which is eight so our Center this time instead of being at 0 0 it's going to be at if you remember this is y minus K X minus K Y minus H and our center is always KH so our center is going to be three four so 1 2 3 up 12 34 and I'm going to have to add some lines here because I'm going to run out of room ok so its major axis is going to go five to the right one two three four five to the right and five to the left so one two three four five it's minor axis is going to go two up and two down and our ellipse our ellipse is gonna look like that and I know it's a really bad ellipse it looks really bad that's because i'm not using real graph paper if you're at home and you're using real graph paper your ellipses should come out very egg like it should look like a perfect egg so that's actually all we're going to do with ellipses today make sure you come back and we're going to go over our last kind of nonlinear equation which is called a hyperbola
