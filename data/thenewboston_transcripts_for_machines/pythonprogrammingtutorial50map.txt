all right houses welcome back and in this video I'm going to talk to you about the map function in Python so the map function is basically a way that you can take a list whatever it is you know a list of foods of names of numbers and you can run each item in that list through a function really easily so let's go ahead and make a simple list I'll just say income so this list is how much money I make and I'll say the first week of work I made $10 the second week I made 30 bucks and the last week I made 75 bucks all right so now I have a list of stuff but I also have this function and I'm just going to make this function really simple to demonstrate you know because we aren't really learning about functions or anything complex I just want to demonstrate the map function so all this function is going to do is it's going to take each of these items in multiplying by two so double your money so we're going to pass in dollars which is each item in the list and we're just going to return okay there we go returned dollars multiplied by two all right so what we can do is we can make a for loop so for items in income and then we can do this yadda yadda tomato tomahto but there's actually an easier and more efficient way so what we can do is actually call the map function now the map function takes two parameters the first one is what function are you going to run all of your items through well it's just double money now we don't have any parameters and the second function is alright what is the list that you want to iterate through well we only have one list which is this so do that so what this is going to do is it's going to go through this list and for each item 10 30 75 it's going to run it through this function now if we just run this right now it's not going to show anything because we don't have any output so let me just go ahead and very like new income equals list.map all right looking good so I basically am going to run through this multiply each of these values by two so we end up with 20 60 and 150 and then I'm just going to take all those values and convert it to a list so we can print it out so print new income and there you go so now you see 20 60 and 150 now again you can also do this with a for loop so just say for item in income and then you can do it that way but this is a much easier way in my opinion and it's a lot more compact so it doesn't clutter up all your code so there you go that is what map is basically taking some kind of iterable and are running it through a function boom roasted see you next time
