what is up guys it is Bucky and welcome to your fourth Android application development tutorial that's an awfully long name I better start calling them just Android tutorials welcome to your fourth Android tutorials and in this tutorial what we're going to be doing is we're going to be going over how to build a project and also how to set up our emulator now our emulator is pretty much a fake cell phone that we make on our computer so anyways you'll learn about that later but let's go ahead and start a new project so go ahead and get Eclipse open actually let me jot down the time 733 jot it down in my little diary so I know when I'm running out time anyways go ahead and openclips and in order to start a project do this file new project easy enough now we have a lot of different choices here but what we are looking for is Android so go ahead and expand that and Bam look what you got even more choices Android project and Android test project go ahead and select Android project and once that's selected the next uh little button should be able to click what's a good word for able to click clickable there we go that's the word I was looking for so we need to fill in this form exactly like I'm going to show you how and you need to do that for two reasons first of all if you fill it out differently than me then your project might not even work and second of all if you fill it out different than me then when you're following along with my tutorials it's going to be hard harder to follow along because we're going to have different libraries so anyways do exactly as I do for your project name this is irrelevant I'm going to name mine Bucky you name yours whatever you want for all of your contents right here go ahead and leave all these as default and that should mean this radio button that says create new project in workspace should be uh clicked and use default location should be checked and all the content means is pretty much where are you keeping all your files pretty much the location of your project so don't even worry about that by default it should be right in your workspace right where you want it now the build Target for this you want to select Android 2.2 and your build Target like you can see is pretty much the version of Android um not only what version they need on their device to run but also what libraries do we want to use so anyways go ahead stick with me just like Android 2.2 for consistency now for application name go ahead and name this the exact same as your project name so what if your project name is Bucky name that Bucky for your package name now I don't know if you guys know this you should from watching my jav tutorials but a package is just uh it's just how they organize classes in Java so go ahead and they have a weird system if you watch my iPhone development tutorials then it's kind of the same naming system but anyways you have to start with com always and kind of like each other class you separate them by period you know what I'm not going to go over package name me because well quite frankly it's boring but anyways just go ahead and write com doth newboston do um Android Dot and then just name your project whatever project name is Bucky if you want to look up how to name packages go ahead and Google it because uh it's pretty boring if you ask me but anyways when whenever you write create activity if this isn't checked by default go ahead and check it this means well it says right there spec specifies if you want to create a default activity and a default activity is this it's pretty much the first file that gets called or pretty much the first class that runs whenever you start your program so anyways go ahead and name this something like um main activity so with this is going to do is it's going to create a class called main activity and this is the first class that's going to be called whenever we run our device now on our minimum SDK version go ahead and type in the number eight and how do we know that's number eight check this out on our build Target Android 2.2 the API is eight right there so that's pretty much what it's asking what API and again like I said this is linked to your Android 2.2 and it's basically saying um what what's the minimum version of Android needed to run this application AKA what libraries do we want to use so anyways now that everything is set up this finish button should be clickable there you go so go ahead and why not click that just like that and now check this out right here we're getting errors in our project but if we wait a little bit then errors disappear that may confuse a couple of you guys first but let me tell you guys why that's happening if you're getting errors first of all just wait couple seconds and don't worry the reason you're getting errors is because this program compiles everything as it goes along so anyways it compiled everything and that pretty much means it checked our program before it was finished setting it up so it like set half of it up and then checked it for errors and it says Whoa you got half a program here I'm going to give you an error and then it finished setting up and then it was like my bad duh you're good to go so that's why the error went away so if you see error just hold your horses and uh yeah that's it just hold your horses so anyways go ahead and expand Source incom doth newboston Android Bucky and double click mainactivity.java and we see it already built this first class for us so check it out go ahead look around if uh you like what you see which you should then you can go ahead and run it just kidding I fold you you can't run it just yet and the reason for that is this in order to run how am I gonna say this in order to run a Android application on your computer you need something called an emulator now the most basic way I can describe you guys what emulator is it's a fake Android on your phone it's a fake Droid pretty much that you put on your computer so if you guys were foll along with my iPhone tutorials it's pretty much a simulator it simul Ates an Android device on your computer bam there I finally got it out so anyways we need to create one of these emulators to uh run on our computer so we're saying all right Bucky enough giving me the definition let's just go ahead and create one where here's what you do first of all go up to here where this little button is and it says opens the Android SDK and avd manager go ahead and click that and now let me move this over what we want to do is we want to create a new avd so so let's go ahead and click that and look at this box that pops up what we want to do is first give a name and I'm going to name mine like Biore phone because you know why not name it that and you also need to give it a Target and if you scroll over this you see the version of Android to use in the virtual device well make sure your target is the same however you set up your project and if you remember ours was an Android 2.2 level eight so go ahead and click that and all this stuff should be good by by default so let's go ahead and click create avd that looks good uh looks good has a nice little check boox and um it says a valid virtual device if it has a check you know it's good so let's just go ahead and X out of this so saying all right finally I'm ready to run this dang project well actually you need to do one more stupid thing and I promise you guys this is the last thing you need to do before you actually run this program you need to tell Eclipse that that is the fake Android that you want to use and first of all I apolog I apologize if I keep saying iPhone instead of Android it's just cuz I keep developing iPhone apps every day but anyways if I say iPhone accidentally then you know just deal with it but anyways what we need to do now is tell Eclipse that that is the Android emulator that we want to use when we're developing for this project so here's how you do this go up to run and select run configurations right there now what we need to do is click Android application expand that and click new configuration now we see all this crap that pops up and here's what we need to do in the name just go ahead and type in new configuration whatever they give you by default it doesn't really matter to be honest now in our project what we want to do is we want to browse and select whatever project we're working on or if you know the name of the project just go ahead and type it in I'll let you guys decide side on that one so now after this what we need to do is let me make sure I got everything new config Nam IT project yep we don't need to do anything with this all right the only other thing we need to do is go over to this little Target panel and we need to select well you can see right here select a preferred avd for deployment this is pretty much the fake Android that you want to use go ahead and select what one you want to use and then go ahead and you need to hit apply so go ahead hit apply and then well let's go ahead and X out of here all right so we have everything set up our what's it called our configuration or pretty much eclipse is configured to that emulator we're good to go now whenever you want to run this program or test it out the only thing you need to do is go up here and hit run new configurations so go ahead and hit this run button and check it out a bunch of boxes pop up and Bam look at this our program is running how awesome is this it says Android and it has a nice little blinky thing at the bottom and if you have any errors go ahead and Exile this if you have any errors then they're going to pop up down here but anyways we now have everything set up and we now should have whenever you click this button then our emulator in our program actually runs so if you're to this point then you're ready to move on to the next tutorial if you're not to this point yet then you did something wrong you need to watch this tutorial again so anyways I am done talking I'm out of breath and I'm going to go chug a few beers right now so uh thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and uh that's it
