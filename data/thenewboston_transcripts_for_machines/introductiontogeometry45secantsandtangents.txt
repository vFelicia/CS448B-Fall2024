So today we're going to talk about two different kinds of um line ray or segments that have a special kind of relationship with a circle so a seant is a line ray or segment that contains a chord of a circle so if you look at this drawing where the blue lines are where the blue little dotted lines are those are chords of the circle so this line line DP this Ray LJ or and this segment km are all seant of this circle and we usually need a circle based on the center point so I'm going to just no that's not the center the center of the circle is about there and we're just going of all it C so of this Circle C now a tangent is a line ray or segment that contains exactly one point of the circle so it touches the circle at one point and only one point if it like if it's like this kind of a line see how it's here and here that's a secant not a tangent because it intercepts the circle once more than once so this Ray P J this segment a o and this line k l are all tangents of the circle PJ intercepts this circle at Point P only AO intercepts this circle at Point C only and K L intercepts this circle at K only so as long as there's only one point that this line r segment intercepts The Circle at it's a secant of the circle so that's actually all we're going to talk about today and in our next lesson we're going to talk about arcs and angles of a circle
