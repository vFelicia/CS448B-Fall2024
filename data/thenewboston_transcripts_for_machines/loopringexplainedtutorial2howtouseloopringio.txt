alrighty i'll welcome back to another tutorial and in this one we're going to be talking about loopering io so loopering io is loopering's own decks it's their own decentralized exchange built on top of their own loopering protocol now in layman's terms this is an app that lets users trade secure fast and cheap now before we just hop right into it i do want to point out a couple prerequisites that we're going to need to get started so first of all if you don't already i'm guessing like 99 of you probably do but if you don't go ahead and download metamask and if you need any help with this then check out my ethereum tutorial series where i make a tutorial going over all the features that we're going to need for metamask but either way make sure you have this and also you are going to need some ethereum because we're essentially going to be sending this to loopringslayer2dex this app right here so we can trade with it so once you have those two we can now go ahead and click this launch app button so this is going to take us to the user interface however before we can do anything the first thing that we need to do is connect our wallet and what this means is basically just allowing metamask to interact with the website so yes read all the terms and services and click meta mask alright so that was pretty easy got a little confirmation that it's connected right there so either way next thing that we need to do is we need to click this button deposit and activate layer 2. however before we go through this i do want to give you all a very brief overview of what's going on just so everyone isn't really like blindly following along got a little better understanding of what's happening here so either way right now and let me pop this back open right now all of my life savings this .0337 ether is on layer one ethereum's mainnet so let's pop this back open and check it out so here's my account and all of my ether like i said is on layer one now we need to get this over to loopring's layer two decks so that i can trade with it and we need to do this because remember this layer two protocol is essentially like a separate system that exists outside the main ethereum network so at this point in time if i were to ask ethereum what's my balance it would say this and if i were to ask loopering what's my balance loopering would say um wait who are you i have never heard of you before so not only do we not have any balance but loopering doesn't even have any idea that i intend to trade on their platform at all so whenever we go through that process of depositing and activating layer two essentially what we're gonna be doing is creating an account on loopering so that we can trade and technically for anyone out there what's happening behind the scenes is that this contract right here is receiving your assets and mapping them to a slot in the merkle tree which you control however that's not really important for this uh end user facing tutorial but i just want to point that out if anyone out there is a little bit more technical so go ahead and click this now now that we understand what's going on and just go ahead and click deposit and i have point zero three available so let me send point zero all right it's not let me type in point zero all right so it okay maybe some ui issues here but either way i needed to type in the three the three first and then uh go ahead and put the zero right there but either way go ahead and type in however many ether you want to transfer over to layer two now another thing that i want to point out is that since depositing is a layer one transaction it is going to cost a normal gas fee so just go ahead and make sure you leave some ether for the gas and now go ahead and click deposit and once we have metamask open to sign our transaction wow all right so guest fees are uh pretty expensive right now uh let's see estimated gas is 18 bucks wow this is pretty ridiculous okay so what i'm gonna do now is uh retry this process and i'm gonna do it with point two and this actually highlights the need for trading on layer 2 even though i'm going to have to pay a little extra gas here but either way click deposit and we'll see if it works this time all right have enough so go ahead and confirm this deposit submitted fantastic so once we deposited our funds the last thing that we're going to need to do is we're going to need to go up here where it says l2 wallet and then go ahead and click activate layer 2 activate account and activate account and once you do menomas is going to pop open you do need to sign another transaction pretty much authorizing your account activation go ahead and sign and send that and there you go all right fantastic so it looks like our funds have been deposited and account activated in other words account created on layer two and we are now ready to trade all right and i did go ahead and deposit some more funds just to make sure that i have enough to cover all of the features that we want to go over but either way now that we're loaded up go ahead and up in the top menu click trade and then simple and you're going to be taken to this ui and this is actually the first ui that we saw whenever we click launch app however now we're all loaded up everything is good to go ready to start trading so what i want to do is actually trade some of my ethereum and get some loopering so i'm going to say from ethereum i want to trade that for loopering and how much will i have 0.078 available so let's say about half of it so i'll say i'm going to trade .04 of my ether for loop ring gonna get about 142. now if this looks good just hit swap all right so that was pretty quick and apparently i have some loopering now and just to verify if you go back to your l2 wallet and you can now see since by default this takes you to your assets tab whatever you want to call it so if you scroll down you can see that okay i now have um this amount of ether remember i spent .04 on loopering and i now have 142 loopering fantastic and also another thing i want to point out is that if you ever just want to see your order history then on the left right here if you click on orders and then order history right here you can see that this order was basically just uh me trading ethereum for loop ring but either way just want to point out that this is where your order history is now another feature that i want to go over are these automated market maker pools and quick disclaimer i didn't want to make this a tutorial about automated market makers however some of the features that i do want to go over are a bit difficult to understand without a very basic understanding of what an automated market maker is so what we're going to be doing is taking about 30 seconds and figuring that out and more simply what we're going to be figuring out is whenever we just made that trade from ethereum to loop ring we're going to be figuring out how loopering io decided on this exchange rate right here for example whenever we trade this much ethereum for loopering how does it know to give us 138 why not 150 loop ring why not 130. so where does this exchange rate come from well check it out so behind the scenes and by behind the scenes i mean abstracted away in a smart contract somewhere but behind the scenes bloopering controls two big pools of assets and in this case we're going to be taking a look at the ethereum pool and also the loopering pool now in short the amount of assets in each one of these pools determines the supply and demand and by that i mean the less of something there is the greater the price so whenever we traded our ethereum for loopering what we were essentially doing is saying yes there is some ethereum in my account i don't want it anymore or not that you don't want it just that you're trading it for something else so i'm gonna take that ethereum it's gonna leave my account and it's going to go into this ethereum pool so now this ethereum pool now has more ethereum in it and in exchange for that what we did is we said what we want in return is loopering so from this loopering pool we actually removed some loopering for that so as a result of this trade there is now less loopering or in other words a lower supply in this pool and therefore for the next user who makes this trade the price of loopering is going to go up for them and of course it's a bit more complicated than that there are lots of fancy algorithms and formulas involved but the point is for this trading system to work we rely on a pool of both of these assets in these assets come from users so now the question is why would a user ever want to lock up their assets into a loopering dex well in exchange for allowing loopering io to use those assets liquidity providers in other words the people who allow loopring to use their assets they earn fees from the trades in those pools that they provide liquidity to now if all this sounds overly complicated then it could all be summed up in short to say you can let loopering io borrow your assets and you can earn fees from it that's really all that's happening here so how does this work well if you click on this pools tab right here you're going to be taken to a list of these automated market maker pools and you can essentially just decide which one you want to contribute to so to become a liquidity provider what you need to do is you need to deposit an equal value of both assets to these pools so let's say i want to contribute to this liquidity pool where loopering in ethereum is being exchanged so i'm just going to go ahead and click add right here and you are going to be taking to this page where you can add liquidity to the pool so like i said you need to add an equal amount of loopering and ethereum an equal amount of both assets and the reason for that is because if you would only add one then it would actually um kind of adjust the price and that's not what we're trying to do just add some more liquidity for the trading system to work so i'm going to go ahead and add 200 loopering and at the current exchange rate that's this much ethereum and just go ahead and hit add liquidity all right look like it worked so what just happened is we took some of our loop ring in some of our ethereum and we essentially let loop ring io hold on to it or borrow it now in exchange for that what we received is something called an lp token or a liquidity provider token it says liquidity token right here it all means the same thing so this liquidity token is more or less like our iou or our receipt for those coins and what we can do is we can actually if we ever want to um kind of return this and get our tokens back in other words get our loop ring and ethereum back then we can essentially convert this token for these two assets so of course you can see your balance of your liquidity token here and also if you go to l2 wallet and click on my liquidity on the left then you can also see your total position value and also the fee rewards earned from providing liquidity right here now if you ever want to remove it from the pool then you can go ahead and click this and by the way just a heads up if you want to get there from this ui then if you just go back here and click this little tab right at the top then it's going to take you to the same place but this is how you would essentially do the opposite of that transaction where you're taking your liquidity tokens and redeeming them back for that loopering and ethereum so you pretty simple ui you pretty much just say what percentage do you want to redeem and we'll just say 50 and just say remove liquidity and again what this does is it converts those liquidity tokens and we should now have received loopering and ethereum and if we go back to our l2 wallet and look at liquidity yes it looks like it did go down and are right there are our two assets we actually have three assets our loopering ethereum in that this is that lp or liquidity provider token as well now there are two other things that i just want to touch on real quick before i let you guys go and the first one is just using the order book now i will mention this that this simple interface is more than just the interface this trading system is using an automated market maker and we just talked about all that this professional order book model this is not using the automated mark maker this is your typical order book this is going to allow you to place limit trades or market trades limit trades of course being basically a trade where you say this is the price that i want to trade for and you kind of wait and see if someone else is going to come along and take the other side of that trade market trade is basically a simple trade saying whatever the price the current price is then i'll just trade for that price right now but either way just want to point out that there are some more professional tools for the more experienced traders and the last thing that i wanted to cover in this tutorial is just how to take those funds from this layer to wallet and move them back to layer one so what we're going to do is we're going to click withdraw right here and it's gonna ask for an ethereum address and by the way this address it doesn't have to be the same one where you deposited those funds from this can be an entirely new ethereum account it can you know it doesn't even have to be known by lubering at all you can essentially put any layer one ethereum address in here and you're going to be able to deposit to that so just to verify that everything is working let's go ahead and withdraw we'll say oh five and what is my metamask account all right so take note here i currently have .0161 in my ethereum wallet and all right that looks good are you sure you want to withdraw if so just go ahead and sign this all right looks good all right so that was pretty easy and after somewhere between five and 30 minutes you should see those funds appear back in your main layer one wallet so yes withdrawals do take a little bit of time and that is because we are required to interact with layer one however i mean hey that's why we love layer two right so on that note thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and i will see y'all in the next video
