hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a PHP video tutorial for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to be look at looking at constants in um CL within classes so within objectoriented programming so first of all let's talk about what a constant is now a constant is not actually a variable it's a value that's assigned almost like in the same way as a variable but it will always remain the same so you're not going to be able to change the value of this constant hence the name constant is constantly the same value so let's have a look at a few examples we've got Pi for example is 3141 so this would be a constant because Pi the value of pi is never going to change we could also have something like um someone's name for example if you were specifying a page with just a single name that you knew would never change could be a constant so anything can really be a constant but looking at more literal constants like the value of pi which will never change so what we're going to do in this tutorial is we're going to create a class that's going to calculate the area of a circle so we're going to create a circle class we're going to have a constant in there called Pi I'm going to show you how to um how to use this constant because we don't we can't use constants in the same way that we can use variables um and then we're going to create a method that's going to calculate the area and then outside of our class we'll create a new instance of our class and we will um we will find the area with a given radius so the first thing we need to do is is create our class so I'm going to call this class Circle so let's bring down with our curly brackets we need to now create our constant so I'm going to first of all demonstrate how we ACC access this constant outside of our class and then we can use our method within to uh use this constant value so we're going to use the const keyword and then we're going to say Pi = 3 .41 and that's it we've created our constant the name of our constant is pi for pi and our constant keyword lets us know that it's a constant now outside of our Circle class what happens if we were to say Circle equals New Circle so let's just oh without the parenthesis let's just double check that that works yeah that's fine so we've refreshed the page and no errors now what I want to do is say Circle and usually to reference a variable or a property within our in our class we would use the hyphen and the greater than sign to say within and then we could say Pi so this is just going to return the value of pi also we think it may not do let's Echo it out and see what we get Okay so we've got undefined property circle Pi and we think we think well why I mean the key is in this dollar sign here this uh denotes a variable in PHP or a property in um inside of a class so you can see that it's trying to look for this um for this Pi variable and it can't find it so how do we how do we um you know Echo out this value of pi if we can't use this method well what we do is we use something um with a with a double colon so we say Circle double colon Pi now let's refresh oh okay so we've got this error so um let's go ahead and and change this what we need to do is we need to say Echo Circle then our two colons then Pi so now we're getting the value of pi from the circle class so now we've got the constant value um displayed to us so what we can do is we can make use of this inside of our class as well as well as outside our class we're not going to be echoing um the pi constant outside of our class but we're going to be creating a method now inside of our class that's going going to calculate the area so this is going to be a public function and it's going to be called area remember to create your um parenthesis here for your arguments and your um curly brackets curly parenthesis we're going to take in a value um inside our area method and this is going to be radius so this is the argument that we're going to take in and process okay so now what we want to do is we want to return the value of the area so the um formula for the area of a circle is PK R 2 so what we're going to do is we're simply going to return Pi time radius time radius so what we're doing here is we're multiplying radius by itself so we're we're squaring radius and then we're multiplying it by pi now this isn't going to work as it stands I've I've written this like this on purpose because you know that we need some way to access um remember before we used this like this so this and then a hyphen and a greater than sign Pi so we're getting the value of pi from this class as a whole however this isn't going to work so let's demonstrate it first without this and then we'll add that in and see that it doesn't work as well so we've got nothing here so um in fact hold on let's come down and uh we'll create a new instance of our class so let's go Circle equals New Circle and then we'll say Circle and we'll say area and we'll give it a value so we'll say 100 let's come in and refresh now we can see use of undefined constant Pi assumed Pi so here we have um use of an undefined constant Pi now we have defined it up here however we need to access it in a slightly different way now usually we'd write this uh like this so we'd do this and a hyphen and a greater than sign and this would usually work let's refresh you can see we've got undefined property again the same error as we were getting up before so it's slightly different now remember I said you can use the double um colon to access the uh Properties or constants outside of your class you can do that within as well but this time instead of writing this you need to write self and this is this is without a um this is without a dollar sign the reason for this without a dollar sign is that when not actually dealing with a variable we're dealing with a constant so itself just on its own two colons Pi the name of your constant which in our case is pi and then you can perform the rest of the operation so we've got return self PI so now let's refresh and you'll see that we've got no errors we haven't got any output yet because we haven't echoed out the value that this method has returned so we have a return value here from this method so let's go ahead and Echo that out and see if that works okay so we've got a value return of 31,41 um this is right uh the reason we can tell that the calculations have worked is because obviously our value of pi is 3141 uh 3 sorry 3141 and we've multiplied that essentially by um um 100 squar so we know this is correct this value is correct okay so that is um constants within um object oriented programming with PHP um how to access them outside your class how to access them inside your class using this self um and the two colons and also a little program that we've uh created here to calculate the area of a circle
