all righty guys welcome back and in this video I want to talk to you guys about refs now before I explain exactly what refs are let me go ahead and talk you guys through exactly what we're going to be doing so essentially whenever the user edits these comments we want to allow them to pretty much type some neucom in here and hit save and then it's going to save it right here so this action is actually broken up into two parts in our code so the first thing we're going to need to do is we're going to need to get the value of whatever they typed in and that is kind of step one and we do that whenever they hit save and step two is going to be taking that value and setting it equal to this chunk of text right there so in this tutorial we're actually just going to take care of part number one which is getting the value of whatever they typed in so let's think about how to do this for a second before you just jump right into it so whenever they hit edit this text area pops up which is this right here and then they throw some text in here whatever their weird comment is and then we have to get the value of it so we pretty much need a way to reference this text area so we can get the value of the text that they typed so let's think about this I mean I guess we can give it an ID right well wait a minute that won't work because if we have multiple components multiple different notes they can't all have the same ID so can we just say like this components text area well that won't work either because we can actually have multiple text areas and what if we have a component with like three different text areas so all right how do we solve this problem well the solution is to use refs now refs are a way that you can get a reference to one of your child elements so whenever you need to refer the text areas value which is the text they typed in we need to give it a ref so how do we do that well right after text area you add a new attribute called ref now you can give this anything you want and I'll just say new text so now when we refer to the new text ref it knows that it's talking about this element right here and again the reason that this is better than ID is because if you render all these with the same ID it won't work because you can only have a unique ID in other words all of your different components have to have a different ID so now what we can do is now that we have a way to reference it let's go ahead and in our save function let's actually utilize that so what I'm going to be doing is whatever they typed in I'm just going to be storing it in a variable and I'm just going to name it V al for value so this is going to be equal to whatever text they typed in in this example this distances and how do we get access to it well you first need to say this dot Refs dot new text we just copy that too lazy to type five more letters all right so now this is a reference to this element right here now if we just set it equal to distance actually going to be equal to the whole text area object and that's not what we want we actually want the value of this so again the value of this is actually going to be equal to whatever they typed inside which is in this case bacon so now we got bacon stored in this variable Val now remember I said eventually what we're going to want to do is set this equal to this text right here but for this tutorial since I just want to cover reps on let's just go ahead and log it out on the screen so console.log and um I might as well add new comments Wow right like that so whenever we hit save what it's going to do is it's going to get the value of this and then it's going to log out new comment bacon new comment hey now or whatever so everything looks good let me refresh this and alright so I know you guys probably can't see in my console but I'm going to hit edit and then instead of hi my name is Bucky I'll say this equal to bacon snakin and then I'll hit save and then the logs out new comment bacon sneaking actually looks like smacking about what mzo alright so that sums up what I wanted to cover in this tutorial and that is whenever we need a reference to one of the child elements that get rendered out instead of giving it an ID we can give it a ref and then in our code whenever we want to refer to that element we just call this refs and then whatever we named that ref and then we can do whatever we want with it in this case we got the value of whatever the user typed in to the text area and logged it out in the console so yeah there's part one to saving these comments and part two is a little bit more tricky but we'll get there so then guys watching I will smell you later
