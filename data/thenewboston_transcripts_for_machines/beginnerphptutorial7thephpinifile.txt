hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video we're going to be looking at our PHP ini file now ini ini files or any files whatever you decide to however you slide to pronounce them I say I and I just because I'm being literal and saying each character it's basically a configuration file so you know that as soon as we see the file PHP dot ini we automatically know that this is a PHP configuration file now what is our configuration file our PHP configuration file and where can we find it now I've opened my text editor here so I can open this file and we can have a look through at some of the features inside it and how we can change things about our PHP installation so you can have a good look at this maybe print it out take it around with you look at different things because it's really useful to get to know inside of your PHP dot ini file because a lot of PHP problems that you later realize when you're coding actually come down to the settings in your PHP dot ini file so let's create an open dialog well open up an open dialog now you can see that at the moment I'm in C colon backslash xampp backslash PHP now this is because I have I'm running an xampp package you can see here I've got my xampp control panel open and I've got Apache my sequel running blah blah this is just my this is just my package that I've installed that contains Apache along with PHP installed with Apache so this is our folder with PHP and it's got all the information and the runtime dll's about with regards to our PHP installation now obviously the file we want is let's just find it it would be here is PHP to ienai so this is the typical location depending on whether you've installed PHP yourself if you've installed Apache and PHP yourself or if you're using a package such as xampp alarm some of the others ones we've got W amp I think so let's go ahead and just open up our PHP to ini now obviously if you are having trouble finding this you can just do a local search on your computer just make sure it looks like it in a sort of relative location to your local webserver okay so when we open up this file you notice that we have a warning and a bit about PHP dot ini now this is very important by default PHP installs itself with the configuration suitable for development purposes and not for production purposes now what this means is the PHP the default installation PHP ini is not suitable for when you were just if you were to say okay so I've got a local webserver on my on my computer here's my IP address you can see what pages I'm running always always always when you want to show people or release PHP files or a project that you've created always upload it to a paid hosting or a free hosting but some kind of commercial hosting website because what you don't want is you don't want to have the in experience of not setting this file up properly and you suffering for that so there's lots of security aspects that when we enable settings and disable settings in this PHP dot ini file we tend to find that we're allowing ourselves from ability so we can go down you can see standard syntax in here is that we've got the semicolon as a as an end of a line so well as a comment in in this purpose you can see that we've got loads of set semicolons here that are basically just commenting this out so this won't be processed by by PHP so let's go down and find a setting okay so you can see that things like engine on is not commented out so these are file these are settings that are currently in use then that you can modify so let's go down and find something that we might change okay so you've got things like Zed libbed or output compression off you've got a quite a descriptive description up here quite an extensive description of what it does as with you do with most settings you'll find that a lot of this file is is actually description so we're not going to change any settings now we'll leave that to later when we need to we're going to talk about things like error handling and how we can change this inside our PHP dot ini file just one more note is when you make a modification to PHP dot ini if you were to say print this out and go through a reader and you might get to a stage in your programming where you know that you want to change a value now once you've changed a value and you've saved the file so you go to file and save that's absolutely fine however what you need to do is you need to either restart Apache manually or you need to bring up your exam or similar control panel and stop this service before you restart it so for example if I was to change something in here so I'd be able to change this value for any reason I can then oh I should then sorry I open up my exam or other control panel and I stop the service simply stop the service again okay so the service isn't the service is now stopped we can click start again wait till that starts back up and it's running again now what we've done is PHP has taken into account the changes that you've made and will now process them according to what you've written so my strong recommendation will be to have a look through this see if anything catches your eye get to know different values and what they do and read some of the descriptions if you have time because it's a really really useful file to know what you're doing with a lot of PHP problems that crop up like I said are to do with files or to do the values in this either being disabled or enabled or switch to something that not allowing a certain piece of code that you're using or sort of method you're using on your website or code not to work so PHP dot ini files basically the PHP configuration file for PHP have a browse around it and hopefully it will be of some use to you in the future
