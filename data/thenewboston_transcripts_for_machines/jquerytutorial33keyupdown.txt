hi this is Alex from PHP academy' no org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to look at the key up and key down functionality in jQuery now when you go to web sites such as Twitter comm and you look at the area that you are type that you would type a tweet in you'll notice that you have things like a character countdown now these are the checks in the background are based on when you press a key on your keyboard so in this example we're going to look at the the key up and the key down event handling and how we can produce some output based on this so essentially what we're going to do is we're going to give the user a text field a text input field and then we're going to allow them to type inside of this which is just a standard HTML form field what we're then going to do is display the contents outside of the field so we're not really creating anything practical but you're going to get the hang of this key up and key down functionality so the first thing we want to do is create a another javascript file which is going to handle our events so let's create a new a new file in our text editor and I'm going to save this as keys jus so I've now got keys is inside this J's folder and inside the index dot PHP I can go ahead and actually set up to include this so I'm going to say script type is equal to text forward slash JavaScript and end that script there the source is going to be J s /k j s so now keys j s is going to handle the events that we you know want to well the event of a key up or key down so let's build up our page to give you a give you a rough idea of what what we're actually going to achieve so I'm going to create an input field and this is going to be text the ID of this is going to be a user and that's what we need for now now let's go to our browser and have a look at this we just have a text area where we can type something in here now what I'm going to do is create a div just below here or we can create a span of gas and the span ID is going to be a text or user text feedback so I've called this user text feedback and this is user text now the idea of this tutorial to demonstrate we're going to type we're going to allow the user to type something into this text field and as they're typing we're going to relay what they're typing inside of this span so essentially what's going to happen is as I type characters here for example a a will then appear underneath when I type B B will appear underneath and this is all without refreshing the page obviously so let's go ahead to our keys Jes and start to create our event handler now we need to reference our input text a text field which is user underscore text so we know that in here we can write hash user text we can then say dot now this is where we call the event handler so I'm going to say key up or key down we'll say now instead of here we need to create a function that's going to run a block of code based on when the user presses a key down so function and then here we can create start to create our code in here so let's just for an example now say alert key down now what's going to happen is when the user presses a key down while they're inside of the user text field we're going to alert key down so let's go over to our page and test this out I'm going to click inside of here and I'm just going to type a now you can see that we now have a an alert box saying key down so we know that this works now it's an important part of testing I know I do especially use alert boxes a lot just to test event handling so we can just press carry on that even when we press a backspace we get the key down and then you can see that the a disappears so now that we know this works we can get rid of the alert and we can start to actually write out the input into this user text feedback span so we need to grab the value of this text field in order to display it out so what we need to do is we need to create this value so I'm going to create a variable and I'm going to call this user underscore text and that's going to be equal to the value that the user has currently typed inside of the element now to do this we just need to say hash user text dot Val the Val function will take the value that's currently inside of this text area okay or this input text so now that we've got the value here we can go ahead and echo that out again just to see if it's working so let's go ahead and refresh the page I'm going to type in a now the one thing you'll notice is that nothing has been relayed back to this alert box however when I go ahead and press another key we get the first we get the first thing we typed now we'll look at this problem in a moment however I'll briefly explain why we come across it when we use the keydown function the event inside for example this event inside of here the functionality here will be executed or run straight away it won't wait to actually grab the value because we're grabbing the value after the key down once we've pressed the key down this will be run straight away therefore it won't give this enough time to grab the current value and we'll change it in a minute and look at the key up event handler which will solve the problem so we'll go ahead and write the rest of the code and then we'll look at solving this problem in a moment so what we now need to do is relay this value back to user text feedback so what we can do is say a dollar sign in here user text feedback dot HTML HTML is a function we'll look at a bit later however this just adds some code to this the current element however we will worry about that a bit later when we come to it so HTML is going to output a value into this span that we've created here so let's go ahead and type in user underscore text inside of here so now essentially whatever the value is returned here will be input into this user text feedback field so let's go ahead and test this let's just get rid of that and refresh the page okay so let's go ahead and start typing some data into here I'm going to type a you'll see nothing has appeared down here however when I type B you'll see oh well it's next to the text field but you'll see that we're getting the same problem as we had when we were using when we use the alert box so as I type it still relays the data however we're not getting the information in the correct order you'll also notice that when I type ABC and I press backspace you'll see C appear at the end of this a B here okay so when we press M when we use the key down event handler it doesn't relay the information in here in time for us to see it so what we do is we instead use key up so if you're having this problem then key up is the the other event handler to use so let's go ahead and test this now a b c you can see that it's writing it in exactly the same time as we're typing it so in this tutorial we've looked at the key down in the key up function the differences between them and where key up should be used in this case one which retrieving a value and we've successfully created an input box which will relay information as it's being typed
