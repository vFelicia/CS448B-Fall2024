welcome to subtraction with whole numbers just like addition you start in the ones place only you do it subtraction so nine minus one is eight four minus seven you can't do that so we have to borrow from the six make that a five make that a fourteen fourteen minus seven is seven five minus eight cannot do that we have to borrow from the five again make that a six fifteen so fifteen minus eight is seven and six minus one is five so there's our answer so over here 4 minus 5. to borrow from the 5 make that a 4 put the 1 right there making that a 14 minus 5 is 9. 4 minus seven cannot do it borrow from the two make that a one make that at fourteen fourteen minus seven is seven one minus six we have to borrow from the eight make that a seven make that eleven eleven minus six is five and seven minus three is four over here we have six minus seven bar from the two make that a one make that a sixteen that's going to be nine sixteen minus seven is nine so it's a borrow from the three make that a two make that eleven so eleven minus eight is three two minus four i can't do it the borrow from the seven make that a six and that's gonna be 12 minus four is eight and then six minus three is three so over here three minus eight borrow from the four make that a three make that a thirteen so 8 9 10 11 12 13 is five three minus seven can't do that the bar from the one make that a zero make that thirteen thirteen minus seven is six zero minus nine borrow from the nine make that eight make that a ten ten minus nine is one and eight minus one is seven over here two minus seven need to borrow from the three make that a two make that a twelve 7 7 minus 12 is or 12 minus 7 is 5. 2 minus 8 can't do that borrow from the 5 make that a 4. 12 minus 8 is four four minus six can't do a spar from this six make that a five make that a fourteen it's going to be eight fourteen minus six is eight five minus two is three those are our answers for those ones and when you get good at placement you can do it horizontally so 8 minus 2 make sure you go from left to right 8 minus 2 is six put the six way over here and then nine minus five is four fortysix nine minus eight is one six minus seven can't do that to borrow from the six make that a five oh sorry bar from the four make this a sixteen make that a three so 16 minus seven is nine and we have three minus two is one and then one minus 1 is 0. so you don't have to include it you don't need to include any leading zeros but it's very important to include the following zeros so 1 minus 3 can't do that to borrow from the two make that a one put the one right there and that's going to be eight one minus four can do i have to borrow from the seven make that a six change that to an eleven and we have seven six minus nine can't do that to borrow from the six make that a five sixteen that's gonna be seven and five minus one is four and that is our answer and that's all i have for subtraction with whole numbers
