alright guys welcome to my 15th UDK tutorial and in this tutorial I'm finally gonna be finishing up the basic shape of our house so once we finished the basic shape we can begin learning about other fun stuff but for now this house needs a roof so what I'm going to be doing is what I could do before is just copy the floor and drag it up but remember we added that porch extension so we need to account for that whenever we're creating the roof so what I'm gonna do is change my grid size to 32 for easier measuring and I'm gonna measure the new length of our house and let's see what it is sixteen hundred so that's the new length that we need our roof to be and I already remember from whenever we created our floor that it's 1024 it's 1024 in this direction wide so let's go ahead and make our roof right here using the red builder brush hop out of cylinder if you're still in that and for the cube but just go ahead and right select that and as you can see the Y property is the length so we want to change Y to 1600 we want to change Z Z is gonna be the thickness so change that to 32 and for X X is the width so go ahead and change that to 1024 and now that we got that set up go ahead and click build and X out of that so now all you have to do is position this red builder brush over our house precisely so let's go ahead and position that exactly where it needs to be and also pull it up so it's right on top of our house right like that and now all we have to do is add some mass and get that red builder brush out of the way so now as you can see in our perspective view we now have a beautiful roof but our house looks more like ice cream shop or a museum than a house so one thing that we can do is we need to add a pitched roof so in order to make this polygon kind of more triangular let's hop over to geometry mode and remember like I said anytime I work with the geometry mode I like to hop over in brush wireframe mode it gives me a better idea of what I'm looking at so hop over to brush wireframe mode and go ahead and hop into geometry mode and this lets us at all the vertexes all the polygons and stuff like that so i'm gonna be teaching you guys is how to make this really quick and easy triangular so what we're gonna be doing is i'm gonna be selecting this edge in its I know it's gonna be a pain in the butt since I'm recording this right there it only took me two tries it usually takes me about 87 so what we're gonna be doing now that we have this edge selected we're gonna hit this button right here split what this does is it takes that edge and it splits it directly in the middle it pretty I mean I can't explain it as good as you guys can see it so that's what it's doing it's taking the shape and it's splitting it so it gives us a bunch of new vertices to work with so now what we can do if we go in the side view which is actually the front well let me go ahead and move this out of the way a little more so now what we can do if we go in the side view which is actually the front of our building is we can select these vertices and remember if we select this top vertex it actually selects both these vertices as we can see in the perspective view and now all we have to do is move these up so move them up until you get a nice look and picture on your roof I think that looks pretty good go ahead and check it out in side view and also in perspective view and actually let's go ahead and hop out in geometry mode and into camera mode before you do something we don't want to actually turn this into unlit mode and remember you don't see any changes right now because you didn't rebuild your geometry so if we go ahead and build our geometry again and close this we now see those changes pretty cool huh so one thing that we could do after this is I want to make sure that my lighting is centered so let's go ahead and center that light and actually I just moved my window so actually my lighting looks pretty good right now so let's go ahead and test our our final level of course we didn't add any textures and stuff yet but for this sake of this tutorial I'm go ahead and say this is final and it says lighting needs to be rebuilt you sob so let's go ahead and build all and it's gonna go ahead and build my lighting it's probably gonna take like 20 seconds or so so yeah so anyways there is a UFC tonight that was pretty cool Frank Mir be really nice and and anyway he's nothing me talking let's go ahead and play this level so go ahead and play from here and now we get there play our new level in our shiny new house so check it out there's a little lighting issue outside the house and if we want to we can go ahead and fix that by doing this in our top view remember I know I didn't talk to you guys about lighting or anything yet but anytime you want to copy something just go ahead and hold alt and drag again like I said this is not a lighting tutorial just for the sake of this tutorial I want to light up the outside so if you want to copy your lighting just go ahead and select the light that you already added hold down alt and drag and slide this one to outside so then our entire house is lit up and of course we need to rebuild all and as I say there's a UFC tonight and rampage one rampage beat who do Matt Hamill and okay nothing be talking and close that was just little filler talk to keep you guys entertained while my lights were building and now check it out our house is perfectly lit up inside and out oh nice pillars wonder who installed them pretty cool huh so there you have our basic 3d model that's all I'm gonna be doing one that comes the basic 3d modeling in the next tutorial I'm gonna be covering textures and a bunch of other fun stuff so now that you have a basic shape model it's ready to move on to next ceftaz Orioles expand our knowledge even more so for now thank you guys for watching and don't forget to save your file I'm actually gonna save mine right here and I guess I'll see you guys in the next video
