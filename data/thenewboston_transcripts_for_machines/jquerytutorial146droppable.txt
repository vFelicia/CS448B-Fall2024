it's just yes I mean I guess it doesn't really matter about placing just yeah but let's just go to this example let's just say you only wanted names in this first div but you wanted places in this second div the accept options basically allows you to only allow specific groups of objects so by class to be dropped into particular elements so we're going to be using the example that only these two names are going to be allowed to drop be dropped into here but London the place is not going to be allowed to drop into here so let's go ahead and change around our code inside here I'm essentially just going to allow both to be draggable so both of our class names so name and place to be draggable so we say name comma and then place so now that we have name and place draggable these are both draggable and london is also draggable as well that's the place so we've got name and place that are both draggable containment is within the document and they both revert back to their original position so now that we've done this we've made our drop area which is a div droppable however now we can specify which class we want to accept so I'm going to choose to only accept class name so now that that's happened we can go ahead and test this out now when I drop dragged London over here you'll see that nothing happens however when I go ahead and drag oh no that's not worked it is dots name when a drag London over nothing happens when I drag Billy over which is a name we get this border so that's allowed the drag will allowed the drop so London doesn't change the outside because remember we specified the hover class here because this only accepts name none of these will be valid well this one at least won't be valid the tolerance will still be valid but hover class will only add this class in when it's accept a specific class so now that we've got that you can start to see the use of it for example if you didn't want places a list of places to be dragged into here they're not allowed to be dragged but names are allowed to be dragged okay so now let's take a look at some of the events that we can apply to this to actually make more use out of it now we're not actually going to be creating a list type drop box essentially what you could do this is when you dragged Alex over and released you could add that name to this box and the same with Billy you could then add that under Alex again London wouldn't allow you to drop it so that would be the point of the application however you'll find this tutorial in the example tutorials in this series so you'll be able to actually create a draggable and droppable list application but for now we're going to be looking at events so at least we know how to handle specific events so I'm going to create a comma after here and come down a few lines and I'm going to create an over event and this is going to be a function and then going to comma and I'm going to come down and create an out event and that's function again and again just keep comma separating and the last event we're going to take a look at is drop and again that is a function so pull that down there pull this up just to tidy R and we can indent these so hopefully that doesn't look too messy and it makes sense to you the over functions basically what's going to happen when something hovers over the out function is going to is what's going to happen when we've hovered something over and then we take it out again and the drop function is going to be when we actually release something inside of this box so we're going to change some text inside of this box depending on whether we've hovered over taking an element back out of the box or when we've dropped an element inside of the box so over all we won't really want to do is add some text to our drop how drop div so I'm going to add the text something has hovered over me so now when we hover something over we get this text inside something as hovered over me when we take it out nothing happens it just remains as this text here let's just go ahead and give this some padding so it looks a bit better so when we hover that over something has hovered over me that's fair enough now what we want to do is go ahead and specify what happens when we drag a particular element out so we again use the selector to select drop and we apply the text something has been dragged out and when we refresh we can drag something in when we drag it out it changes to something has been dragged out so now the last thing is the actual drop of it so we again use this selector to select the drop div and inside the text something has dropped now we'll just put something dropped now do okay so let's hover over something has hovered over me we can hover back out drag back in so these work sort of in sequence with other one we wouldn't let go it says something dropped same with Billy and London doesn't do it because it hasn't got the acceptance to be dropped in so we can't actually hover this over and let go so these two elements work because we've applied the accept option and we've created these three events that handle the dragging of the hovering of something over something being dragged out or or something that is hovering being taken out of this particular div and then we've applied an event to see when something has actually dropped inside so now that you have the fundamentals of dropping you droppable you can go ahead and look at the the jQuery UI documentation and actually take a look at some of the other options however these should be enough to allow you to drop things into them form lists based on things that have dropped etc etc so that's the droppable interaction in jQuery UI
