so today we're gonna go over the circumference of a circle circumference is the distance around the outside of a circle so it's basically like the perimeter of a circle it's just called circumference because it's you can't take a perimeter of a circle because of its route because it's round so you don't just add up the distances like you want to find perimeter but you're still finding how long this blue arc is so circumference is equal to PI times D or 2 pi R so D is the diameter so D is this whole line right here R is the radius which is d is equal to 2 because the radius is just this piece right here diameter is this whole part so this thing this funnylooking thing right here is called pi and it's we have to multiply diameter by PI to find circumference if you're good if you want the exact value of the circumference you'll write C is equal to like 12 pi but if they ask for an approximation of C you're gonna say pi is approximately 3.14 pi is a non repeating decimal so it just keeps going on and on forever so there's no way to get exactly circumference unless you write it like this but if you wanted to approximate it you'd take 12 times 3.14 and if you plug it into a calculator you'll get 36 point six eight but that's just an example so now we're gonna do some more examples find the circumference so this is the center of the circle so this is the radius so to find our area we're gonna take two PI R so for an exact value we'll get 16 pi for an approximation we'll get 16 times 3.14 you plug that into a calculator you'll get 15 point 2 4 so when we have an exact value we use equal signs but when we approximate the circumference we're gonna use these little wavy lines and that just signals that we approximated it and that this is not the act exact value of the circumference it's pretty close it's just not exact so if I'm a circumference this time we're given diameter but if we wanted to do the 2 PI R 1 7 PI D 1 we would just divide 15 by 2 you get 7.5 but I think it's just easier to use pi times diameter so for an exact value we get circumference is equal to 15 pi for an approximation we get 40 won't we get forty seven point one inches now since we're doing the distance around the circle we're gonna be in just inches because circumference is a onedimensional measure unlike area which is twodimensional so that's actually all we have for today but make sure you come next time where we'll be finding the area of a circle
