So today we're going to talk about factoring perfect square trinomials so a perfect square trinomial will be written in this form a s plus or minus 2 a b + b^ 2 and if a trinomial comes in this form whenever you go to factor it all you have to do is a plus plus or minus b^ 2 now this plus or minus in the parentheses depends on whether this is a plus 2ab or a minus 2ab so for this example x^2 14x + 49 we have to make sure that X is a perfect square which it is 49 is a perfect square which is 7 squared and that this can be written as 2 a which is 1 B which is 7 well 2 * 7 is 14 so that means when we write our perfect square we're going to take a which is the square root of x and then plus or minus but since this is a 14 x it's going to be minus and then B B which is 7 squared so when we go to factor it this way we have to make sure that it fits that formula and if it does you're always going to have a single quantity squared so is this a perfect square well the square root of 49 is 7 and the square root of x is x 1 the Square < t of 1 is 1 and is this equal to is 14 x = to 2 a which is 7 7 x and B which is 1 well NE 4x is equal to 14 14x so that means it is a perfect square trinomial so when we go to factor it we take a which we already found was 7 X plus or minus but since this is a 14 it's going to be minus and then B the square root of B which is 1 squared and if you want to check this remember that when we have a quantity s we have to foil it out 49 x^2 7 x 7 x + 1 and that is the same thing as up here so we're going to do one more example with factoring perfect square trinomials they're pretty easy because all you have to do is recognize them and remember the little formula that tells you how to factor so we have to make sure that this is a perfect square and this is a perfect square so the square root of 25 is five the square root of x^2 is x the square < TK of 36 is 6 and now we have to say is this equal to 2 a * 60x is = 2 * 5 x is 10 x * 6 is 60 x so yes that does work so now we take a which is 5X plus our minus but since this is a positive 60 in the middle it's going to be plus the square < TK of b^2 which is 6 squared so like I said that's all we're doing with perfect square trinomials make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we're going to learn how to factor normal trinomials that don't follow a special rule
