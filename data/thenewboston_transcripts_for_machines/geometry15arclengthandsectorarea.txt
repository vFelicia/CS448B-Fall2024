okay so today we're gonna talk about sectors and arcs and we find the length of an arc using this formula at length of the arc is equal to a over 180 PI R so where a is the measure of the arc and if you remember a central angle an arc length is the same measure as its central angle so the length of this is equal to the measure of this central angle right here so what we're finding is refining the circumference of a portion of an arc so pretend we have a big pizza when we find what the arc length is we're finding the length of a piece of the crust of a piece of pizza we're just finding the outside part later when we find when we talk about area of a sector we're gonna be talking about finding the whole area of that slice of pizza so let's do some examples with length of an arc before we get into sector length okay so find the arc length so if you remember our formula length is equal to a which is the measure of this angle well it's the measure of this arc which is also equal to the measure of this angle so 180 over 180 PI times our radius well if you remember this is our diameter and D is equal to 2 times R so if you divide 14 by 2 you get R is equal to 7 so PI times 7 and that cancels to 1 so you get 7 pi is the length of this arc now if you look that's the same thing as us finding one half of the circumference of a circle so if we were to find the circumference we would do 2 PI R but since we're doing it only have half a circle it would be 1/2 PI R I'm sorry it wouldn't be 1/2 you divide 2 by 2 and you'd get 1 and if you were to plug it in that way you would also get 7 pi so we have another example for this one we're finding the length of this arc so using our knowledge of circles we know that a full circle equals 160 degrees so if we want to find what the length of this arc is we're just gonna minus 45 and we get 315 so now we do L is equal to 315 over 180 times pi times our radius so this is where I'm gonna use the help of a calculator to make sure I get pretty exact answers so I'm gonna do 315 divided by 180 times 6 pi and if you put that in the calculator you get approximately 32 point nine eight seven but if you wanted to give it a more exact answer you could do 315 divided by 180 times six and then write it as L is equal to ten point five PI that's more exact so now we're going to talk about sector area so it's exos when we find sector area we're finding the area of this region so to do that we have area equals a which once again is just the measure of the is angle or this arc over 360 PI R squared because if you remember high R squared is the formula for area and when we only want part of the area of a circle we put this out front to tell us how much of it we're gonna get so a is the measure of the arc and if you remember a central angle has a measure of a so let's do some examples now find sector area so we're finding the area of this whole circle so there's 360 degrees in a circle so 360 over 360 times PI R squared that cancels to 1 and you just get 25 pi for your answer which is the same thing is if we've just used the plain old area formula which is PI R squared we'd still get 5 squared times pi which is 25 pi because that's what we're doing we're finding a portion of the area so like I said pretend this was a pizza and you had this slice right here when we find arc length we find the length of this crust right here when we find sector area we find the area of the pizza of the piece of pizza like how much pizza is that out of the whole circle okay so we have one more problem that we're gonna do so we're finding it of this arc so a is equal to 200 over 360 radius squared times pi so I'm gonna type this into the calculator 200 divided by 360 times 12 squared so I get a is equal to 80 pi and I'm gonna leave it like that because that's more exact so oh but we forgot to use unit so this would be inches squared because whenever we find the area it's inches its units squared and this is centimeters squared so that's all we're doing with sector area and arc length today but make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we're going to talk about how to find the lengths of certain kinds of segments like tangents and secant of a circle so make sure you come and check that out
