and I think one more time okay so now what we need to do is handle in case there is no person inside of the list people so we'll go ahead and type an else statement right here so if there isn't anything selected then we'll just go ahead and type message box dot show please select a person and then we'll set the title to warning we'll set the message box buttons dot to okay and we will set the icon to warning so message box icon dot let's just do exclamation okay so if we go ahead and run this we'll go ahead and click the play you can see we have our form under our form one right here we click new person I'll just add Sam click OK you can see we get the current weight the current money and the current income and now we can have Sam eat work and exercise and you can see that it's going to update and I can increase the income you can exercise even more can work even more and I can also eat and get fatter now before we finish the program there's a couple things we need to do to make it work better and to prevent errors so on the form one load we're going to have we we're going to have to disable these buttons right here because they click them it's just going to crash the program because there's no selected person so come back to form or VB and we will add a sub that will disable all of those so what is called private sub disabled buttons and we will type button eat dot enabled equals false button exercise dot enabled equals false and I'm going to go ahead and type all this in and then come back when it's fit okay so you can see that I created the sub disabled buttons and I just set each one of the buttons enabled to equal to equal false so button exercised that enabled equals false and I made a reverse sub of this called enable buttons which will just set each one of those equal to true so now we need to do is come up here to form one load and when the forum unloads since by default the selected index is going to be negative one for our list box we're just going to type disabled buttons and now we'll come down here and let's see list people so I can index change so if the selected index is not equal to negative one then go ahead and enable the buttons and else we'll just disabled buttons okay so now let's go ahead and run this and you can see that we have our program right here we got the current weight which is nothing current money which is nothing current income which is nothing and you can see that these buttons right here are disabled because there's no person so let's just create a new person we'll call him Sam and when we select that person you can see that it updates right here we can have a meet we can have him work we can have we can increase the income and we'll do whatever we want to now we can create another new person let's just create John Doe and see that when we click on John Doe it gets the current weight and the current money and the current income which is default now we can add as many of these as we want and we can keep accessing different people so let's have him exercise having eat some more I will have him work to make a lot of money you can see that when we select these we get the values that are attached to each one of these people so this is the end of working on our person program what I want you guys to do is create input boxes that will get the pounds to eat how many hours to work how many hours to exercise and how much to increase the income so that your program is a little bit more functional and it just looks a little bit nicer and it works better so I'm thanks for watching guys and stay tuned for the next tutorial
