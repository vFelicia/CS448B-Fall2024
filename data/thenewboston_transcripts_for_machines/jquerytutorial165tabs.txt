so what we do instead is we have to just put four sortable append on this find here and what we want to find is a particular class and that class is UI tabs enough so UI tabs nav is these little buttons here the actual tabs themselves so now when we refresh you can see that we can actually move the particular tab itself rather the entire set of tabs so I could move that there move that there put that at the start if I wanted to so now that we've actually found the particular tab that we want to make sortable or the particular element that we want to make sortable by this class we can do so so if you're just using sortable and its own is just going to pick out the actual tabs itself rather than the individual tabs so that's how we go ahead and make it sortable now the last thing I'm going to talk about let's just make sure that's working the last thing I'm going to talk about is the cookie option now we can supply a cookie option just after here and this will take one option and that's suppose that's the expiry time of the cookie now before I go ahead and actually demonstrate this let me just tell you what it's for let's just say a user was to click we'll get rid of this for now just so nothing no errors occur let's just say the user has clicked on contact now when the page is refreshed this will go back to the default option which is about me so if I click on loop and then press f5 to refresh the page we go straight back to the about me tab now the cookie option is going to allow the cookie to be stored and it will hold which tab is currently open so when the user refreshes their page in this case the contact would stay open I've clicked on contacts I've refreshed the page but I want the contact details or the contact area and the tab to still be selected so how do we go about doing this well we need to supply the cookie option and inside here we set an expiry time so we just say expires and this is in days so we can select say one day two day three days the amount of days that we want to keep the cookie active for so if we would say for two days we wanted to keep these cookies tabs you know we want to keep memory on these tabs for now you've noticed I've implemented this correctly however when now now the problem is that when I click on tabs nothing's actually working and the reason for this is we need to include the cookie plugin to be able to use this so this is a still download as long as you've gone ahead and downloaded the entire jQuery UI and you've selected the whole package this will be available so let's go ahead and browse over to development bundle folder and external just show all files now jQuery cookie is is the file that we need to include onto our page to allow us to use this cookie functionality so let's go ahead and just include that now so we'll come down here and we create a new script include so the type is obviously a text slash JavaScript and the source this time is development bundle forward slash external forward slash jQuery cookie is so you feel free to obviously change around these directory names it doesn't really look nice when you're including it in development bundle I've just done it from the standard package to make it easier for you to see in your directory structure however now that we've included the cookie plugin let's go ahead and refresh we can select tabs as normal when I select say the contact tab and then refresh the page open that's just let's just go ahead and get rid of that okay so now I select the contact tab when i refresh the page you'll see that the contact tab is left open because what we view what we've done by using this let's just get rid of that what we we've done by using this cookie and expires we've now created a cookie that expires in two days and holds the tab that's currently open so however much we refresh the cookie is now telling us that this is the tab we want to keep open with the relevant details so we can then select say portfolio I'm going to go ahead and hit f5 to refresh the page and the portfolio has stayed open so no matter how many how much we refresh this cookie that we've created has stored our tab preference or the one that we've kept open last so this is extremely useful if you want users well let's go into a scenario if your user comes into your website and clicks on your portfolio and leaves out your portfolio when they come back into that you know your website they'll still be able to see your portfolio so it will leave your op your user with the last option that they clicked so this isn't extremely useful just extremely useful for functionality it's also extremely useful for people that want to come directly back from your website in one session for example they might close their browser and then go oh I want to go back to the same page they might go back to the same page and they'll have this tab open I'm ready for them to continue viewing as well as things like browser crashes and if they accidentally close a page for example so the last option we've just taken a look at is the cookie option however it's completely and definitely not least because I think it's a really good option and extremely easy to implement as well so that's tabs in jQuery UI remember you're going to go ahead and create this as an outline and you just really need tabs to be able to actually use tabs again we've gone ahead and changed some of these styling in style dot CSS so this suits the sides of the page and makes it look a bit nicer but go ahead and play around with it play around with the styles and play around with some of the options that are available to you
