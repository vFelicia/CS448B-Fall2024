so let's go ahead and say if is set dollar underscore post remember we're using post data down here and we're going to say search name so we're corresponding this to the name that we've given the element in our HTML document so if this is true we're going to run this block and inside this block we're going to set a variable called search underscore name to the value of what's been posted because otherwise if we specify this outside of our if statement before we've checked if the form has been submitted we're going to have an undefined index error or an undefined variable error so we've put this into a variable so we can use this later on in our code and we don't have to keep referencing back to this now let's check if this isn't empty so if not empty and we're specifying the search name in here if it's not empty then do something else so basically what's going to happen is let's just echo out and okay message there let's come back to our code let's type in nothing so we click nothing or click Submit without anything in being and then nothing happens if we type a value and click sub search we get an OK message back there so now we need to start constructing our query so I'm going to create a new variable called query and this is going to equal our SQL query that we're going to execute or run inside of our database so we're going to say select and we're saying select name from remember our date our tables called names we've already connected to our we're already connected our database a database here remember these values must correspond to your your login credentials and also the database that you're using and let's take a look here so we've got the names as the database so we're selecting the name from names so select name from names we're name like and now we can do what we've been doing inside our SQL tab in PHP myadmin and we can look at the most sensible search option in this case would be to have a wildcard either side so you can put such name in here now remember we need to think about security for this so that's that's a pendous on let's get that outside of here so what we've done is we've just closed our our core our string data here and appended on the search name and then appended on the rest of our string data let's enclose this in MySQL real escape string to ensure that SQL injection can't take place in this instance and we're just as protecting against it as much as we can for now so now what we want to do is we want to run the query so query run is equal to MySQL query and query so now that we've run the query we should have returned a value based on what the user has actually typed in so say the user typed in Alex we'd search for a wildcard either side of Alex and it could return whether it will return Alex Garrett and Alex Malcolm so let's go ahead and check how many results we have got back so what we can do is we can say if MySQL num rows and the we're going to feed this in the query so this function is basically counting the amount of rows that we return bit by this query so if it if they're greater than or equal to one then do something so we want to say you know display the results otherwise this means that no results have been found so we can just echo no results found up here for now we're just going to we're just going to write echo found we're not going to display the data now but we're just going to test that our queries actually working so let's go ahead and type in a name that's not in this database so we could type Craig in for example click search no results results found if we type Alex and click search found so if we know that our query works now because we have data inside of our database that would correspond to Alex with the wildcard either side let's go ahead and type in Garrett click search now let's go ahead and type in G arr and click search that's found now let's go ahead and type in for example Josh click search and Noah's axe found so we know that our query is working now what we can do is work to show this data so we're going to use a while loop this is going to loop through all the records that have been found and put them into an associative array and o sitive array i mean an array with a field name as the key so we're referencing each returned row by the key itself so the data we want to receive from this so I'm going to say query row equals mysql fetch associative array this stands for associative anyway and we've put in the query that we've already run inside here
