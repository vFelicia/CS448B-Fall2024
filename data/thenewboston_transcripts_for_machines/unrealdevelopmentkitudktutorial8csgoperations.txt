all right guys welcome to your 8th udk tutorial and in this tutorial i'm going to be talking to you guys about the different csg modes these different boxes right here what they are how we can use them so the very first thing i want to do for this tutorial is build a simple cube so we already have cube selected and we already know if we click add it adds mass simple enough so now let me talk to you guys about the subtract csg choice so what this does is it subtracts mass when there's already mass so let's go ahead and probably if we work with our front view it's going to be the easiest so go ahead make sure you're working with your move tool aka translation mode go ahead and select your red builder brush now go ahead and move this to the right and probably up just take a chunk out of this you know wherever you want let's take a small chunk out of it like right there so as you can see already we have our blue block and that's the mask that we already added and then this red builder brush is basically saying all right this is your work tool basically so what we're going to be doing is we want to subtract this piece from this chunk of mass right here so we already have the red builder brush where you want it maybe it'll be better if i change this view right there and go ahead and hit subtract and as you can see it subtracts mass from where you already have mass so basically the csg add adds a chunk of mass to your game and the csg subtract subtracts a chunk of mass to your game simple enough so now let me go ahead and with that being said go ahead and select both of these and we'll delete that and now let me go ahead and move this out of the way and we'll go ahead and delete this subtraction and actually i'm kind of jumping ahead myself just go ahead and hit file new don't save because i wanted you guys something first what i want to teach you guys now is what the intersect and d intersect tool mean i almost forgot that so go ahead and might as well add a chunk of master here so now we have a chunk of mass just a square on our screen now let's go ahead and jump to front view again and i'm going to move this red builder brush let's go ahead and move it right where it was before up and over until it's taken out a nice little section right there so let me change this view right here so now we have a chunk of mass right here and the red builder brush is intersection intersecting a section of it now what these two buttons down here mean intersect and d intersect it's basically a way of quickly changing the shape and size of your red builder brushes out without having to change every single point so anytime you hit this intersect button look what happens it takes where it's overlaying a chunk of mass and it changes the red builder brush to intersect that perfectly so as you can see instead of having to resize this brush right here what we did is we hit this intersect button and it pretty much changed brush size to intersect that maybe you can see a little better right there so check it out pretty cool huh so i'm going to go ahead and hit this button undo so just to get you know my red builder brush back to normal and now let me go ahead and hit this button right here now what the csgd intersect means is basically the exact opposite wherever there is mass already or wherever it's overlapping something let me go ahead and click it and i can talk about it later on so you can probably see in this perspective view in this front view the best instead of only creating the red build brush where is overlaying something instead that's the only space it takes away from the red builder brush so now our red builder brush is an entirely new shape depending on what we are overlapping so just remember csg add adds mass to the screen csg subtract subtracts mass from the screen intersect changes the brush size to whatever it's intersecting it only changes the red builder brush to that size and csg intersex takes a chunk out of the red bullet brush depending on what it was overlaying so with that being said let me say this let me go ahead and get a new file once again and i want to cover one last thing before i let you guys go in this tutorial go ahead and let's say we want to add a shape right there and then we want to go ahead and we decide that we want to make a subtract brush so go ahead and we want to take a chunk out of this and go ahead and hit this to subtract it and as we can see nothing new nothing unexpected it takes a chunk out of this so let's go ahead and get rid of our red builder brush and as you can see in this front view we got our main brush right here which is of course the main ad brush it adds mass to the screen and then we have this subtract brush which basically subtracted mass takes a chunk out of it so let's say we want to change this and maybe we didn't want to take a chunk out quite as big so what we can do is we can move this subtract over here and we'll move up a little bit so the chunk isn't quite as big but look what's going on right here hmm that's kind of weird i mean it changed in this view but whenever we changed it in this view it didn't update it that's kind of weird since our red builder brush i mean our ad brush was right there and our subtract brush is still there yet the geometry is not updating anytime you come across this issue where your geometry is not updating this because of this the udk doesn't rebuild your geometry every time you move a brush if it was going to do that it would eat all your computers memory and resources so anytime you want to explicitly update or refresh your geometry you need to go to this button up here build geometry for visible levels now i'm going to go ahead and click this and look what happens in my perspective view down here go ahead and click it and it basically updates it so this basically means build geometry for visible levels it's basically another way of saying all right udk update or refresh my geometry so again anytime you move your shape like this it's not going to change in the perspective view because it's not rebuilding your geometry in order to explicitly rebuild your geometry you need to go click this button right here build geometry for visible levels and then it updates all your geometry so if you have a parameter like all right i move this but that's not you know updating that's what's going on so that's all i want to talk to you guys about in this tutorial again don't forget what all these csg modes do and also when you come across the issue of you try to rebuild your geometry and it doesn't look exactly like you expected that's what's going on udk doesn't rebuild your geometry each time you have to explicitly tell it to rebuild so that being said thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and i'll see you guys in next video
