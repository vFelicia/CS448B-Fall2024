now we're going to learn how to solve equations using factoring so to to solve an equation by factoring you have to have an expression set equal to zero you can't Factor it until you set it equal to zero otherwise it'll give you the wrong answer so then the next step is to factor out your expression now for this particular one it's a trinomial so we're going to have to factor it out and there'll be two quantities that'll multiply to give us this so this will be an X and this will be an X now we ask ourselves what two numbers will multiply to get pos2 and add to get 7 so so 2 and 6 4 and 3 12 and 1 so four and three are going to what's or what's going to add to give us 7 so that means 4 and 3 which if you if you add those together they'll give you 7 and if you remember when you multiply a negative by another negative you're going to get a positive so this is still equal to zero so then we take each one of these factors and set it equal to zero now we do this because if you remember whenever you multiply a number by zero it's going to give you zero so this equation is going to equal zero whenever one of these two factors equals zero they could both equal zero or just one of them can equal zero so we set these equal to zero and then we add four to both to both sides of this equation and we add three to both sides of this equation so X is equal to 4 and X is equal to 3 that's the solution for this equation up here so this time we're going to do a different kind of factoring so we can pull out a v from both of these and we get V ^2 4 equal 0 and then since this is a difference of squares this becomes vus 2 and V + 2 equal Z and then you have to set each one of these factors equal to zero and V counts as a factor because if V equals 0 then this whole thing is going to equal zero so V equal 0 V minus 2 = 0 b + 2 = 0 that's already solved for you if we add two to both sides we get V is equal to 2 subtract two from both sides we get V is equal to 2 so this and most of the time you are going to have more than one solution to your problem okay so again since it's a trinomial we're going to have two expressions now if you think about it the only two numbers that are going to multiply to get well there are four numbers two and three and six and one and and in this case they will only one of them will be able to give you a 6 as well as a neg five which it's going to be six and one because if you take 6 with a positive 1 you get x2 + x 6 x 6 which is going to give you x^2 5x 6 equal Z okay now this work was just to check that those factors really do multiply to give me this so then I set each one of these equal to zero I add the six over and get x 6 and x = 1 now we're going to do two more examples okay so remember the first thing I said is you have to have an expression that equals zero so in order to set this equal to zero we have to subtract this 10 over so this becomes x^2 10 x + 9 = 0 now if you think about it the only thing that's going to multiply get 9 and add to get 10 is going to be 9 and 1 since it has to be negative that means both of these have to be negative minus and a negative * a negative is going to give you a positive and if you check that you'd find out that you'd get x2 x 9x minus or + 9 so then we set each one of these factors x 9 = 0 x = 9 and x = 1 we have to move this 8X over we can Factor an X out and we get out we'll get x 8 = 0 set both factors equal to zero add eight to both sides you get x = 8 and xal 0 so that's all we're going to do with um solving equations today but if but make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to talk about solving word problems using factoring
