what is going on guys welcome to your 27th JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys how to add methods to your objects so let's go ahead and the first thing that we need is a Constructor function so function go ahead and name it just people or something and just like before we'll give it a name and an age so all these people will have two properties a name and an age and we make sure of that by setting the object's name to whatever we pass in for name and the object's age to whatever we pass in for age simple enough so we have a Constructor function now we can begin actually making objects so VAR um let's go ahead and make an object called Natalie and said equal to we don't need that yet a new object from the people blueprint basically and the name it takes two parameters first name Natalie Portman and her age she's probably like like 28 I'm guessing I don't know who knows so anyways we already know that we can access you know Natalie's name Natalie's age we can go ahead and print that out y Yad we learned that before but what we're learning in this tutorial is how to add methods to this object and by the way a method is pretty much just a function that uses some of these properties so you know how a function might calculate the temperature converted to Fahrenheit to Kelvin well methods take properties like this like it would take her age and calculate how many years until retirement or calculate when she's going to die or calculate when she was born or something like that so it takes some of these properties from this object and it makes a calculation with it so let's go ahead and calculate how many years until Natalie Portman can retire she can probably retire right now because she's extremely wealthy but let's go ahead and say that the retirement age is 6 5 so in order to create a method here's what we do just like any other function go ahead and give it a name years left looks good won't take any parameters and the first thing that we KN need to do is calculate or in other words give a variable that we can return so let's go ahead and make a variable named num years and this is going to store the number of years until she turns 65 because it's 65 she can retire so let's go ahead and just write 65 minus her age and in order to use this object's age you use this. Ag and whatever object you pass in for there it's going to take their age and it's going to subtract it to 65 from 65 excuse me so I'm 24 so if it was the calculate for me it would be 41 if someone was 20 it would be 45 if someone was 65 it would be zero so anyways how many years until you turn 65 that's what's going to be stored right in here and now remember whenever we wanted to make a calculation and give us the answer back we need to return it whenever we return something it takes that calculation and returns it to you so then you can print out the value of it and cool stuff like that so numb ears so what I like to do is just go ahead and highlight that to make sure they're both the same and now that they're both the same we're good to go so this function is basically going to work like this whenever you call this function it's going to say all right what object did you give me I'm going to take their age I'm going to subtract it from 65 and I'm going to give you the answer back simple enough but saying all right here is the blueprint for the object so how does this object know to use that function well it doesn't just yet so that's what we have to do in this next line of code in order to tell this object that basically we want to use this function or in order to tell it that this function is just not a random function we actually want to associate it with this object here's what we need to do just like every other thing every other object property you go ahead and assign this Dot and then you write whatever you want your property to be named and just go ahead and put um years until retire or something like like that I spell everything right everything right looks good enough so then what you do is you have three properties for your object every person in the world has a name has an age and has a certain amount of years until they can retire their name is whatever we give it their AG is whatever we give it and the years until we retire it has to make a calculation what is that calculation going to be based off it's going to be based off this function right here so we don't set it equal to a number like 6 5 or anything like that we set it equal to the name of this function so if you go ahead and copy that and paste it and here's the one thing that can confuse you guys you don't add parentheses at the end of this I know it's weird but they made it this way so your object knows that this method is associated with this object so this makes sense we pass it in a name we pass it in h but for this last one we make it just like any other object property just like this one or this one but instead of a value that we pass it in we set it equal to a name of a function without the parameters and the reason we don't add parameters for that is because it's going to take all its parameters already from the object pretty cool huh so now with that being said let's just go ahead and use this so now we can do something like document write again we already have an object Natalie her name's Natalie Portman and her age is 28 so now anytime you want to calculate her years until retired here's what we do just go ahead and write the name of the object Natalie and then just go ahead and write years check it out she has three properties we can either print out her name her age or years years until retire so just go ahead and copy that paste it and here is where you need parameters just like that simple enough so let's go ahead and print it out see how it works 37 years until Natalie Portman can retire so let's go ahead and make another object real quick one for me why not um I'll make an object Bucky um my name is of course Bucky Roberts and my age is 24 so now let's go ahead and put Bucky years until I retire save it and see what I get 41 41 years until I can retire so basically to sum it up one last time this is what you do whenever you want to add methods to your object you already have a Constructor function with properties I have a name I have an age we know all that so whenever you want to assign a function to your object you take the name of the function and you assign it just like you would any other object property simple enough and don't forget whenever you make your function the only thing you have to do to get the extra information is put this object's age if we wanted to print out my name you would write like document WR this name easy enough So then whenever you want to actually use that function or excuse me the method now you just write the name of your object and then right there check it out not the function name but the object property name simple enough so um there are just a couple neat little tricks that you have to watch out for the first one is don't include your parentheses right here that's your way of telling driver script that this method is actually a part of this object because it has no parenthesis and the last thing is whenever you actually use it add your parentheses after this it's a little confusing but trust me if you make like if you do it like three times you'll get the hang of it and it'll be breeze so that is how you add methods to objects so now we basically learn everything about object how to create a Constructor function how to add basic properties and how to add methods so simple enough um thank you guys for watching in the next tutorial probably going to be talking about objects a little more so if you're confused at all just move on next one and oh got some FL in my throat and you'll be fine so again thank you for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you next tutorial
