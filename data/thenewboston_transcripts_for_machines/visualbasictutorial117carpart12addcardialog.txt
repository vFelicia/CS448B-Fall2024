hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be working more on the car program now as I've said before if this doesn't look familiar to you you may want to move back to the beginning to the beginning of the series okay so you may remember that we added this button right here that says new car that will allow us to add a new car to the program but at the moment it doesn't actually do anything we haven't even created the event for it so let's just go ahead and paste this debated right here then we'll be accessing that in a second so go ahead come over to car application right click and add a windows form select windows forms windows form and just call it new car vb and then add it i've already added it so i'm just going to click cancel so here's my new car dot V B this is the design for it now let's come over here to our all cars file and we'll see some of the information that we're going to need to create a new car so we're gonna need the color the name let's just leave the starting speed at 0 miles per hour the number of doors and the horsepower so let's just start adding stuff to our new car form we will add a label we'll set the name to label name and we will set the text value to name of car now we're going to need to do is let's add a text box so the user can type in a name for their car we'll make this a little bit bigger and we will set the name of it to text car name now I'll do this again for the color and some of the other properties of our car so we will do the color of the car so we'll just have color car and that stands for the name still do label color and we will set the text value to the color of car so color of car and we will just add a text box so that they user can type in their color okay so now let's see what else we're gonna need we're gonna need the number of doors and the horsepower so we'll just add a let's add a numeric up/down picker for this we will add a label that says number of doors so we'll set the text value to number of doors and we also have a name to label doors now we're gonna go into the properties for this numeric up/down picker so let's just call it numr and then doors and when you just set a max value for this so we'll scroll down and we will find the maximum value right here in our properties well set that max value to five so that they cannot exceed the number five so let's see what else we're going to need we're going to need the horsepower so we will just add a text box right here then we'll add a label so we'll set the label text to horsepower and we'll set a text box we'll set the name of the text box to text horse and then we will set the name of this one to label horse okay so now let's add a button that says okay or we'll just type add for that so the name will be button and car then we'll add another button that will cancel it so button cancel we'll make the form a little bit bigger okay so let's make these buttons a little bit bigger than what they are okay so we'll set the text of this one's button cancel when you switch the places okay so let's set the text of this one to cancel and we will set the text of this one to add and we'll just make this a little bit bigger okay so now let's go ahead and head back into form on DB and here is our create car event I'll click event handler so what we're gonna do is we're gonna create a new object of new car dot V B so we'll declare add new car as new new car so now that we have this form right here we've got an object of it let's go ahead and show it so we'll type add new car dot show dialog now the reason for using show dialog is to prevent the user from going back to the form one whatever the new car dialog is shown so now that we've shown the dialog we need to get whatever they put into this so to do this we're going to use the width keyword so we'll start off by typing width and now we're going to use we're going to create a new car object so with let's just say Cu from new car let's say let's just call it a new car one and then we need we first we need to declare a new car one so dim new car one as new all cars dot car so we're going to use with new car one then we hit enter and you can see it adds end with so basically what this does is it's the equivalent of typing new car one dot car name equals and then setting our value and then typing new car one color equals then our value by using the with keyword it's just gonna use new car one before the dot each time we call something with our new car one object so let's just do dot car name so the car name is going to be the value that is entered in the text box right here the name of the car so what we're going to need to do is access the text changed event for this so whenever the text change changes we're gonna store that in a public variable so public car name as string so whatever the text is change car name is going to be equal to text car name dot text
