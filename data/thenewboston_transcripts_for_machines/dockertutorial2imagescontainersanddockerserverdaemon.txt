all righty y'all welcome back and in this video we're going to learn about docker images containers and the docker server now that's all going to be great but before we do that i just want to show you something interesting i just want to know if anyone else has experienced this or if i'm the only one it's only on my computer but it drives me nuts where whenever you copy and paste something from google drive these single quotes and double quotes are different from the ones that you uh type into your ide so it's like slanted like five degrees it's so hard to notice but anyways okay let's uh let's go ahead and get to the video enough of me chatting okay docker images and containers a lot of people whenever they're researching docker they get a little bit confused on what exactly the differences between each because at first glance it seems like they have a pretty similar purpose and in fact they're quite different so in another thing i want to mention real quick i don't typically like going over like vocabulary terms until we get to the point in time where we actually have to learn that term because i think i don't know just like in your brain you have nothing to uh connect it to or to relate it to so it's hard to remember or hard to learn however it is so sprinkled in everything we're going to be talking about in these upcoming videos i thought it was important to kind of go over some of these things early on so in this video it is mainly going to be about the concepts and in the next couple start getting those hands dirty all right so that said what is an image an image is a readonly template that contains a set of instructions for creating a container so again plain english it's pretty much the set of instructions on how to create a container a container is a runnable instance of an image so it's its own isolated environment like we saw in the last video that runs inside of your operating system and each of these containers almost like its own computer it has its own memory it has its own networking it has resources separate from your main operating system all right so we can see the fact that a container is basically like a little server running on your computer and an image is the instructions on how to create these little servers simple enough now hop back over into your terminal and run docker version and i want to point out two things and that is docker version it lists client and server so each of these have a version but this is interesting so i thought you know i just downloaded docker got one thing and you know i was expecting one version number but what are these two things running right here well believe it or not whenever you download a docker there were think of it like two things that came with it the first thing is the docker server or the docker daemon this is the background process that runs that can create images run containers it's basically what you think of as docker running on your computer now the other thing that it came with was the docker cli this is the command line tool that we use to type into so we can interact with the docker server now check this out go ahead and run docker run hello world back in your terminal and what this is going to do is this run command is going to create and run this hello world image in a new container now this hello world image right here this is just a sample image that they create for beginners to test out their docker installs basically and all it has is a like i said a simple tiny program on it that prints text out to the screen whenever you run it so you'll see again nothing meaningful just a quick sample image now the cool thing that i want to show you is look what happens whenever i run this command i'm going to hit enter now all right unable to find image pulling okay so let's see what that did okay so docker on hello world and it said unable to find image hello world latest locally unable to find emily locally pulling from library hello okay what is this all about whenever you ran the command docker run hello world right into your cli your cli sent that command to your docker server the background process running on your computer that can do all the docker things and it asks that hey docker server do you have this image hello world and docker server went um nah i got that image i know nothing about it and then it goes you know what cli let me go ahead and check docker hub and i'll let you know if i can get it from there so it went up to docker hub it saw that there was indeed a hello world image that someone created it downloaded it and it created a new container using the instructions in that image and after it was done creating it it sent that output that log to the cli and that is what the cli displayed on our screen for us so pretty much uh the docker server doing the heavy lifting talking to both docker hub making everything nice and formatted for our display how nice of it all right so let's look at one more thing before i let you guys go now i am going to go ahead and run this again and look at what happens this time oh that was uh pretty quick and unlike before where it said unable to find and getting it yada yada it didn't say that at all and in fact if you notice that entire command it ran quite a bit faster so what is going on in this case well let me just slide over here all right so the docker server is smart enough to know that whenever you ask for an image that you just asked for like like 10 seconds ago it's like nah i don't need to go to docker hub this time because what i did when you weren't looking is i actually cached that image because i had a feeling that you might ask for it again and if you do then i'm not gonna have to download it so once you download images using the run command docker server does cache those and i'll show you guys how to clean your cache later probably in like two tutorials or so but just know that that is kind of what's happening behind the scenes so with all of that said i am hoping that you now have a little better understanding of images containers uh the importance of the architecture and understanding this and what happens whenever you run these simple commands like run hello world a lot more behind the scenes than meets the eye all right so i'm gonna go uh see what's going on on discord but thank you guys for watching i will see you in the next video also special shout out sanjeev rocking the flames baby keep it going
