what's going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to 20th I believe JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about a while loop but before I begin I just want to say guys if my voice squeaks or if I stop talking like if I'm in the middle of sentence I just suddenly stop talking that's because like my voice is like given out like I can be in the middle of sense and my lips will still be moving but nothing's coming out so I got this lucky mucus phlegm in my throat and it's no predicting what it does so it's not my microphone it's not your speakers it's just my annoying raspy voice oh you guys just got to deal with it I guess I apologize but anyways let's go ahead and learn about this stupid thing called a while loop go ahead and well let me say this first of all a while loop is basically the same as a for loop all loops are pretty much the same they do a certain bit of code over and over and over again until you tell it to stop so why use a while loop and while you use a for loop well they're just set up a little bit different the syntax is a little bit different I think a while loop is a little bit easier to understand some people like for loops and they're going to come across different situations where you can only use one or the other but anyways that's my little introduction you know the history of the while loop so let's go ahead and the first thing that we need is a counter variable to keep track of how many times this loop actually loops so x equals 1 will start at 1 just like you know we did with a for loop so now the syntax for a while loop is pretty simple it's a while and then you have in here how long do you want to loop the last blue so let's go ahead and put X is less than 10 so this is pretty much going to loop this bit of code so long as X stays less than 10 so now we can either increment it by like 1 2 or 3 or 4 5 6 7 8 9 or 10 so now let's just give a go ahead and give it some simple code right out so document dot right and actually what we can do is we can print out the value of the variable I guess the counter variable right there so we can actually see it that might be a little easier to understand and now let's go ahead and add some text like how do you like them apples first person who can tell me what movie is that from gets gets my respect there you know I'm not really giving you anything worth of value just my worthless respect so anyways so the basics is this we start at one and we're going to loop as long as it's less than ten but you're saying all right Bucky well our variable is just going to be stuck at one the whole time so this is going to keep repeating forever well if we ran it like this then yes it would keep repeating forever that's why we need to increment X slowly so let's go ahead and add one X each time by using that shortcut we learned X plus plus and now let's go ahead and save it run it and see what happens actually let me add a space right there and there we go so it says how do you like them apples nine different times so check it out we started at one so that's why our loop started at one if we started at six it was 36 but we didn't we started at one so the first time X was equal to one it ran the bit of code the next time X was equal to ran the bit of code and it did this all the way down until it got to nine x equals nine I'm going to run this bit of code now the next time after this X actually changed to ten so then this while loop took a look at it and says all right it's ten less than ten no 10 is not less than 10 10 is equal than 10 is equal to 10 so therefore I'm not going to run this bit of code because you only told me to run it when it's less than 10 so that is why you don't see 10 how do you like them apples 11 12 13 or anything like that that's why I stopped at 9 so anyways that's the basics of the while loop again it's pretty much the same as the for loop in these examples the only difference is instead of having this and this and this all in the parentheses right here there kind of spaced out and I kind of like it this way it makes it easier to see keep track of your variables and keep track where you're incrementing so anyways that's all I have for you guys for this tutorial um yeah sorry wish I had some more valuable information but I'm probably going to go take a mucinex and cough up guys let me say this for those of you guys who want to be grossed out listen to the rest of the story but for those of you guys who are just here for JavaScript education and for the information I'm not going to say any information so you can move on to next tutorial but so that's your warning but for you guys who stuck around let me tell you this all right this morning this morning I was like coughing and coughing and I like nothing was coming out you know how like the phlegm is just stuck in your throat and it's annoying that you can't get it out no matter how hard he cough so I took him using XDM because that kind of loosens stuff up and then about thirty minutes later I like sucked in like and I coughed like as hard as I can in this huge glob I was like the size to grapes of it look it looked like oatmeal and I don't know where in my body it came from but it was the most disgusting looking thing coughed up in my sink so I mean I shouldn't have even told you guys but hey I warned it so anyways anyways thank you guys for watching and listening my story of Anna yeah I guess I'll see you guys in the next video
