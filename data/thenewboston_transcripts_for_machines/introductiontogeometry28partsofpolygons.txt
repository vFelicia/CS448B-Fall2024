our focus is on the parts of polygons so we have this polygon right here named polygon ABCDEF the opposite sides of this polygon are a B and C D a B and D for for this side it's bc e d and f e opposite vertices are just that they're exactly opposite one another so a is opposite C D is opposite a being the BNF and diagonals are the line that you can draw across opposite vertices so our first diagonal goes from A to C connecting those vertices our second one goes across the polygon to D and up to e be and D be in the B in there C and F C and E those are all diagonals of the polygon which are formed by connecting opposite vertices okay so we have this polygon and we're gonna name it two different ways so first we're gonna go clockwise and starting with G we're gonna start g e d x em a th or we can go the other way starting with G H T a m XD e so those are two ways to name that polygon and you couldn't you can name a polygon starting with any point so I could start with D or I could start with and it doesn't matter so name two consecutive sides to G H and if you go back to our first page I'll show you what consecutive sides are these two sides are consecutive sides because they fall right next to another each other this one is consecutive sides with this one consecutive first vertices are the same thing where the vertices fall right next to one another all right or vertices okay so going back to our example this side right here we want two consecutive sides to it so this side falls next to G H and this side falls next to G H so named two consecutive vertices oh that should be you know so this one is next to this one but it's also next to this one so now lists all out sides opposite G H so G H is right here opposite sides are sides that fall across from this side so e o falls opposite it and that actually is the only one that's opposite G H so fret number two will just write none so list all vertices opposite oh so right here well a is opposite Oh and T is opposite oh and M and that's it so now that we know what the parts of the polygons are make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we talk about different kinds of polygons and what their official names are
