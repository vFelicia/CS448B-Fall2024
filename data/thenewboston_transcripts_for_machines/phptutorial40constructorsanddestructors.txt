alright guys welcome to your 40th PHP tutorial and this tutorial is going to be on something called constructors now what a constructor is it's a special function that gets called automatically whenever you first create an object sounds confusing well trust me it isn't so let's go ahead and create a class I'm gonna name mine Bucky and let's go ahead and create our special constructor right now anytime you create constructor it's the exact same as creating another normal function inside your class it just has a special name so public definitely spelled that our own function and instead we're just naming anything you want you have to name it this underscore underscore CO and STR UCT and I definitely spread that on STR UCT should definitely take a spelling class alright now let's go ahead and put your empty parameters and your body so like I said you don't need to call this function explicitly when you coding in PHP as soon as you create any object from this class this constructor is gonna get called so in that way it's a little bit different than another function so let's go ahead and put some coding in here let's just echo echo out umm you never have called me come on there we go I know how to get it eventually so well I guess that's really all we can do with that constructor for now I mean we could add some more code but I really am way too lazy to do that so anyways like I said this special function which we call a constructor automatically gets called whenever we create an object so let's go ahead and make some object right now and set it equal to new Bucky and looks pretty good and check this out you know how we would have to if we wanted to use any function in this class go ahead and use some object and yaddayadda called a function like that well in this case we don't need to do any of that soon as we create this object is gonna say alright what class did you create this object from you created it from Bucky so I'm gonna go up to the Bucky class and I'm gonna look if there's a special function name underscore underscore construct in here if there is then I'm gonna run automatically right now whatever you told me to in that constructor if there's not any function at all in here called construct then I'm just gonna you know do nothing at all so let's go ahead and save this and see what we got let me go ahead and refresh a little bit of this a little bit of call make on the beat and check this out you never called me so now you can see instead of having to explicitly call this little bit of code and construct it gets pretty much called automatically so that is what a constructor is in by the way let me just add this little note in this example I'm showing you right here it's pretty much useless because I mean why couldn't we just create another function and if we're gonna say that then why wouldn't we just write echo right in the body then just having to go through a class at all well actually whenever you're working with classes the constructor is useful for maybe you want to initialize some variables or maybe you want to call some other methods automatically well in this case I know that it's not really useful but whenever we are actually programming real programs and I'm not just showing you guys an example you'll see how it's useful and anyways enough of that let me go ahead and show you guys one little thing they may be wondering you may be wondering alright why do you have parameters after the class name the parameters after the class name whenever you create a new object are further constructor a constructor as you can see like I said is just like a normal function except that it gets called automatically whenever create object so knowing that you know that you can pass parameters to your constructor just like you can any other normal function so let's go ahead and pass our constructor a parameter right now will pass the X and say you never called me X and then whenever you create our object it will pass in something like Sarah well I kind of like that Sarah with no age anyways we'll go ahead and pass in the name Sarah to our constructor and that's what these parameters are for right here your constructor so then it's gonna say alright you never called me Sarah so oops almost forgot to save it and let's go ahead a little bit of this a little bit of this a little bit of behind the scenes and check this out you never called me Sarah or is it you never called me love Sarah I don't know depending if you want to make this program to send me or we're gonna send this to Sarah you know it's up to you just follow your heart so anyways that is why you see those parameters after the class name those are for Reconstructor if your constructor takes a parameter so now I know you guys those probably bothering you what those parameters mean so you're saying alright buggy so I know everything there is to know about constructor well yes you do so now I can teach you guys about a Deconstructor now check this out way back when in PHP for programmers set alright now that you have a constructor that's all nice and all but we want to add something else we want to add something called a Deconstructor and this gets called when the PHP script is complete and you no longer need your object in your object gets destroyed well right before it gets destroyed your PHP code is gonna look for something called a Deconstructor in your class and if you have one this is the code that gets ran right before your script completes and right before your object gets deleted now let me tell you guys this in this code is where you mostly do any of your cleanup like another programming languages you might clean up the memory or you might delete some files well it's not as common in pageviews up in other programming languages but I'm gonna show it to you guys anyways because you know I just can't skip over information so let's go ahead and name public function underscore underscore de as TR UCT destruct so it's not gonna take any parameters and all its gonna do is echo you know destruction or something like that so anyways down here in our object we don't need to do anything different because this object is gonna get created and then right after it gets created its gonna say alright your script is complete you no longer need this object so I'm automatically going to destroy this object but before I destroy it I'm gonna go in your class to see where the object was created from and see if there's a special function called destruct and if there is I'm gonna call it right now so let's go ahead and save this and a little bit of this yes and check this out you never called me Sarah and then your script is completed so it's gonna look for this special function called destruct and it's gonna run whatever code is in there and like I said your Deconstructor is really useful in other programming languages where you need to clean up memory or delete files it's not as useful in PHP but you need to have it there and I mean I really never even built a program where I used a Deconstructor I just any code I needed to run I just ran it before you know I completed everything but anyways I need to show you guys this because it's a part of PHP that you need to understand and if you ever come across that you won't be like whoa what the heck is this so anyways my point a Deconstructor is not as popular as constructors but it does exist so now you guys know it um if you never use again sorry for wasting your time you can send me some hate mail if you like so anyways that's all I have for you guys for this tutorial what a constructor is how you can pass it a parameter and what this useless D constructor is so anyways thank you guys for watching and I know in this example just like most of my examples I'm just covering the basics this isn't really a useful program home pipo unless you really hate it a girl named Sarah but anyways in the upcoming programming programs I guess programming programs as a nice little name you can see why this would be useful but anyways for now thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe in aus my guys later
