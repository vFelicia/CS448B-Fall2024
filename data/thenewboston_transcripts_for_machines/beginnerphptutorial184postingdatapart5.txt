so now we can put it into its own variable so we can use it a bit better later so we're going to say text equals dollor poost uh text that just saves us writing out this dollor poost text again and again okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to check if this equals a value so we don't want to be uh inserting empty values into our database we want to be uh entering at least some text so I'm going to say if not empty um and we're going to say text so we're referencing text into here here and if not empty text we do something else I'm going to Echo out remember we're echoing out whatever output we get from this update. in. page we're update sorry we're outputting it into our message div down here so we can we can give error messages to the user and it will pop up without refreshing the page this is the whole point of Ajax it gives you things a lot quicker and without refreshing the page so it's a lot easier to deal with so we can say uh please type A um please type something for example uh so let's just go ahead and Echo our okay here just so we know what we're doing uh and let's go ahead and submit nothing okay so it says please type something now let's insert our type Alex click submit okay so we know that that's working that's great now we can start constructing our query to insert this data into the database and then check whether the query was successful or not so let's start constructing the query uh this is quite simple uh I have tutorials on this as well so go back and refer to them if you're you're stuck on this bit uh we're going to say insert into and now we choose the table name so if we go back to PHP my admin we can see the table name is data so we're inserting into this data table and then we say values and inside parentheses we're going to supply the amount of values and the values that we want to input so we're going to say two values so we've got two of string data here if you like the first one is an ID and it's an autoincrement so we don't need to specify a value we can keep this blank what that will do is the database will automatically update it uh to the next number in line in the increment but in here what we need to do is specify this text here now we do need to add some level of security so we need to add um we need to basically escape from this string here and append on this text variable and then we need to append on the rest of the string now what we can do is we can use the MySQL real Escape string function and en close that text in that and the reason we do this is because uh SQL injection is possible whenever we're allowing a user um a user a dynamic user input uh going into a query um can always result uh potentially in SQL injection so now we're going to say query run equals MySQL Query and then obviously the query uh string inside of there so let's just add this into an if statement so we can check if it's worked so if query run equals MySQL Query what this is going to happen what's going to happen here sorry is this is going to return true if uh the query was a success so we can say in here uh success else we can say failed so let's Echo failed oh not in capitals it's a bit rude so failed and then otherwise here we can say Echo um data inserted for example okay so now let's run back to um our browser and test this out so as it stands inside our database we've got no values in here so MySQL returned an empty result set i z r so we've got nothing in in our database at the moment or in our table rather so now I'm just going to pop my name in there and I'm going to click submit so so it says data inserted so now I can presume that the data's been inserted into the database let's go in and let's click on browse and you can see that it has in fact inserted this data let's go ahead and um type something else so we'll type do and click submit and we get the same message back again uh it hasn't changed so I presumed that that has just um reiven me the data inserted VAR uh Echo uh and yeah it's inserted more data so now we can start in start to insert uh different data and whatever we want so there's not really much much point to this um application itself but hopefully from this tutorial you can go away um with your knowledge now of the post um the post data or posting data using Ajax as opposed to using get data and you can apply it to your own uh your own uses so we've gone through the Ajax stage of things we've gone through uh the HTML and the div and we've also more importantly gone through the PHP and how we can combine that with Ajax um and taking our post variable in order to post a value to the database or insert a value into a database
