hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this video we're going to be creating a div element that uh using width and height both for the window and the object we're able to place in the very center of the page uh and this is also dependent on moving the window as well so you can see I've got my code just behind me here uh and you can see that this will stay in the center of the page uh if we adjust the width uh or the height of the window so we constantly place this exactly in the middle of the page so it's an extremely simple way to do things we're going to create it a little messily uh this would be good as for examp as as an example a plugin uh but we're going to go and create it just very messily but just using the width and height to calculate where we should place this uh it's not as easy as placing it at half the width and half the height you have to then you know subt subtract off of the um actual object the half of the object height and width as well but we'll we'll cover that so um we'll go ahead and look at the code um or go into our text editor and start writing out the code for this okay so the first thing that we want to go ahead and do is create our element and then we're going to apply some styling to it you'll notice I've included style.css on the page uh and as well as jQuery obviously so we're using jQuery and ext.js as well so let's go ahead and just create this div and then we can start to style it and preview it in our browser um I've created a div and I'm going to give this an ID of very center and let's just go ahead and refresh the page you can see nothing but the div does exist here so let's go ahead into star. CSS and actually go ahead and sty this so very center and we're going to apply a few properties to this the first one is the height so I'm going to have this at 150 pixels uh then the width again 150 pixels uh I'm going to set a background color of black just so we can see where it is properly uh let's just refresh you can see that we've got that there uh let's just change that to 250 sorry and lastly what we want to do is we want to set the position to Absolute and what this is going to allow us to do is use top and left inside of jQuery we're not going to do anything else to this style do uh this um div styling uh but position absolute means that we can move it around on the page exactly where we want it's it's fixed to our own custom position we can choose where we want it so for example I could say top 20 pixels and you can see that shifted 20 pixels from the top or left 200 pixels uh and that will have shifted 200 pixels from the left so we're going to be using the top and left to move this around and therefore we need position set to Absolute okay so now that we've created our div on index.php and our our uh styling on style.css we can go ahead and actually start to write this out and we're going to be writing the resize action inside of a function and we're going to be using the window resize event handler to call this function every time the window's resized but we're also going to be calling this function uh initially so it's set to the middle of the page initially so like I said slightly messy and it would be better used as you know like a Plugin or something uh but for now this will give you the general idea so so we want document and we want to apply the ready event handler and inside of here uh create a function we'll just go ahead and bring that down just the standard notation for when we use jQuery uh nothing to worry about uh that's just how we write it out so let's go ahead and create our uh move div function so function move div this will essentially uh this function will essentially grab the height and the width of the window the height and the width of the div itself uh and then it'll apply some kind of uh position to this and then we can you know call this function at any time on our on our inside of our document so the first thing we want to do is establish the window width and the window height so we use the width and the height to calculate this so I'm going to create a variable called window width and that's going to be equal to window do width quite simple we're using a jQuery selector and we're selecting the window and we're taking the width of of the window let's go ahead and say window height equals and exactly the same thing let's just tab these over window do height okay so let's go ahead and alert out window or let's go ahead and alert out width x height X and let's just go ahead and replace these X variables in here okay and we can just uh append on window height so we're taking the window width uh from here and we're applying it to a variable called window width we're taking the height using window height obviously window is the current window and it will change depending on where you move it uh and then we're alerting out the width so in here we can just call this function move div or down here uh so when the document is ready we Define this function or we uh yeah we Define this function and then we call the function down here so now when we refresh uh we get width 950 and height 4 59 so that's the current uh width of my window okay so now what we want to do is we don't want to just call that function yet in fact we do because we're going to do some more testing we want to grab the width and the height of the object so I'm going to call this object width and that's going to equal remember we called our div very center
