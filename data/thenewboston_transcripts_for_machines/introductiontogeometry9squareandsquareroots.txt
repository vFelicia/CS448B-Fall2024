so we're gonna be talking about squares because in our next video they're gonna help us solve some triangle problems so a square is basically like it's written like this and it's basically the number times itself so right here we have x squared so that's just x times X so we're gonna do some examples where we're just gonna write out this square and find out what it equals so 11 squared is just saying 11 times 11 equals what and 11 times 11 is equal to a hundred and twentyone so 1 times 1 is equal to 1 4 times 4 is equal to 16 2.3 times 2.3 now 5.29 six times six equals thirtysix and when we have a fraction like we do right here you square the top and square the bottom so ya 1 times 1 over 2 times to the top equals 1 the bottom equals 4 so that's what you do when you square a number now to undo a square you take the square root of a number so when you take the square root of a number you you're finding what number of times no you're finding what number times itself equals the square so for x squared we know if we took the square root of x squared since we know that it's x times X when we take the square root of it we just have X a square root is how you undo a squared function so now we're you're going to do some examples the square root of 121 well this is just saying the square root of 11 11 times 11 so when you take this square root you get rid of one of those 11s and you just get 111 because this is saying if I squared 11 I would get a hundred and twentyone which is true so this one's pretty easy what times one equals 110 times 10 so you get ten now just like we square the top and the bottom of a fraction we're gonna take the square root of the top and bottom separately so what times itself gives me 4 well 2 times itself gives me 4 and what times itself gives me 5 5 so the answer is 2/5 the square root of 9 is just 9 is just 3 times 3 and that gives us 3 16 4 times 4 and then 1 over 9 since the square root of 9 is 3 and we know that the square root of 1 is 1 it's just 1/3 so when you raise a number to the second degree you're saying x squared and when we want to undo that squared we take the square root and we go back to the original number so this is gonna help us with triangles and solving sides of triangles in our next video so make sure you come back and watch that
