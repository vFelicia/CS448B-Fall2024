hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the slider in jQuery UI what we're going to do is we're going to implement a simple slider onto the page and take a look at some of the options that are available to us so when the slider is in operation we're going to create a div underneath the uh slider that's going to hold the div and we're going to feedback the values associated with the slider so this is useful for things like if you've looked at clothing websites or other websites you have um you know such as just retail websites you might have sliders that uh allow you to pick a particular value uh of uh in the range of a particular value uh for example in currency you would have uh a slider that would allow you to only show items between uh certain amounts of money so sliders can be implemented in this way obviously we're not going to be looking at it in too much detail in this tutorial by just demonstrating this slider um effect or slider widget in jQuery UI but we're just going to take a look at some of the options available some of the more useful options so the first thing we want to do is actually Implement a slider into our page so I've included obviously all the necessary includes uh that we've been using throughout the tutorial series uh but the first thing I'm going to do is go over to style.css and just style some of the body elements or one of the body Elements which is the font size and I'm going to set this to 14 pixels uh I'm also going to be setting the size of the slider a bit later on we're going to be fiddling around with this during the tutorial uh but for now I'm just going to leave that blank until we implement the slider so the slider uh we're going to place into a div element on our page I'm just going to call this slider and underneath I'm going to have an area where we have the slider value so I'm just going to call this div slider value so the slider is going to be implemented in here here and the tech or the value associated with the slider will go into this div here so if we go over to ui. JS which I've included on my page we can start to actually activate the slider so we're going to reference uh using a selector uh this slider div here so we'll go ahead and write slider in there and then we just want to write do slider now this will be this will uh automatically activate the slider and we can view it on our page uh so yeah that should be slider so let's go ahead and refresh our page and you can see that we've got a basic slider uh with no minimum or maximum value uh and we're also not feeding back the value to the user so the first thing we're going to take a look at is actually feeding back the value so inside the options we're going to set an event based on um the uh slider value so the event name is slide so if we just write slide in here we can create a function associated with this so we'll come down a couple of lines uh let's just pop this on a separate line Al together uh down here okay so when we've actually when we're actually taking uh the slider and dragging it across this bar uh anything inside here we want to uh feed back so this function here is going to take two uh parameters which is event and UI now we're not going to be looking at event but we're going to be looking at UI uh which is obviously going to feedback the value of the bar so I'll show you how do that just now now we're going to uh select our slider value uh div and we're going to place some text inside there we can use HTML or text uh if you're putting anything else other than uh thing you know like you might want to go ahead uh and Implement a pound sign for example uh let's just do that to test and then you want to append on ui. value now we're going to be changing this a bit later on uh with the other options that we're going to give it because uh value isn't going to work for uh values in between so you know you you'll understand a bit later on that we'll we'll go ahead and change this and accesses access it uh as an array but for now what's going to happen is we've set up the slider uh when we slide we run this current function and from UI we place the value of the slider into the slider value uh with a pound sign on the front of it so let's go ahead and refresh uh you can see that as we slide uh this this is now updating so you can see that the uh value is increasing uh by default it's from zero so back to zero here uh all the way up to 100 now because we're going to be setting values a bit later and using these in several places what I want to do is just go up here and set a few of these uh values into variables so I'm going to set uh the Min value equal to one we want the value to always start at one and I'm going to set the max value to uh 400 okay so now what we want to do is actually Implement these as uh options so the two options we're looking at here is min and Max so just under here I can write Min and I can go ahead and put Min value so now Min will be equal to one so the slider will always start at one and Max we can use max value and remember this comma here because this comma separates uh this uh option value here from this slide here it would usually look like that so now that we've set a Min and a Max we can go ahead and check that you can see that it will have started at 1 and as we go all the way up it's now at a maximum value of 400 so that's essentially how we are setting the minimum and maximum values of our slider which is almost uh always going to be the case uh we might not want zero to 100 we might want a larger value so assuming this is pound uh we have an option from 1 pound to Â£400 so this could be a slider for example uh I don't know how much money do you want to borrow uh or how much money you know would you like to donate or anything like that um there is another option that we can use called Step which will step at an in incremental point in the uh slider so for example if we only wanted multiples of five uh what we could do is we could set a step value so I could set the step value to five for example and what's going to happen here is uh when we actually increment it it's going to go up with a value of five so you'll notice at the moment that we've uh we're going up in five because we started at one uh so we could either change this to zero or or we could Step at four
