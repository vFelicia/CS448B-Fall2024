what's going on guys welcome to your 14th JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to start off teaching you guys something called an if statement and then we're going to learn about something called comparison operators so basically an if statement is a really simple way to have your computer make a decision you're going to give it a scenario and if it's true it's going to run a bit of code for example if you say if the variable called Bucky is equal to 24 then run this of code if it's not then don't do anything so really simple decision so let's go ahead and do that right now let's go ahead and make two variables and later on we'll compare them to each other so make a variable name apples and set this equal to you know 20 or 34 whatever and make a ver another variable called hot dogs and set this equal to like 53 it doesn't matter what numbers they are as long as they don't equal each other so we have two variables we already know what those do now let's go ahead and look at the basic Syntax for an if statement now the if statement is set up like this all of the time have the word if right there and then go ahead and write two parentheses after that now inside these parentheses is where you're going to be making your comparison you're going to say all right if apples is equal to hot dogs if apples is greater than hot dogs if apples is less than hot dogs and all that stuff you're going to be comparing one thing against another now if that comparison is true it's going to go ahead and run the bit of code in between these curly brackets so go ahead and throw those in so basically if statements work like this it's going to test something right here and if that test is true or if they do match each other it's going to run this bit of code so let's go ahead and give it something really simple to run run document. write um yay it worked something stupid like that so let's go ahead and give it a simple comparison right now and you may be thinking right this all right a simple comparison would make sense like apples equals hot dogs I mean make one thing equal to another and that's a test that's how I did it in math class that's how it works but whenever we make a comparison we have to follow one simple rule we can't use a single equal sign ever because JavaScript already uses single equal sign whenever it sets a variable equal to a value so whenever you're comparing two values you need to have two equal signs and now you're testing all right does the value of apples equal the value of hot dogs in other words does 34 equal 53 if 34 does equal 53 it's going to pron out yay it worked if it doesn't equal 53 or if they don't equal each other nothing's going to happen so since they don't equal each other let's go ahead and refresh and nothing happen happens so let's go ahead and change these values to make apples equal 53 and hot dogs equal 53 so now apples does indeed equal hot dogs so this is going to be true and since this is true this is going to run so let's go ahead and save this refresh it and check it out yay it worked so now we can see the basics of an if statement it's basically this again you you test what is called a condition now this condition is going to be true if it's true and it's going to be false if it's not true if they equal each other in this case it's going to be true if they don't it's going to be false anytime it's true this bit of code is going to run any time it's false nothing's going to happen so you're basically giving your computer a decision to make if this is true run this if it's not don't do anything so aside from this double equal sign we know that we can use the double equal sign to tell JavaScript compare two things we can also give it a couple other symbols we can say explanation point equals and what this means is if apples doesn't equal hot dogs go ahead and print this out so check this out since they are alike and they do equal each other then this is going to be false since well let me go ahead and run this and show you guys nothing happens right here so why is this false well does apples not equal hot dogs no they do equal each other so it's false so this is a way of saying all right if apples is not equal to hot dogs do this so when exactly would this pronounce say you had 53 and 99 well now they don't equal each other so this statement is true and since this is true I'm going to go ahead and print this out and worked so another thing that we can do is I showed you guys how to make it equals and how to make it not equals so you can of course use greater than and less than these are really easy ones if apples is greater than hot dogs AKA if 53 is greater than 99 print this out so can you guys guess what's going to happen it doesn't print it out because 53 is not higher than 99 and again I don't need to show you this but I might as well do it anyways if 53 is less than 99 which is indeed true since this statement is true then this is going to print out just like that so that's is why when I refresh it it prints out so those are the four most common but I also need to uh include one other thing you can also have uh greater than or equals to and this say if it's greater than or if it is equals to like 53 and 53 would work and also 56 is greater than or equal to 53 but so just uh verify that it does work there you go right there and also you have less than and equals to so in any scenario where apples is less than or equal to Hot Dogs which it would be false in this case because 56 is not less than or equal to Hot Dogs whenever you save it it doesn't work so check it out so those are the basic ones you there are a couple other ones but I don't want to confuse you guys for now so in when you want to compare two values to each other use double equal signs when you want to make sure that they're not equal to each other use explanation point equal sign and then you have your Basics greater than less than greater than or equal to less than or equal to so that's basics of what an if statement is it pretty much test something and if it's true it runs a little bit of code so now you understand what conditional operators are or excuse me comparison operators and also the if statement so in the next tutorial we're going to be going over kind of a more complex if statement but it's probably going to be the one that you're going to be using more often so it's actually not that difficult to learn if you can understand this then the next thing is going to be a breeze so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
