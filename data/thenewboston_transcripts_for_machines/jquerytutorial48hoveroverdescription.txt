hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with a video tutorial for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to be creating a hover over effect um over um an element in HTML so just taking a look at this example quickly I've got a link just here and I've got an image just below that now the overall effect we're trying to achieve is when we hover over a particular element we're going to take a description from a custom custom attribute that we give this element and then we're going to display it in a box as we hover over so the effect's quite cool and it's it's found on quite a few uh websites mainly when you have uh content you know you want to show your users or give your users a description of the content as they hover over be it an image uh a link or anything else so you can see that when I hover over Google I've got this div uh element that's following my cursor and it has a description which says Google a powerful search engine so the link still works we can go ahead and click on it and and go over to that link uh but we've assigned a particular class to this link to allow us to display this description uh accordingly uh we can also use it with images as well so you can see I've got a Tartan pattern here and my description here a lovely Tartan pattern so that will work as long as the cursor is hovered over this particular element so the way I've created the code for this tutorial is so you can easily use it and modify it uh not modify it really I mean you can feel free to modify if you like but the the overall idea of this is so we can really easily and quickly um add um more elements so if we wanted to go ahead and create the link we can do but then to create the image all we need to do is create an image and we don't need to modify the jQuery code whatsoever so the reason I've done it this way is is it because it acts more like a plugin so you only have to ever include a div element on your page if you want to use um this uh feature uh and then you can go ahead and add elements and add in the descriptions straight into the element into an attribute and this will work so as long as you follow this tutorial and complete it and everything works you can go ahead and actually use this throughout your website and use it on any any element whatsoever so now that you've seen an example we're going to go ahead and look at start creating this and start uh testing out these uh the specific functionality that makes this work uh and we'll eventually end up with an effect like this so let's go ahead and start writing the code okay so we're over to our text editor uh we have an HTML 5 template just laid out the important includes that we need are the stylesheet which I have opened just here uh and I've included that just here um and we obviously need jQuery included as well and I've kept this in my Js folder so taking a look at the directory structure we have index.php we've got style.css which can be found in the CSS folder and we then have jquery.js which is found in the JS folder so we need to create an external script that's going to handle specific operations or specific event handler uh handling so we need to go ahead and just create a new document uh and I'm going to save that inside the JS folder and I'm going to call this uh hover text. Js so now that I've got hover text. JS I want to go and um actually include this on my page so we do exactly the same as we would with jQuery and we just include this as a script include uh inside of our page and that's going to mean that everything we write in uh hover text. JS uh will be able to be used inside uh this page so hovertext do JS okay so now that we've got that included we're going to go ahead and create a link and test some um hover hover over or sorry not hover over uh Mouse move uh event handling so let's go ahead and create our link and I'm just going to call this Google as I did before uh set the link uh location and let's go ahead and just refresh our page so I've got Google um the standard link just on a page and it works so we need to think about um how we're going to handle um the hover well hovering over this and then displaying the um div that we're going to create in just a moment in style. CSS so let's go ahead do uh h.j in just a moment I almost forgot to assign a class to this I'm going to assign a class to this called hover link Now by assigning a class to this you can then go ahead uh and create other elements on your page with the same um class and uh oh no I'm just going to call this hover sorry uh we can assign a class to any element on our page called hover uh and that will allow us to take advantage of the functionality that we're going to build around this so now that we've assigned a class to it we can come over to hover text. JS and we can uh select this particular class so we use a selector uh we use a DOT and then we say hover now we're going to assign an event handler to this to uh handle the event when the mouse moves over this particular element or the element with the class hover so I'm going to say mouse move now inside here we need to go ahead and create a function so I just outline a function and then we just come down and we can start writing code in here so the code that I'm just going to write for now is going to be alert Mouse over or Mouse move and what this is going to do is on any element that has hover I.E I'll link just at the moment when the mouse moves over it we're going to alert out Mouse move so quite simple stuff um but when I move over you can see that it says Mouse move so now that we have this in place we know that we've got the functionality required to return perhaps specific coordinates uh of where the mouse uh is on this element
