what's going on guys welcome to your 36th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to talk to you guys about something called a multidimensional array now a multidimensional array is basically an array inside another array so yeah think about that for a little bit and get freaked out you might be thinking whoa this reminds me of inception a Dream Within A Dream what's going on and you guys are thinking oh man this tutorial is going to be super confusing I barely even understand arrays and now going to say an array inside an array all right well here is an easier way to think about it if you ever you know use Microsoft Excel or maybe use uh MySQL think of it as a database or a table a multidimensional array is basically made up of rows and columns so this is the easiest way where you can think of it and it's basically whenever someone has uh information and they want to organize it in rows and columns they use a multidimensional array so let's go ahead and create one right now and I'll show you guys the Syntax for it go ahead and pretend you're creating a basic array I'm going to name m Sally and instead of a one square bracket it actually takes two square brackets in the first square bracket you write how many rows do you want to have in your array let's let's keep it simple and say we want to have an array with two rows and for the second one is basically columns how many columns do you want to have in your array so let's go ahead and add three columns so now we have a row excuse me now we have basically a table that's two rows by three columns AKA there are six elements in this array so in order to create um an array inside an array it's basically exactly like you would think go ahead and make your array and just to tell you guys this code blocks gets freaked out whenever you try to put uh squarely brackets inside other squarely brackets so that's why uh it might be messing up when you try typing it but anyways go ahead and as the first element in your array you actually add an array so let's go ahead and add two three 4 so check it out we have an array 2 3 4 inside another array and this smaller array is the first row so now let's go ahead and make our second row or second array add a comma and like I said uh code blocks gets freaked out whenever you try to do it so it might be weird but let's go ahead and in this array put 8 9 and 10 so we basically made two different arrays one array is 23 4 and the other array is 8 910 so we said all right we're creating a multidimensional array consisting of two different arrays each array is a row and each value is going to be a column and remember to separate your arrays with a comma so basically this is an array made up of two smaller arrays so let me go ahead and draw this for you guys visually like I said there are two different rows one is two three and four and the other one is eight 9 and 10 so visually this is what our array looks like this is all one array that's basically made up of this array 2 3 and four and this array 8 n and 10 2 three and four is on top 8 n tens on bottom two rows three columns pretty simple huh so anyways the basics of this is anytime you want to create a multidimensional array go ahead and list number of rows number of columns and for the number of rows that's how many arrays you create and for the number of columns that's how many values you add to each array and then you end up with something like this so if you're saying all right now how do I reference you know how do I get to each element in that array well let's go ahead and just print it out on the screen um of course print out Sally and whenever you reference it it just takes the two brackets the first index you need is what row is it in and remember the first row starts with zero so anytime we want to access the element in this first row we need to go ahead and put zero now remember two is going to be zero 3 is going to be one and four is going to be two so if you write 02 it's going to look look at the zero with row which is the first run and the second element which is actually 0 1 2 so it's going to go zero 2 and that's going to give us our four it's basically just like coordinates I don't know why I didn't say that before I didn't cross my mind but basically multidimensional arrays are exactly like coordinates you RIS the coordinate here start with zero and the coordinate here so if we want to reference N9 that would be 0 1 so go ahead type one for that and 01 right there so that let's go ahead and print that out and I got my nine so basically a multidimensional array just like Inception is an array or more than one array inside a bigger array it's pretty much an array made up of arrays instead of values and what it does is it gives you the idea that you can create a table basically made up of rows and columns and anytime you want to access one of the elements you just go ahead and type in the coordinates which would be the row number and then the column number and you print it out and there you go so if you guys understand this then you're ready to move on to my next Topic in the next tutorial I'm going to teach you guys a really simple way to print out a multidimensional array so instead of you know just having to commment this right here um you have a nice visual of what it looks like so if you guys uh don't understand it then go ahead and just go to my forum and ask me a question and I'll explain it better there but if you do or you know maybe if you got any good Inception jokes then leave them in the comments below but for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I will see you in the next tutorial
