so today we're going to talk about simplifying fractions so whenever you simplify fractions you're going to factor the top and the bottom you're going to cancel any like factors and you're going to reduce so for this one we're going to factor the top and bottom first so the first thing we can do is factor out a 5 so we factor out of 5 and then we get x squared plus 30 divided by 5 is 6x minus 35 divided by 5 is 7 over we can factor 5 out of this one to 1 minus x squared so those fives will go ahead and cancel and then we can factor the top and bottom again x squared plus 6x minus seven is going to factor to two quantities so we have to think what's going to add to get a positive 6 but multiply to get a negative 7 well seven is a prime number so it's only factors are seven in itself if we want it to be positive that means the seven has to be positive and the one has to be negative and then we're going to factor hanover and since this is a difference of squares it's just that it's just the first term the square root of the first term minus the square root of the second term plus the square root of x the square root of the first plus the square root of a second so now these two factors will cancel and we're be left with a fraction of X plus 7 over X plus 1 so now we're just going to do some more examples so first we always factor the top so the top is a difference of squares so it's going to be X minus 3 times X plus 3 over and if we factor the bottom it's going to be two factors that look like that negative 6 is divided by two and three two and three will add to make a positive one if we have a positive 3 and then negative 2 so this positive 3 and this positive x plus 3 factors are going to cancel and we're just left with X minus 3 over X minus 2 now what we're essentially doing here is dividing by those common factors this is the only way for us to really divide polynomials so now we're going to factor the top and the top will just be able to factor a 3 out of it so it'll be 4 12 / 4 is 3 minus 4 divided by 4 is just one so a and then the bottom will factor as well we'll get an a here in an a here the two factors of 12 that are going to add to give us a one is going to be 3 and 4 since it's a negative 12 and we want a positive one we're going to have positive 4 negative 3 is a minus 3 is if you look if you were to rewrite this with this would be a minus 3 so this cancels with this factor and we're just left with four over a plus for we're going to do a couple more so to factor the top all we can do is factor of X out of that and to factor the bottom it's a difference of squares it's going to be X plus 5 times X minus 5 these decks plus wives are going to cancel we're going to x over X minus 5 and now this last one you can't factor the top but the bottom should look really familiar because this is a perfect square trinomial so then so if you remember we're going to take the square root of the first plus the square root of the second and then square root plus the square root because that's our formula for perfect square trinomial so this a plus B is only going to cancel with one of these a plus beads so we're left with the one on top and an a plus B on the bottom so that's all for simplifying fractions make sure you come back and watch your next video where we're going to talk about multiplying fractions
