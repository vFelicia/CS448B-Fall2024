all right guys welcome back and in this video I am going to show you how to use a tool called Hydra to access a router's settings or configuration screen whatever you want to call it so as I'm sure you guys know whenever you go to the IP address of a default gateway or maybe a variation of it what it does is it gives you this web page where you can access your router settings and you can change things like the default DNS server uh this is where you set the preshared key or password for your WiFi network basically any settings that you can perform on your router this is how you get to it so if you click login or maybe the forms right here then what it has you do is it has you type the username and the password now most of the time what you need to do and this is incredibly easy if you just look at the manufacturer of your router and maybe the model number let me just close out here then all you have to do is you have to go to Google and say okay what is the default user username and password and it's usually something really easy like user user blank password uh admin admin you know something really simple like that so if you ever get to one of those screens first just Google it and see what the default uh you know credentials are now if you were smart and you actually change your password like I recommend most people do then maybe a few months later you came back and you're like all right I want to change I don't know maybe my WiFi password but I can't remember my password that uh you know I changed my router to well what you can do is you can use a tool called Hydra and this allows you to perform a dictionary TCH on your router and I guess it isn't really a tech it's more of a recovery tool since it's your own router but I'll show you guys what we're going to do so and by the way I know that my router before this tutorial I already changed it back to default which is the username is user and the um the password is also user so just just remember that is user user to log in but we'll do it the cool way all right so before you start doing this you're going to need to have two files the first one is for potential usernames and the second one is going to be for potential passwords and they're usually going to be a lot longer than this but this is just an example so what it's going to do is this tool is going to go through every username and for each one it's going to try all of these passwords so root with this password then root with this password then if it can't hit any it's going to go to admin admin with this then this then this all the way down here and it's basically going to go through every combination until you find the one that works so let's close out of here and I'll show you guys how to use it so if you just type Hydra then after this you need to give it the page where it's going to log in and I closed out of my browser but mine was login. HTML so if you go to http that was the protocol and if you just type in the IP like you would in a browser it gets um a little confused so you need to surround it with square brackets so 192.168.0.1 and this isn't the same IP for every um single router the IP of your router depends on the manufacturer how your network set up but for mine and a lot of people's it's going to be this one or maybe uh 16811 so just look for your own you you know there's a bunch of different variations so my login page is login. HTML so this is pretty much the page where we have to type the username and password so after this I'm just going to show you guys a bunch of different um parameters that you guys can use these are uh very helpful and I almost do them all the time maybe I should just type all of these first so V then minus t we'll do a four and that's good for right now all right so this minus NS right here this means that I'll show you guys let me bring that back up usernames and passwords so you know how I said that what this is going to do is it's going to look at every username and try every password for it well whenever you have the ens flag it's not only going to do that but it's also going to try um so for this one the password of root so it tries itself as a password too and also a blank password so this one is going to try all these combinations plus root plus blank for the password this one is going to try all combinations plus admin plus blank forv password so it just gives you some more um options and by the way like even my router the username and password are both the same user user and I see admin admin a lot so this flag is actually really helpful minus F this means exit whenever we find a login so as soon as we find the credentials that we can that match that we can use then this stops the program and it doesn't you know no use continuing with the rest we already found what we were looking for this minus V just says to display the results in the terminal for both give me something to look at this minus T4 this says that this is the number of tests that we're going to run in parallel now you just don't want to do like a 100 because some routers won't allow it and even if they do you know then it could probably crash it so usually minus T4 8 or 16 are your options there and the last thing that it needs is just the files for the username and the password now if you're using a list then you use a capital letter if you're using just one then you use a lowercase letter so let's say that I just had one usern name I knew that the username was admin I'm going to do lowercase L admin now since I have a list then I use uppercase so that's the difference between those two and mine is on desktop and what was it top usernames so top 10 usernames do text and well it'll wrap so all right so the last thing is of course the passwords and same thing for password so if you know the password is like bacon 123 then you can just use a lowercase p but I'm just using a list of passwords so I'm going to use uppercase p and and then that's on the desktop too and that is top 10 passwords do text so there you go and well now it's good to go I'm going to hit enter and check it out look how fast that was so it ran through all of the root so as you can see it did a root first and then blank and then it went through the list 1 2 3 4 5 6 it did it for admin that didn't work and then it did it for user and once it got to the login user using the password user it says D we finished we found a valid pair this is a username and password combination for your router so now we can log back into our router and do whatever we want to do to it change the password DNS settings uh you know maybe put some firewalls up whatever you want to do follow your heart but there you go that is the basics of Hydra and I actually want to do like a little miniseries on Hydra because there are a lot of different options and you know just different settings you can use you can do this for like MySQL and um SSH and FTP and any well a bunch of different stuff but I'm getting kind of headed myself but there you go hopefully you guys enjoyed go log into your own router and uh yeah see you guys next time
