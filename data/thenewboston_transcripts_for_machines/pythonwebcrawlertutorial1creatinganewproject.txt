are already houses welcome back and in this video series I am going to show you how to make a Python web crawler now I actually made this because a few weeks ago I was trying to make a sitemap for my website and if you guys don't know what a sitemap is it's basically all the links or all the pages on your website so you need to make a program to crawl your entire site and gather up all the links and I'll search your nonline for a free one and there aren't a lot of good free ones they all like are limited to like 50 pages or something and then I was like are I'm just going to buy one and all the ones that you can buy our like a hundred bucks a year and I'm like I'm not going to pay a hundred bucks a year for a little bot that's going to take like ten minutes to run so that was my first motivation but I was lazy and I didn't do it oh my god then I got a like program this crawler and then a few days ago I was looking through my website and I was like you know what what would be really cool is if you could have like open source search engine for your own website and I know that you can go ahead and add like Google custom search whenever you have a site and you want to add some search to it but Google custom search it doesn't really feel comfortable like it's it kind of feels like separate from your entire website so I'm like man that crawler I was going to make a few weeks ago that would been a really nice so again all this program is going to do in this video series is basically going to go through all the pages on your website and gather up all the links so you can either use that for a site map or if you're making like a custom search engine then you can go ahead and run some analytics on each page later on but this is the core of a lot of programs so that is my motivation so let's go ahead and get started and actually before I do that was a lie we're not going to get started yet I know that there are a couple armed modules already in Python this is the first one I looked at but this doesn't even have Python 3 support yet I think it's in beta and also this was a little different from what I was trying to do and I know that beautifulsoup does exist but this is more of a parser so in other words once you have HTML for example it can like rip out the title and tell you what the title of the page is and you know maybe the content and all the paragraphs and whatnot but again we need to start with the basics we just need to go ahead and gather the links for your site before you can start running analytics on all the pages so what I'm going to do is I'm going to set this up like we're going to use this a bunch of times on a bunch of different websites so let's say that I wanted to run this on my website and my friend's website and my uncle's I would need to separate each of those into their own different projects or own own different folders so that's what we're going to do what I'm going to do is I'm going to first add a way where you can type in something like the New Boston how can I not type today alright so this is the name of the project and then we can go ahead and give the home page like this again this isn't Python code I'm just demonstrating how we're going to make it so we'll say alright the project name is the New Boston and this is your home page so then it's going to go ahead and create a folder and store all the links in that folder and then they don't get all jumbled together if you don't understand what I'm talking about we'll check this out so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to import OS and this is just actually want to kind of keep that I kind of like that little thing I don't know why all right so this is just going to allow us to create directories so let me say that on each website you crawl is a separate project and again the project files for this it's not gonna be anything special a new folder equals a new project simple as that so we'll just call this function def great project directory and then we'll name it directory don't use the keyword dir because dir is already a builtin Python keyword so don't undo that actually let me get rid of that after all all right so the cool thing about this program the way I made it is I'm going to say go ahead and start off by whenever we create a project for the first time create that new folder for us and start crawling the website now let's say that your computer shuts down maybe I know your electrical failed or something or you just need to put your computer to sleep or go home from work or something you don't want to go ahead and get rid of all that data let's say it was like 50 percent done crawling that you actually want to save that so what I'm going to do is whenever you run this again if that directory already exists if that project already exists we're not going to go ahead and create it again we're just going to say ok only create this if it doesn't exist so we'll say if not OS dot path exists and we'll see this is the path right here so again the folder name is essentially just the path only then do we want to create a folder so I'm just going to write a little prompt so whenever they run this the user knows what's going on I'll say creating directory and then I'll print out the name so my project name is going to be the new Boston so whenever I run this for the first time it's going to say creating directory actually let me say creating project that'll be a little bit cooler a and then how do we actually make it well it's the easiest thing ever OS make directories and you just pass in the directory name right there so let me go ahead and run this right now show you guys what's going on all right so check this out you see how this load directory doesn't have any folders or anything and it just has main py the file I'm working on right now so whenever I run this bit of code what it's going to do this is going to say okay creating project the new Boston and look at that we now got a folder called the new Boston now let me go ahead and run this again so say that we had some data in here we're going to go ahead and run it again you see how it didn't say creating project in New Boston is because it already created it so that way it doesn't overwrite all of our juicy files and also one thing I'm going to do is I'm just going to change this to general because this general file I'm just going to have a lot of shared functions in here and that main dot py file that's kind of going to be the starting point for our entire program so I don't just don't want to pop these right in there so again that's how our projects gonna be set up that's what we're doing in this video series and yeah that's all I got to say I guess I'll smell you guys later
