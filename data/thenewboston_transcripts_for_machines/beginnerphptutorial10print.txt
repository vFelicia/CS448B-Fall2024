hi there i'm alex from PHP academy' and this is another video tutorial produced for the new boston this time we're going to be talking about the print language construct in PHP now you can see that I am using the previous echo example here from the previous video talking about echoing out data to the users browser or string data to the users browser now print does not differ whatsoever just for the purposes of this tutorial I'm going to just change this text to hello with an exclamation mark so I'm also going to change this to print you can see my text editor has highlighted this blue again so we can see that this is this is a language construct and it's still valid however when we refresh we get exactly the same result as we do with echo now you may be thinking while they're two different now print works slightly different to echo in the way that it is an actually an older way to in a more sort of traditional way if you like to print data out basically I mean to the browser in this case so it's also slower to use and an echo and if you wanted to be really petty it also has more characters so people tend to find it's quicker to use echo also when we're using print traditionally we would use brackets as it behaves more like a function even though it still is a language construct so basically in short it's a lot better to use echo and the main reason for this is it being a lot quicker using less system resources so even though you can use print and later on in the tutorial series we will come across things like print are which aren't in fact too tightly related to print itself but you will maybe come across print at some point in programs however if you're programming sort of from now on we're going to be using echo and it's probably better to use echo as well
