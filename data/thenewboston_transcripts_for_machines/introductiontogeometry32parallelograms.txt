today our focus is parallelograms and like the name suggests opposite sides are parallel that's how it so a d and BC are parallel a a b and d c are parallel opposite sides are congruent so AB is congruent to DC BC is congruent to a d opposite angles are congruent so angle B is congruent to angle D angle a is congruent to angle C and consecutive angles which remember are side by side angles are supplementary so these two are supplementary as well as these two and these two and those two so if AB is equal to 8 then DC is equal to what well since it's a parallelogram and we know that parallelograms opposite sides are congruent DC also has to equal 8 the measure of a d is 11 so the measure of BC which is opposite it has to be 11 as well the measure of angle one so the measure of angle b equals 47 so this right here equals 47 measure of angle D has to equal what well since we know that opposite side opposite angles are congruent angle D has to equal 47° so the measure of angle C has to equal well consecutive sides or excuse me consecutive angles are supplementary so we set 47 plus the measure of angle c equal to 180 so the measure of angle C is 133° we got some more problems to do so a d is congruent to b c angle a is congruent to the angle opposite which is angle C the measure of angle a plus what is equal to 1880 well there's actually two different angles that could fit here so it's consecutive angles that are congruent so A and D are consecutive angles and a and b are consecutive angles so since they're supplementary we can say the measure of angle a plus the measure of angle D equals 180 or the measure of angle a plus the measure of angle B also equals 180 DC is congruent to the side opposite it which is AB the measure of angle B is congruent to the angle opposite that so angle D so now what we're going to talk about is diagonals of parallelograms so a diagonal of a parallelogram which is drawn through opposite angles divides the parallelogram into two equal triangles so if we're looking at this if we're looking at this diagonal first this triangle formed right here is congruent to this triangle formed right here and if we're looking at the other diagonal right here this triangle right here is congruent to this triangle right here the diagonals also B BCT each other and bisect right here if you don't know what it means already it means cuts into two equal parts so if I call this point right here Point F that means that if I'm looking at this lighter blue diagonal first that that this part is equal to this part or if I'm looking at this dark blue diagonal this part is equal to this part so now we're going to do some examples using that information so we know that triangle BCA which is formed by this solid diagonal right here that's going to be congruent to this triangle over here so triangle BCA is congruent to Triangle d c a triangle AB D which is formed by this dotted diagonal AB D is congruent to Triangle DC d a so if this right here equals 5 what does this part equal well like we said we said that when these diagonals cross each other they bict each other so when they bisect to each other they cut them into two equal pieces so if this side equals five then a EC also has to equal five so Point e is the midpoint of what two lines the midpoint is literally just the point point in the center of a line and we know that it's a midpoint because the lines the line segments are equal so Point e is the midpoint of this diagonal AC right and this diagonal b d because it cuts this line into two equal pieces as well so we went over this today so that in the next lesson when we talk about special kinds of parallelograms we already have a ground knowledge so make sure you come watch the next video
