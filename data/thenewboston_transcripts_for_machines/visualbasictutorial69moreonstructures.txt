hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking another look at structures and we're going to be working more on the program that we created in the last tutorial now if you don't know what I'm talking about right here or what this uh form is then go ahead and move back one tutorial to I think tutorial uh 68 and you'll see how to make this uh make what we've made so far so we declared a structure and we called it C customer then we created an object um that is a customer which is a structure so now what we need to do is we need to uh assign some values to the first name last name and email of this object customer so we'll go ahead and click list customer or button one click so uh let's go ahead and change this the name of this to button list customer okay so now we'll come back here and let's just go ahead and assign the first name last name and email of object customer whenever they click button one we could do this when the form loads and we could do it outside of it but let's just do it under button one click so we'll type object customer and then if we use dot you're going to see that we have you can see all of the ones with the blue boxes right here now that stands for a variable so we got email first name and last name so we'll set first name equal to uh gy and now we will set the last name equal to H Jones and we'll go ahead and set his email to equals uh let's just do jones. Jin mlive.com okay so now that we have set a value I mean a yeah a value for each of the variables inside of the structure object customer um let's go ahead and add those add the customer to these text boxes right here so we could do this right on button one. click but we want to use a uh sub because this makes it easier to reuse code and we're not going to have to copy and paste which is a very bad habit that you don't want to get into so what we're going to do is we are going to create a sub called display customer now what this is going to do is it's going to get our structure and it's going to add it to the text boxes so we'll go ahead and type private sub display customer and now for our arguments we're going to have have to pass a uh a customer object to it so I'll just type buy Val we could use Bure but we don't want to accidentally change the values of object customer so we'll just go ahead and make a copy of object customer by using by Val and it's just going to be used this sub and then when the sub's exited it's gone so we'll just type cust as customer which is the data type so now what we're going to do is we are going to type text first name. text equals cust which is the customer object that is passed to display customer. first name now we're going to do text last name. text and we'll set that equal to cust do last name and now I'll do this one more time for the email so text email. text equals c do email okay so now let's go ahead and run this and see what happens so if we go ahead and click list customer looks like we're getting an error here ah no never mind we're not getting an error we need to go ahead and call display customer so whenever they click it whenever they click uh button one it's going to call display customer and we will just pass object customer to that so it sets the values of that and then displays it on the text boxes okay so let's go ahead and run this and if we click list customer we get Jim Jones and jones. Jim live.com so um go ahead and make this program if you haven't already uh you can play around more with the structure see what you can do with it and then once you have done that you can go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and in the next tutorial we're going to be working more on this program and then after that we're going to be done with this program and we're going to be moving on to uh other topics so um go ahead I'll scroll up and down through this you can go and pause wherever you want if you want to see the code so thanks for watching guys and stay tuned for the next tutorial
