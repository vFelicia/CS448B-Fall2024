hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to take a look at the scroll top functionality in jQuery and how we can return a particular well and integer value of the current scrolled position in let's say a text area so on this page I have a text area here with quite a bit of content inside of it enough for us to actually scroll down at the moment this text area is quite tiny let's go ahead and look on the page you can see it's quite tiny so I'm going to go ahead and apply some styling just to change this I've got a CSS file which I have included on the page called style dot CSS you can see that we've included it here I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to set the height and width of this so the text ID text area ideas text area let's just go ahead and say text area and in here we can say height let's give it a high over let's say 200 pixels and a width of 100 pixels note we'll say 350 that's going to make it a bit more even and you can see that that's changed that quite nicely okay so essentially what we're going to be doing is we're going to be feeding back the current scroll position inside of this div now this isn't useful until you actually find you know some kind of other use for it and if you look in the example applications that I've created in this series you'll see an example application that deals with scrolling to the bottom of a of you know this text area and then returning or enabling a particular button or a check box so here's the knowledge and then you can go ahead and actually apply it to a reallife situation a bit later okay so we've got this div ID with feedback we've included jQuery obviously and also ext Jas which I've got open here so we're going to be going and writing our code inside of here and we're essentially just all we're going to be doing is relaying the currently scroll position inside text area now it's important to know before we start that you can use this with absolutely anything you can use it with the current window for example if you had enough content on the page where you could scroll down you could relate to the use of the currently scroll position not that you would actually go ahead and display this integer to a user because it might be useless but obviously you can you know use this value to you know perform a specific action maybe when the user reaches the end of your page so you know it could you could reload information for example I know if you go to Twitter and you click on a list of someone's tweets and you scroll down to the bottom it will automatically load more tweets so this is an example of this kind of functionality but for now we're going to be focusing in on this text area and relaying this value so let's go over to ext j/s and let's wait for the document to be ready so we do document ready so we applying the ready then handler inside here we create a function and inside of this block of code let's bring it down we're going to relay the scrolling position of this text area into feedback so we want to apply an event handler to text area and that's going to be the scroll event handler so let's go ahead and select the text area div and let's apply this event handler scroll to that now inside here we can go ahead and create a function just bring this down and what we want to do is now pick up the value of the or the scroll top of this text area so what we need to do is reset a variable or create a variable and I'm just going to call this variable scroll top for now scroll underscore top so every time the user Scrolls one part of this down we're resetting this variable scroll top to equal the scrolling position so what we want to do is we want to reference this with this because we're already you know on this current object and then we want to just use the scroll top function so now that we have this value scroll top this is going to dynamically update as we scroll in this text area so all we need to do now is go ahead and lay this in feedback so let's go ahead and select hash feedback and then we say dot txt and we can just play some text in here so I'm just going to say currently at position and then append on the scroll top variable so essentially as we scroll we set this variable every time which is equal to the position that we're scrolling at and then we just pop this into the feedback area so let's go ahead and refresh the feedback areas down here when we start to scroll you'll see this value you know update itself so we know that we are at a particular position and what we can actually do is more easily than not with the window because we can use window height to grab the window height is we can use some calculation to accurately gain the integer that's associated with the current or the the scroll the the maximum scrolling height with this and we can determine when we're actually at the bottom of a particular element so it works well with text area and it can be applied to like I said enabling a check like a checkbox or something if these are terms and conditions for example and you want the user to scroll down before a particular checks to check area or button is available or checkbox rather but again you can use it for window if you're scrolling down a window all you would have to do is go ahead and change this to window obviously it wouldn't be in this context of scrolling in a text area but you can retain the value of the scroll bar in the current window by using window scroll top so that's the scroll top function in jQuery and a bit about how we can use it however go ahead and check out the text area tutorial and that gives you a bit more a bit more information about how we can put this into practice
