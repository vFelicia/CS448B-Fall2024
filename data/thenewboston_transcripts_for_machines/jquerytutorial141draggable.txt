hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the draggable interaction in the jQuery UI and how we can drag elements on a page we're also going to be looking at the options that we can supply there are a large variety of options that you can choose from for this interaction however I've picked out probably the most relevant in terms of usability we're also going to take a look at some of the events that are associated with this this interaction okay so we're going to be dragging a particular element on a page so we're going to go ahead and first of all create this element on our page so I'm going to create this as a span and inside of here I'm just going to right drag me now we did take a look at how to make an object draggable in the last part of the tutorial list jQuery UI tutorial series and we looked at how to actually set the draggable interaction on a particular object obviously the difference in this tutorial is it's going to be a lot longer because we're going to be looking at the different options we can supply so I'm going to create a or call this span so give it an ID of drag so we can use a selector to reference this ID and you'll notice that I've got UI j s open in my browser and i've also included this on the page as well as the jQuery UI library and the jQuery library as well so these two files will handle everything we need this file however is blank and this is where I'm going to be writing my own code so the first thing we need to do is set this to draggable so let's go ahead to our browser and just refresh you can see that we've just got a span element here we can do nothing with it at the moment so what we want to do inside UI J s is check for when the document is ready so we use the document selector and ready and inside here we create a function which will handle ever thing after the document is ready to use or is it's loaded so we need to make this ID heal this span with an ID of drag draggable so the fundamental way to do this would be to use a hash selector to select the ID or the element with the ID drag and then we just write draggable now just this alone is going to allow us to actually drag the element however we don't have any constraints and we don't have any additional options supplied to it we supply all the options within the parentheses here so let's just take a look in our browser what this is done we can now actually drag this element around the page the first thing you'll notice is that we can drag it so it's not in view and as well here if you look at the bottom of my browser down here you can see that we are actually creating a large space because we've were able to drag it wherever and you'll see it does get a bit messy so we can supply options to constrain this to a particular area on the page we'll be looking at that first we'll also be looking at a few other options that allow us to change the cursor create some kind of create like a grid style to this set the opacity and also reverting back to the original position so there's lots of options we're going to look at and we'll be looking at that one by then one by one will then be going on to look at events where we can tell when the dragging has started when the dragging is happening and also when the dragging has stopped so ie when the element has been released and the mouse is Friel the cursor is free from the element so the first option that we're going to look for or that we're going to talk about is the axis now we can set the axis in which our element moves in now at the moment obviously we can move it in the X and the yaxis we can move it wherever we want however we want to particularly constrain it to one access we can we can specify this so for example if I wanted to specify just to the x axis only allow it to move along the xaxis I can do so or if I want to constrain it and only allow it to you know move on the yaxis we can also do access we can do that as well so when we supply options inside of this draggable function here we use curly brackets so i've created some curly brackets inside here our option name goes here and our option value goes here so we've got an option name and a value and these are comma separated so we can supply more than one so everything I'm going to talk about you can combine into the same element as well so like I said the first thing we're going to be looking at is the axis so let's go ahead and specify the axis option now we can either specify the constraint or the restriction to X or Y and this is supplied within single quotation marks so for example if I wanted to constrain movement only to the x axis I can do so by specifying axis and then X in single quotation marks let's go ahead and check what that's done when you now when you can you can see now that when I drag it I can't move it downwards but I can move it across the xaxis so now that I can move it across the xaxis it won't actually move down the yaxis at all so we can do the opposite to this and obviously specify that the constraint is only in the Y access and we can only drag it down now so that's how to constrain to a particular axis inside the draggable interaction we're going to take a look now at the containment option now containment is extremely useful because as I mentioned earlier we can actually drag this anywhere we want we can drag it out of view here we can drag it across so we create scroll bars at the bottom however what happens if we want to allow the containment only to the current document window current document or current window now the current document will be the document itself however the window will be the current actual window that's open so the document might be larger than the window so we might want to first of all only allow it to beam you know moved inside of the document area so let's go ahead and choose this containment option so that's containment and we have a few options here the first one we're going to look at is document as I mentioned so we just type containment as the option name and then document as the value
