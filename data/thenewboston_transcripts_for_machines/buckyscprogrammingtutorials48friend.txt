welcome back I steer 48th C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be going over the keyword friend so basically every class can have friends and a friend of the class is something that's totally separate from the class but it still has access to the stuff inside your class like your variables and your functions so in other words if a class wanted to have a function it can make that function its friend and now that function had access to the variables and the functions inside the class pretty cool huh so let's go ahead and take a look at it so the first thing we need is a class and I'm going to name this class stank fist so let's go ahead and make our class right now the first thing I like to do is get everything set up so public and private so this class is going to have one private variable and int stinkie variable so now the only thing that has access to this thinkI variable is whatever is already inside this class so first of all let's go ahead and build a constructor for this stank fist and all this constructor is going to do is take that stinky variable and set it equal to zero so now as soon as you create a stink fist object and make sure I capitalized that consistency on my fist it's going to take this stinky variable and set it equal to zero simple enough so now what we need to do is we need to build a function so let's go ahead and build a function outside actually let's go ahead and make it right here so in order to make a function your friend the very first thing you need to do is prototype it inside your class so go ahead and put void one name this function stinkies friend and we'll go ahead and as a parameter it's going to take a stink fist object so stank fist and we'll just name this object s fo4 stink fist object so as a parameter it's going to take an object of this class so we're saying all right so that's all you do in order to make it your friend prototype inside your class one know in order to make this function a friend of this class before the prototype you need to type the keyword friend now this function has access to everything inside this class because it's its friend so now when we go ahead and copy this and paste it and create it we can use the stinkface object to access all the stuff inside the stink fist class pretty cool so first of all let's go ahead and change this stinky variable equal to something so using our stink fist object let's go ahead and access the stinky variable and set equal to 99 or something different than zero and now let's go ahead and just print it out on the screen see out SFO stinky variable and lime so basically what this does is even though there is a function right here you can see that it's totally different totally outside this class but since this class said you know what I trust this function it's my friend now this function has access to the stuff inside the class such as stinky variable and another thing I want to point out before I go on a class has to give away its friendship for example this function and this function can't demand to be friends with this class that's why you don't have the friend keyword right before it this class needs to give away its friendship other places just can't take it it's kind of like real life you can't make someone be your friend they have to accept you into being your friend make sense trust me I tried it didn't work out so well so let's go ahead and now that we got everything set up we can begin using this in main so our main what we need to do first is create a stink fist object so stink fist and I'm just going to name my object Bob and now we can use that Stinky's friend function right here and of course this function takes a stink fist object as its parameter so let's go ahead and as this parameter type in Bob and now we'll go ahead and run it and check it out as long as I didn't forget anything it should print out 99 pretty cool home so even though we were using this function and this function was outside this class it was able to access the stinky variable and print it out on the screen pretty cool huh so basically to recap one last time we wanted to build a function that can access this class but we didn't want to put it inside the class itself so instead what we decided to do was make this function a friend of the class now whenever this function tried to use the variables and functions inside of this class it was able to because this class said you know what you're pretty cool you can be my friend so then we made a function that took a stank fist parameter as its object so the first thing we need to do is create a stink fist object and we pass it in as its parameter and then ahead access the distinct fist class so that is basically the UM I don't know the lesson behind this tutorial whenever a class wants something to be its friend it can access the members of that class and aside from that a class has to give away its friendship other functions can't just demand to be friends with it it has to give it to them so there you go that's what friend means and that's why it's useful again this is a real simple example but later on I'll show you guys how it's really useful so just stick around and you'll see so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
