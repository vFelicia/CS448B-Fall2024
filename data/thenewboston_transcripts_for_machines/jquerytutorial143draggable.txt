so you can see how it's snapping to a grid so this is extremely useful if you are creating something where you need an element to snap to a particular area on a page so if you're creating a web application that requires this it's an extremely effective way of actually you know snapping to particular areas on a grid so that's a another option there now let's just pull this down and refresh I'm gonna remove this grid option now and we're going to go on to look at revert now revert is not really something you would include with you're dragging it would only be something you'd want if you can if you wanted the the element itself to revert back to a particular position so revert we can set to true and what this will do is wherever the element has started sorry let's just get rid of that there sorry okay so wherever the element has started I'm continuing to drag it however when I release it you can see it it returns to its original position so wherever I drag it to it snaps and revert back to its original position and we also have an additional parameter that we can set for this and this is revert duration and we can set a time in milliseconds how long this takes to revert back to its original position so I've set revert duration now if I drag you can see it takes that was a second to revert back if I was to say change this to five seconds you can see that it's significantly slower it takes five seconds to revert back to its original position so that's the revert option and then the revert duration option that allows you to set the speed however I tend to find that the revert set to true by its default speed is a nice speed for it to revert back to I think it's probably 500 milliseconds by default okay so now that we've looked at a few options in here we're going to take a look at events now events can be appended as normal onto the end or sorry onto the end of here and then we create a function inside of these to perform a specific action so for example I want to I'm going to come and separate the last option that I've chosen and I'm then going to start the or type the start option now the start option is going to be equal to a callback function now what this is going to do it's when the dragging has started is going to perform the opera by the block of code inside of this function so I'm just gonna pull that down a minute as well as pulling down start as well just so we can see what's going on a lot better so as well as these options here I've chosen this start event now it's it's important to know that this doesn't cut this isn't classed as an option these here are options and this here is an event the event has a callback function and inside of the callback function we can specify it something to do so what we're going to do is as soon as the dragging starts we're going to apply some text to a div down here and it's gonna tell us the status of the element so has it beings has it started dragging is the element currently being dragged and when the when the dragging has stopped as well so we're going to look at these three events the first of which being start so we've created this div here and I'm just going to call it event and when the start when the element starts to be dragged so ie when it's clicked and the you know first action is made we want to put some text inside this event div so I'm going to say event text and inside here dragging started so now what's going to happen is when we drag you can see that the div now says dragging started okay so as soon as we start dragging or we activate this I we click on it that's when the dragging has started so when I when I click and pull it a tiny tiny bit of the way it says dragging started the other elements are drag and stop so the first one we're going to look at well the second one we're gonna look at in this case is uh let's see where are we so that ends just there and then after this we want to say come down here and we're gonna say drag and this is equal to a function we're gonna pull this down as well just to make it look a bit neater so while the element is being dragged we want to again place some text inside this event div and this text is dragging dragging so you'll notice now that when we drag it we won't actually see the dragging started message here and that's because this will override this text in this event div when the dragging started yes we will get a message saying dragging started inside of this div the text inside this div however as we drag this will replace it so you'll notice that we won't see the dragging started text but we will automatically see the dragging text when I let go this doesn't actually change because we need to supply an additional event this additional event is stopped so we create a new a callback function inside here and we pull this down and inside here we are going to set the event text dragging stopped so now that the dragging has stopped well when the dragging has started we have this dragging text here I'm still dragging this element however when I let go and it returns we have dragging stopped so with this you can work out if an element is being dragged or not now this might be useful if you wanted to say pinpoint the coordinates or find out when an element had been dragged if you wanted to log this in one way or another so these events aren't just here for the sake of telling the user when the dragging has started when the dragging has is commencing or when the dragging is or the elements being dragged or when the element has or dragging a stopped but we obviously have make use of callback functions in order to do something when the dragging has started so for example if you wanted to you know allow an element to be dragged and you wanted to say change something on a page as it's being dragged or changed something on a page when the when the dragging has stopped you can use these events here and the callback functions associated with them so let's just pull that down there so the three events we have our start drag and stop now as well as these there are other properties of this draggable interaction we can use if you go over to the jQuery documentation itself you can view a list of options events and also different methods associated with this draggable functionality so in the tutorial we've looked at a variety of options which either help the functionality of draggable or the aesthetics behind it and we've also looked at some of these events and placing text inside of a div when these events actually happen so draggable is an extremely powerful tool and there's a variety of options you can apply to it depending on your needs
