what is up guys it's Bucky and welcome to your 13th JavaScript tutorial and this tutorial is probably going to be a real quick one because I'm only going to be talking about one thing and that is called assignment operators so I already taught you guys what the assignment operator is so say we had a variable equal to Bucky and let's go ahead and set it equal to 24 because that's my age and if we go ahead and just document right out Bucky it's going to go ahead and print 2400 screen no need to show you guys that but hey I will anyways right there so that is the assignment operator basically an equal sign but there are different types of operators to in there pretty much like little shortcuts and there's an add an assigned operator which pretty much takes a variable and in order to use the add in a sign operator you put plus equal sign and then to the right of it you put a number like 54 now what this is going to do is it's going to say all right the value of Bucky is 24 so if I add 54 to it I get the new value of 78 so now Bucky equals 78 so let's go ahead and refresh this and when it prints out Bucky it says 78 so it doesn't change Bucky 254 what it does is it takes Bucky adds 54 to it and assigns it the new value so aside from um which is called the add and assign operator you have the subtract and assign operator right there choose 54 why not which gives you negative 30 the multiply and assign and the divide in a sign which is I have no idea what this value is oh nice so aside from the add in a sign subtraction sign multiply divided and assign there's one other one and that's called the modulus and inside modulus and a sign and to tell you the truth what this does is it takes an integer remainder or basically the remainder and it you know what remember this don't ever use the modulus and a sign I've been programming for I don't even know how many years and I never used the modulus and a sign other than just teaching people what the modulus and a sign operator does so basically you're never going to use the modulus and a sign so wipe that out of your memory and yeah I probably should edit that out at the tutorial but anyways I won't so aside from that the other thing I want to teach you guys before I let you guys go is that you don't have to only use one of these you can go ahead and assign 67 to that and let me see if you guys can figure this out and go ahead and you know 32 and then Bucky x equals 4 and then Bucky um mult divided equals 5 or something like that so go ahead the original value of Bucky is 24 plus 67 minus 32 times 4/5 and I messed that up right there but I'm going to wait 10 seconds and I want you to leave a comment below of what you think this equals and let me see if anyone can figure this out in 10 seconds 9 8 three two one and let's see what it was forty seven point two so how close were you to that hmm let me know in the comment section below because I bet you were way off because I was by anyways thank you guys for watching that's all I have for you guys for the story I just wanted to talk to you quick about assignment operators and don't forget don't ever use the modulus in assign operator I'll see you next time
