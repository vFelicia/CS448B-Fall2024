hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about stream readers now if you remember from the previous tutorials we learned how to write text to a text file well now we're going to be learning how to read text from a text file so we'll go ahead and create a new project we will select a windows forms application and we will call it streams again go ahead and click OK and looks like lots to do streams 1 click OK and wait for that to load okay so now now that is it has loaded we'll go ahead and add a text box we will make it multiline and then we'll make it readonly so readonly is going to be equal to true and then we'll add a button and we will set the button name or the text we'll set the text to load file and we'll set the name to button load ok so now we'll just double click on load file and this will open up our click event handler for it now just like before to use any kind of any type of stream we're gonna have to type imports the system dot IO namespace so this gives us the classes that we can use to read and write to text files now there are a bunch of other ways to read and write to text files but this is just how we're learning it in these tutorials so we're gonna go ahead and declare a stream reader so private file to load as new stream reader and we'll go ahead and set the path of this to the same path that we used for the last tutorial so we're going to get my file dot txt in the gdrive now you can see that I have it right here and we can edit that with notepad plus plus and I have hello YouTube on life gamer and the new boss stand in there so we'll go ahead and close this out and we'll go ahead and minimize that so now that we have our stream reader and we have our location that we're going to load from whenever that I click load what we're going to do is type file to load dot read and you can see that we have read read block read line or read to end read reads only one character read block reads a maximum of count characters from the current stream so you can tell it to read a certain amount of characters you can read one line so it really reads until it hits an escape key or down to the next line and it ends reading and what we're going to use is read to end so it's going to read everything inside of the file so now that we've called read to end what we're going to need to do is put all that text inside of our text box so we'll type text box 1 dot text is going to be equal to whatever is in that file so let's go ahead and run this hopefully we won't get any errors and now when we click load file we get hello YouTube on live gamer and the new Boston so we can go ahead and close out of that and let's open my file again and we can edit it so we'll add a visual basic.net and programming so now that we've added some more stuff stuff to our text file let's go ahead and run this again and see if it shows up when we load the file so you can see that when we load the file we get hello YouTube on live gamer the new Boston visual basic.net and programming so go ahead and practice loading files using a stream reader you can also load files in add stuff to them and then save them after that so that's what I want you guys to do is make an app that will do that if you don't want to you can just go ahead and move on to the next tutorials if not and you make one feel free to leave it in a video response so thanks for watching it stays tuned for the next tutorial
