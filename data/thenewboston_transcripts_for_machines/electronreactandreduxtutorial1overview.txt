what is up y'all welcome back to another video and in this one i thought i'd share an interesting side project that i've been working on now before we get to any of this i do want to throw out a little disclaimer and that is that this tutorial series it's going to be a little bit more casual a little less structured than my other tutorial series even though my other tutorial series definitely were not the most formal or structured in the first place but i just want to point this out mostly because i i just really been missing getting back to these stories where i don't know everything wasn't so planned out and it was more just having fun hacking something together building something with the community uh sharing stories and yeah i just thought it would be a little bit more enjoyable so kind of want to get back to that now with that being said i'll go ahead and show you exactly what it is that i'm going for here and i'll start with the problem that i was trying to solve so check it out so i like having plants in my apartment i just think it i don't know it's cool watching something grow and overall it just feels like there's more life in my apartment now the issue with that is that i'm too lazy to to walk the three feet over to water them each day and i'm also a little bit worried that whenever i go on vacation that they're all gonna dry out and i'm gonna be worried that they died and yadda yadda it's just too stressful so i was planning some kind of system that would like automate the watering process or allow me to water my plants remotely and when i was planning on the out i realized that if i made this architecture generic enough then i could probably build some other cool stuff too almost you know kind of start turning my home into a smart home uh if you want to call it that that's kind of a stretch given that i didn't even build anything yet but that's kind of the background for all of this so let me go ahead and talk about the architecture that i came up with so check it out so the basic architecture the very first thing we need is just a way that i can have two devices communicate with one another because the idea i had for that plant watering thing was something like this where whether this is a computer or a mobile phone whatever but i wanted to be able to send commands over to some raspberry pi is what i had in mind and then the raspberry pi would be hooked up to some water bottle the water bottle wouldn't look like this it would probably be some kind of system that i could um automate the watering process easier with electronic so it won't have like a squeeze handle most likely but i have to figure something out but either way let's get back to this so the general architecture is i can send this raspberry pi commands from one of my devices and then this raspberry pi could water my plants and i thought it would be cool if you know i could have an app that i could do it from my desktop or maybe a mobile app as well anywhere in the world my plants would be watered problem solved okay so that is pretty cool so before just hopping right in to that though i figure i kind of want to build this up and by build it up i mean uh kind of building it more in bite size manageable pieces so i'll kind of walk you guys through my overall plan and if you have any feedback then i'd love to hear but the very first thing that i'm going to be doing is really just hooking up a very basic system where i can send sample text messages back and forth between my devices and i wouldn't even call this like a chat app more of like a simple ping pong service if you want to say that but either way the very first thing i'm going to be doing is just hooking up my imac and my laptop and just seeing if i can you know send ping and get a pong response back now once i do that then i can go ahead and replace this device delete that with this raspberry pi automated watering system and then move all this around one other app id i had by the way i'm i'm not saying that i'm going to be building all these i just want to give you some examples of the type of architecture that you know kind of show you what's possible um another cool app idea i had is that well i'll explain kind of my thought i had is that whenever i'm like out traveling or going hiking or anything if i could just take a picture with my mobile phone and when i come back to my apartment i could have some like digital picture frame and it would like appear there um i thought that would be pretty cool or maybe if i was browsing online and finding a cool picture then i could just use some app to you know pretty much manage my digital picture frames for my apartment and i'm almost certain something like this must already exist already but you know it's cool if we build it ourselves so those are some app ideas that i had if you have any more i'd love to hear them but uh yeah and now with that being said let's pop this back open and okay so since i'm going to be building multiple apps and not just one what i started doing is building out this platform called tnb os it's of course not an actual operating system it's actually written in electron and react but i thought t and bos sounded cool so sticking with that for now and the purpose of this platform i guess you could say is really to abstract away a lot of the technical stuff and i'm also writing a more standard api that i can use for app development just so i don't have to write the same functions over and over and over again and so far the progress that i made is really as you can see been working on the ui some of the project structure uh hooking up redux writing some standard components and let me show you the ui real quick so the ui what i have built right now are two well they're called apps in the system but the first one is this just the network manager um i didn't want to pop this back open so i didn't just want to make this platform where the server that i had was hard coded in because i figured if anyone else wants to use this i don't know maybe you want to develop your own uh private network applications that uh you know you can add your own so this is what i have kind of a network manager right here and of course you can edit delete it yada yada and then i also have this device manager and by the way these aren't real devices right now like i said none of this is hooked up to the back end as of yet but eventually these are going to be real devices pretty much adam and then eventually later on we're going to be building applications that allows us to communicate with these but really just want to have something simple on the ui right now to verify that everything is working and yeah so still figuring out how to structure everything of course i need quite a bit of ui work um kind of through this ui together is kind of quickly need to polish it up these are like pretty much the first icons that i could find but yeah lots of interesting challenges with using electron in react as an operating system and i say that in air quotes especially whenever we're building these i don't even know what you call them like stateless peertopeer remote apps whatever you want to call this overall architecture and it's actually believe it or not been pretty fun to build the back end right now i would say is about 96 done it just needs some updates to the websocket authentication so that only the account owner can listen to their traffic thought it would be a little bit more secure that way but once that's ready gonna start hooking everything up to the front end so shortly all of this ui will hopefully be live and working so looking forward to that but yeah that's really all i wanted to cover in this first video if you have any thoughts on the ui let me know what i was thinking is that these system apps right here would probably be on the right and then all of those custom apps that we talked about like for watering the plants chatting uh managing your digital pictures so on and so forth i was thinking that those would be on the left it just felt kind of intuitive that way but uh yeah let me know and also another thing that i want to point out i saw on reddit that someone was making a react project that was kind of similar like a react type os kind of app and they had these windows that were movable and resizable more like an actual operating system right now these windows right here are static you can see you can't drag them or resize them or anything but that's another feature that i want to work on i think it would be i don't know just a little more os like very cool but yeah overall just thought it was a cool little side project wanted to share it in the next video i'm going to be going over the project structure but for now i'm actually pretty hungry so probably going to go pound a few beefaroni's and on that note i will talk to you later see ya
