now let's say I wanted to select data so let's just put some pseudo code here select uh data or select um the username from uh users so this is our table here where the ID is equal is equal to two so this is what we call a query this is in Pudo code at the moment I haven't well almost it's just engl English language but I um what I've done here is I've constructed um a something called a query and what a query does is allow us allows us to use specific syntax this isn't specific syntax at the moment to select information from different parts so what we're doing here is we're selecting the username in this column here from users table which is this whole table here where the ID is equal to two so the ID is equal to two we want to select the username and we're taking the username which is Billy so this query would return the value of Billy so you can see the advantages of storing inside a database it might look complicated at this stage but when you start to use it inside PHP PHP makes it very easy for you to extract data even insert data um and perform a variety um of queries Etc and that's done through MySQL so you can also have other tables so we could have table um let's say uploads we might have allow users to upload files now why is this going to be useful let's just add um another column called ID and then I'm going to say user ID and I'm going to say location so the ID will again be autoincrement but this time user ID what we're doing here is we're referencing the user ID back to this initial ID because that is the user's ID so you can call these column names anything you like but I recommend something of the similar structure so user ID might be one and the location of the file that's been uploaded might be uh logo.png for example and now we can come on to say record 2 and this might be user ID 1 again might have uploaded a file called um php. jpg onto record three and we might have user up user two upload a file called art.jpg so now what we can do is we can perform a query to say um let's say our user is logged in as Alex what we would do is we would have the ID ready to select things relative to Alex so the ID is one this is unique to the user Alex so what we could do is we could say select um location from upload remember this is the table name where user ID is one now what this query here would do is return the values wherever the user ID equals 1 so it would essentially return these two now we've selected location only so what it would do is it would only bring back this data so what we can do is to speed things up we can select a specific uh column name so we can save time in our program uh our load time and we can save um you know resources so this is essentially databases the reason we use databases is it's a quick and easy way to add information somewhere that can be easily retrieved we don't have to deal with text files we don't have to deal with comma delimited files or space delimited files or tab delimited files which would look something like um Alex Garrett PHP academy.org we could have maybe one there we might have two Billy Garett and nothing so to do this we would need to open the file we would you need to use an explode function to get rid of these commas and put this into an array then what we would do is we would have to select a specific uh part of the array so either 0o 1 2 or three but by putting it into a database you're creating almost something that you can visually look at you can visualize as a whole and extract specific data and in insert specific data you can also update data really really easily as well with with just a single query so that's an introduction to databases like I said we're going to be using the database um MySQL which is sometimes pronounced my SQL and um SQL stands for structured query language now I've been talking about queries and this is exactly that we have a structured query in which to retrieve update delete create anything inside of our table so this is just the name of the database we're going to be using
