so today we're moving on to circles now a circle comes in this form with with one little stipulation this is usually y minus a squared plus y minus B squared equals R squared with a B this Center so for this equation it's centered about 0 0 because we're not subtracting any numbers and then our radius is R so we would take the square root of both sides to solve for R and this isn't an action we don't have an actual number for our but what if I told you that x squared plus y squared is equal to 4 we would take the square root of 4 to find out what R equals so R equals 2 so our Center is at 0 0 I'm just gonna put that so you know but you remember a circle doesn't intersect its center so if we have a radius of 2 that means that every point is 2 away from the center so that's what our circle would look like okay so x squared plus y squared equals 4 this is what we just did so we're gonna skip this one X minus 1 squared plus y plus 1 squared equals 9 so first we're going to find out what our radius is our radius is equal to the square root of 9 so R is equal to positive and minus 3 now in this case our plus and minus tells us direction so it says our radius goes 3 to the right and it also goes 3 to the left so our center if you remember it comes in this form a B so our a is positive one our B is negative one so that's our Center so I'm going to plot that one negative one so this is our Center and our radius goes three in each direction so up three left three and down three so there's our circle and I know it's not perfectly a circle I don't have a compass with me right now and that's all actually for our equations of circles but make sure you come back where we're going to talk about a third nonlinear equation called an ellipse
