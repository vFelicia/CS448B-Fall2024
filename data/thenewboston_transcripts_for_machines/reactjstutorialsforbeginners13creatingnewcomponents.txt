already houses so now that we got our edit functionality and remove functionality working correctly the last thing I want to do is I would just want to add a quick button to add a new comment so let me go ahead and in my board I just go ahead and add it right above the board so since we're going to add a button and still have this board we actually need to wrap those both inside one parent div so let me stick my board back in there and let me just put fun alright so on the button I'll just write add new so we'll have a button right at the top and whenever the user clicks it it'll just give them um like a blank one or maybe we'll add some default text in there who knows and I already have some styling built in so I'll say class name I'm going to make a purple so that's button info again this isn't any react stuff it's just to make it a look kind of fancy and great so again this just makes a purple button and I can actually render this out right now alright so there you go when you click it nothing happens plain old dumb button so what else do I want to do what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to remove all of these by default so at first we're actually not even going to have any comments whatsoever so whenever the user wants a new one they're going to have to click this button alright so what might be a good idea to right now is that make a function to add a new comment why not name it ad so function boom roasted now actually whenever I do this I'm going to add some default text in there so we just don't have blank comments or else they'll look kind of weird and yeah so this is going to be the text that we're going to set essentially to this array item so just like before what we're going to be doing is pretty much taking a string of text and adding it to this array so we need a reference to this array we're going to make a copy of it and then for that copy we're just going to add a new item so push is how you add a new item to an array in JavaScript and what text we want to use just this right here so the very first time we call this it's going to have a string of text in here that says like I love Bucky or I love ice cream sandwiches whatever and just like before since we need to update the state then we're going to update the comment state using the new array boom roasted how easy was that so now the last bit of code we have to write is we have this function right here now we actually just have to hook it up to this button so how do we do that well over an hour button what we do is we just write on click hey how it does that on click just like that and set it equal to this dot add now one other thing I want to mention is this whenever you call in this kind of way since JavaScript can't really figure out scope yet you need to call bind so this is actually how you pass some values or text in right here so what we're going to bind is just a no object in the default text is pretty much the text that's going to appear on the button so I'll write I'll write something that's like baking food and I'll spell it wrong why not so basically whatever you type here is going to be the default text and of course the user can edit that later so let me refresh this and new and there you go there's our default text I just didn't want to write default text because I want to show you guys that you can like customize this default text let's do it properly now all right so you add it we now have a new array item aka a new comment and the user can edit this bacon they can add a few more tuna fish and you know what I actually didn't even want this one so I can go ahead and remove that boom roasted there you go so that ladies or gentlemen is probably all I'm going to do for this little note program there's a lot more react to toriel's that I'm going to cover but they're going to be set up a little bit differently and for example you guys probably notice already that is getting kind of cluttered having all this code inside one file so later on I'm going to show you guys how you can actually take each component break it up into a single file and then whenever you run your final build to build your entire program it kind of bundles everything up automatically and makes it run super fast so that's what we'll do in the next couple tutorials it's going to be awesome so I'll see you guys then
