hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash the on live gamer for the new boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about eye disposable now what i disposable let you do is get rid of objects after you've used them so that you can make better use of the memory that you're using and you won't have to have garbage collection do all of the work for you so what we're going to do is create a new project here so we'll go to file new project will shrink it down and we'll call will select windows forms application and we will call it eye disposable test and then go ahead and click okay so now what we need to do is we need to add a class to our eye disposable test so we'll we will add a class and we will call this class do stuff so we have a class that will do stuff dot VB and we'll go ahead and click add so here's our class that we've created and so now we need to do is to be able to dispose of objects created on this class we're going to have to use the implements keep keyword to use eye disposable so the way to do this is by typing implements eye disposable and we go ahead and click tab and click enter you can see that adds a whole bunch of this code for us so it says region eye disposable support so it just creates a region in our class that holds all of these subs for us and we have a disposed value as believe which we'll see if the current object has been disposed we've got a disposed sub and a dispose a second one of it so you can read the comments on this if you want to see what it does but we don't really have to worry about that right now we can just leave that the way it is and I highly suggest that you do not change that so we will add some subs here so what type of public sub so message and then we'll just type message box this is a message okay so now that we've created a sub that will show a message we can go ahead and come into our forum 1vb designer and we will add a button to this so we'll just set the text to show message and we will set the name to button message and we'll just make this a little bit bigger so that it will fit all these words we'll double click on the show message event handler and we'll just zoom in here okay so now we need to do is we need to create an object of the do stuff class so we'll go ahead and type dim new do stuff as new do stuff so this creates an object of our do stuff class and now what we need to do is we need to call show message so we will type the name of our object and we will just use the show message sub okay so now it's just show the message and now once that's done showing the message what we want to do is we want to get rid of ours to us new do stuff object so that the memory we have more free memory so we'll just go ahead and type new do stuff and then we're going to use dot right there and we will just call dispose so dot dispose and you see that it has been created by eye disposable for us okay so now we need to do is we need to come back into new form and do a formal VB and we need to set new do stuff equal to nothing which will completely get rid of our object so let's go ahead and run this and you can see that if we click show message right here it says this is a message and the title is the by default when you call message box the title is going to be the name of your project let's go ahead and click OK and when it does that you can see that it gets rid of our new do stuff object so go ahead and create a couple classes that implement eye disposable so that you can dispose the value I'm not supposed to value dispose the object once you're done using it and then after you've done that go ahead and move on to some of the next tutorials we're going to be talking a little bit more about eye disposable and using objects and making it more memory efficient so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
