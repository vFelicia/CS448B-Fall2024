hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking another look at strings now we looked at strings in the last tutorial and for the next couple upcoming tutorials we are also going to look at some other stuff that you can do with strings so let's go ahead and get started now we're going to come up here and we're going to declare a variable so let's go ahead and dim uh username as string so now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt the user to enter in their username so we'll just do console. right line what is your username now username is going to be equal to console.readline so basically just get what they typed in now what we're going to do is we're going to test to see if their username is a certain length so we're just going to make a simple if statement so if username and now what we're going to do is we're going to add a period so if username Dot and you can see here that intellisense pops up with a whole bunch of stuff that we can do um you can copy you can do do contains there's a whole bunch of stuff that you can use um with strings and this is very useful so what we're going to use is username do length and now if you read the description for this it's going to say gets the number of characters in the current system.string object so if username Dolen equals 10 then go ahead and do something so we'll just do console. right line you have been granted access now what we're going to do is we're going to add console.readline so that our program won't close right when we're done so now it'll say what is your username and if I type in something that's 10 characters long so let's just say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and if we press press enter it'll say you have been granted access now if we type anything else that's not equal to 10 so let's just do something more than 10 it's not going to say anything so let's just go back in here and add a simple else now what we're going to do is we're going to do console. right line your username is not the right length so now if we run this it'll say what is your username so if we type something that's not 10 characters long it'll say your username is not the right length now what we can also do instead of using IF username Dolen equals 10 we can just go ahead and do if usern username Dolen do equals and then inside of the arguments for equals It'll ask us for an object as an integer so we'll go ahead and do 10 right there now this is just another way that you can test the length value of username and do equals can be used for a lot of other other things in Visual Basic so if we run this it should work so 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and it'll say you have been gr granted access now this is a really simple simple tutorial and you shouldn't have to practice it and um go ahead and stay tuned for the next tutorial and thanks for watching
