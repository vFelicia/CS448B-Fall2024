this is Alex from PHP academy' dog and this is a second video for the new Boston on timestamps now when we want to display a date we can display the current date we've already established how to do that now what if I wanted to display a date that was say a couple of days ago or a week ahead or in fact I wanted to read in a particular date and store it as a timestamp now when you're storing data for example dates in databases it's always recommended you store as a timestamp therefore making it available to process that day and in many different ways possible so at the moment you can see we've got the time we've grabbed from a timestamp we've got the actual time which has been formatted however what if I want to just up here let's just remove this as well otherwise it won't make sense what happens if just up here I want to change the date I want to change the date to say a week ago okay so today today is April the 1st and 2011 so what I want to do is I want to change the time and I want to say the time is equal to in fact what we'll do is we won't do that here we'll establish the time stamp here and then here what we'll do is we'll say we can either say plus or minus a certain a certain amount of seconds so what we can do is we can say minus 20 so time minus 20 that's 20 seconds before what we're looking at so let's refresh this now at the moment this shows an hour that's probably a bad idea we'll say minus 60 for a minute so let's refresh so this says it reads 824 and 50 seconds now looking at my clock on my computer it's actually 825 so now it's 826 on my computer so we've gone back an hour so now what we could probably do is say time now equals or copy and paste that over to here get rid of that and append a break on to that in fact no we won't wheel time modified so I'm just setting on my variables so they look a bit nicer so now what we can do is echo a sentence here so the time now is time now a break on to there and say the time modified is and space and time modified so let's refresh this page and see what we get so the time now is Friday April 2011 and you can see this 2655 however this one's 25 55 because remember we 60 seconds however there's a really useful function in PHP and that is called an STR time and what this allows you to do is take a string data for time so we could say plus one week and that would return a timestamp with a week's worth of seconds added on to it so we can test this in here we could say plus and then we could say STR time remember this is string data with converting a string to a timestamp we can create say plus one week now if we refresh this the time now will the time now will show a or we're looking at the date in this case Friday and April we've added a week on so we are looking at only Thursday 1916 and plus Oh L don't know one week there we go so refresh right this might just be my okay there class one week and what that should do is know in actual fact looking at this logically okay right right okay so what I've done is I'm returning the timestamp and adding on something we don't need to so if I was to say st at a time this is already including the timestamp and then we're adding a week on so let's just try this again and refresh okay so now you can see that it's gone from Friday to Friday however if we were to say one week this is probably a better example because now we're going to go back into March we've changed this now to March so let's just put this as D and refresh so first of April and let's put this as a D small small D lowercase D and it's refresh okay perfect so now we've got a textual represent an americorps representation of the day so first of April 2011 we've gone back a week which is the 25th of March so now what what happens if we say +1 year obviously going to take ourselves into 2012 so we've got 1st of April 2011 plus and then the modified is 1st of April 2012 but what we can also do is we can do things like combinations so what we can do is we can say plus 1 week 2 hours 30 seconds okay so what we're now doing is we're adding a week 2 hours and 30 seconds so let's just refresh we'll check the first let's first of April and it's 20 31 so we're now ended up with the 8th of April which is a week later with 22 and you can see that we've done 2 hours and the 30 seconds is been added on so we've got 35 here and we've got 5 here so we're going into the next minute so this is a really great way to modify your times depending on your needs obviously these functions can be used alone you can use them to feed in a time stamp so we could say time and we could say 30 seconds so let's refresh we've gone back to this again so I think it appears that we know yeah we're not going to use this because because of the nature of how the function works however we can obviously use this alone we can use the STR time and then say a week however if we wanted to go back let's say let's say for example 30 seconds 30 minutes let's just say well we'll enclose this in brackets first and then we can say two hours or a and we'll just say like seven days for example so seven days two hours 30 seconds and 30 minutes so what we're doing is we're multiplying everything together to create the seconds now let's refresh the page and we can see that what we're doing is we're taking this back seven days so we've got first of April mmm let's just try changing this to 24 hours what result we come up with let's refresh okay so um it's taken us back 24 hours 24 hours let's just doublecheck that 24 hours then another two hours and that's back to the 31st of March so yeah 24 hours we've been taken back not sure why this 7 days isn't working but anyway it's just something to research and have a look at it's very hard to explain every single point of timestamps because there's so many functions within PHP that deal with the time so be sure to have a little research around have a look around and the php.net manual is full of information about this and you can view live examples but this is generally how we would use time stamps and how useful they can actually be
