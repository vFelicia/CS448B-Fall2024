hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with another video tutorial for the New Boston we're going to be looking at the stop animation in effect in jQuery um now I guess you wouldn't really call it an actual effect but what the stop function does is stops an animation um from you know from currently well it will stop an animation as it is happening so what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and create an image and a button so the button is going to toggle the image sliding up and down but we're also going to include another button which will stop the animation while it's happening so for example if the image has slid down halfway we can use the stop button to stop the animation so let's go ahead and create two paragraphs um in the first one is going to be our button so we have button and a value of start um we'll also give this an ID as well let's say ID equals start um we can now create another button quite similarly but this time it's going to be uh to stop the animation so the type is button the value is stop and we can give this an ID as well and that's going to be stop so now that we've done that let's go ahead and preview this on our page we have a start button and a stop button so let's go down and include the image that we want to toggle so image source and that is Tartan do jpg the alt can just be Tartan and uh we need to give an ID to the paragraph now in the last tutorial when we looked at the slide effect uh which I'm going to be using in this tutorial as well uh we noted that we can't actually use the slide effect for an image itself we have to use it in something that surrounds it and in this case that's a paragraph so I'm going to give this paragraph an ID of image uh because we know that there's an image inside of it so this is what it looks like in the browser when we click Start the animation is going to take place we're going to toggle this using the slide toggle function the image is going to slide up or down depending on uh where whereabouts is at the you know at the current state uh either hidden or shown and then stop is going to stop this animation in its track TRS so let's go ahead and create a event handler for this start so um inside of our effects. JJs file which we've included in our page we need to go ahead and create an event handler for this button so um start this is um we're going to say do click so when the user has clicked we execute uh code within a block in this function here so we've got our function as normal and our block of code and inside here we want to slide toggle so we reference the image remember the image paragraph we created and we use the slide toggle function to do this and I'm going to set a time of let's just give us a chance to click on the button so 3 seconds so when we click on the start button you can see that the image uh slowly uh shuts actually we'll give it five so when we click on start it takes 5 seconds from the bottom to the top and then when we click start again it will open back out and slide back down so that's the slide toggle function now stop is going to call a stop to the current animation path so what we want to do is we want to create another callback function or sorry another event handler for the Stop button so let's say hash stop. click so essentially when the stop button is clicked remember we called the stop button stop just here when this is clicked we create a function or we execute a function and this is essentially going to reference image and then we just say dot stop so now that we've called do stop on this while this slide toggle um effect is taking place we can then click the stop button to stop the effect let's go back to our browser and click Start now now that's loading or that's uh sliding up let's slide it back down again and this time we're going to press stop before it gets to the end so we press stop and you see that the animation has stopped uh when we press start it will toggle it because it hasn't got to the end of the animation with regards to resuming um an animation like I showed you earlier we start the animation and then we can stop it at a particular Point uh you'll see that um we we have this problem now the reason for this is that jQuery doesn't actually have a um resume functionality however there are um a variety of plugins that will allow you to do this so while we can't do it with the original jQuery Library we can get extended plugins that will allow us to do this so for now what we've looked at is using the slider toggle function uh as we did in previous tutorials but actually using stop to stop any animation not just this type um while it's being carried out
