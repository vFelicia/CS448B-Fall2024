what's up guys bucky here and in this series we are going to be learning about docker now for those of you guys brand new to docker who aren't quite sure what it is or even when you would use it let's go ahead and imagine this so say it was your very first day starting in a new job you just got hired as a software developer and your boss slides you over the new company laptop and tells you to start installing all the dependencies that you're gonna need all right so let's go ahead and do this we're gonna install some python and uh what else do we got maybe uh postgres new database for sure and what's one more thing uh let's say django and what is this not compatible with version of postgres huh okay so it looks like we have to install a different version of postgres uh okay so you know things not going that well so far but let's just go ahead and install a different version so i'm going to install postgres v2 and what is this uh postgres already installed oh crap okay so oh i know what if i installed with brew so install brew okay that's good and then brew install postgres okay now you have five postgres installed and nothing will work anymore okay so clearly things are not going that well i mean we already installed a bunch of different versions i'm reading through stack overflow posts and they're out of date and confusing and the cute girl sitting next to me thinks that i'm an idiot and it's not even lunch time yet now before we think about quitting and moving to canada so we never have to show our face at that company again let me tell you about a little something called docker now what is docker so docker makes it easy to install and run software without needing to manually install and configure a ton of dependencies so how does it do this it does this through something called containers now this is a very very simplified diagram of a container again in this first introductory video just want to give you the really high level concepts we'll be taking a deep dive into the container architecture later on and see exactly how it interacts with your operating system and hardware but again like i said very brief overview for now so let's get back to it what is a container a container is an environment that is isolated from the rest of your operating system so in this diagram right here this black laptop is your main laptop think of it like your work laptop and this green laptop is supposed to symbolize if you can't tell by my beautiful artwork an environment that's kind of isolated from the rest of your operating system now what do i mean by that isolated that means that within this container you can install any software you want you can actually delete any files you want mess with configurations do whatever you want in here and no matter what you do your parent operating system is never affected so unlike here where if you just have five different versions of postgres installed and your environment is all messed up you may have to like reboot or reinstall your entire operating system if things get really bad but with docker what you can do is essentially just delete this container and create a brand new one now some of the more tech savvy people out there may be noticing some similarities between docker containers and virtual machines and they do have a lot of similarities but some key differences as well now this website right here docker dot com slash resources slash what container is a good overview and actually has some pretty cool diagrams that uh i'm just gonna reference instead of trying to draw my own about the more of the specifics between a vm versus a container but real quick with a virtual machine you essentially have a separate mini operating system running within your operating system so this diagram on the right is reflective of an environment running multiple virtual machines so you see a b and c now you can see that each one of these is pretty much like a mini operating system which of course an operating system running within operating system is going to consume a lot of resources now containers they take up less space than a vm because they actually share the same operating system and hardware resources as the parent operating system alright so more on this later but for right now let's just head back to docker.com and we're going to install something called docker desktop so we are going to be using this throughout the duration of these tutorials so make sure that you follow along with this again docker.com if you go to products you can click on docker desktop and i'm going to hit download for mac because i'm on a mac and actually what i did is i downloaded it before this tutorial began because i figured you guys wouldn't want to you know just sit here and watch it download for however long it took so just gonna double click this all right now just drag it over in applications all right so apparently we got it installed but where is this thing well check it out open up your launchpad and click on this docker icon right here and okay yup i trust it it's cool it's cool and for this yes i do trust it and all right looks like we got something going on now another thing that i want to point out is in the top right corner right here throughout this tutorial you are going to need a docker hub account so let me pop this up so if you go to hub.docker.com you are going to need to sign up for one of these accounts create an id an email a password and very simply docker hub is more or less like github for docker there's a lot more to it than that but for right now just think of it like that so create an account and then once you do that if you right click this icon you can actually sign in with your docker id and this is just your docker help account alright so now that we have our docker hub account created and apparently we have everything installed the last thing we need to do in this tutorial is just verify that everything was installed and configured correctly so in your terminal whatever terminal you're using go ahead and write docker version and hit enter and if everything went smoothly then you shouldn't see any errors and you should see some output again we're going to be going over all this output in the following tutorials talking about the difference between the client and server yada yada tomato to motto but for right now all we want to do is ensure that we have everything set up installed and configured correctly now the last thing i want to point out before i let you guys go is if you run into any issues either in this video with the installation process or setting things up or in any future videos then what you can do is on the website the new boston.com social there is a discord link right here if you join our discord there's actually a docker channel that we have where we're going to be discussing everything docker related and helping anyone out with any issues at all and as a bonus if you want to follow these other sweet social media channels feel free to do so however now that we have everything installed and ready to go we are ready to take a closer look into containers and that is what we're going to be doing in the next video so ladies and gentlemen i will see you then
