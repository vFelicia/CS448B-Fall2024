what's up guys is Bucky and welcome to your 41st PHP tutorial and in this tutorial we're gonna be talking about something called cloning now what cloning is is it's a way to take an object and pretty much clone it make a duplicate of it but you just can't you know set one object equal to another object and expect everything to work fine because well we didn't really cover references or anything like that but it just doesn't work like that so we need a clone an object a special way whenever we want a copy of it so let's go ahead and I decided for this tutorial what I'm gonna do is kind of recap everything I learned instead of just teaching you just about cloning so I'm gonna show you everything we learn and that's how to set up a class properly and by doing so I'm gonna teach you cloning so let's go ahead in the setup class called person and it's gonna have to have a couple attributes in it so class person and let's go ahead and make two private variables one is called age and let's go ahead and just copy that and let's go ahead and name this one color so say we're making a class of people and we want to record their age in their favorite color or something like that so let's make function set H and go ahead and pass the X and go ahead remember this age is equal to X so now whenever we want to set this age all we have to do is pass in the variable and wham bam thank you ma'am there you go so let's go ahead and copy this and we'll do the same thing for color but we'll change the name set color and this color so how easy is that you just go ahead copy change couple key words in there you go so now that we have our setters let's go ahead and build our getters to get you know age or the color so this is even easier than the setter function get aged empty parameters because we're not passing any new information we're just getting information and all we wanted to do is return this age in this case and now for our color let's go ahead and copy that and all this function is gonna do is get color and it's gonna of course return color so the basics as you can see we have two properties right now in age and color in this class this one sets the age this one sets the color this one gets the age this one gets the color easy enough so now let's go ahead and finally build some objects so I can show you guys pretty much what cloning is and why it's useful the first thing we need to do is let me just add some space right there in let's go ahead and make person called Bucky and set this equal to a new person because if you remember from up here our class was called person so Bucky as a new person it doesn't have any constructor so we don't need any parameters for that let's go ahead and populate his age and his color so let's go ahead and do that right now in order to do this you go type the name of your object put set age and of course my age is 23 actually it's 23 for let's see 1 2 3 more days so my birthday in three days so let's go ahead and now Bucky's age is 23 so now all he needs is a favorite color so Bucky what was it it was set color yeah set color and for the parameter type my favorite color can anyone guess and you wanted it oh it's actually blue blue and white they're tied but you know this only asked for one set so I'm gonna give it so now we have an object called Bucky and he belongs to the class person so Bucky has a favorite number that's 23 and Bucky also has a favorite color and that's blue but what if I have a twin named Tommy well in order to create an exact copy of the subject we just can't do this or else it gives us a whole bunch of issues because an object isn't just another variable with a value an object kind of has is a special variable because it has a bunch of different values and a bunch of different methods so it's not just one value or copy in here so that's why we can't just do that so what PHP did is said whenever you want to copy an object to another object go ahead and use a special keyword called clone and now type the object you want to copy so it's kind of like copying the variable but you just need to remember to put that special keyword clone right before the object that you want to copy so now Tommy is an exact copy of Bucky Tommy's favorite color is blue and Tommy's age is 23 so let's go ahead and change one of those parameters so when I output it you can see that this is actually a little bit different so Tommy let's go ahead and set his favorite color too no let's say it's red or something and let make sure I have all my semicolons go good enough all right just making sure I got my semicolons right there all right so now what we did is we created a person called Bucky who's 23 favorite color blue now Tommy whenever we call him his favorite color was blue and his favorite number 23 but then we decided to make his favorite color red so now Tommy is the exact same age as Bucky which is 23 they're both 23 but they just have different favorite colors now so when we echo that if everything worked out perfectly that's what we should see so let's go ahead and echo everything right now let's echo both of Bucky stuff so Bucky remember get aged and of course it doesn't take any parameters and let's just go ahead and you can't Nate it with a break so when we output it in our browser everything will look all nice and neat and let me go ahead and echo this that goes favorite number two actually you just go ahead and copy this I mean if a guy suddenly all right Bucky you get age Bucky get color so what this is gonna do is it's gonna echo 23 and blue easy enough so let's go ahead and copy all that because you're way too lazy to type it and now let's echo out Tommy's information Tommy Tommy Tommy is actually the name of my cousin's in case you guys are wondering go ahead and send them some mail and check this out the first thing that's gonna do is echo out 23 and blue because that's Bucky's information that's the original information we got but we made a clone of Bucky called Tommy right here now Tommy's age is the same but we changed his favorite color right here to red so this age should be twenty three stroke still but his favorite color should be red so if everything went nice and neat and we didn't get in heirs or forgot any semicolons or anything like that that's what it should display so refresh send yes and check this out whoa definitely I went back to notepad and set my browser there but anyways check this out it didn't update for some reason update yes and there we go 23 blue that's Bucky's information Tommy same age 23 but his favorite color is red just like that so how awesome is that that uh you know its basic basically what clone does right there it pretty much takes one object and allows it to clone another object and there's one more little thing I want to teach you guys about cloning objects but I don't know how long it's gonna take and I'll probably run out of time so anyways and this story what we did is I taught you guys about cloning and I also recaps pretty much everything we learned in the past how to create a class why should make private variables and public functions again um never mind by anyways I'm not gonna tell you guys what we just learned because you just watch this whole tutorial if you want to know what we're just learning again then watch this or again anyways thank you guys for watching a ninety nine how to clone objects now you're ready to move on to the next step in our object oriented programming adventure so yeah that's all I have for you guys so uh enjoy the tour Oh check out my website and have a Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays if you juice see it
