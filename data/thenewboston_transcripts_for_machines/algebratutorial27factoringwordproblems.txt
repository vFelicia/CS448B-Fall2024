so now we're going to learn how to use factoring to solve word problems so like I've always told you the hardest part of word problems is setting them up after that the math is actually pretty easy so let's focus mostly on the setup of this problem the sum of the squares of two consecutive positive even integers is 340 find the integers so I know that sounds like a lot but right here where it tells us that it's positive and integer just tells us that's it a that it's a positive whole number two consecutive even integers is going to help us Define our variables so X is going to be the first integer and consecutive means that they come one right after another but since it says even if x was two the next integer would be three if I just said that it was x + one so we have to say that it's x + 2 in order to ensure that this second integer is also even so this sum of the squares so that means we're going to square the first integer and add it to the square of the second integer and the sum is which means equals 340 so let me Square this out you get x^2 + 4x + 4 is = to 340 we're going to combine our like terms and we're going to pull this 340 over because remember when we solve equations by factoring we have to set it equal to zero 3 36 = 0 we can Factor 2 out x^2 + 2 get 168 equals z so here's where the guess and check part of this comes in we have to figure out which two numbers div multiply to make 168 but divide to make or I mean add to make two so I'm just going to with my calculator plug in some numbers and see if I can get any that will fit those two rules and I found out that 168 / 12 is equal to 14 so if I make this x + 14 x 12 then they'll add to give me a positive2 and multiply to give me a negative 168 so I'm gonna set these both equal to zero if I add 12 over I get 12 If I subtract 14 over I get 14 so since our problem told us that they had to be positive I can scratch out that 14 and I know that X is equal to 12 but since it said to find both integers I have to add two to that to find the second integer so X is equal to 14 so we're going to do another example 14 less than the square of a number is the same as five times that number so we're going to let x equal the number 14 less than the square of a number so X 2 14 is equal to 5 * that number and subtract that 5 over 4 equal 0 now this is in a special kind of trinomial so we just have to factor it normally so what two numbers well the only things 14 is divisible by is 7 and itself so 7 * 2 will give us 14 and since I have a 5 that me needs to be a 7 plus a pos2 cuz then we'll get 14 and 7x + 2x is equal to 5x then we set these equal to 0 x 7 = 0 x + 2 = 0 X add seven over you get seven subtract seven two over you get2 so now what we do is we plug this button in we plug both of these numbers in and see which one makes the statement true so 7^ 2 14 is = to 5 * 7 7^ 2 is 49 14 is equal to 35 if you subtract that you get 35 is equal to 35 so that one checks out we have to make sure that the other one doesn't or it does as well so we have 2 2ar 14 is equal to 2 * 5 so this is 4 14 = 10 10 = 10 so those both work so that means the number is either 7 or 2 and it's possible to have more than one correct answer for these problems so that's all we're going to do with word problems today make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to use factoring to help us solve geometric problems
