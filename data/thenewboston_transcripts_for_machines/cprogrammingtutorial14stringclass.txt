what's going on guys welcome to your 14 C++ tutorial and in this story I'm going to be teaching guys about a new class yes a new type of data interesting OMG buddy enough of the classes and types of dad I just want to learn something trust me guys if you guys have suffered through my last tutorial and learn everything about character arrays and getline oh my god I had enough with arrays if there's just a simple way to take a string and set it equal to a variable without any crap about arrays or anything like that that would be amazing well guys I have saved the best for less if you made it this far then you are in for a treat you think that I would teach the most simple stuff first but this is pretty much your prize for learning all the hard stuff first you want to see how easy this is check it out go ahead and type in the data type of string then go ahead and create a variable called X now without creating any arrays or anything like that all we have to do is take this and set it equal to any string we can imagine it can either be one letter it can either be a word an entire sentence an entire paragraph Bucky is ponder Sona whatever the heck that means it doesn't matter what it means because it's valid and let's go ahead and let me prove this oops not that what the heck is e let's go ahead and print this out and check it out Bucky is ponder Shana maybe it's Ponderosa maybe its personality who knows it doesn't matter because it makes sense as code so check this out there are no arrays there are none of this crap right here with commas and B and commas in you know none that crap string class is pretty much the character class cleaned up by a thousand percent and that is why I'm super excited about introducing this class it makes everything incredibly easy it's the one way that we can take an entire string and set it equal to a variable and I know you guys are same but Bucky you told us how to like add character classes together and how we could extract things and find the length of the character class and stuff like that and we don't have all those tools accessible to the string class because it's kind of like the character class bare bones well guys you are wrong check this out let's go ahead and make a string one and set it equal to bacon and let's go ahead and make string two and set it equal to I don't know sammich is and so we've got bacon sandwiches and then let's go ahead and get string three by the way one two and three they're just variable names you can name it XY and Z if you want you can name whatever you want and then go ahead and take string 3 into 1 plus 2 we'll check this out oops that's a regular colon semicolon check this out not only do we have access to other tools that we had access to in the character class but we also have access to some pretty neat tools on our own for example whenever we want to create a new string using two previous existing strings what we need to do is just go ahead and name our new variable then put 1 plus 2 and it adds bacon plus sandwiches so the easiest way is just pretty much just output this on the screen so let's just go ahead and print this baby out right now and see what we get bacon sandwiches so this is actually the string 3 which is actually a combination of 1 & 2 so that's a neat little trick we have with this string class and check this out aside from that um yeah let's go ahead and end line we also have access to that string length but in this string class it's called something a little bit different it's a new function and it's called size so see out three sides with empty parameters so check this out right here instead of string length if you want to get the length of assuring in this class you just call that function and automatically gets the length of this string so check this out how much easier is this just a class a variable name and then a string how easy er is that than this car Bucky 20 equals parentheses boo oh my god all that crap forget about that we're done with that we're moving on bigger and better things so check this out it's pretty much a character class like I said cleaned up times a thousand percent so we're going to be building a couple programs in the future using this string and trust me it's a whole lot better than using character so I just wanted to introduce this to you guys as pretty much your prize of suffering through my last tutorial so anyways there it is learn it get used to because you're going to be seeing a lot of it so I don't know what I'm going to be teaching in the next couple toriel's but it's prep going to be awesome so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
