hello this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is another video tutorial in PHP for the New Boston in this video I'm going to be talking on the subject of operators but we're going to be using comparison operators and I'm going to be showing you how they work and what they're useful for now let's go back to our previous examples of having variables I'm going to say 10 and number 2 I'm going to make that equal to 9 now comparison operators are basically when we compare one or more values we can compare any amount of values we want in this example we're going to be comparing sort of a maximum of three values just to demonstrate but without going going too far over time now for this example we're going to be using if statements so if you haven't already learned about if statements go to the video about if statement and have a look at that so you can get a general idea but as far as this is concerned I'm going to set up an if statement with my block just under here as well so I've got the block of data that's going to be executed here if this equals true now remember this inside here evaluates to either true or false therefore if I was to say if true I'm going to echo out inside so this is inside out our block I'm going to refresh and that's as inside however if I was to change this to false and I refresh it's not going to echo anything out because this has evaluated automatically to false I've used the false keyword now it's the same as if I was to do 1 equals 1 now you probably noticed I've just put two equal signs in there now remember when we assign values we use a single equal sign however when we use double value of double equal sign we compare so we're comparing the number one to the number one now the number one is equal to the number one this means is equal to so we're asking the question is one equal to one and this statement will evaluate to true so we are going to echo out text inside so let's refresh inside now we can say if does one equal two it doesn't so we're not going to echo this text down now the other the other assignment opera comparison operator sorry are not equal to so what we do is we use an exclamation mark and then we still use a single equal sign so we've got two characters here we've got an exclamation mark and a single equal to sign and this in plain English reads two does one or doesn't one equal to or does this not equal this now the answer is yes it doesn't one doesn't equal two so therefore we this is going to evaluate to true so one doesn't equal two therefore we're going to echo out the text inside now if we change this back to a 1 does 1 not equal 1 1 does equal 1 so this is going to evaluate to false so let's refresh and we don't echo the text down so now what we can do is start working with things like greater than and greater than or equal to or less than or less than or equal to so for example just to let you know beforehand this can also be written like this so we've got sort of conflict in less than and greater than signs so 1 is equal to 1 so we're not displaying anything however if we change this back to 2 as I've shown in the previous example it's still working so that can be this or this it's entirely up to you I always prefer this I just think it's a lot easier to to read and process in your mind because we tend to think of this as sort of maybe a perhaps a negative thing like her we're exclaiming something so doesn't equal to you know it's just a lot easier to read so let's go on to incorporating our variables up here that I've assigned earlier into this if statement now I want to say does is or is number 1 greater than number 2 so in here I'm going to change this text so I'm going to say either yes or no so yes is going to be our text we're echoing out otherwise echo no so we're using an ifelse statement now so if number one is greater than number two we say yes otherwise we say no so obviously in this case number one is equal to ten and number two is equal to nine so number one is bigger than number two so or greater than in real terms so we're echoing out the text yes now if I was to change this to smaller than so is that or less than is number one less than number two it's not so this statement here is going to evaluate to false and we say no it's not so we that's the text we echo out to the screen now what we can also do is we can say is number one greater than or equal to now if we just left this as greater than and we had 10 and 10 10 isn't greater than 10 its equal to 10 so this is still going to evaluate as false so we're reading is 10 greater than 10 and the answer is of course no it stays does now however if we incorporate an equal sign in remember when we did the not equals we're incorporating the equal sign this now reads is number 10 greater than or equal to number 2 and in fact this statement is going to evaluate to true because 10 isn't greater than but it is equal to so we get the text yes echoed and we can do exactly the same with less than or equal to we're still going to be receiving the value yes because it is still equal to as well if we were to put this as 2 this is now smaller than it's not equal to but it is smaller than so when we do refresh we still get the value Oh down okay so now these are the comparison operators we're comparing two different numbers or two different variables as it stands this may as well read obviously two and ten because we're just replacing the variables inside here but however simple they may seem they are extremely useful you'll probably find yourself using the double equals a lot if you're creating code for example if a user was to submit a password through a form you may want to check if their password is equal to maybe a preset password or a password stored in the database and therefore what we'd do is we'd do something like if we were to have a preset password I'm going to set my password up here to password so obviously quite a basic password and I might say if password so it helps if you read it out English if password equals equals password then we echo correct otherwise so else echo incorrect so the way we read this is in English would be password the variable password equals password this is the password that needs to be matched now we say if the password so the password up here is equal to password correct otherwise incorrect so refresh at the moment it's correct however if we were to change this to something else it's incorrect so you can see how on a daily basis this could come into great use and and these comparison operators can help you operate your program really really well
