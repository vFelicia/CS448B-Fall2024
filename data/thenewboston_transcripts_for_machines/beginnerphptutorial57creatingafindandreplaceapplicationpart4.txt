so okay we've accured the string position we don't need to do that anymore but we still need to keep this offset here in order for us to our program to work correctly well we don't need the line break on the end so now what we need to do in here is we need to use the substring replace function to replace from a certain part of this so we need to create a new variable or we don't actually we need to update the text variable using the dollar not the pound sign substring replace remember we're searching for the string and this is equal to text researching in the text substring replace inside the text what we're looking for is replace we're looking for the word replace at what we're not looking at the word replace but we're looking for what the user specified to replace now we need the start and the length so where are we starting at obviously we're starting at the offset that nore sorry we're starting at the string position and the length is the length of the search character so we're starting at a string position that's been beep that we've been found and we're ending three characters later for example if it was cat so now let's check this work so we'll come down here after this while loop and will echo out text so let's give this a try the cat sat on the mat we want to search for cat and we want to replace it with monkey so I'm going to click find and replace the monkey sat on the map say little clacks now we're going to type the cat sat on the cat search for cat and replace with monkey find and replace you can see it's updated both
