so today right now solve word problems using polynomials so most people find that the hardest part about word problems is setting up your equations because if you don't set up your equations correctly you won't get the right answer to the word problem so we're just gonna do some examples and focus a lot on setting up the equations because solving them is usually pretty easy so Sally has 21 coins and nickels and dimes the total is one dollar and seventyfive cents how many of each does she have so we know that her total amount and I'm gonna use in cents just because it's easier it's a hundred and seventy five so we know that we're going to be setting something equal to 175 so when we talked about doing the word problems earlier on in the series I always told you that you have to name your variables so that's what we're gonna do right now so it doesn't really matter what you call X you just have to make sure you clarify what it is so for this one I'm gonna let X be a number of nickels and then since I have 21 points total if I take 21 and subtract the number of nickels from it I'm going to get the number of dimes so the next thing that we have to remember is that this total is the total sentence not the total amount of coins so that means that we have to multiply the number of nickels by how much in nickel is worth the number of Dimes by how much a dime is worth so since a nickel is equal to five cents 5x + and a dime is worth 10 21 minus X is equal to our total number in cents one hundred and seventy five cents so now we're going to distribute this ten and you get to ten ten X is equal to 175 so we're going to combine this positive 5x and this negative 10x and we get negative 5x and I'm gonna subtract this 210 over and you get negative 35 if you divide both sides by negative five to get the X by itself you get X is equal to negative 35 divided by negative five is gonna be a positive seven okay now when we do word problems we always have to make sure that we answer the question completely so this question asks how many of each does she have so remember we got X is equal to seven and seven is the number of nickels or X is the number of nickels so she has seven nickels and 21 minus X is the number of Dimes Tsarina plug in our X 29 21 minus seven is 14 so she has seven nickels and 14 x and you can always check your work by making sure that 7 times 5 plus 14 times 10 really does equal 175 so 7 times 5 is 35 + 140 times 14 times 10 which is 140 and that you'd get 175 and since 175 does equal 175 you know that your answer is correct so we're gonna do one more example and it's kind of similar to the one we just did so Tim bought stamps for 25 cents and 29 cents he paid 7.65 cents for 28 stamps how many of each stamp did he buy so again our total is gonna be 7 $60 and I'm gonna convert it to cents just because I think it's easier to work in cents because each stamp has a value that's expressed in cents so you have to make sure that if you were to do this in dollars that you show this as a portion of a dollar so we have to name our variables again so I'm just gonna have X be equal to the number of 25 cent stamps and then since he bought 28 stamps 28 minus X is gonna be the number of 29 cent stamps so just like we did with the last problem we have to multiply each one of these equations or each one of these variables by how much each stamp cost so we have 25 cent stamps which cost 25 cents so 25 X plus 29 times 28 minus X is equal to 760 and this is gonna be a really big number so I'm gonna have to use a calculator 29 times 28 is equal to 812 29 X is equal to 76 and I combine our like terms a positive 25 X or adding it to 29 X is gonna give us a negative 4x and if I subtract this 812 over you're gonna get negative 4x is equal to a negative 52 cents you divide both sides by 4 you're going to get X is equal to 13 so again just like the last one we have to make sure we answer the question completely so the question wants to know how many of each did he buy so X is the number of 25 cent stamps so he bought 13 25 cent stamps and 28 minus X is the number of 29 cent stamps so 28 minus 13 is equal to 15 so in he bought 15 29 cents cent stamps and you can always check your work by plugging these two numbers in to this equation that you wrote right here so that's all we're gonna do with word problems today make sure you come back and check out our next lesson where we're gonna start learning about factoring and how it can help us solve equations
