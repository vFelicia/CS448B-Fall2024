so now we're connected to our database hopefully let's just change this to a database one which doesn't exist and we can see what we're returning xql DB database one that's refresh hmm okay let's try and specify this in here just start laughs for example come back refresh get still working and I guess what we're going to do at this point is we're going to specify my SQL DB and we can also say or Die we can say Conn error the error we specified before this could be anything it could just be you could just say all died without some without text so let's try and refresh and see what happens okay so could not connect the reason for this is that we've specified the databases i underscore database one when this database doesn't exist in our collection of databases so let's delete the one and see what happens you can see that now we're connected okay so this is a pretty bad way to go about things now eventually I'm going to include all this in a single file and what we can do is we can use include within PHP to include this anywhere we want to use our database so it's a lot better way to work everything out and including it means that you don't have to keep specifying the code that we've written just here so I'm going to get rid of this echo here I'm going to put at just there and I'm going to get rid of the error message that we've supplied in here okay in fact I'm going to get rid of the whole line so at the moment if we just echo out okay down here you can see that everything is working fine it's going to grow our oK we've selected we've selected everything correctly and everything is working but now what I'm going to do is I'm going to create an if statement and I'm going to say if and I'm going to copy this into without a semicolon so let's delete them to copy that into an if statement so if this returns true then we want to do something so we want to stop another if statement with a block here and we want to include this in here so I'll put this all in for now and then I'll run through what we're doing so what we're doing now is we're saying if MySQL Connect is true so if this has connected and there's no errors remember we can put an @ sign in front of these so they don't so they don't give out us an out an error if they don't so if MySQL connect blah blah blah then go inside and if MySQL connect DB then we can say ok and we're returning ok again so what happens if it doesn't connect what I'm going to do is instead of writing and just MySQL connect in just cross let me and select DB I'm going to say if not if not then in here and if at no I'm not come back and the best ways to do this would be to combine them into a single and if statement so I'm going to say if not MySQL connect and not MySQL select DB echo or we can eat in fact die so for your best rider die that's it we can just say die ok and maybe give an error so we can say era should be okay yep okay so MySQL Connect we're performing this here we're saying if this hasn't worked or we should be doing actually so or this hasn't worked kill the page and connection error so let's refresh okay everything's worked because we haven't killed with a connection error now you can say else echo connected so we can refresh we're going to remove this connected and display message because we don't know obviously we don't want to display this to the user every time we're connecting to our database now let's change something so we'll change this packet to Alex real fresh we've got an error we can obviously put our will not be there power out symbols in there so we just get our could not connect error back so now let's change this database to one but we'll change that back to root we're still getting a could not connect error so killing the page if we can't connect free the reason and if we're not then we're carrying on down to here so we're killing the page if we get an error because if you have a lot of if you've got a lot of need to access a database on your page there's no point at echo in your page if you can't connect to the database so for example if the database is down for any reason this will also produce a connection error so that's basically how to connect to your database and how to handle errors and in the correct way if for any reason you can't connect to either your database or select or connect your server or or select your database
