hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our FTP downloader so what we're going to be talking about now is deleting the a file from the FTP server now if you want to delete upload and download files in all the pins on the permissions of the user for the server so let me open up my FileZilla server here let's see here it is so you can see there's a whole bunch of activity from me connecting to it through this program if I go to my users you see I have a tutorials and none of the shared folders they can read write delete and append so make sure if you have an FTP server set up on that they have all these permissions or if you're connecting to one because if they don't have these permissions then you won't be able to use this functionality so we'll go ahead and double click on delete and let's make sure that they have actually selected a file so if lists FTP files dot selected index does not equal negative one then we'll go ahead and do this now negative one is the index that is pretty much selected if nothing on their selected and then it starts at zero and goes down to the list so we'll just type FTP downloader dot delete or FTP delete and then for the file name we're going to use list FTP files dot selected item so you may have remembered when we create a download we didn't have this if statement right here so what we need to do is add that up here so if list FTP files dot selected index does not equal negative one then we're going ahead we'll go ahead and download it so we'll just end if right here and if the selected index is negative one then we just want to tell them so we're just using else I'll type message box show please select a file error and then message box buttons dot okay and then message box icon dot error okay so let's go ahead and run this and see what happens if they try to download something that isn't there it says error please select a file and you can hear it plays that error noise so we'll go ahead and come back down into delete and it's a select index is equal to negative 1 then we're going to delete that so now I need to do is add an else so if it is then we'll just type message box top so please select a file and since we're using the same thing right here let's go ahead and copy this and paste it okay so you can see here that we've got FTP delete and we also have an option to FTP downloader dot delete directory now this lets us delete a directory in the ftp server but we're not going to worry about that right now right now we're just going to delete files so in order to make it to where they can only delete files and not whole folders we need to add an end right here so if the selected index is negative one and lists FTP files that I selected item does not contain something then we'll does not contain a period or it does contain a period then we want to let them go ahead and delete it so in order to use contains what we're gonna have to do is create a variable sodimm file as string and we'll set it equal to this right here so we'll just copy that and paste it so if the selected index is not equal to negative one and file dot contains a period then go ahead and let him delete it now we need to get rid of this right here so we'll go ahead and run this and we'll go ahead and update not update so it will go to the home directory of our server and let's delete the jackhole copy so we'll go ahead and click delete and you may be thinking well it didn't work well if we go back to the home directory you can see it's gone so what we need to do whenever they delete a file is we'll type refresh lists so whenever they delete it it's just going to update everything that is in that list box now what you could also do is add a message box so that it verifies then they want to delete the file but we're not going to do that because if they're enough to click it and they don't want it deleted then that's their own fault so we'll go ahead and go to home directory and let's go ahead and delete this right here and you can see that it's gone now and if we click a folder right here and click delete it'll say error please select a file because that is a folder and then we can open that folder and we can delete stuff in there so we'll go ahead and close out of that and so put in this code if you haven't already make sure you change the button download code and once you've done that if you understand everything and you don't have any questions move on to the next tutorial
