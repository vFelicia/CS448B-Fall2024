what is going on guys welcome to your 18th UDK tutorial and in this tutorial I'm gonna be going over something called at surface properties so during the break what I did is I used the default materials that we had built into UDK to apply all the materials I needed to to my house so now my house is covered with the materials the roof all the walls the floor etc etc so let me say this for the record whenever we're building the models in the future whenever we learn to create our own materials I'm gonna be using you know nice siding for the walls and you know maybe a nice tiled roof and maybe a nice concrete and carpet floor but for now these are the materials that we have to work with so our models may look a little funny because you know we have to use like a metal and these weird materials but just stick with me for now we're just learning the basics for now so basically what I want to be talking to you guys about surface properties now if we go ahead and fly in our house we can see that alright whenever we apply a material it kind of sets up the material by default the size of the material how it's placed on our walls but there are a couple things that we may want to change specifically how it's aligned and maybe we want to rotate it or something like that well in order to adjust the details of our surface we need to adjust surface properties so let's first and foremost take a look at this you see how this floor kind of doesn't align with this piece right here and if we go ahead even though these are the same surfaces or excuse me the same materials the tiles aren't really aligning and it doesn't really look really pretty so let's go ahead and fix that first and foremost so in order to open up your surface properties window go ahead and hit view and then you see an option for surface properties or you can go ahead and hit f5 and no popup so now with this selected you can go ahead and adjust all the properties of the surface so for example if we want to align all these floors what we can do is we can hold ctrl to select this one and this one and in order to align them all let me go ahead and zoom in on this and look what happens whenever I hit a line go ahead and hit planner or planner however a heck you say it and this pretty much means Allina in the same plane so go ahead and take an O of this piece right here I'm gonna hit apply and everything snaps into perfect alignment so now this piece is lined with this piece and also this piece is aligned with this piece so again any time you want to lie align the same material type just go ahead and select all that material and hit planar alignment and hit apply pretty cool huh so now that that's line we're gonna notice a few more things first of all whenever we tiled this floor whoever we hired didn't do a very good job because we want this tile right here to bob up against the wall exactly as you notice it's kind of getting cut off and it's like half the tile is being the line with the floor and we really don't want that so what we can do is we can use this pan property and we probably want to make sure all of our surfaces are selected and pan them all at once so go ahead and control control and now let's go ahead to his corner and pan them appropriately so what pan means is pretty much move they probably should just named it move but hey if I was making it I would have done it so the U and V pretty much means horizontal is U and vertical is V is just two different directions so go ahead and if we want to pan this four units vertically or excuse me horizontally go ahead and hit a four four four or four until we get exactly but it up against the wall now say we hit 16 by accident and we want to go back in order to move it in the reverse direction just go ahead and hold shift on your keyboard and now while holding it shift it pans in the reverse direction so go ahead and make that but up against the wall directly and that looks pretty good right there and now I'm going to be the doing the same thing with V so go ahead and have four and one and there we go so now our tile is butted up against the wall exactly how we want it to so using the pan what we can do is we can move the material and using the alignment we could align up the material simple enough so now our floor is looking pretty good I think I'll leave it at that so now let's go ahead and move on to the roof and I'll teach you guys about some more surface properties so as you can see as my roof material I chose this kind of weird looking I was going for kind of a metal roof design look and this was the closest thing I had to it so let's go ahead and notice a few things first of all this material right here and this material right there is actually the same material and you might be kind of confused at first because this material doesn't look like it has those metal strips on it while this one does well let's go ahead and fix that right now and get everything aligned go ahead and select this one and hold control just select that and if I Phi over on this side I'm actually going to do the same thing hold control so now I have my entire roof selected and don't forget all of those are the same material so let me go ahead and get a good angle for what I'm about to show you guys the very first thing I want to do is make sure everything's aligned so I'm gonna go to planar align and hit apply now you can see a little bit of change but it really doesn't solve my problem of having these metal strips aligned with these metal strips so what I'm gonna do is even though everything is aligned it's rotated in a different direction this is rotated horizontally and this is rotated vertically pretty much so go ahead and select this one and also go ahead and hold down control and select this one and if I go ahead and hit rotation and 90 degrees everything is gonna line up nice and neat so that sort of rotation comes in handy you can rotate different materials depending on how you want it so I'm gonna go ahead and actually I have two more things to do I want to fix this roof great right here and I also want to mess with the inside walls a little bit right here so what I'm gonna be doing is I'm gonna be saving that for the next tutorial so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video
