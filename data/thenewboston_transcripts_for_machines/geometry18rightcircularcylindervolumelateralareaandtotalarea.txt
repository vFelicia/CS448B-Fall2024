so today we're going to move on from talking about prisms to talking about the right circular cylinder now we're going to go over volume lateral area and total area of a right circular cylinder today so volume of a right circular cylinder is equal to PI R squared times height which makes sense because if you think about it the area of a the area of a circle is equal to 2 PI R squared or excuse me it's just equal to PI R squared and then if we multiply it by the height it'll give us volume so the volume of this cylinder is equal to PI radius squared times 12 so this is equal to this is equal to 49 pi times 12 and those are kind of big so I'm going to put those in the calculator 49 times 12 so 588 PI I'm just going to leave the pi like that so that we give it more exact answer okay so now we're going to talk about lateral area so when we find lateral area of a cylinder we're finding the area of this part that wraps around the cylinder the soup can that wraps around or the soup label that wraps around the soup can so that area corresponds to this rectangle right here and if you look this height of this ring rectangle is going to equal to the height of this cylinder so that's why it's 8 right here the width of this rectangle is going to equal the circumference of the circle because if we unwrapped it we'd have a width of 2 pi R so that's why when we find lateral area its equal to 2 PI R times height so the lateral area for this is equal to 2 pi times our radius which is 4 times our height which is 8 so 2 times 4 is 8 times 8 is 64 so this is 64 pi centimeters squared this area is always centimeters squared all right now we have one last thing we're going to learn its total area and we find when we find the total area of a cylinder we are finding the surface area of this entire can we're finding all of this that's why when we find our total area we take our lateral area which is 2 pi RH plus 2 PI R squared this part gives us the area of both of these bases or I'm sorry this part gives the area of the bases this part gives us the lateral area and when we add them together we get total area so we have 2 pi times R which is 5 halves times 13 plus 2 PI R squared so 2 times 5 halves just leaves us with five because the two can choose cancel so we have five times 13 times pi plus 2 pi if we square this fraction remember we square the top and the bottom so we get 25 over 4 so five times 13 is 65 pi plus if we cancel these we get plus 25 halves pi and I'm going to get a common denominator so if I get a common denominator this is going to be 130 PI over 2 and this is 25 PI over 2 so then we get a hundred and fiftyfive PI halves inches squared because area is always squared units so that's all we're going to do with the right cylinder today but make sure you come back and watch the next video where we're going to go into some formulas for pyramids
