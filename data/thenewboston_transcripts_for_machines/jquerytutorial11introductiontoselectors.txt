hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg and this is a video tutorial for the new boston in this tutorial i'm going to be talking a bit about selectors in jquery why we use selectors and then i'm going to give a quick example of using a selector now selectors are basically a way to select and match a set of elements in on your page so for example if we have a paragraph tag here i've already set up a script called selectors js which i have open in my text editor essentially we have a paragraph here what I could then do is just type some text in here when we are in our selectors j/s file we've already looked at referencing objects or elements by their ID and their class however if you wanted to select something for example all paragraphs tags on a page you would use this notation P so now when we perform an operation such as P click like an event handler every paragraph on the page will now have this event handler attached to it so we select elements particularly on a page for example we reference them by their ID so for example P ID equals para we would then use a notation hash and para so we're only creating this event handler for this paragraph now there are many many other event handlers in jQuery and over the next few videos or the next set of videos I'm going to be taking you through some of the event handlers some of the more useful event handlers and we're also going to be looking in the first video coming up next how to select all elements on a page I'm also going to count all elements on a page as well as a short example so basically selectors in jQuery are a way to match a set of elements and then perform a specific operation on them or retrieve a value from them
