and inside of there we are going to write something in a moment now what we've done here is we've taken the element that we've specified in the function and returned or placed it inside of here usually we would do something like pee but because we've already fed in the element we can just substitute the variable name in there now the part of the CSS that we need to actually to get from the the func pair the paragraph is the font size so we can simply specify in here font size let's go ahead and alert this current variable out and see what we get when we click on one of these links so we're going to click on one of these links and we're going to be returned with the font size currently set for these paragraphs so at the moment you can see it shows 16px now we need to find a way to add or subtract a value from this number 16 in order to make the text smaller or the text bigger and the problem is that we've got this px in the way so what we can do is inside of our text editor we can actually wrap this whole piece of code just here inside the pass into function and this will essentially it will essentially cast this value to an integer so we're still going to alert out this current variable however now that we've used past int it will remove the px part of the string so now we have an integer of 16 so now we can start adding or subtracting values on depending on which button we've pressed so down here we'll get rid of alert and we'll create an if statement to perform a calculation based on whether smaller or bigger has been fed into this function so I'm going to say if size is equal to remember size is the text we fed in here smaller or bigger if it's equal to smaller we need to perform one block otherwise if the size is equal to bigger we want to perform a different block so inside of the first block we want to create a new variable and this is going to be called new underscore size and that's going to be equal to current minus one we're going to one pixel every time we could put two I suppose that would make it a bit better to use now if the text size has been specified as bigger ie bigger link has been selected we need to again create a new variable called new size and this is going to be equal to current but this time plus two so if we are clicking the smaller link we're calling this function with the elements that we want to change the size of and we want to make them smaller so when we come in here we get the current size cost to an int and then we check and perform a calculation based on whether it's smaller or bigger that we want to go and that's obviously minus 2 and plus 2 okay so after this if statement we want to change the element CSS remember again we're using the element that we fed in which is the paragraph tags or paragraph element and we want to change the font size in here so this is going to be font size now we want to change this to the new size but then we want to also include the textural px on the end of this so just putting new size here won't actually work because we need to then append on px so now it conforms to CSS okay so let's just run through this quickly on index dot PHP we have these two links smaller and bigger when we click smaller or when we click bigger we have to event handlers here this one here and this one here if we click smaller we send the P to the change size function and we give it the value of smaller for this size variable here and the same with bigger we work out the current size we then check with we want to say smaller or bigger and we either if it's smaller or + if it's bigger then we reapply the new size plus the PX that we removed with this past int function back to the font size CSS style okay so let's go ahead and test this out now we've got the text as it normally is let's go ahead and click bigger you can see that the font size is automatically being being increased by two pixels we can do this again and again and again to make these bigger now you'll notice that it's only changing the size of these paragraphs because the selector that we used was four paragraphs and again we can go ahead and make these smaller and smaller and smaller until they're essentially unreadable and gone so that's how to use selectors inside of a function we've passed an element through a function and this is a nifty little piece of code that will let you increase and decrease the font size on a page
