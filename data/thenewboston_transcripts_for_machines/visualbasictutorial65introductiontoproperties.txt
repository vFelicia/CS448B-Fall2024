hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be learning about properties now what properties do is it's a way of encapsulating data within a class now let's say you have a uh variable that's declared private and it's in another class and you cannot access it what you can do is you can use a property to get that variable and see what it is without directly accessing the data now what this does is let's say you make a property you've got a variable you don't want to change that variable but you want to access it indirectly and have it stored in that property you can create a property get the variable and then if you want to you can set the variable um using that same property so here is the program that we worked on in the last tutorial now I you can see I've changed it a bit here um go ahead and open your toolbox and add a date time picker right here drag that over there and drag a label set the label text to State not initialized and set the name to label State as you can see right here set the datetime Picker name to datetime Picker hour or dtp hour and set the format to time and you can go ahead and resize it some if you want and here is that enumeration that we created last time I added some stuff to it we've got a sleep waking up school lunch home and programming so we'll go ahead and just create a variable of the data type day action so private State as day action okay now what we're going to do is we're going to create our property so we're going to do this by using either the public or private keyword at first we're going to use private so we'll type private and then the keyword property and we have to have a name for it so we'll just call it our and you use empty parameters and you're going to have to specify a data type for it so we'll just make it an integer and if you go ahead and press enter um and type end property okay so now what we need to you do is use what's called a a get statement so the way we do this is we start by typing get and you see when we press enter we get an init and you can see it adds a set um function for us now properties are similar to classes even though I haven't taught you those yet um but they're a lot more efficient you can't do as much but they're more efficient ient and when you want when you can use them use those instead of classes um you'll understand more when we get into classes okay but with a get what we're going to do is we're going to get a variable so we're just going to get the current hour that is displayed on this date time picker so what we do is we type return dtp hour then you type Dot and then you type value and it says gets to set the date time value assigned to the control. hour so what this is going to do is it's just going to get the current hour that is um displayed on the datetime Picker now we could use when we use return it sets property hour equal to um the hour that is on selected on dtp hour we could also type instead of return we could type hour equals dtp hour. Val . hour so we'll just go ahead and put return and now what we're going to do is we have to create a set function you can see it's already created for us and we've got by Val value as integer so whenever somebody calls set they're going to have to give it a value so what we're going to do is we're going to set the date using the hour pass to this property so if they give us an hour We're going to going to set um that hour so we'll just go ahead and type dtp hour. value so what this is going to do is it's going to set the value of dtp hour and we're just going to set that equal to and this is a little introduction to um date and time functions that are built into Visual Basic we'll go more into depth more in depth with those later but for now we're just going to go ahead and create uh a couple little things with it so we'll type new date you can see it says represents an instant in time typically expressed as a date and time of day so date is going to take several arguments so first we're going to set the year so to get the current year we're just going to go ahead and type now and what now is is it's returns to date value containing the current date and time according to your system so whatever their system says it's going to get the year for that so now do year so now what we can do is we can get the month so we'll type now do month and you can see right here that it's giving us a new date and we have three Arguments for this year month and day and we're going to be using a little bit more than that so now we can set the day so we'll type now. day which will give us the um the day of the week or not the day of the week the day in the month so now what we're going to do is we are going to set the current hour and you re you remember that they passed value to the set function so we're just going to go ahead and put value here which is the hour as an integer and we'll set the minute equal to zero and the second equal to zero also so we created a property we got the current hour that is being displayed on the U date time picker then we have a set function that will set the date time picker hour to the specific value that we pass to it so um properties are a lot more confusing than enumerations as I said enumerations might be a little confusing to you in the last tutorial but um we'll talk more about these in the next tutorial and um so if you don't understand this don't practice it yet um you will understand gradually as we go along so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next video
