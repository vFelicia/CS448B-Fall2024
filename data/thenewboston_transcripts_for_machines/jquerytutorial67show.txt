hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in the last video we looked at the hide function in jQuery the effect in jQuery and we successfully hid an element by clicking a button so we clicked hide and this text disappeared we then used a callback function to tell the user the the element had been hidden and I explained a bit about why we were why we would use callback functions in this tutorial we're gonna look similarly at show so if we go ahead and change hide here to show nothing will happen at the moment because the element is all automatically shown by default so when we show the element we don't really show anything because it's already been shown now this show function applies to elements that have a visibility of nothing so for example if we were to come into our div here and type style equals and create some inline CSS we could actually hide this element by default so when the page loads we can hide this element by default so for example I would write displaynone now when I let's just modify this button as well so it says show if I was to refresh now when I click show this element is shown and then we have our callback function with element hidden but obviously we've shown our element that was just wiper in here so it's just changed that to shown okay so what happens if you want to eradicate the use of CSS but automatically make specific elements hidden by default and then be able to show them now in sideeffects jeaious we can use the document.ready functionality to hide any elements we want and then allow this click event to actually reshow them so let's go ahead and say document dot ready and inside here we need a function we need our function block and we're going to pull that down so we can write our code in here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to choose the element a underscore div you remember using the hash the dollar sign outside of these parentheses and I'm gonna say dot hide and that's it so we've automatically hidden this when the page is loaded so we're not using any CSS styling but we're using jQuery to handle the fact that we're hiding this element once the document is ready what we can then do is use the button to catch the event show this slow linear and then use the callback function to alert that the element has been shown let's go ahead to our browser and test this out now you can automatically see that the element has been hidden despite the fact that we haven't used any CSS to do so so when we go ahead and click show we get the same functionality we have some text inside here and then we have element shown so the two functions hide and show both both work in opposite of each other where the hide actually sets the element visibility to none and the show removes this element or removes this visibility set to none so this is a problem because obviously we can only show and hide with one set of function however there is a toggle function which we'll be looking at a bit later on that allows you to simultaneously hide and show elements
