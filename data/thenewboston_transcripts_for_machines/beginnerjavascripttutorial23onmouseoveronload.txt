what's going on guys welcome to your twentythird tutorial and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys a little more about event handlers so before we learn that you can take a basic event handler such as the onclick event handler and you could place it somewhere such as in a forum button but now what I want to show you guys is there are more event handlers than that basic on click and also you can place them in different locations you're not only limited to form buttons you can place them in links and actually some places where you probably never even think of so let's go ahead and make one type of event handler and this is called the on mouseover event handler and this gets called whenever you mouse over an element for example you don't have to click it you don't have to you know highlight it as soon as your mouse hovers over it that's when it gets called so as you know we could do it with a form button but we already did that so let's go ahead and try something new and let's go ahead and make a link and might as well make it to the greatest website of all time the New Boston comm and go ahead and might as well and that and let's go ahead and write some text like hover over me explanation point because we really want to emphasize this so what I like to do is save it launch it in Chrome and click it make sure our link works all right we're good to go so far so now we have a basic link on the screen so now let's go ahead and add that on mouseover event handler so just like before like the onclick we add it kind of as attribute and that's on mouse over with the M and the O capitalized now as your value we can set it equal to JavaScript code so let's just go ahead and I'm just going to make basic alert boxes um you can do different things but a an alert box is just easiest to see what's going on with this example so alerts and then just go ahead and write something stupid like game time because I feel like playing call of duty right now so let's go ahead and save this and we refresh it and check it out I'm not going to click it and I'm not going to highlight it I'm just going to scroll have my mouse go over it and as soon as it hovers over it an alert box pops up that says game time so that is the beauty of the onmouseover you don't have to click it as soon as you hover over it maybe it should be called on hover over but it isn't I don't name them so that's the basics of that so now that I mentioned onmouseover I feel compelled to mention this one on Mouse out and this is a little bit different it's whenever you are hovering over a link and you don't click it but you take your mouse away from it then that's what this is get called so let's go ahead and put gametime be like hey come back so now let's go ahead and save it and see what happens again no clicking involved here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take my mouse hover over it nothing happens still but whenever we take it away that's when that event handler is going to be called in again that's on Mouse out whenever you take your mouse away from an element so it says hey come back then you go ahead and click ok so technically if you had a web page and you had like 200 links on it you could add one of these to every link and then you can create the most annoying web page ever but who would want to do that if you do then go ahead and send me a link and I'll check it out but anyways let's go ahead and get rid of that for now and actually might as well go ahead and get rid of this entire link because I want to talk to you guys about a different subject now that we know that you can add event handlers to different elements on a web page I'm going to show you guys one place where you probably wouldn't think that you could add event handlers and that's in the body tag itself so go ahead and actually before you get to that just add some text on the screen yadda yadda yadda and save it and check it out our web page loads and we have some basic text on the screen just like that so we can't just add any event hand alert to the body like we can't add on click or onmouseover there are specific event handlers that you can answer your body tags and one of those is called on load and this is going to be called if I hit my caps lock this is going to get called whenever your webpage is done loading so let's go ahead and just make an basic alert and make something that says like your webpage or website has loaded explanation point die so everything wrong this wrong this right this right this wrong perfect so let's go ahead and save this run it and I'll show you guys what happens our webpage loads and when it's done loading it just says your website has loaded dee dee good enough okay so you might be thinking I know it looks like everything's happening at the same time but if you had a slow motion camera you can see that your webpage loads and then the JavaScript pops up so that's why it's a little bit different than saying this all right buck you're going to do that then why wouldn't you just have the JavaScript right here well sometimes you don't want to run JavaScript as soon as your webpage starts loading you want to run it as soon as everything is complete and right now I'm just making alert boxes in it's not really useful example but later on I'll show you guys why it would be useful to load a bit of code after your website has loaded so now that I showed you guys the onload alert or excuse me the onload event handler um you guys are probably thinking all right then is there on unload Wow I definitely have my caps lock and I definitely typed everything around so on unload there we go so now let's go ahead and see what this does but instead of your website has loaded because that doesn't make sense anymore just go ahead and write like goodbye so the on unload event gets called whenever the user exits a web page and they can do this by clicking a link and it takes them to another web page or even if they try to close out of their browser this code is going to be is going to run before it lets them go so let's go ahead and I already save this refresh it and it says goodbye so let me go ahead and the reason it said goodbye already is because whenever I refreshed it I left that webpage so check it out so now I have a web page with that unload I cannot talk tonight on unload function already in there so whenever I try to close out of my browser it's going to stop me before and it's going to say goodbye so let's go ahead and close out of this and it says goodbye before it lets me leave so click OK and now let's go ahead and just watch it in chrome again see it loads perfectly like that because we haven't left it yet so again whenever I try to close out of my browser it says all right before you go I just want to say goodbye I miss you farewell so now you can see the basics of you know different types of event handlers not only are there different kinds of event handlers like on click on Mouse over on Mouse out and then your loads but you can also begin to see that we can stick them in different locations we're not only limited to buttons or links and we're not even limited to the body but in the upcoming tutorials I'm going to show you guys all the different types in places and why they're useful and we're going to be getting more in depth because this is one of the main concepts behind JavaScript and now we can start to see we're beginning to build smarter and more interactive web pages but for now that's all you get so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
