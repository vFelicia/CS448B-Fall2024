hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to look at the HTML attribute in jQuery now the HTML attribute will do two things the first use of it is to take HTML text or HTML code I guess from a particular element and the second will actually input text into a particular element so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create a space that we're going to retrieve some text from so I'm going to create a paragraph just here and I'm going to write some text in here now I'm going to reference this paragraph with a unique ID just so we can reference it when we create our external javascript file I'm going to call this just text so now we can actually grab the text from this paragraph using the HTML attribute and we reference it using text so the next thing I'm going to do is create a blank paragraph down here and I'm going to give this an ID of copy and you'll notice that I haven't actually applied any text into this paragraph now I'm going to go ahead and create a button and this is going to allow me to copy this text into here so I'm going to create a type of button and I'm going to give this a value of copy and we also need to give this an ID as well so we can apply an event handler to it so we know when the button has been pressed so I'm just going to call this copy now in fact I'm not because I've already called this copy I'm going to call this copy underscore button okay so now that we've done this we need to create an external javascript file we've already included jQuery however we need to go ahead create a new file and save this inside j/s the j/s directory so I'm going to call this HTML Jas okay so now that I've created the HTML j/s I need to go ahead and include this on the page so I'm going to create another script tag and in that script tag their type is again text forward slash JavaScript and the source is j/s /h TM ljx so now that HTML j/s is included on our page we can start to create an event handler for this button retrieve the text from here and then place the text inside here so let's go over to HTML j/s and start to create our event handler so use a dollar sign and inside of this we need to reference what we want to check for an event and this is copy button it's our button on our page so I'm just going to type copy underscore button now just in the meantime I'm going to come over to my browser and refresh to see what we have we have this copy button the paragraph here and then there's another paragraph underneath that would be copying the text too so copy button click so essentially when the button has been clicked we want to perform a function inside of here we create a function as normal with parentheses and then square from our curly prevent parentheses as well we're going to bring this down and then inside here we need to perform this specific operation which is to take the text from this paragraph and then copy it into here so the first thing we need to do is retrieve this text here and we've called this ID text so we can essentially create a new variable in JavaScript and I'm just going to call this text and that's going to be equal to and again we're referencing an element on the page and this is text dot HTML okay so now the HTML function has taken the value inside of this paragraph so the text variable in JavaScript will now equal some text in here what we can then do is use the HTML function again to actually place the reference of this text inside of this copy paragraph so if we come down a line and we just simply go ahead and reference copy and then say dot HTML texts so let's just run over this again we check for the clicking of the button we store the text that's currently in the text paragraph the first paragraph and we store it in a variable called text we then apply the HTML to this text button in here okay oh this text paragraph sorry so let's go ahead and test this out when I click copy you'll see this duplicated the data so because we're using the HTML function this means that we can actually copy HTML text from one paragraph to another in this case obviously there are better uses for this for example data might have retrieved from a database you might want to put into a paragraph a span a div but if I was to for example enclose this text in a strong tags you'll notice that when we carry out the same operation it does actually carry the tags over as well so the HTML function in jQuery is used to grab HTML data from one area and then you can also then go ahead and put HTML content into another area
