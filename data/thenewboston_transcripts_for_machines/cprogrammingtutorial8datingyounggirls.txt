what is going on guys welcome to your eighth C++ tutorial I think this is a tutorial but I could be wrong if I am who cares anyways welcome to another C++ tutorial and in this tutorial what we're going to be covering is building functions with return values sounds awesome and that's because it is awesome because in the past we created functions that you know maybe we gave us some information and it printed something out on the screen and that's all it really did but these functions with the return values we're going to give us some information and then it's actually going to make a calculation actually do something useful and return to us an answer so you know instead of just doing its own little thing and printing now on the screen or doing whatever we needed to do these are actually going to be useful functions that we can use and it gives us an answer that we can you know set to a variable maybe maybe we can print that answer around the screen so if this sounds kind of confusing just me talking once I get typing typing some code and everything is going to make sense so you're going to ask all right Bucky since you need to make a function that actually does something what kind of function are you going to build well I was racking through my brain and I was like well maybe I can build a function that converts feet to centimeters that's kind of useful or maybe I can build a function that converts like kilograms the grams that would be a nice demonstration but you know all this scientific crap no one really uses in real life so I'm going to build a function that you are definitely going to need in your lifetime and that is this you're going to need to know based on your age how young of girls you can date and here is the formula for this and guys if you didn't know this trust me I didn't know this up until a little bit ago what you do is you take your age divide it by two and add seven and whatever that number is that's the age of girls you're allowed to date no younger than that so let's go ahead and the first thing we need to type is what kind of answer do we want back well we want the girls age back that's our goal so that of course is an integer and go ahead and name your function anything you want I'm just going to name my date calc for a date calculator and now what kind of information are we going to be giving into the program well we're going to be giving it our age which is of course an integer Noah have no like I'm 23 and a half crap none of that now I'll cheat so anyways go ahead and put in my age as that variable and then go ahead and you're ready for the function body but before you do remember from the last tutorial and check this out when if you rightclick there's not a copy thing right there that's kind of annoying so code blocks and you fix that anyways go ahead and paste this get rid of my age in int and this is what the function prototype is going to look for this int that's what we're getting back date calculator or calc that's the name and we're going to be passing in an integer as our age so anyways anytime we use the my age variable that's going to be you know we're going to pass it in a number and it's going to convert it to the variable my age so check this out we need one variable for the girl's age that we didn't create yet so let's go ahead and do that int girl's age and set this equal to this oh crap someone's calling me on skype I'll just you know I'll just say I was sleeping or something suckers and let's go ahead and do this my who the heck hire Indians are you serious quit talking here right now yeah I don't I don't think I'm going to explain that one anyways moving on my age divided by two plus actually it's laying that up plus seven so here's what's going to happen whenever we call this function we're going to enter an age like 23 because that's how old I am or let's say 24 for simplicity when I enter 24 it's going to say alright 24 is now equal to my age so take 24 divide it by 2 and add 7 and whatever answer you get from that set it equal to the variable girl's age and then once you have that calculated go ahead and return girls age as our final answer so it does all this calculations and finally what we get back is the value of girls age which should be like a 1819 one of those things sounds appropriate for me so let's go ahead and what we need to do now is call this method so we can go ahead and you know just throw in a number like 23 bolt let's go ahead and build this program where we give the user an opportunity to enter their own age so we need a variable for H so let's go ahead and put int age and now let's go ahead and give them a little prompt on the screen see out enter your age and it with a semicolon and now what we need to do is give them a way to enter their age and set it equal to the variable age so CIN remember that age so now what we have is whenever they press a number or type a number on the screen you should say and press Enter whatever a number they type is going to be equal to the variable age so and tighten that up actually there we go that looks like nice nice to me so now what we need to do is we need to take whatever number they entered and we need to pass it in as the argument for this function so how do we do that go ahead and call your function and date calc just like that and that number they entered is going to be passed in as an argument but what we want to do is this we want to print out the answer on the screen so let me go ahead and run this real quick and show you guys a quick example and then once everything works hopefully I didn't get in errors I'll see in a second nope I'll talk you guys through how it works one last time so I'm going to enter my age 23 press ENTER and the answer is 18 so I'm allowed to date girls that are 18 years old no younger than that so let's go ahead and run this again and just drive you know so like let's try something more like how young is a 76 year old man a lot date 45 so any girl younger than 45 he's not allowed today so you know that's how it works but this is how it technically works so we got our function prototype in our front function body so now that you guys know what those two are here is how the program is going to work step by step your operating system is going to call your main method right here the first thing that's going to do is recognize all right I got a blank page that you're going to enter as an integer this is just text on the screen so the user knows what's going on and this is saying all right whenever the user enters a number store it as the variable age and now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take that age which is you know 23 or something and I'm going to pass it into the function date calc so with this right here whenever it comes across this line of code it's going to shoot down to here and use the function date calc so it's going to take that 23 which was age before and now convert it into my age and now it's going to do some calculations to it so 23 divided by 2 is 11 that's how you round in computer you kind of forget about the decimal place we'll worry about that later so I know it's eleven plus seven which is 18 and I'm going to take that 18 and store it in the variable girls age simple enough and now once I have that answer I'm going to do is return the number 18 so basically this entire statement right here is the exact same thing is the number 18 so by calling this you get the value 18 and by calling it with you know 76 you get 45 depending on what number you enter is what you get back does that make sense to you it makes sense to me but anyways so then all it does of course is see out which is pretty much means just print it on the screen and by the way in the last couple tutorials I saw comma on one of my videos that they didn't quite understand what this line of code meant instead of system pause what CN get means is basically wait for the user to enter a character on the screen they can press any button just wait for any character get means get character and see in of course you know that means so that's what that means there's a real quick explanation that basically the same thing is system pause because if we just comment this out and run our program check this out whoa it actually works without it that's pretty good but anyways throw that in there anyways because some compilers aren't going to work without it so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe if you have any questions ask me on my forum check my new website and I'll see you guys later
