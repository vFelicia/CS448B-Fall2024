okay so today we're going to talk about solving equations using multiplication and division so just like with addition and subtraction in order to undo what's been done to your variable you have to do the opposite so here we have 2 x = 12 so since 2 is being multiplied by X the only way to undo it and get X by itself is to V to divide both sides by two CU this will cancel and you get X is equal to 6 now when you're being um multiplied by a fraction you're going to multiply by the reciprocal of the fraction so so when we multiply by the reciprocal which is just the fraction flipped we're going to get four to cancel out with four three to cancel out with three this negative to become positive and all we're going to be left with is y equals and we have to multiply by the reciprocal on this side two and look you can reduce by threes 5 * 4 20 so now now we're going to do some examples okay so here we're taking 7 and multiplying it by y so in order to undo it we're going to divide by S excuse me 7 divide by7 and we get y this because remember a negative divided by a negative gives us a positive a positive divided a negative is going to give us a negative it's going to be 4 so over here you might think that we've already solved this equation but whenever you have a negative out front you want to pretend that it's that it's actually written like this 1x = 17 so you still have to divide by that 1 to get X is equal to 7 so down here we have two fractions and I'm I think the easiest way to solve this is to cross multiply but I'm going to show the show you the other way you could solve this as well so we're going to cross multiply and we're going to get 3 Y is = to 12 and we're going to divide both sides by 3 and get Y is equal to4 so the other way we could have done it is taking the re reciprocal of six or 1 16 which is 6 multiplied it by both sides and we would have gotten Y is equal to this and we could divide we could reduce by threes and 2 * 2 is 4 so either way you can do it but I'm I think cross multiplying is easier just because you already know how to do that so we have a over 5 is equal to 6 in order to undo this divided 5 we're going to multiply by 5 over 1 this cancels we get left with a is equal to 6 * 5 over 1 which is 30 so that's all we're going to do with multiplication and division today but make sure you come back where we're going to take what we learned today and in the lesson before and use it to solve combined equations which just means that they have multiplication addition and subtraction and division all in one equation so make sure you come back and watch that
