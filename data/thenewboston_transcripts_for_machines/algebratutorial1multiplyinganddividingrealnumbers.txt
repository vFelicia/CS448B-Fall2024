okay so today for our first lesson in our new algebra series we're going to talk about multiplying and dividing real numbers right the first thing you need to know is that multiplication and division are what's called inverse functions that means to undo multiplication you divide and to undo division you multiply so when we have a positive number times another positive number we're always gonna get a positive number so when we have 4 times 6 we're gonna get positive 24 when you have a positive number times a negative number you're always gonna get a negative number because if you take a negative number and multiply it a positive amount of times you're still gonna have a negative amount of something so for this negative 4 times 6 gives you negative 24 now this works if it's a negative times a positive number so 4 was positive and 6 was negative it would still give you negative 24 and if we have a negative number at times a negative number we're gonna get a positive number so if you think 2 of the same sign positive positive or negative negative is always gonna give you a positive it's only when you have two opposite signs positive and negative are you ever gonna get a negative answer so negative 4 times negative 6 would be positive 24 so now we're gonna do some multiplying with numbers and we're gonna work on how you multiply fractions so for this we're gonna take a negative times a positive so negative 10 times 3 gives us negative 30 then we're gonna take negative 30 and multiply it by negative 4 so since we have two of the same sign we're gonna get a positive number so this becomes positive 120 now multiplication has a property which is called communitive now because multiplication is commutative that means you can multiply numbers and enter any order you want and you'll still get the same thing because if I had taken 3 times negative 4 I already got negative 12 and then negative 12 times negative 10 would still give me positive 120 I can take these numbers and write them however I want and I'll still get the same number when I multiply okay so right here we have 3/8 x 5 6 so when we multiply fractions what we're gonna do is we multiply across the top and across the bottom so on the top we have 3 times 5 and then over 8 times 6 so 3 times 5 is 15 8 times 6 is 48 so our answer is potted positive 15 48 now here we have what's called an improper fraction or excuse me we have fractions written properly but in order to multiply them we have to write them as an improper fraction so what we do is we're gonna take 6 and write it as something over 2 so we're gonna take 6 and multiply it by 2 which is 12 and then we have 1 up here so we add 1 so our new fraction is gonna be 13 halves we're gonna do the same thing here we're gonna take 4 multiply it by 3 get 12 plus 1 gives us 13 so this is times 13 thirds so now what we're gonna do is the same thing we're going to multiply it atop the cross and atop the bottom so we have 13 times 13 over 2 times 6 and when we do that we get a hundred and 69 over 2 times 3 which is 6 okay so for our last example we have negative 2/3 x 4 now the any number divided by 1 is gonna stay the same number so when we multiply these fractions we're gonna write 4 as 4 over 1 that way we can multiply across the top and bottom so this becomes and since we have opposite signs multiplying we know it's gonna be negative and we're gonna have 2 times 4 which is 8 over 3 times 1 which is 3 now if you can write this fraction as negative 8 over 3 or 8 over negative 3 it doesn't matter or you could just write it out front as negative 8/3 it doesn't matter it cuz either way you do it you're gonna end up with a negative number so now we're gonna move on to division and the same rules apply when you have a positive divided by a positive you're gonna get a positive so 50 divided by 2 is gonna get you 25 positive divided by a negative or a negative divided by a positive is gonna get you a negative so 50 divided by negative 2 is gonna be negative 25 a negative divided negative and you're gonna get a positive so negative 50 divided by negative 2 is gonna get you positive 25 so now we're gonna do some practice with this now when we divide real numbers what we do is we are going to write this as a fraction with this which is the number this is the divisor what we're dividing by and then we're going to write it to get our dividend which is what we get after we divide so we're gonna get negative 24 and went and when we show division we write it as over 3 and then we reduce so 3 goes into negative 24 8 times so we get negative 8 as our answer when we divide fractions it's a little different we use this rule which is called keep change flip so first you keep the first term exactly how it is so negative 1/2 then you change your sign to multiplication and then you flip your fraction so that we get 8/3 and then you multiply across the top and across the bottom like you would with multiplication so then we would get negative 8 over 6 and we always want to reduce our fractions so both of these two goes into evenly so we'd get negative 3 over 2 but there's also this little trick what you can do is before you multiply you can reduce and you reduce diagonally so 2 goes into 8 how many times well 2 goes into 2 once 2 goes into 8 3 times and if you were to multiply that across you would get oh excuse me I made a mistake right here sorry 2 goes into 8 4 times and I made this mistake over here negative 4 and then third says what she should have gotten okay so when we have a decimal sometimes it's always sometimes as easy as to write it as a fraction so we're going to take 12 and we're gonna multiply it by 0.5 which is the same as 1/2 because we used our keep change flip rule our keep change and I forgot to flip this because this is 1/2 so we flip it and get 2 so 12 divided by 0.5 is 24 so we're gonna do the same thing over here and we're gonna write them as two fractions so this is 1/2 divided by 1/10 and then you're gonna keep change flip and if you multiply across on top you get 10 over 2 which reduces to 5 now that's all we're gonna do with multiplication and division but make sure you come back and watch your video where we talk about order of operations
