uh so let's go ahead and just analyze how we could probably move this uh around uh so it removes it and essentially the problem that we have is that um every time the mouse is moved IE for every pixel that's moved uh what we were doing is let's me just bring this back here get rid of that one uh is we're removing the title attribute and then again we're grabbing the title attribute uh so this is uh sort of a bit of a problem um so what we want to do is we want to go ahead uh and make sure that we're removing this uh but then we're sort of like reinstating it so we're re sort of displaying it again so we could go ahead and do this title there so essentially then what we're doing is we're hiding it but then we're showing our div and then we're putting it back again so hopefully this works I'm sure it will I don't know it hasn't uh that's a shame uh so let's go ahead and see what we can do uh and the problem that we face as well is we can't move this up here uh or it will take uh all um it will take you know sort of like all the a tags um you know in its place uh so let me just have a think about how we could probably do this okay so uh yeah I think what we could actually do is we could use the mouse in um the mouse in event handler uh to to grab the title um and then hide the um attribute as well so let's go ahead and just maybe uh pen this onto the end of here so we'll say mouse in and then function and let's go ahead and go ahead and get rid of this title so we'll say this do attribute title uh it's nothing uh so let's see if this helps it hasn't so um mouse mouse over I think maybe no not at all okay so um a let's have I think about this I guess this is extremely annoying uh but in terms of learning uh I guess it could be quite good uh let's just say uh maybe Focus we're setting the attribute title to nothing um but yeah I tell you what okay so okay so solution um this is going to work so just before this I'm going to go ahead and use the um the mouse in uh event handler uh and then I'm going to create a function from this and just pull this down a bit okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to put we get the title when we Mouse in and then when when we we um when we sorry yeah also when we Mouse in we want to go ahead and remove the attribute so this do attribute title is nothing and that way uh when the mouse comes in we're gaining this variable and storing it but then removing the title attribute and then on Mouse out we want to go ahead and sort of restore this so we want to say this do attribute title title uh which being the variable we we've already created so fingers crossed this works uh and nothing's worked there so we might have some kind of error in our code let's just have a look so this mouse in Mouse move I think it's maybe Focus we'll use instead let's go ahead and refresh no so there must be an error here somewhere uh that probably someone's pointed out already uh let's let take a look so this do Focus function um okay let's just go ahead and alert something out here uh just to check that this is okay so we'll just say working and we'll refresh yeah and we don't get an alert over which tells me that there's something wrong uh with this um code and that is I don't know because I can't find this problem so oh no sorry it's focus in oh dear okay right so yeah um oh no it still hasn't worked uh let's check no that's extremely annoying let's go ahead and alert out something again so I want to say alert working and refresh and nothing's working so this. focus in which would be an a tag focus in function we've got our function block there that lines up VAR title is equal to this do attribute title and then this do attribute title is nothing so we've already grabbed this variable beforehand then on Mouse move after we focused in we grab these and we place the title in that was all working so it must be some sort of small logical error I think in my part let's just try it without the VAR no
