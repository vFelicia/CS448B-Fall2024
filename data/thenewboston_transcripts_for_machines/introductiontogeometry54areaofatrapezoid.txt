okay so today we're going to talk about the area of a trapezoid and it's very similar to the area of a parallelogram with one big difference this part right here so because a trapezoid will never have equal length bases is because if you draw a height down here it has to be parallel to the two bases since you can never have a trapezoid with equal bases we have to take the average of the bases so we're going to take 12 B1 + B2 which is how we are going to find the average and then we multiply it by the perpendicular height just like we do in parallelogram so now we're going to go into an example find the area so this is our height and it's been drawn in for us so our height is 4 base 1 is six base 2 is 10 so area is equal to 12 6 + 10 * * 4 now these parentheses right here are really important you have to add the two bases together before you can multiply it so it's 12 6 + 10 is 16 * 4 a is equal to 12 * 16 is 8 * 4 so our area is 32 so this trapezoid is a little bit different the leg of this trapezoid just happens to be perpendicular to this base so we don't have to draw in a height because this is already our height so H is equal to 4 base 1 is equal to 6 base 2 is equal to 8 so even though we don't have to draw in a height our area formula is going to be the exact same 1 12 B1 + B2 * 4 so a is equal to 12 6 + 4 is 14 * 4 12 of 14 is 7 * 4 the area is equal to 27 or I'm sorry that should be 28 but this time they give us units so we have to make sure we put Mill squared so that's all we're going to do with trapezoids but in the next lesson we're going to start talking about circumferences of a circle which is kind of like the perimeter of a polygon so make sure you come back and and watch that
