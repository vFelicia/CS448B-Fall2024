what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your 12th tutorial and this my friends is the tutorial that I have been waiting for we are finally going to begin talking about math and math operators and all that good stuff so a couple tutorials ago I gave you guys a quick little taste of variables and math operators and you saw that not only can you set variables equal to numbers and text but you can also set them equal to simple equations for example 4 + six uses the addition operator to set apples equal to 80 so what it does whenever you do this it knows that you're working with numbers and it knows to add them together to give you the answer so then when you have document right and you try to print out apples it doesn't print out the text 4 + 76 it actually prints out the value of 80 so in that sense it knows that you're working with an equation so that's pretty cool another thing that you can do is you can't you not only limited to two numbers you can go ahead and add three or four however many you want so let's go ahead and the answer to that is 778 666 pretty cool huh so let's go ahead and delete all this and aside from the addition sign you can also use subtraction sign I don't really need to show you example of that because hopefully you guys know how to subtract what I do want to show you guys example of is multiplication so the multiplication might be a little different than you guys would expect it's actually go ahead and type like 54 or something it's not X don't ever use a lowercase x it's actually the aster sign just like that so 54 * 3 let's go ahead and see what that equals 162 pretty cool so anyways whenever you want to multiply go ahead and use the asteris sign whenever you want to divide you can go ahead and you use the four slash just like that so 54 divid by 3 is 18 it goes in evenly pretty cool but what if you have a number like 56 divided 3 that doesn't go in evenly well let's go ahead and refresh this and see we got 18.66 66 and finally it cuts you off this six actually goes on forever but depending on your browser it's going to cut you off after a little bit just like my friend did last night when I had too much bruskies but anyways it's going to cut you off so that leads me to another Point what if you actually need that remainder as a number itself for example you were making a program and you said 18 remainder two which would the answer to this problem be well anytime you want the remainder you need to add the percentage sign and this is called the modulus operator it basically divides one value by another and it gives you the remainder back so 56 divide 3 is 18 remainder two so when you save this it's not going to say 18 remainder two is just going to say two simple enough let's give another example 2 5 / 7 is three remainder 4 but it's not going to say three remainder four it's just going to say four pretty cool huh so that is how you use the modulus operator and the last thing I actually want to go over it's not really a math operator at all but it kind of is it's called the increment and decrement operator and this is how you can quickly add one or subtract one from a single number so let's go ahead and make a variable called chops short for pork chops and set it equal to seven by the way I'm hungry and let's go ahead in order to add this you can add one to this variable in one of two ways you can do chops well I won't even teach you guys that but you can do this chops equals chops + 1 so then it's going to say all right this variable now equals 7 + 1 so we can go ahead and write document. write chop s you can actually do this another way but I'm not going to cover that in this tutorial so let's go ahead and save this and did I this is chop actually was going plural and singular mixing it up can't do that so let's go ahead and save this print out and we see that we do indeed have eight first it was seven then we added one to it we got eight pretty cool huh but see whenever you have chop equal chop plus one it can get kind of confusing so let me show you guys an easier way to quickly add one to a variable anytime you want to add one to a variable just go ahead and write the name of the variable then write plus plus and that's it that'll take the number whatever it is say it's like 67 and it would add one to it and that'll give you a completely new variable so let's go ahead and save this and now chops is equal to 68 instead of 67 so that is a way to change a variable by adding one to it you can also write chop minus minus is this is the decrement or what's it called decrement whatever not decrement that's uh that's something else so I don't want to talk about that and see it was 67 before and then we took that variable subtracted one from it so now chop equals 66 and we printed it out on the screen so again plus plus and minus minus they aren't really useful right now in these examples but trust me whenever we learn about loops and we're going to learn about other stuff and they're going to come in handy and we're going to be using them a ton so that's why I want to cover them now so when we go over them later on you won't get confused so thank you guys for watching that's all I have for you guys for this tutorial a simple tutorial about math and simple equations oh I got like a piece of flim in my throat so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you in my other videos
