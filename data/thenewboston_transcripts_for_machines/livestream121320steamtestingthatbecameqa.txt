all right and we are back in my comments uh we need meme review i agree okay let's check it out check it out check it out all right so i don't know if you guys notice but i now have some awesome decorations back there i got an elephant two little plants literally the only decorations in my entire apartment all right and we got a logo no more uh streaming hard duck what is this testing this is just testing the uh stream i just signed up for a stream yard it's called and just streaming on youtube making sure my audio is good video is good and pretty much it yeah i move my jacket so you know you can see my awesome decorations a little bit better it's two decorations i do have a cool steve jobs poster but i don't want to like tape it to my wall i'm too lazy to frame it i don't have any thumbtacks so it's kind of just like a laying on the ground now should probably just tape it up there all right and look at this actually you guys dig in the red the minimal or no display name i kind of like the minimum myself stream yard cost uh i think this was actually let me see i just purchased it like 30 seconds ago 39 a month yeah this was uh actually they got a 20 a month plan but it had something up it didn't have full hd and i know you guys want to see my beautiful face in full hd of course so i had a splooge on that for you not using obs um so i used to use obs to stream on twitch but they like fried my mac every time i turn it on it was over in and also another fun fact for you guys is i had to uninstall adobe creative cloud because even though i like the software it was also frying my mac whenever i turn on camtasia to record anything it was just like uh heard my mac spinning fans overheating and i looked at the processes and there were like 500 processes running in the background so i close all my adobe apps and then i close the uh like that little uh tool menu in the top right the creative cloud one and still i looked at my processes and these things weren't shutting down so i'm like whatever just uninstall that okay yo bucky what up not much what's up bucky not much and let's see um these comments are moving a little too fast okay i use please help sir what are the most important subjects for cs student operating systems network c plus plus java other languages their computation architecture please answer so for that i would say there is no um there's no one right answer it really depends on where are you trying to go what do you want to achieve in the future and then once you decide upon that figuring out the best path to get there but for some of those you may need those skills for some of you may never need them so uh why does a variable appear uninitialized in main c plus which was declared and taken as input from class dot cpp i do not remember that tutorial that specifically so i would have to look how to get freelancing projects and make a career in freelancing so i never did freelancing but i know upwork is the site that i use whenever i need freelancers so possibly that route can you make a tutorial about good practice in convention uh programming i like that idea actually i am uh obsessed with clean code to a point where it's not even like clean clothes it's more like ocd really um just making sure like properties are in alphabetical order and uh imports are optimized everything is nice and standard and you know what on the topic of clean code so i actually uh had a debate with a few people about this and whenever you're working on a software project as a team clean code seems like kind of um strictly an ocd thing but the reason that i like it is because whenever you have standards and really clean code you can go to any part of the code base and it you can't tell who it was written by and that's kind of the goal in my mind where everything is standardized consistent so it doesn't look like each part is written by a different team or a different pod however your teams are structured and also these little things of okay where do i look for this property in the list of like 60 properties or was this imported and then you have to find it it's all those little things where you don't think about but these seconds they add up and kind of i always kind of equated it to this where uh it may not be that correct or the best analogy but programming is a lot like just reading any language where you start to read and you're focused on just the letters you learn b and t and bat okay on ba in you are you put so much time and energy onto each character and then later each word that by the time you get to the end of a sentence you don't you pretty much forgot what was at the beginning and your reading comprehension is really um low when you first started out but eventually after you get more familiar with it it's like the dog is on the uh house or whatever it is and then you can begin to understand the words and then the sentences and then things just flow and then after a while you aren't thinking about those specific words you're thinking more about the meaning and paragraph and the story so kind of like coding the more familiar you are with it in the more the easier it is to read uh these different patterns you can focus more on the problem that you're trying to solve rather than the syntax of what does this do or where is this thing all of those little question marks you can get out of the way can allow you to focus on the the problem itself wow that was a long answer i didn't even remember what the original question was but let's scroll back up here flutter you guys really love flutter flutter is coming this is uh kind of my game plan for youtube videos and before i get to that let me um actually how am i going to show you guys this if you go to my twitter uh my name is bucky underscore roberts the second to last post i made actually let me back up a little bit so a couple of days ago i asked what do you want to learn in 2021 since well i wanted to know what you guys thought since those were pretty much the tutorials i was planning on making and for those of you who don't feel like going all the way over to twitter python was first surprisingly and i say surprisingly not because the community is uh you know familiar with python but mainly because i taught a lot of python before so i figured you guys would be sick of it but python was first and again this was just the results from the poll they're not anything like uh i'm committed to creating these tutorials or i haven't decided anything yet i just want to you know read you guys the results number two you guys will be happy to see is flutter number three i'm just going to read them out i'm going to say one two three all right python flutter docker django aws kubernetes react native react in ai and after that's blockchain javascript machine learning typescript and yada yada so on and so forth but flutter is definitely on the menu as is docker and aws python and django i did teach that before if there's debating whether i want to teach that again i mean if you guys would like me to teach that then yeah i guess uh rocking with that all right hold on read through comments reading through comments how to concentrate and have patience while learning so this is um okay i need to find a way to like bookmark these comments or something i as i'm answering i see all these other questions go past and in my head i'm like i'm gonna miss that i'm gonna miss that but uh okay one second okay how to concentrate and have patience while learning so i think the reason why a lot of people have trouble concentrating and having patience while learning is because the thing that they're trying to learn doesn't have a lot of meaning to them in other words whenever i was in school high school i had to learn about history and then i had to read books for english class and the fact that i had to do it rather than i wanted to do it it just it was just like okay i just got to do this to complete an assignment or whenever they teach you math in school they're like figure out this equation and then answer on your test or on your homework and in my mind i was like what's the point of this when am i ever going to use this equation uh it just feels like i'm like i'm a function i get some input and i got to do some output or else i get in trouble by my mom or whatever but um the reason i say all this is because with without that reason and say what does this matter what am i doing it for there's no purpose there's no uh nothing to attach it to on your mind because you have nothing to relate it to so whenever i am learning a new language or new technology of course i have the purpose to teach you guys but aside from that it's not i don't really think of things like uh learning in this way or i have to do this to do this what i usually do whenever i'm learning a new technology is something like this i want to build a digital currency because i want to create a better economy and i want to work on this program with everyone for my community now that's what i'm gonna do and that's my focus that's my only focus my dream what i'm passionate about so on and so forth now on that journey of getting to there i know that i'm gonna have to read through documentation i'm gonna have to understand concepts that i didn't learn before but unlike before when i was in high school and having to go through each of these things i'm still doing the exact same thing i have to learn math i have to learn new languages i have to learn this and that but it's not about that learning it's just things that you do naturally on the way to creating this digital currency or this project and a side story on this is that when i first moved down to north carolina and i had a job like um i had to mow like uh police departments and fire stations in like uh like the soccer fields that kids played at so i was just like uh a landscaper basically i worked with uh two people notably i worked with a lot of people but in this story we'll just stick with those two people one guy he hated coming to work every day and he's like ah another day another dollar that's what he always said and another guy kelvin he's like man after this week gonna get that ps3 and so you know got the ps5 now but i actually don't even know if it was the ps3 it was one of those consoles back then but he was always looking ahead to what he could do uh after like what was the purpose of work so on and so forth and i was like huh that's uh pretty interesting it's both of these people including myself we're coming in and going to work every single day we're doing the same exact thing but one guy was upset and depressed the whole time in another one in the exact same situation was just always looking forward to things so i don't know it's just uh the way that i learn it's not that i ever have to go through docs or learn something in a book it's just that these are just things to get me one step closer to what i'm concentrated on it's just um it's not so much learning anymore or having to do anything it's uh just a different mindset i suppose okay miss about 5 000 comments so let me scroll up what are you up to now regarding the channel like blockchain machine learning and web stuff so yes the channel got a lot of stuff planned um i wanna i finally have time okay let me just back up so on november 5th whenever i release the video there were a lot of people um who came into the project right away a lot more than i expected and let me kind of close this as well so a lot of more people came on to the project than i expected and it was just really um overwhelming so in a good way by the way so people would come on and message me and say hey bucky uh i want to join the project this is my background so on and so forth and as i was responding to them i could hear on my little slack bot other people coming in or uh sending me messages i'm like man i am never gonna get through these and then at the end of the night at like 1 30 2 in the morning i finally got through all my messages i'm like okay tomorrow i can go and finally uh start on my twitter messages since this was all on slack and then i would wake up open my slack prepare to go to twitter and there'd be like 150 new messages on slack and i was like oh man never going to get through this but um yeah so the point of the story is essentially i finally have some time now now that that new traffic kind of died down and i want to get through the digital currency videos which i'm hoping to rip out pretty quick and then after that i want to make a series on the account manager the desktop client that you use since a lot of people are having some trouble with that since it is a brand new piece of software of course so i want to teach that and then on the 19th i think i'm flying back to new york to see my family that's the plan for now with this virus thing going around everything's uh changing pretty quickly but i am going to um finish writing my docker tutorials my aws tutorials i'm going to be writing flutter tutorials i'm i'm not going to have my computers around since i'm since uh i film on these big imacs and what is this ah a little debate going on in the chat so i'm not gonna have these but what i'm gonna have am i am gonna have is a lot of time to uh finish writing my tutorials which actually takes the bulk of the time whenever i'm creating videos just because i need to make sure to have a general outline and then i need to make sure on each tutorial i have bullet points of what i want to cover just so i make sure that i don't want to um miss anything or skip over anything so that takes the majority of the time and then when i come back in the beginning of 2021 in january i can pretty much just pump out a bunch of those tutorials so docker aws and flutter coming first and then and then i'm essentially going to wait and see what you guys say mostly listening to the polls uh so on and so forth wow these answers are way too long okay uh scroll down scroll down okay how to increase logical skills for programming this is actually interesting question this is uh something i never thought about i guess that um so so one thing it's kind of the stupid standard answer but just uh practice lots of practice and another thing that i noticed throughout my programming career one thing that separates the really good programmers from the junior programmers that is pretty apparent is whenever they have a new feature to work on or a new little project the more senior developers they take a lot of time to plan they spend a lot of time either on a whiteboard or a notebook and by the time their fingers touch the keyboard they know exactly what they're gonna do uh it's pretty much just writing the solution as fast as you can type of course there may be some issues that they come across but more or less so much goes into planning and understanding exactly what you're building before you start writing the code where with junior developers they get a problem it can be like um an interview challenge or even like a feature later on when they get hired or when they're first starting out and whenever they do they just hop right into the code right into the code and pretty quickly right after that they usually get stuck or say i have to rewrite this rewrite this and i think what's happening in the reason that uh i guess with this digital currency thing i spent months and months and months playing them before my fingers ever touched the keyboard is that whenever you just start coding right away you're kind of looking at things uh one step at a time so if there's ten steps you say i'm gonna do step one and then step two but what it doesn't allow is to see the system as a whole and say okay so this is the individual pieces kind of like that reading comprehension if you guys were here for the earlier part of the stream but not only can you understand the individual pieces but you can understand how everything fits together and then if things don't fit when you're looking at things from a big picture you can go back and kind of tweak things move it around but um i i don't know if that was the answer of the logical skills for programming but by taking the time to plan things out thoroughly uh kind of just with a notebook a notebook and pen or a whiteboard it i feel will improve almost all of your projects all right pretty cool huh i don't know what that was referring to but i'm guessing that it was cool all righty where can i notify you about a security vulnerability you can uh send me a private message on slack uh hi daddy skip that one all right let's see what else we got can you do bitcoin for complete beginners so caleb is actually making a uh blockchain for beginners tutorial series for the new boston however he is waiting on a payment library that we haven't had time to develop yet so i wanna wait and see for his series to come out and see what he covered and then i'll kind of let the community decide if they want more if they want less if they like that if not so we're rocking with that how long will this stream be i have no idea it's already uh way longer than i expected i really just wanted to do this stream to um test out this uh this new software that i was using in the stream so there really is nothing nothing planned or important for this stream so uh yeah i need to know about the obsession with tuna so another fun fact for you guys is that whenever i started using bacon and tuna in my tutorials and i'm sure if you guys follow me on twitter you already know where this is going but i actually didn't start using the words bacon and tuna in my tutorials to be funny even though you know it is kind of funny i started using it because whenever i was learning programming for the very first time i would go through these books and teach them about so i would go through these books and learning about classes and functions and variables and these variables would be named like var num equals five and i would see these two things like var num i go is one of these like customizable is numb is var like like what's going on and it was hard for me to see like what was a builtin uh keyword and then what was customizable so in my tutorials where i did var bacon equals 18 or something or var tuna equals you know some string i did that because it's very clear to understand what is a builtin reserve keyword and then what is a customizable variable name so that is kind of the reasoning behind that if you guys just thought they're kind of random and i also know that uh a lot of people don't like kind of uh teaching programming that way because in real life you're not supposed to name things bacon however when teaching to someone for the very first time and trying to look at things from their perspective um it is good to use those kind of keywords so even though making actual application i would never suggest using tuna or bacon unless you're making a program about like foods or fish or anything but um yeah there you go oh let's see la la how does one obsession with tuna where have you been still like look like a college kid thank you i feel like i'm about 80 years old stress out from a lot of different projects uh this digital currency one got going on which is a pretty big one but i'm feeling really good about it python is good for people i suggest python i love it seems to be growing strong and also one of the most well liked wait not just the voice i am not a [ __ ] he's my daddy again okay interesting uh oh i should quit college okay got it thanks so this is actually a very interesting question so one i would say that you should probably never take my advice for anything at all so that's my little disclaimer um i i don't recommend quitting college overall it's just a general piece of advice what i would recommend is for anyone in in life really to figure out where you want to be and where you're trying to go and then for yourself independently ask yourself is college the best way to get there and for a lot of professions whether it is um being a doctor or a lawyer uh dropping out of college is not a good idea at all for being a programmer and for wanting to build something unique and for wanting to focus your time and energy on learning about different different software and technology versus going to college and learning about science or gym class then it can be a consideration and another thing is that well i guess i'm always a little weary to give advice like this because i know that what worked out for me may not work out for um other people so i i really am hesitant to uh you know advocate for dropping out of school just because even saying that it seems like a silly thing to suggest but for myself it was even now i feel uh the right choice for me 100 but it's hard to give advice for other people because i don't know your situation all right all right salesforce commerce cloud uh so to anneal bk asking about salesforce commerce cloud actually never uh use that software um familiar with it but i would not be the best person to teach that i'm afraid all right all right wow lots of comments about that okay here we go the new boston how long to learn python so this is uh interesting as well because when there there's never really a time where you can say i learned this language or i didn't learn it yet the moment you pick up a book and understand the first line of a python uh tutorial then you learn python kind of like learning a language okay i took spanish in high school and i know how to say like uh my name and i know how to say like donald biblioteca like where's the library but i don't know spanish or maybe i do now even people who even myself who am a native english speaker there's like 90 language i have no idea what those words are probably so can i say that i know it so it's always this fuzzy thing where uh myself who's been writing python for 10 years more than that i guess um there are there's a vast majority of the language that i i don't know so it's uh how long to learn something it's gradual it happens over time and it never stops you can never stop getting better toothbrush or headphone or what this is a toothbrush actually like the whenever i'm making the tutorial brush the old teeth okay do you feel like the cs field in general is becoming flooded to me in school the cs major is such an impacted major so becoming flooded um i don't it depends on your perspective because is it just like are too many people learning cs uh i wouldn't say that because if lots of people are interested in cs then they should learn it they should go after what they're passionate about as for hiring i think that tech companies specifically they don't care so much about your certifications or your degree versus other areas of um career and industry so on and so forth software companies want the best software developers they want the best software developers in the world because when you release a piece of software there's no certifications or degrees attached to it so people acquire their skills through different means some people go to school and get a master's degree in cs other people go to boot camp and become amazing developers and some people just do independent study and learn on their own and each of these avenues can turn out great for people and each can turn out not so great it really depends on how you learn best as an individual some people need to go to school even for cs because they need that pressure of someone saying okay you need to be uh kind of responsible to complete these assignments and without that pressure they never progress other people it's just um they know exactly what they want to do they know exactly what they want to learn and they don't need help going down that path but whether it's a boot camp whether it is um university whether it is independent learning all of this really depends on what works best for you so i hesitate to give a general answer but hopefully that helped out tooth pressure headphone again huh okay favorite tech stack so i don't know if this has a um uh so the tech stack i like is uh django and then i like django rest framework everything on aws even that that isn't really part of the stack and still a fan of react react in redux been using redux toolkit recently but i mean if you're just gonna like rip out a traditional uh crud application or i mean you really can't go wrong with learning python or django because it's so uh popular nowadays and then on the front end with react javascript i mean that's not dying anytime soon so it's hard to go against that even though i know answering that now everyone is going to you know be debating their own stacks in like what why not angular why not node jango so yeah i uh i blame that person for starting a war in the chat okay and this is jumping around jumping around uh what about big data so i think i might have missed a question here uh something about it or just what about it all right so how is the new boston currency so fast so this is interesting that's what i like talking about all right so there are a couple inefficiencies that i saw actually since this is a stream i guess i uh okay let's just let's just uh answer this question straight up so you know whatever let's just go way back to why i uh created the network and how that came about so whenever i was creating the digital currency i never set out to create a digital currency what i was doing is i was actually um making a simulation about the entire us stock market and what i saw is that there's an opportunity if you could figure out the retailers and their suppliers to through earnings see which companies were going to most likely uh have higher earnings than expected and the reason uh pretty simple is for this if google announced 10 more earnings then that means that more or less their company was growing by 10 so therefore since they needed to you know buy additional uh merchandise buy additional computers hire more employees expand their operations then that means that whoever they purchased their supplies from whether it was intel whether it was from amd so on and so forth that they would most likely have a 10 earnings increase as well so since i was finding this correlation what i do is i mapped out a simulation with all these different companies and then i saw i essentially needed to figure out how the money was flowing between these companies to get this correlation so the money is a little bit more complicated than just seeing where it's flowing from company to company because money doesn't flow that way in real life what happens in the v1 of the simulation is i figured that i needed to add employees so when and break this down even uh more simply is that whenever a company pays employees those are people who can go to different parts of the economy and buy something in other companies so it essentially is a company to employees they spend it at another company and then that company can hire more employees or you know pay their employees and the cycle continues now breaking this down into its most simple form i thought in my mind never went to college but things kind of work like this where whenever i have a dollar and i give it to you that is minus one dollar for me and plus one dollar for you so in the end i figured it always equals zero and then when you expand it to companies playing them employees and their employees go and you know they pay taxes and stuff but then they buy other goods in my mind i figured the total economy always equaled zero but then after looking at things i saw okay whenever i plug real numbers into the simulation that it didn't equal zero or not even close and what i didn't account for in the end after you know mapping a lot of things out is how the money got into the economy in the first place that whenever i pay you a dollar that dollar needed to come from somewhere in the in the first place so i had to essentially say okay in this economy where does the money come from oh it's the banks and they loan it out and well how did the banks get the money how does this system work oh central banks do this and oh that's kind of a unique system because huh apparently what's happening is banks are giving out people loans and that's how money gets into the system and then loans are essentially promises to pay back more money than you initially receive however breaking things down let's just say that there are three people in the economy and they each took a loan out for a dollar now if there is 10 interest on that loan at the end of the year they would each have to pay back a dollar 10 cents but after a year what you would essentially have is three people pen cap dropped no i did not watch that but you would essentially have three people who took out a dollar loan so there are three dollars in the economy however if they're all standing around each other they would say wait a minute so we as a community owe three dollars and thirty cents to these banks but there are only three dollars in the total economy so and this again is a very simplified version the economy is a lot more complex than this but um essentially that's what i was uh trying to figure out and then i saw that an alternative solution was bitcoin and way back when i didn't understand what the hype of all the uh blockchain was about since it seemed like this technology that was just technology for the sake of technology and let me uh get rid of this right here so i kind of saw bitcoin similar it's like 3d tv where okay that's pretty cool but okay like it's cool technology but is it gonna take off do we really need it is it really meaningful in any way uh i couldn't really connect it in my head so after understanding this in the problem with a simulation that i was trying to figure out which ended up being a lot more than a bug fix because i ended up having to figure out how different parts of the economy work so on and so forth i saw that okay so bitcoin is actually a pretty cool solution to this but if that's the case and people have a choice between these two systems why are they choosing this over uh bitcoin or blockchain or anything i don't mean seem like a advocate for bitcoin or whatever since i know a lot of people get pretty annoying on all that but um i was just trying to figure out in my mind it was just a better solution but why if that was the case it wasn't more widespread and one of the big things even though there are lots of things is that the transaction times were a big barrier so i know right now we have the lightning network and there are lots of other improvements but essentially no one i noticed was going to go to uh a deli and buy a cup of coffee or sandwich or whatever and be waiting there for 10 minutes while their transaction was you know pending waiting to get approved so i knew that the first thing was the transaction times that i needed to speed up or at least that was um the barrier that i saw which would eventually lead me to uh start creating this project another thing was the incentive where more or less in this economy people will will do what you pay them to where they build the things uh based on economic incentive they choose jobs based on that so on and so forth now in the bitcoin blockchain that incentive comes from mining blocks it comes from the fact that not only do you validate transactions which is useful uh it's the main goal of the miners but so much of that time and energy is spent solving this puzzle it's spent devoted to something that has absolutely nothing to do with verifying the transactions itself so in the bitcoin blockchain and this all ties back to that original question by the way one sec in the bitcoin blockchain what you essentially have is a network of miners and these miners each get transactions and they bundle them together into a block and then they validate those transactions pretty quickly but then after that what they do is they solve a puzzle a puzzle that takes around 10 minutes on average to solve and the reason that they solve that has nothing to do with validating the transactions has to do with more of a human problem and that is if you picture it like this if there were a lot of students sitting at desks and you were watching like in a football stadium or something then if you just had each of those students with pencil and paper validating a transaction and in a live network they would just stand up and shout every time they validated one then it would just be mayhem there'd just be validated validated validate you couldn't understand who's first you kind of understand if they're valid communication would just be a mess so with that in mind instead of all these uh kids i don't know why they have to be kids just imagining myself in an elementary school but now imagine each of these kids validating a set of transactions or doing a test or something and then after that you give them a big crossword puzzle to fill out or maybe a word search or something maybe a sudoku problem and this is a challenging one that takes on average 10 minutes to solve well now instead of everyone shouting shout and shouting they solve these transactions and then they have to solve this and then the communication becomes more spread out at the end of 9 minutes 10 minutes somewhere around there a kid's going to stand up and said i validated these transactions and i solved the puzzle and instead of everyone shouting at once now those people all those other students are able to determine okay this person was first that communication is pretty clear now we can just validate it pretty quickly and then move on to the next puzzle so that is what i saw but what was interesting in all of this is that aside from that earlier part that i mentioned of everyone solving this puzzle validating transactions so on and so forth i noticed that there was a moment in time where one of these students in my mind stood up and then the entire network agreed that this was a student that we go with this was the one so in that moment an entire network of computers of nodes that were controlled by people who had no idea who each other were they were able to agree on something and the bottleneck and all of that was this puzzle was this puzzle that needed to be done because they needed to figure out uh who was first or who should be able to validate that block now kind of translating that to a couple problems i identified is i saw that the efficiency inefficiency in the network uh came from a couple of things so the technical technological inefficiency was first of all within each individual minor 99 of the time is spent doing something completely unrelated to the transaction validation you got a about less than one percent validating transactions and then 99 percent of time is just spent doing this puzzle so if we could cut out the puzzle that would be great another thing is the network inefficiency where in the bitcoin network you essentially have these miners all around the world trying to mine a block because when you mine it you get that bitcoin reward now whenever one miner solves the puzzle what happens is they say yo these uh transactions are valid in everyone else's work just get tossed out the window so with one minor there's just so much little work that actually mattered and everything else was just wasted more or less now the reason back to this question is why the new boston network is so fast is in the bitcoin blockchain what they do is every single block every single um puzzle that they solve they essentially say look i solved it and then everyone else agrees on that now whenever you solve block after blockout for block you have to agree as a network on black block after block after block and there are transactions happening very quickly and it takes a long time now if instead of having all these miners and they validate these blocks and then you have to decide on each of these is this one legit is this one legit is this the one legit if you take that consensus and move it down a layer where you say we don't have to agree on every single block instead let's just go ahead and agree on the minor that we want to choose that we trust the most to validate these blocks because we're essentially taking all that uh waste that happened before and removing it to the last second where if that network in the bitcoin uh if that decision in the bitcoin network that consensus was reached on the individual block then we know a network of computers can reach a consensus about something now instead of reaching about the individual block why not reach it on the node and then we can say this node is the one that we agree that we reach a consensus on is a node that we trust now we can essentially just send all transactions to them and they can validate it as fast as they can so as soon as they come in there's no need to wait for anything else so on and so forth and for these other miners they essentially turn into uh validators where they aren't just like peaceing out saying you know you don't need me anymore they're doing a couple key things they are backing up the primary validator in case it over goes down and they are also double checking their homework essentially so they just don't blindly accept this they're revalidating each and every single one so by doing that we essentially eliminate the need for a puzzle and we eliminate the network inefficiency as well because well for all of those reasons so that is uh another man got a lot of these comments so that is essentially why we are able to uh speed up the um block times so quick because we don't have to agree on every block time we have to agree on a trusted minor and then they are going to be the ones validating all of these transactions and if they ever try to lie or cheat or steal or anything you have all of these confirmation validators checking them and they are essentially going to broadcast the moment they try to you know tweak anything by one little bite so it just um leads to a a very interesting and efficient architecture okay let's uh that was way too long i got to speed these up uh let's see how to avoid burnout of learning so many things um yeah i think that kind of comes down to you aren't you don't get burnt out by learning things that you enjoy to learn you kind of get burned out by doing things that you have to do so a lot of burnout happens because of the environment rather than individual topic what about database i think i missed the earlier question there views on ethical hacking uh ethical hacking is yeah it's uh like white hat pen testing just a different area of security did you write a 10k reader all right what do you say about aws and cloud computing should i go for network automation i am a network admin uh yeah it seems to be um where the world is shifting aws cloud computing is not going anywhere anytime soon okay let's see let's see let's see man stream is just me trying to read through questions are you a freelancer or what i am not a freelancer super chat question question i saw super chat on youtube but i'm i'm actually not sure what it is okay wow way way late on this um decentralization yes yes never knew how you look like this is it where did you learn these programming languages from you look so pretty cool uhhuh why thank you and um yeah most of them most times when i was learning programming languages so i used to just uh buy the top rated book off amazon and uh sometimes i would just like buy two or three cents like they only show you a little preview and back then uh whenever i was first starting out ebooks or kindles weren't that prevalent so just um yeah just going through books and and studying and now what i like to do is i like to watch uh video courses stephen grider is probably my favorite uh instructor i love the way he teaches and any course that he teaches i would uh highly recommend okay see superchats are where megaballer millionaire youtube's get donations from viewers very cool millionaires this is interesting where mega baller millionaire youtubers get donations from viewers it sounds like those are the last people that would need donations but um yeah sounds interesting nonetheless blockchain what if the trusted minor gets corrupted or it goes rogue what can you do sorry for spamming the question no it's a good one because it definitely uh can happen the primary validator is one that is a single source of truth in validating all transactions in the network for optimization reasons primarily now the moment that they try to cheat and uh the most likely thing they can try to mess with the network a bunch of different ways but the most likely reason that they would cheat their incentive is just adding additional money to their own account so instead of me paying you 50 coins they would either try to pay themselves 50 coins so when that happens uh through the use of digital signatures all of the other confirmation validators will notice that it is a invalid transaction and they won't accept that transaction onto their blockchain because all the confirmation validators are continuously trying essentially to um sync to the block or the primary validator of blockchain so essentially when this happens the confirmation validators will reject the primary validator the primary validator will be booted more or less from the network and all these confirmation validators will inform the banks that the primary validator was cheating and through the it's a separate process but essentially the banks move on to the next most trusted confirmation validator now another cool thing is that this process would normally take a long time where uh this primary validators kind of got caught cheating and then every other node in the network had to resync okay what do we do now what do we do now who's the most next trust in but the cool thing about this is that this decision is already in place before that happens so through trust banks are already deciding if the primary validator ever goes offline or is caught cheating so on and so forth they already know what confirmation validator to move to next so that is why even in that process the transition times and the resync of the network happens very quickly okay the even docker bro yes docker tutorials coming right soon let's see this this okay so how can we get coins so coins are earned through contributing to the project so that is where i felt the incentive should be where in different networks where it's mining the incentive comes from building the fastest miner and here the incentive in the value is essentially what you put into it so the entire idea is what you put into it is the value that you should get out and the coins are just a representation of how much you help the network and how much you help the community so you get coins through different things working on projects like if you want to work on a game or analytics tool or anything that integrates with the network you can earn that through project proposals and another thing is you can just work as a weekly contributor and these are things like the front end team the back end team uh seo marketing so on and so forth design uh those types and lastly just completing a onetime task so if you don't want to help out every week and you just want to fix some bugs or make some optimizations then if you go to the website look at the tasks then there are smaller onetime tasks that you can do okay alright client so what clients do you have what operating systems you can run on so our main client is the account manager you can download it from the new boston.com and with that it was built using electron so it works on linux windows and mac os so you can buy up a bunch of coins and control the network so i so this network is not controlled by a proof of stake at all so the amount of money or coins that you have uh doesn't have any influence okay how old am i i think i'm 33 34. this was actually the hardest question oh wow okay this is uh okay bucky meant suffer engineering or cs uh so that's up to you it's uh what you're more interested in gekko question mark yeah coin gecko is cool there might have been a earlier question but okay okay uh the value basis makes sense what about speculators that just want to buy and sell at higher prices so yes the okay so the value this is another thing where the value of the coin is a difficult concept to explain because a lot of people don't think about uh value of currency in really at all before uh bitcoin they were born into a system where uh currency already existed and with bitcoin what it showed is uh currency doesn't have to be that way the value can come from what you build it into so even with that there are different types of value there are social value their monetary value which i'm sure that you are referring to in the monetary value of this is first going to be determined whenever we start selling goods and services so we're going to start selling uh stickers and tshirts the new boston on the website in the marketplace whenever that rolls out and then later they're going to go to decentralized exchanges and these decentralized exchanges uh contributors or whoever has coins are going to be able to sell them for other types of currency bitcoin ethereum so on and so forth and the exact value of that we don't know we won't know until the moment where those coins are placed for sale and an agreement is made for one person to exchange their currency for our coins stephen grider where is his courses so he is on udemy i believe uh that's where i get his courses i'm actually i'm actually not sure if he is on youtube or not if so that would be cool but yeah check them out on udemy makes awesome courses and they're uh very indepth as well okay what do you think of the future of this crypto i have very uh okay don't uh get everyone's expectations up too high but i am liking what i am seeing a lot we still have um a couple we still have a long way to go but so far things are looking very good and i just see this comment give cat bagel all right rust as well and okay so i like and rust uh what about sqlite database uh yeah sqlite is pretty cool in memory it's nice to uh just share databases it's really simple for getting started especially locally on like a django project before you port over to postgres or anything like that but uh yeah i'm a fan of it it's probably not a fan in a production setting are you guys using solidity we are not using solidity uh this is not um erc20 compatible this is it's actually a complete rewrite of the blockchain from the ground up however later on whenever we reach out to or get on decentralized exchanges then we will most likely be wrapping it in the erc20 coin and getting on that way what is my rating in chess so i actually used to be really into chess um i can't remember what my rating was i want to say i want to say like uh 1600 1700 but uh yeah and then so i was actually climbing climbing and i took chess lessons i love my chess instructor i love chess but after a while i got busy with working some other things and then i want went into a play a little bit later and my rating dipped way down so it's one of those things where if you aren't doing it frequently at least in my experience that uh some of these comments that uh i kind of lost it but i still love chess a lot all right trying to get an entrylevel job programming i learned this and this what other skills and tools must i master i feel stuck so this really depends on what specific language you're trying to get in and i would stick with like um there's no need to learn java and c plus typically you usually stick with uh one or the other kind of like um well i guess it's a little bit different for web development because with the web development you typically need a stack unless they're looking for like strictly back end or front end but it's tough to say because depending on the company that you're trying to apply for in the position um it really depends on what they are looking for but in general i will say that your best bet is to go deep into one language because if you are like an expert in one language you can almost always find a job rather than having a shallow bit of knowledge in a lot of different ones isn't proof of stake arguably better for daytoday use than proof of work so i would say from daytoday transactions it definitely makes the network faster uh the concept behind proof of stake where you're essentially rewarding people with more money uh versus proof of work where you're rewarding people for solving puzzles faster not so as far as transaction speed then proof of stake is definitely the way to go this this yeah okay how many youtube channels did i follow uh don't know 100 maybe i followed them uh over time all right so what incentive would someone have in trading their bitcoin for the coins is there an intrinsic value so i guess um the value of each of these it's essentially similar to um bitcoin where the value of that was nothing in the beginning and that's why people pay like millions of bitcoins for pizza or they're just giving them away for free whatever the value of these cryptocurrencies it only comes from the value that you you give it or the value that you build it's the value of the network and the value of currency overall doesn't have any inherent value i mean of course uh gold coins in way back then it's a little bit different but nowadays there's nothing inherently valuable about a dollar bill with a president's head printed on it the only value of currency is for the goods and services that you can exchange for it you can take a dollar bill and you can buy a candy bar or you can hire someone to mow your lawn or something but um the the only real value of currency is what you can exchange it for that has tangible value goods and services uh learn programming say watch my channel react to native all right favorite programming language i would have to go with um i'd have to go with python just because it's well i'm biased it's just my own personal opinion that i'm most familiar with it all right all right all right all right uh let's see what do i think about machine learning um yeah it seems uh useful i always felt like i was unclear on the difference between machine learning and then statistics in like a forward loop essentially even though that's a very over simplification but um yeah lots of math involved in machine learning is my sequel obsolete absolutely not and okay uh kyle had a question up here uh more centralization hmm asciis create more centralization ee that's interesting it's like a decentralized centralization i guess not a typical one but never thought about it like that still better still building racing carts i am not uh let's see okay message retracted that's interesting all right so it looks like i got to the bottom of these all right javascript or python which holds the future uh i think they're gonna be equally valuable i don't see either one of them dying down anywhere in the near future and there's still a lot of development going on with either they're getting better every year faster uh yeah so both of them in our university we're learning c programming language is it good for beginners um so this is interesting because what programming language is good for beginners so i would say that c definitely is not the most easiest one to learn however on the flip side of it you do learn a little bit more lower level indepth programming concepts so in that way even though there's a bigger barrier to learning it it gives you almost like a more clear picture about programming overall but i guess that's a kind of general in computing where the more low level the more you understand about how like the uh bits move around but of course the closer you are the lower you are then uh not so much uh easy to get started decentralized artificial intelligence hmm now we're getting some good stuff decentralize artificial intelligence decentralize artificial intelligence so i i always thought this where um and this is an interesting concept as well where whenever you have a cell in your body like your stomach cell or your lung cell or whatever your lung cell has no concept of the lung overall it doesn't know okay i'm doing this i'm doing this so uh there there's this human outside who can like uh breathe or digest food a stomach cell is just like bloop whatever noise they make it's just doing its thing so it doesn't really understand the environment that it's in and even when you put those together your lung overall it doesn't have a brain but still continues to do these things these processes without any over without any understanding of the the body that it's in it's a lung and it just does what a lung does now with that in mind right now we have a lot of different ai and they are specific to certain tests uh image recognition uh making sure that you click uh what was that what was that a movie on netflix called social dilemma pretty much all that stuff with the ai but um whenever this ai starts connecting and starts learning from one another and i think that's going to be pretty interesting and aside from that the reason that i bring up the lung cells so on and so forth is it always felt to me like as human beings there was a drive that we didn't really understand even as kids we want to build things and we want to create things but what's our drive like when i was a kid i used to build these towers out of blocks and i knew in my head that they weren't going to last forever they're just going to be knocked down but still i wanted to build the biggest tower and now i wanted to build the fastest blockchain and do this and that but for all these things i'm doing all these things i'm building putting together figuring it out it's like why what's it what's it matter at the end whether we have a big tower a fast blockchain so on and so forth and it feels like what humans are doing is they're building something that they don't quite comprehend myself included but what i do see is that people are becoming more connected and they're becoming connected faster than ever and even though i i don't know the uh the end of this or the body it's um it's interesting to see how things are tying together with the technology that we're building and these different types of ai and how they do influence us overall now i don't want to get into another social dilemma uh so on and so forth but in terms of artificial consciousness and artificial intelligence decentralization it feels like uh overall we're moving very quickly in a certain direction and it will be very interesting to see what is going to happen in the future okay uh would you say privacy is important i think this is for me yes uh 1 000 okay dynamics 365. actually am not familiar with that pretty interesting customer relationship management okay now i know about it pretty cool funny how ideas spread oh okay i missed a bunch of ones okay privacy uh bug bounty programs yeah i'm a big fan of bug bounty programs uh the pan renter how do you bridge the gap between theory and application i'm stuck knowing how to do things when i actually but not being able to actually do them pan or answer can you um let me see you can you give me a specific example this is an interesting question teach arduino that's interesting as well yes uh who is secret agent paul cool name uh teach arduino so um i'm actually i had a poll on twitter asking people what they want to learn in 2021 i have a couple different topics on the agenda but uh if you want to recommend arduino then yeah that would be definitely a possibility what are your view on blockchain technology i used to not be a fan of blockchain technology at all i didn't see the use in it but now i do see the use in it and i am a huge fan uh any experience in computer vision i do not in how should i answer this so i was never a huge fan of computer vision because in my mind there are some problems that a certain classification problems that computers are better at solving computers are much better at solving problems versus humans when there is one right answer when they need to calculate a spreadsheet for example uh computers are just gonna be way better than humans hands down no matter what however if you ask a baby or not a baby if you ask a toddler to draw a picture of a horse and then ask a programmer to write a program to draw a picture of a horse then it's a little bit different and the reason it's different or difficult for computers is because there is no one right answer of what is a horse someone could draw a pitcher with just a head someone could draw a picture of a horse jumping over someone could draw a black horse a brown horse and when you get into these classification of problems where there is not one right answer it becomes a difficult area for computers so that's why i like computer vision and image recognition i s like i see the benefit of it like you have photos of people and you want to be able to recognize them but that's why i was um not so drawn towards that because i i view technology as a way to extend the capability of humans we can't calculate these spreadsheets or total as fast as a computer can so let's use computing as a tool to allow this to reach that limit however when it comes to understanding more abstract concepts like um identifying is this picture um a good painting of a horse then some decisions i feel are better left in the hands of humans blockchain series 2021 so caleb curry is actually working on a blockchain tutorial for or a tutorial series for this have you ever heard of fast api uh yes so i am uh definitely taking i i never use it in a production environment but i these other questions all right so i never use fast api in that production environment but i looked into it recently i it looks very cool i want to take a deeper dive and that's something i may also put on the schedule favorite channel thank you very much videos help you a lot thank you very much as well and okay how do you think about using frameworks verse micro services so um we use microservices essentially so we use frameworks whenever we want to build a more complex application just because it gives you a nice pattern to use industry standards and also developers are just familiar with different types of frameworks microservices we typically use for processes that they aren't really uh that time sensitive or they're just longer running processes that kind of can be separated from your main application one example would be like um optimizing images whenever you upload images for a product or for profile so on and so forth you want that large image because you know people ever want to zoom in or whatever but you typically want a smaller thumbnail as well just because whenever you're loading a list of products for example you don't need that huge image just because it takes so much bandwidth so a microprocessor might be good in that where it's not really time sensitive you know maybe it slows it down a bit but um yeah just uh different use cases i suppose all right python in the future from ryan so this is uh interesting i don't know if you were here earlier on but i asked on the twitter poll what do you want to learn in 2021 and surprisingly people voted python is number one and surprising because i thought that they would be sick of learning python on my channel by now but um yeah apparently not why is c still popular so c is very performant which i assume is the reason it's so popular and also it's in a lot of uh different things today people you see in electronics lowlevel things but mostly performance reasons c is really the foundation for a lot of different programming languages bucky how to make a web page update by itself whenever there's a change in database so whenever you have a change in your uh data architecture you typically run something well i guess uh what i'm familiar with in my tech stack there's something called a migration where you essentially update your database and then uh after and then in parallel you update your servers and then after you update your front end but it's actually uh it's a wellknown um challenge because what you're essentially trying to do whenever you want to update your database architecture is you don't want any downtime at all however in an alternative situation what you can do is you can take a snapshot or clone of your database and then you can change the structure of it and then you can essentially deploy your new network your back end and then your front end on this uh like temporary ghost network and then once your updates are all good to go then you could route your traffic over from your old network to your new network now the main challenge with that is that even though you can essentially take a snapshot of your entire architecture update everything while the users are still using your old one and then get everything ready and then switch the traffic over you still have an issue where at the time you took that snapshot and are rolling everything over then you essentially have people still updating data here you still have people like sending messages or adding products or whatever it is now in that time is uh these two databases can get out of sync so they have something for i always forget the color it's like red green or blue green deployment what's the name of it i feel silly even yeah i think it is blue green yeah blue green deployment where it's just different models of how you essentially solve that exact problem okay wow mr wow these are lots of messages coming on okay let's see put them in the future colin or flutter i am not falling for that trap that is uh gonna start a war in this make python addon and blender so i probably will not be teaching anymore blender for a while unfortunately where you make other algorithms and data structures tutorials so someone requested this as well and i want to get your guys input so some people say uh they would like me to make algorithm and data structures tutorials other people say that there are already lots of youtube videos and content out there for it so they would prefer me to make something else but yeah uh since i got lots of people here right now what do you guys think any plans to do machine learning courses so nothing on the immediate agenda however 2021 uh we're still figuring out exactly what type of content to produce and that appears to be a pretty big one so yeah i can see it slowly moving up on the on the schedule how do you have like what's this number how do you have 1 million 468 437 different tutorial playlists did you teach yourself all that stuff uh i don't think i have quite that many but um yes i did teach myself that it's actually pretty enjoyable i like i like learning new things it's not it's not like uh learning something in school where you have to learn it it was uh i don't know it's enjoyable and that's another thing i'm very uh fortunate i can do what i enjoy in life i know not many people have that opportunity or they get stuck into a career or path in life that they're not really interested in or not really passionate about and i'm very fortunate for that opportunity all right mongodb that's another going on man a lot of stuff i want to teach privacy encryption as your proof knowledge tutorials would be cool kyle am i liking these ideas uh how to learn things fast i don't know uh to be honest i don't learn things faster than uh other people uh i i might even learn things slower i am just really obsessed with um learning things pretty uh deep and if there's one part of it i don't understand i'll just go deeper and deeper until i understand it but i would say like um if there were a bunch of people in a room and you gave us something brand new to learn and then you said okay in an hour or however long you think it takes to learn then do this test after i would probably be uh slower than the average person just that in that example um even though i might have been slower i would want to take the the content home with me and then just pour over it even when the test was over just to understand it and maybe that's not a good example because in that case i would just be learning something just for the sake of completing a test but when it comes to computing different technologies and seeing how these different technologies can be used to connect people and build awesome things then it's uh yeah it's not really learning it's just something i'm passionate about i want to figure out how things work all right web assembly okay yes weebas slow learner but the that's uh very short and yeah i feel the same way distributed computing i like that idea as well i actually have a let me see if it's here i'll show you guys a cool book so with distributed computing i would recommend this i actually think i took a it's another thing i posted a video on instagram and or not a video i posted a picture on instagram where i i put a postit note and then a slice of cheese on this book and i said art and i don't even think people realized that it was cheese i think they just thought it was postit notes so you know i was a little disappointed about that that no one saw my beautiful artwork but uh yeah point of the story is that this is a very good book for uh distributed systems all right bucky loves bacon definitely agree with that data science related technologies yeah it's a pretty big feel build your own cryptocurrency tutorials cyberpunk well you are in luck because we have a huge open source project gone to build a very innovative cryptocurrency that is going to belong to the new boston so i actually have a series uh digital currency tutorials that we're walking through everything and then also check out the github the new boston developers lots of different repos lots of activity on that as well do you have actual advice to self teaching programmers besides the whole stick with the routine so i would say that for selfteaching programmers that it's not a good idea to say i want to learn programming so i'm going to type in programming on amazon and then i'm just going to start reading through a book because with that there is no direction there is nothing to give what you're doing meaning and when you don't know where you're going you don't know where to go it's uh okay i got through this chapter should i go next chapter should i learn this other book so on and so forth now when it comes to um a more clear vision say i want to be a web developer well then things get a little bit easier then you can say okay this company that i want to look for or work for they use django and they use react so i am going to um learn django not for the sake of learning django and hoping that something good happens but i'm gonna learn it because there's a goal at the end and then i'm gonna learn react for this and learning in that sense it becomes more than just learning for the sake of learning you don't get bogged down by oh i have to read documentation or i have to get through this chapter the site in your vision is always on that final goal that final goal which is a lot more satisfying and it's a lot more clear when people learn that way okay lots of uh lots of the same comments kind of spamming oh okay let me go back up back up here hi bucky is a degree in cs worth it um is it worth it hmm it's different for everyone uh for myself it wasn't however for you it may be it's uh it depends on so it doesn't hurt i will say that uh it's not gonna hurt your chances applying somewhere if you say i got like a masters in this area of computing versus if you don't now i will say that some people learn better not in university some people need that pressure of your teacher or someone says look you need to complete this assignment uh you need to create this test you need to finish this degree so on and so forth but some people are just better independent learning some people are better reading books some people learn better watching tutorials so it's different for each person and depending on where you want to go in the path that you need to go to get there um i would say it's i know it's not the answer that a lot of people like to hear but without understanding your background your different methods where you learn best it's uh it's difficult to say all right please make tutorials on ethereum and blockchain okay you got it yes two of my uh newly favorite subject your mic looks like a toothbrush okay no uh no response nina i concur uh helping me all these years you are welcome for that could hurt you financial kyle another good point so yes a degree um that is a thing where a degree at least in the united states it costs a lot of money education costs a lot of money and another i hate saying like downsides to this but um when you go to a university and expect to get a degree after four years what that means is that alternatively if you were to go to a boot camp or selflearn in maybe not have as much knowledge but you would begin uh entering the workforce earlier then you would essentially trade those four years for like three years worth of experience so uh and i will say from uh just everyone that we have hired in the past experienced i would almost always take someone with a oneyear boot camp and three years of developer experience versus four years of university but i don't know again that depends on the type of company okay wow every time i scroll down i feel like i miss all these uh any plans to collab yeah a couple of different collabs in the works thank you a lot of uh very okay uh lots of um people saying thank you for helping out which i appreciate very much and then another slew of comments about how my microphone looks like a toothbrush which it's interesting uh go to canada not a bad idea i don't know if they would like us americans at this point in time but design patterns and the way you explain it would be awesome yeah i like that as well i also like talking about that stuff um it's a little more interesting than uh teaching programming to show how the different parts of language connect and more of a system level another note i want to show you guys let me see it wasn't it was actually a book it's called something maybe one of you guys knows it like um thinking in systems or something but it's not strictly a programming uh book but it's more of a book on like uh systems overall of how things connected how information flows from one part to another and it's useful for like uh building any type of system whether you're making a complex application uh an organization and you just have to have a different teams how does information flow between them it's just um i don't know i'm just really interested in system development for whatever reason api tutorials please another very good recommendation and oh need more mods for chat can i have mods in here oh manage moderators very cool okay how does this work and who's going to be a moderator uh let's see competition thinking protocol buffer grpc any plans yes this seems to be an ever growing area and especially with uh cryptocurrency blockchain yeah i do like that idea as well oh react.js slow mode please for chats is that the thing are you just making that up slow mode for chats i honestly don't know if uh that's a thing or not or if you just made it up but uh yes that that would be useful okay what do we got here uh does it annoy you that technology and programming languages change so fast uh no i actually um i love it so even though it does seem like um especially with like javascript front end pro well you know what a lot of different areas now that i think about it like devops frontend development uh mobile development but i do like it because it isn't changing for the sake sake of changing it's changing for the better it's changing because we have better technologies or we can uh create things faster okay no slow mode hey guys bucky here random guy what a great username uh all right what the heck is going on bucky wait i'm here in no slow mode and then i'm here bucky there is a slow mop it's very confusing how to become a billionaire i would say uh investing in cryptocurrency do you see front end being automated soon uh front you mean front end how do you mean that continue with cli noted uh tutorials on github okay nice shirt bucky yes this is my uh stretched out stretch out what day is it saturday shirt what is the purpose of life i would say that the purpose of life is to collect memories with the people you love because those are the best memories that you can collect bro you're awesome happy to see you happy to see you too uh let's see what is cryptocurrency so cryptocurrency is a currency that exists only in digital form what is my favorite crypto well of course i'm a little biased because we are making our own crypto and of course it has to be the new boston coins uh my second so i wouldn't say i have a a favorite favorite i like um i like bitcoin for what it did for cryptocurrency overall and kind of uh everything that it stands for i like ethereum for its flexibility and how it pushed uh things even further i like monero because of the focus on privacy and yeah a lot of different cryptocurrencies i like and invest in for different reasons buckies uh do i still have that sensory deprivation thing unfortunately not i moved from my house in new york to pasadena california now and i did love that if i ever have a house again i'm definitely getting another one it was a lot of work to maintain i will say a lot more than like a pool or a hot tub and uh the thing i didn't like about it is if you ever want in on vacation or anything because there was so much salt in the water because uh it didn't keep you buoyant that it would like clog up the pipes so you needed to keep it running needed to keep it filtering and you just can't it felt a little bit scary to uh like put on an automated timer or anything because they aren't like the most stable systems and uh it would leak sometimes so you know i was afraid to leave it pumping when i wasn't there because i didn't want everything like blowing up all over all over my living room tron uh not a fan of tron is a cryptocurrency yes spam lots of spam going on all right hold on guys trying to sort through these but i got some spam comment can i buy the new boston somewhere so not right now uh we have plans on the roadmap and maybe i can show you guys this should let me talk to you guys through real quick i know some people are here interested in the uh digital currency that we're making and some people aren't so try to answer it quickly so on our roadmap we're having an authentication system built into the website and then we're gonna have user profiles and more social and then we're gonna have a marketplace where they're gonna be tshirts and uh stickers and like hats and stuff for sale then after that we're gonna allow other people to add items to the marketplace like uh books maybe this elephant and uh those things behind just like uh books artwork uh bracelets whatever people want to sell kind of like ebay craigslist style and then we're gonna add the actual payment integration system in so you can add an item to your cart scan it with your phone or whatever app and then uh like let's say it's a tshirt you can type in whatever information have it mailed to you and then after that we're going to be reaching out to other websites uh actually a couple already reached out that are interested in accepting coins and the first websites that we're going to hit is essentially uh ones that sell digital goods or downloadable goods like online courses or if they have graphics music whatever just because it's such a lowcost good to deliver and then they get coins and also in addition for coins they also get a community of developers and free marketing for their site and our community benefits because we now have something else that we can spend our coins with so that's going to happen slowly over time and also once our marketplace on the new boston.com is complete we are going to be uh not only reaching out to other websites but looking to get on an exchange as well so very exciting times ahead all right what is bitcoin bitcoin is the og cryptocurrency actually wasn't the first but it was the first i don't want to say successful since that means the other ones aren't successful but uh yeah one of the main i'm getting contracted here all right uh how can i okay to answer that question bitcoin is a cryptocurrency how can i buy ethereum without coinbase so there are so there used to be these um these sites you went to kind of like uh craigslist but you had to like meet someone a person and pay them cash i don't know if they still have those but um yeah there are lots of different exchanges aside from coinbase where uh you can buy ethereum and other cryptocurrencies for um well i don't want to say us dollar i don't know where you are but uh other currencies as well bitcoin is good but will not move anymore as a store of value because it's too slow yep uh i can so i i do think bitcoin does have lots of room to grow but it will most likely be a longer term store value more like a gold is right now rather than uh kind of like i don't feel it's going to be used in daytoday transactions all right all right stop spamming guys yes all right uh let's see okay lots of uh a little bit of spam here that's all right okay bucky do you have any plans of starting on index fun or etf i do not unfortunately i'm in the valley near pasadena foo welcome to the h hole of ello oh yeah la's getting pretty rough right now i'm actually off i'm in uh pasadena near la and flying back to see my family in new york and pretty much going from like lax to new york airports and they're like the worst places in the country right now in the world in america which isn't doing too hot either and it's like it in america's spiking like crazier right now it's my great this it's not feeling like the best idea but i haven't seen my family in a very long time oh do you like tie dye i'm indifferent to die die all right uh how can cash be replaced with cryptocurrency uh yeah it's essentially uh when those shops when those stores start deciding to accept cryptocurrency and from technical point of view i don't think it will be anything that foreign to people because they really use cryptocurrency in a way uh even though like cash isn't used for the majority of transactions a lot of it is just digital credit card uh it's just numbers on a computer or on your bank account so really not that far off it's just the underlying method behind it i think will become quite different in a good way all right will the vlogs be back that is hmm that's a good question i was thinking about booting up that channel again but uh to be honest nothing really a vlog worthy to vlog about now uh just because vlogs would pretty much just be me sitting in my apartment and either working on digital currency network or making videos um probably just not the most interesting stuff since i can't really go outside now that we're on lockdown there's a question i just saw that was pretty interesting but i forgot what it was man these comments are coming fast okay okay oh do i believe in aliens okay now we're getting to the important questions do i believe in aliens hmm i'm gonna ask this for a delay since i know that you guys will be interested as well do you believe in aliens but now let's think about this so i i guess the uh the interesting thing about this is we're not exactly sure how life began we have uh different theories of course uh but we have different theories about everything so we do we do know that it's a very unique thing we do know that it's possible also i don't want to get into any uh religious debates either but um i see it it's a very um unique thing in a unique you need a very unique set of circumstances and a lot of it i'm sure happens by chance but i don't see anything scientifically that limits the fact that life can only be created on earth so with that i unfortunately i don't have any experience seeing an alien for myself um no direct evidence of that but i'm openminded that was a good question by the way your heart getting into the good stuff now all right bucky on the plane don't use the bathroom okay i won't uh how am i funding this project so yes so there are funds being spent right now a couple contractors helping out with more specialized areas as well as hosting uh for the new boston uh so on and so forth and we need like to purchase um like wordpress themes and wordpress hosting and uh for the blog and just some like miscellaneous stuff right now i'm just funding it out of my uh personal funds flutter series coming in 2021 is your mic toothbrush yes when did you start working on cryptocurrency and why started working on it uh at the beginning of this year because um i saw some optimizations for the bitcoin blockchain i saw it as a big barrier to adoption and i i wanted to solve the problems that no one else could and i knew that uh yeah if this thing got off the ground then the network that i had through the new boston and through this community that we would be able to make a very big positive impact on the world if things went well which they seem to be going very good right now all right duh okay i like eagles hearts question if you could fly or become invisible which one would you choose if i could fly i mean these are tough both would be great i mean you just can't pass up going invisible i mean animals fly birds fly planes fly but nothing could be invisible so that would be uh you know how can i pass that up okay let's see which is more button field when comparing cloud computing blockchain and big data whoo that is tough so i would rule out big data just because it was budding a while ago i see uh oh blockchain was budding a while ago too but blockchain has had a it's like a second life all of a sudden almost since the um yeah whenever this uh the virus hit in the lockdown began a lot of these things uh crash like or dipped uh cryptocurrency but then they came back very strong and a second bit of interest cloud computing uh i wouldn't even say that's budding i would say that is already butted and we are already in the bud does that make sense in the bud hey we're wrong with it all right uh story behind the new boston this is a pretty bad story where i just thought it sounded cool i didn't know whenever i created the youtube channel the new boston that it would turn into what it turned into if i didn't know that then i definitely would have pop a lot more thought into it but whenever i was just signed up for youtube i'm like what name sounds cool the new boston that sounds pretty cool so sorry to disappoint you on that build a tutorial on how consciousness works so cyberpunk this is a very this is uh interesting that you brought this up because i thought about this specific question for longer than uh i feel like a lot of other people have because i was wondering first to be able to define consciousness and then to be able to translate it into a computer you you get into a lot of um interesting questions like what is consciousness what is life what does it mean what is thinking um and i always go back to kind of uh babies when they're entering life for the first time oh they come out into a universe and they don't they're not familiar with anything they've never seen slights before never smelled never hurt sound and everything's new and they know how to do certain things uh they don't know how to do certain things and they learn a lot of things as well so part of it is what they are and what they are naturally inclined to do and the other part is their environment it's the universe around them in a way it's like um your combination of everything that's around you everything that you've ever ate everything that influenced you so on and so forth but consciousness is a very interesting subject and as far as computing goes which i'm sure a lot of you would be interested in is is it possible for a computer to have consciousness if not why not what makes humans so special that computers will never be able to do because if human consciousness can be broken down to um our brain which is just broken down to biology which can be broken on to chemistry which can be broken down in physics which can be broken down to math then if everything can be broken down to mathematics even consciousness then there's no reason why a computer can't be consciousness can't be conscious because we can program formulas into it maybe a little bit slower with the limitations of technology but to say that would say that you are uh you need a formula for a consciousness a mathematical formula and whether consciousness can be broken down to a formula is something we have yet to find out how do we become master programmers by what means it is only through tutorials of reading books how do we become that programmer that can program a lot of things probably not the answer you're looking for but um practice i would make little projects in one second getting thirsty how do we become master programmers so even that definition is uh it changes like uh got like a helicopter out outside my window so a master is masters in uh different people's eyes but i'll just say lots of practice uh build projects that you're interested in and you're passionate about and eventually you'll get there i like to know more about cryptocurrency and learn to earn okay lots of cryptocurrency on the channel 2021 and also if you want to learn more about cryptocurrency i highly recommend that you join our github since we are working as a community the new boston on which will be the greatest cryptocurrency of all time in my opinion all right let's see this thing outside can you hear that it's like a helicopter or something really annoying me can you be my spirit guide slash accountant hmm hmm yes holy there's a lot of spam okay uh do you know tequila timmy youtube channel i do not do you need a phd not sure with what when do you think we will reach singularity and what our economy will look like after singularity so this is also an interesting thing man uh eagleheart and cyberpunk are just killing it with the questions so that it depends on how you define singularity but what i do see i kind of mentioned this earlier is that we as human beings are we have a drive to build and innovate and create and it appears that things are that we're building something that we don't understand and we're building something big and what we're building even though we may not be able to explain in words what it is what's happening with technology is it's becoming more connected and it's connecting lots of people around the world and it's happening very quickly and innovation is accelerating what the end of this is all i do not know but it's a very interesting path that we are headed down especially with the uh reemergence of ai and lots of different trends as well so when do i think we reach singularity i am not sure and what will our economy look like after singularity i'm not sure either but very different than what it looks like now singularity or not oh okay let's go back back okay uh coin am i making a coin or a token on the blockchain we're making a coin and then i'm getting old to ask this but how can i stop playing games and start coding instead so for this i would say that naturally people would do what they are most passionate about if you enjoy playing games versus uh more than you enjoy building things creating things creating software then it's probably not going to happen uh to start coding instead you need you need a reason or a purpose behind anything you do i like to build things because even when i was first starting out i like the idea that you could sit your computer and you can create something that can potentially connect people all around the world and even now i like it i like um just learning about new technologies new innovations i liked i like what you can do with knowledge and passion and then the community and the software that forms around it just something i'm very passionate about so how can i stop playing games and start coding instead if you're passionate about it then follow your heart favorite teacher or favorite programmer and favorite book so my favorite teacher um so aside from like my favorite teacher in school who was mr pulaski because in fifth grade we used to trade hockey cards and uh i think he also gave me like the good end of the trade he wasn't like ripping kids off so that was just fun but my favorite teacher online right now is uh stephen grider he teaches on udemy and he teaches i just love the way he teaches the way he communicates it's so uh indepth and yeah so and what was the last one favorite book so my favorite programming book is a python cookbook just because it has lots of little neat tips and you don't have to like read it cover to cover you can kind of pick through it my favorite other book is uh oh the place is yogo by dr seuss um it's a lot of has some very it's like a book for kids but uh i don't know it just always resonated with me favorite teacher so that was the one hopping around okay what are your upcoming courses so i'm gonna finish the digital currency tutorials and then the account manager and then after that the main tutorials that you guys are looking for we are going to be rolling out with docker and aws and flutter and then after that we are essentially just going to go to the community and see what you guys want to see or listen to what you guys want to see what makes you motivated to do great things like the new boston everyday what keeps me motivated is the impact that it can have on the world so nothing i think um i think there's different types of incentive different types of motivation of course the main thing is uh financial motivation where i i have a job because i want income i want to live an apartment and i want to eat food um things i'm really passionate about where let's just pretend that everyone in the world got paid the same amount no matter what i would pretty much just be making uh youtube tutorials in teaching just because i love learning new things i like building things i like creating things that don't exist yet and solving problems that no one else has solved before and to be able to do it with the community that supports it and the bigger it gets the better it gets is just can't really ask for anything else favorite programming language in general i would say python it's hard to go uh go wrong with python and let's see developer dylan okay my cur career bucky thank you developer dylan glad i could help you out quadratic funding so this is another interesting concept so the thing about quadratic funding is that you are essentially attempting to it's a way that you are attempting to program the level of value and fairness into a uh cryptocurrency or digital economy the concept of value and fairness is i don't know if it's something that can be programmed into a formula i think it's uh an abstract concept and i think that the definition changes over time and it's different for each and every person so i think that quadratic funding is uh interesting because it solved a lot of the problems with uh fairness that a lot of people agree is you know unfair but i think that it's difficult to program these concepts of fairness of trust of value because even though we can see that these different algorithms exist uh it's almost hard to explain where and this is something else i'm noticing as well where people in a digital economy they have a lot of ideas of what is unfair or so on and so forth but then to go back and say well what is fair it's hard for them to answer because there is no one definition of what is fair what is trustworthy uh if they say where does the value come from and then to ask them how would you define value it becomes tricky it becomes difficult because there is no one answer so to take some of these ideas and programming into uh these different models or algorithms it's it's a different way of looking at it which is always good however i don't think it's the uh final solution probably shouldn't say that final solution i think that means something else is it possible to be anonymous on the internet it is possible to do a lot of things anonymously complete on anonymity is challenging try this background all right how long does it take to learn cryptocurrency you can learn the basics probably in a youtube video uh i don't know if anyone's ever gonna learn the complete uh everything there is to know about all cryptocurrencies since it's an ever growing field but um yeah basics in youtube video you can be pretty comfortable with it understanding the concepts in less than a week and then to dig down into any specific one you it takes a little bit longer okay let's see uh what is your say on go lane i like online actually um i had to port some of my applications over to going just because it is a lot more performant than python for example i think python is very good for um innovating and creating things quickly and even for a web application where you don't need to do a lot of heavy processing typically but um yeah just being able to buy i always want to make sure i don't miss any of these questions but i do like golang for a lot of different reasons pretty much all the ones that they promote on their website okay all program languages are a mess i'm working on my own i've had enough so much confusion and mess that's cool and a lot of the best program languages came from people who felt that same way where there isn't a good solution so they wanted to build a better one so yeah i'm a big fan of that as well what equipment do you use bucky uh so i use a pretty standard equipment this is a blue yeti mic i got a logic logistic webcam it's pretty simple i had to upgrade for my builtin one and then um yeah did you mean like a youtube appointment for recording cryptocurrencies are too unstable on price to use as a daily currency that is true it's a pretty uh volatile market right now probably not the best uh this early on to be like the global currency or anything but i feel like that'll stabilize over time as we've seen with bitcoin at the very beginning and then now it is more stable even though like uh jumps of 10 percent a day aren't a normal do you use vim i do not i've i've used it before but um then i don't i just like uh jet brains ides uh even though i know they have been plugged in so on and so forth but i don't want to seem like a i always feel this funny thing where um when people ask me about different software uh to give my answer it almost feels like in a way i'm like promoting them or something so jeopardians didn't pay me or anything but i mean i just really love their ides and for as complex as their ids and any are whenever they have a new release it's like majority of the time things just work so i don't know what their development process is but jet brains they got they got their stuff together tuna bacon cheese okay tbc wow the new boston coin tuned bacon cheese whoa all right when is flutter come in 2021 what kind of knowledge can we look for about anonymous what resources can you uh advise me i actually left a post i think it was on reddit a while ago about uh the best thing that you can do to be anonymous um let's see let's just see how much i remember the first thing that you can do is well you need a device you need a device to connect with the internet and if you purchase that device using a credit card or using uh any type of means where they can track you even cash where okay there's a receipt for it but now a bunch of cameras pointing towards you then uh essentially then your identity is tied to it in one way or another especially with credit card or if you pay for it online then of course that device is always going to be tied to you so the best thing that you can do in that is probably get it at a flea market or get it from uh means where your identity is not tied to that device another thing is do not use windows for sure uh i don't know i would just stick with linux i'll say that and probably something like tails since it's an entire distribution built around privacy and then for that you essentially just need to go step by step of every bit along the network uh you want nothing tied to you as much as possible maybe use tor maybe use vpn so on and so forth but those are uh different means that you can use what stack would you choose in building your next big project so this would depend on what the project is for a web application i mean i i gotta rock with uh yeah it it also depends on the architecture if you want to distribute data uh micro service architecture uh is it a desktop application does it have heavy processing is it just a web application where you can just use django and scope scale horizontally so on and so forth but it it's um it's not a one programming language or one stack fits all solution it's more of what are you trying to achieve and then choosing the best technology to fit around that uh how do you compare react angular and view so i haven't used angular in a very long time i re view i know is lightweight react is i it's hard to find too many bad things about react especially with the growth the community um the popularity i of course i'm biased but come on how can you hate react okay let's see this uh what is your take on a lot of newbies learning python is their first language one of my friends learn it but he got stuck on easily because of simplicity yeah this was uh interesting as well because someone asked earlier about c and whether it was a good first language to learn so with python you aren't going to understand the concepts that you do with c with a pointers memory management with the low level things that you would typically learn but what it does provide especially for beginners is an easy entry into programming and they get to be familiar with programming and they don't get frustrated because of some of those more challenging concepts so i i would say it's a tradeoff if they know that they want to understand the fundamentals of programming and how languages are built overall um i would recommend c but if they want to learn programming from a different perspective and maybe they don't care so much but they want to build great things and they want to build tools that they can use for their career later on then yeah python is fine okay let's see uh domains in the field of computer science have good pay and scope in the future so one of the things that has very good pay and i believe it had good pay for a while is um devops with network architecture cloud computing aws um learning about networking and devops is something especially focusing on cloud computing is something that is going to be increasing popularity and we're always going to need it and it is always one of the top paying career fields however what i would also suggest in this decision is you don't want to go into a career field strictly because it has high pay because even though it's gonna be great for a while a year or two you're gonna quickly find that you're in a position where you ended up in a career that you don't really enjoy and you're going to have to work for a very long time as most of us are before we reach retirement and given that such a large part of your life is going to be spent in the workplace you want to make sure that you don't need to like uh have it be your full passion but you need to or you should be in a job that makes you happy all right uh how do you become so good in so many languages uh i would say for any language it's just lots of studying if you're interested about it it helps a lot and i was genuinely interested about install m lots of different uh programming languages just because of what they can do so um yeah i think i think that's a big thing where if you're interested in something it it's a lot easier to become good at it because the motivation comes from yourself rather than external factors all right let's see machine learning in the future um yes this is a big thing people are requesting i didn't have it planned before this little you know uh live stream whatever you want to call it this turned out to be a very long test by the way but uh i am finding out now that a lot more people are interested in machine learning than i originally thought so that is moving up on the menu let's see spam okay a course on blockchain please come in soon toothbrush side of your headphones all right uh name tech i mentioned this but let me brief touch on it briefly what is the story behind tuna i started using tuna for variables as well as bacon not to be funny but to differ to allow beginner developers to differentiate between builtin keywords and their selfname variables since whenever i was learning programming i saw something like var num equals six and i it was hard for me to tell which was a builtin reserve keyword and then which was a variable name so that's when i started using uh tunein big and also it's kind of funny too so object tuna yeah that's what we're talking about let's see let's see okay these are moving pretty quick ah okay i find myself in a position where i can't do the practice because of the lack of thoughts about applications i can't think anything to practice uh so i believe you mean like um uh after you learn the concepts of a programming language it's hard to know where to go from there because uh it's just hard to come up with um ideas on things to create or maybe the ideas that you come up with are way too big like uh game development and of course if you're just learning the concepts it's hard to do game development so this is an interesting question um it's it's interesting because i kind of do things uh the inverse of that where it isn't so much i learn a certain concept or language and then later on um deciding what to build with it it's more so that i always have a vision or a project in mind and i know that just from just community of programmers that there are certain languages that i should learn to best create this so i would say that maybe that's a better avenue if you start with a project in mind and then learn technology in order to build that project it may give a little bit more clear direction uh motivation as well and just maybe overall so i'll try that holy moly okay webassembly spam coming on hot uh why do you go quiet for some time i would check out my hello world video it explains lots of that and let's see let's see uh did you try to restream for streaming so i was actually comparing a stream yard versus restream and caleb curry recommended streamyard so i just tried it i actually just uh set up my account and like bought the paper today seems to be pretty cool i did watch a review on restream vs stream yard and everything basically just said that it came down to preference and the uis look pretty similar so uh yeah now we're on streaming best mobile app framework this is a tough one as well i i don't know they're uh it seems to be uh kind of like reacting angular in view a lot of it honestly comes down to personal preference uh would you like elaborate on networking and cloud computing are there any topics you recommend to get started tcp uh writing your own server and php node so not so much writing your own server and php uh or node i would say start with the basics of networking as far as how do i p addresses work um in just the basics of overall network like uh difference between a router and a switch uh kind of more so the core networking fundamentals and then afterwards you can look into things like um aws and that seems to be a big one now and a lot of those have a pretty clear path for getting certified of a kind of a chain of certifications that you can go through and when you are applying for jobs certifications for cloud computing is a big thing so they'll tell you exactly through practice exams and guides what they are looking for and what you need to know to get those certifications but if you are actually looking for a job in cloud computing then i would essentially learn the basics and then go with aws certifications and that will get you to a really solid point uh let's see let's see let's see have you ever experienced burnout too much coding if it's possible to be burnt out of doing things which you like so uh there i did experience burnout before but it wasn't for it was because at work uh we were building software and it was software that i i wanted to create perfectly but it it like wasn't my idea or it was just like uh joining a company and creating software it wasn't something i was super passionate about as far as like uh the personal projects uh i wouldn't say i got burnt out it's just at the end of them like i made this application to predict uh what horses could win in horseradish racing for bedding uh that was pretty cool but i got to the end of it and then i saw that the uh the edge for the horse tracks like the casino basically was just way too high so i'm not burnt out for the projects that we work on is a community like for the open source project it's going to be very difficult to get burnt out just because you're not developing a project for like the sake of learning programming or anything even though a lot of people come and improve their skills on and so forth but it's goal at the end of it is a bigger meaning and that meaning is as long as the site is there it's never going to burn out so uh yeah i guess uh now that you got me thinking about it it's you can burn out in software development if you work on projects that you aren't really passionate about or don't really enjoy but when you have a project that you're really passionate about and something that you do enjoy it's almost like how can you get burned out by doing something you enjoy all right i am back from sleeping are you still streaming still streaming i was on stream for a couple hours that was a quick little nap how to start with selfdriving cars from scratch wow okay uh i would start with my how to build a gokart tutorial and then automate the crap out of it uh why collaboration with caleb and when you get to know him this man is teaching legend uh yeah caleb's awesome i just got to know him recently uh he reached out to me i joined this little discord community for youtubers and he was there and he just got talking and i don't know he is cool dude how do you learn something new uh i learn based on a bigger project that i'm trying to build and usually it's the technology that i know that i have to learn to build that project so uh it's essentially just part of figuring out how to build something all right all right what is your learning process this is a good one too i always i scroll down a little bit and then people leave ton of comment okay where'd you go where did you go where did you go question okay it looks like you're not gonna find that one again oh here we go sophisal drawl what is your learning process so my learning process now and as it was before is whenever i need to learn a new language or a new technology for the very first time first place i go is to amazon and i just look for the top rated books i look to make sure that they're recent if the technology itself is recent and then i get usually two or three of them just since i don't get to see the full preview and i do like ordering physical books still it's just uh a lot easier for me to read uh for some reason and then i just start going through it and i i have this thing actually i'll show you this little book stand that i can put my book in and have it right next to my computer and i just start going through page by page learning everything and if i can't find a really good book then what i like to do is uh go to udemy and see if they have any video courses as well as youtube for video courses or just different places online so through those means uh it's usually it usually gives me a pretty solid understanding and also recently what i like to do is go to udemyfirst and go through video course since it gives me since it gives me kind of a brief overview of the main concepts and then after that i would go to my book and get a little bit deeper dive into some of the concepts all right let's see winning on chad could you recommend any open source projects about beginners so yes uh all right hit the two i hate to keep bringing this up but um on so we have uh open source projects if you go to the new boston.com clam clown what if you go to the new boston.com and click on the little github link then we're building a digital currency and we are also very open to new developers so whatever your experience level whether you're brand new to programming and you just want to learn how to contribute to an open source project or if you are a senior developer engineer designer marketer seo uh we're building something that is in my mind going to be very big so uh yeah come on in we'll love to have you want to say thank you your videos help me out a lot in college well i am glad that they could help you and let's see okay someone submitting issues on the uh open source project right now how many programming languages do you know bucky so this is interesting because knowing a programming language is uh a little bit hard to define since uh there are programming languages that i typed like hello world before i wouldn't say i know those and even now being experienced as a like um developer uh knowing python on the back end it feels like it feels like the more i learn the more that i understand that i don't learn and even the developers of the python core team i would a lot of them feel like they're areas of the project that they don't know just because they only work on a certain subset at a time so it's uh difficult to answer yes thank you no need to spam i will read your questions however this spam is making it difficult to um kind of read all these different questions python web dev is any good yes i would say it is good crow academy i was inspired by your videos a lot years ago well thank you lots of new videos coming soon ai vs this is another one disaster master cool name by the way adverse blockchain what is which will be more in demand oh this is good i don't know what do you guys think both by the way are looking strong for the future yeah this one's thump me i guess uh i would say both i want to choose one but i can't i see both of them with a very bright future eagleheart says blockchain by far so go or rust man this is uh another tough one both of those are very good too watch your videos a lot in the past now i make 70k in a year creative dev sounding good uh do you have any tutorials regarding linux os for beginner yes i have uh intro to linux or maybe it's just called linux tutorials but uh if you type in the new boston linux then it'll pop up i like linux by the way ai seemingly has more options than blockchain ai could be integrated into almost anything interesting perspective do you have advice for getting started with the game modding this other question too uh for game modding i actually don't have to much experience with game modding believe it or not i'm not a big gamer myself which sounds weird since uh you know they're very big on programming and whatnot surviving the wilderness 3 probably not that was maybe i think two is enough for that is ruby and aspect j dead i hate to say that any what technology would i consider that it's not that it's not to pick a technology that to say is dead um i don't know too much about aspect j uh ruby definitely not any video coming from machine learning complete project so machine learning is something that is okay it's definitely on the menu for 2021 that's actually going to be a pretty fun series to make played played php is dead though don't hear too much buzz about php that's for sure nowadays dead is tricky to classify anything is that but yeah i probably wouldn't recommend going down php avenue python django i actually do have a python django series i actually uh now that you guys are talking about php what is the trend of php like you know they have those stack overflow uh you can pretty much see the trend of different technologies will you film tutorials about metasploit i think that i did actually yeah i think i have a series about metasploit every two interview for uh oh this is a good question ever took interview for a young dev what do you seek in a new dev so at uh my job i'm the director of engineering and have to hire a lot of people and there are times where people would come in and there would be experience developers and i'm working on a web application so there are experienced developers that are just familiar with different technologies or their attitude wasn't quite a right fit for the team and then there were younger developers that just got out of a boot camp or some that even learned on their own and they were really passionate about programming and they told me about all these side projects that they had going on on their own time and their attitude and the way that they approach learning and solving problems and the passion that they had is just uh it's a handsdown better fit than someone who's experienced and feels like not the best fit for the team so i would say for a young developer um if you're passionate about programming then apply for a job so this is another thing with developers with every developer out there you should be applying for jobs that are higher skill level than you think that you can get you should always be aiming higher than where you think because it's almost like the value of yourself as a software developer is what you teach the world that your value is so always aim higher apply for jobs higher than the position that you think you deserve and that would be my advice and even as a young developer um looking at your very first application it doesn't hurt to apply at places where you think you might be rejected the worst case scenario is that they can say no thanks and they say it politely and then you end up in the exact same situation as you were and nothing bad happened best case scenario is you get this job and you get to learn a bunch of cool stuff so yes it may be a little bit of pressure in the first uh week or two and you may have a bit more of a learning curve but that's what it's about pushing yourself and eamonn hunt why do you wear a hat while you're inside so i wear this hat because i have these headphones and you see how they're all like beat up inside so if i don't have this hat on specific specifically then these little flakes always get all over my ears and stuff so this is pretty much just uh an ear protector for these uh things that are flaking holy lots of spam here oh one second let me sift through the spam how are you doing this pandemic i'm digging it i'm digging the quarantine i mean you wake up you can wear shorts uh you know don't have to commute to work wear sweatpants it's not bad the whole you know what's going on and how it's impacting people's lives not that great bob all right please bring your videos here is about competitive programming so you're just a good source to learn it also how to join your open source project so the video series about competitive programming noted and how to join your open source project if you go to thenewboston.com then i would first suggest joining the slack community and for that on the home page you can click the little slack icon and if you just want to dig right into the code then you can either click on the little github logo or there's a section called tasks tasks that you can go and see everything there is to work on but for joining it i would highly recommend uh joining the stock community and then in intros introducing yourself telling us about your background and then uh we'll find a team to put you on because it just feels like people are more part of the community that way a little more engaged good morning from lagos nigeria what up over in lagos and this guy's name is or girl is oauth i like that very cool also nigeria is uh kind of doing awesome in uh cryptocurrency lately i i saw on google trends that nigeria is one of the top countries that has lots of interest in it did you ever try creating your own programming language bucky i did not r which language should i learn after java so this uh depends what you want to do with java maybe not another language but maybe uh something that is java specific why are you up at 2 a.m so from what you yep so for me it's on the uh oh midnight how long wow i thought i was streaming for like 40 minutes two and a half hours dang time flies all right views on flutter i am pro flutter and flutter's coming in 201 uh flutter overreact it's uh debatable okay all right 2021 resolution 2021 resolution uh the main thing is just so we have a road map for the digital currency project that i am looking forward to probably more than anything else in 2021 and then aside from that i just want to make lots of videos i want to make a lots of uh tutorials and get everything up in a buzzing again i am very excited about that as well to get back into the groove of things and now that we have an open source project an awesome community uh i'm feeling very good about 2021 especially compared to 2020 which it really isn't 20 20 even set that high of a bar let's be honest so um just looking forward to 2021 in general also in general another thing about this is i'd i'm not a big fan of resolutions because i feel like if there's something in your life that you want to improve you shouldn't have to wait till january 1st is there something in your life that you want to improve you just start improving it right away in aside aside from that it's also a good read um interesting that i'm not a fan of retros so if you work for a software company you know you have retros like uh with each sprint at the end of it i feel like people just save up the problems for like every two weeks where it's like yo if there's a problem or something you think that we could improve then you could just like mention it like a week and a half ago when this came up didn't need to save it for retro but in a way new year's resolutions are kind of just like retros in a way like what can we do better next year uh so and so forth all right so object oriented is okay so the question was what is object oriented object oriented is uh like a design pattern where instead of programming with individual functions then you use something called uh classes in objects and it allows you to store like um how can i explain this it allows you to store like state and memory with certain bits of code it's kind of hard without a text editor in front of me showing everything but there you go 2021 uninstall facebook and burn your tv that is actually not bad advice i already did uninstall facebook on all my uh mobile devices not because like i'm i'm not like a huge fan of facebook first of all but it seemed to be just be killing my battery and burn your tv i don't know if my tv would burn but also not that bad of device all right let's see how do you see the new boston in five years i have very high hopes for the new boston in five years um especially after i announced the digital currency project since it has a lot of support and it's growing very strong and we we're still in alpha right now not even in beta so i can't imagine when this thing gets the beta and after we have a marketplace release on exchange things are going to be happening very quickly looking forward to it waiting for flutter tutorial from new boston me too it's on the way uh when are they coming they're coming in 2021 early 2021 it's one of the earliest things uh let's see let's see what up whoa okay lots of comments coming in all of a sudden uh how do you feel about visual coding uh visual coding i'm not i'm not familiar with visual coding what time is it bro it's 12 14 or i am slightly after midnight but it's saturday so whatevs we're just rolling with it how's it going going great actually uh this comment says and how to start a fire oh you taught me three languages and how to start a fire that's really the four things i wanted to accomplish in your life so as long as you know three new languages and how to start fire then yeah mission accomplished what is the bucky's language choice to build a web application in 2021 nothing fancy here i'm gonna go with uh for a web application as long as it's not too processing intensive i would just stick with uh python django and react on the front end especially with bringing on new developers or growing it i mean they're such popular languages and they're growing in popularity it's it's really nice to get a solid application up quick iterate and you know nothing bad to say about those can i buy some tmb currency not at the moment we are still in alpha but after this we go beta and then we release and then at that time we're going to be uh getting on exchanges so you can't buy it yet but you can earn it which language is best to learn game programming so this is actually interesting um look into unity so in uh also another thing about game programming is i'm not a game program i never made a like a production level game so i'm probably not the best person to ask about that colin jetpack or react who those are uh uh they're just uh different technologies for different things uh after okay so it's alpha beta and then the next stage in like the software development life cycle is stable release or some people call it production but basically alpha is like almost development uh beta is this should be ready but it probably still has some bugs that we have to iron out you know get it security audited tested and so on and so forth and then at the end of beta you feel that your software is ready to go uh there's no more bugs you can find no more security holes and it's ready for production release so it's it's either called a stable release or production you know depending on terminology you use it's the same thing though okay whoa lots of comments guys these duplicate comments they're filtering out all the good questions how many computers do you have now i only have okay i don't know if so i have five but three of them are laptops and two of them are laptops that i never use one's a linux one and one's a windows one just for when i need those but usually i develop on mac just because i just like their uh products and they're unixbased which is important for the things that i built uh let's see okay come back coming back come back uh i've been on tech was ripping off your content he owes you don't know who that is but yeah if you owes me then you know what are you gonna do about it yo me ivan okay i'm a college student with not too much experience in oss how do i support the digital currency project so if you don't have too much experience and you want to learn then that's fine then there's lots of different areas in the digital currency project which is a cool thing and some you don't even have to be a developer for we have a backend team we have a frontend team we have seo we have marketing we have design we have people who are just community managers who help out around the community lots of different areas where even if you are a beginner developer and you want to kind of dip yourselves in open source development or you just want to hang out join the community that's cool come on in but lots of different areas and we accept lots of different skill levels no matter how new or how experienced you are so come in and we'll find a place for you computer specs so uh whenever i so on my macs they're pretty much maxed out aside from um the video card since i don't really do like uh video editing or i don't need a gpu for anything really just like programming you don't really need a lots of processing power and i believe my hard drive as well since a lot of the information i just store on the cloud okay let's see a local no code movement low code no code i'm not familiar with that actually loco no code what's your favorite ide i love jetbrains ide uh why upper keeps rejecting my profile i don't know and let's see tell me more about your crypto stuff what would you like to know would you consider making videos on ue4 or unity um i made a lot of videos on unreal engine before like quite a few i actually don't even remember if i made tutorials on unity or not but um probably not for the it a lot of these things i'm not sure of because a lot of it depends on what people want to see so okay bro you play video games i don't i'm not a gamer uh i play games i actually have a nintendo switch that i really like i like it because i can bring it on a plane and i don't know i just think it's uh pretty fun i like building or i like playing games that you like build systems like minecraft or i forgot these games but like you put things together and the system becomes more complex and more complex and you have to manage things i'm not a big fan of like first person shooters or anything like that all right all right what program language should i learn first uh if you don't know anything and just don't know where to start it's hard to go wrong with python okay man okay machine learning is quickly coming up on this how does a crypto get into an exchange so this is a james payne is this the same james that's a developer on the project so um there are different types of exchanges you have decentralized exchanges which are uh they are less uh official less regulated basically any exchange that allows people to add one type of cryptocurrency and trade it for another type of cryptocurrency uh most of the time when people talk about cryptocurrency exchanges they're talking about centralized exchanges like coinbase or kraken and in that case each of these have different their own rules on what you need to do to get in and a lot of them are kind of vague as well like the development community needs to be active or the cryptocurrency needs to be stable however the definition of active or stable so on and so forth are really in their hands but each of these exchanges essentially has a list of guidelines of what you need to do before you can apply to get on that exchange so it is different for each one any projects for horse racing i actually spent a lot of time uh building a application to analyze different horses um their different attributes and believe it or not there is a lot a lot of information when it comes to analyzing horses like not only their um their different speeds but their uh race history their parents their medication that they're on uh how they're racing uh the different turf and the firmness so on and so forth i had no idea that there's this much data but the reason that i really got into it was because first of all this horse track that is just uh cool to watch and i was interested in what factors uh resulted in horses winning the race and the main thing that i started out with is is it mainly the horse or is it something else because in a horse race you have the horse itself which you know it's genetics uh it's how it trained however but you also have the jockey and different jockeys have different win percentages mostly based on like experience but you also have trainers as well so the main thing i was trying to figure out is if you had a horse is a horse going to win no matter what jockey or what trainer has or if you had a horse that didn't perform so well but you gave a really nice jockey and a really strong trainer then would that have more of an impact and if it was the horse then how much did its race history matter how much does its age matter maybe some things that people don't think of really matter like how long is its tail well maybe uh most people just disregard that but maybe there is a strong correlation so just taking all of these different factors and then plugging them together where not only these individual factors that you can kind of wait but in combination as well where maybe this horse doesn't do good but it when it runs with this jockey on this type of turf then it always does good so just to find those things it was not only an interesting challenge to program but also to look at the results of okay this was what we decided uh is horse that's gonna be most likely to finish first and often so so here's the interesting thing as well on topic of all this and it's the last point and then i'll stop talking about horses but at first what i was doing whenever i was making this application is i was just using all these different variables to do like machine learning and figure out which horse would most likely come in first in the race i figured the horse that's most likely to come in first is the one that you want to bet on but that is not the case because what you also need to consider is the rate in which they will win so if there is a horse that you think has a 60 chance of winning a race now if that horse wins then you might get like um 20 on your money so if you bet a dollar you might get a dollar tony back now so let's say that horse had a 60 chance of winning there can be another horse that only has a 40 chance of winning but if this horse wins then you triple your money so you essentially just can't run it through this algorithm and look at the results because it it doesn't give you the best results over time what you need to do is run it through more realistic simulation uh considering the betting odds as well and whenever i did that what my program uh did is it really really loved to gamble on the underdog horses almost every one of its picks was like a forty to one undershot or or uh an underdog so it really loved finding these horses that had a pretty low chance of winning now the interesting thing in all of that was that these horses that any normal human being would go to horse track and they would see oh this horse has no chance uh the program was very good at picking these underdog horses that had that ended up in the top three very often so uh it was just the results that i thought it was going to give was so different than what it actually gave and what it said was the best formula and um i don't know it's just something interesting so yes in exile 5a that was my long answer to that oh okay i keep seeing these things and i try to read it but then it pops down okay vs code or pycharm i mean i gotta go with pie jar i'm very biased towards jet brains ides roller coaster tycoon that is a good one actually looked in that for switch but it didn't have that high of a rating so uh is the stream being uploaded this is actually the second stream and it was it's just like a test stream that is turning into a longer stream so is it being uploaded i would say yeah i can save it it's cool can devops engineers do development work also uh that just depends on your skill set we have some devops engineers that are also backend engineers and that's mainly because uh so when writing scripts it's usually a lot of it is python scripts in a lot of cases so yeah they definitely can okay let's see university student with not much experience is there any way to contribute to coins so yes uh the cool thing about this project in the new boston open source development community is there is no restriction on the experience level whether you're just starting out in programming whether you've been programming for a long time there is a position for everyone so come on in join a community we would love to have you and if you're new to open source development then you can learn you get better that's what everything's about here is it an erc20 it is not it is something completely different than anything that exists however we are going to have a wrapped coin to get it on these decentralized exchanges so just like wrap bitcoin we're gonna have uh wrap the new boss in which is gonna be an erc20 coin uh for that reason will this channel focus mostly on cryptocurrency now or other stuff too so we only have two more well one is partly done the digital currency tutorial series and the other one is the account manager series we have planned which is essentially the desktop application that we have for connecting to the network but then after that uh it's it's pretty much just going to be back to basics with uh docker aws flutter lots of programming lots of software related tutorials but for now since there is a big barrier for people understanding what the project's all about and how everything works i do want to get these tutorials out there and pumped out just so you know it kind of helps development but then in 2021 pretty much going back to basics okay let's see let's see let's see would you rather fight to the death with five chicken sized horses or a one horsesized chicken five chickensized horses oh i could crush shows i could crush those horses easily i mean it would be no contest and then one horsesized chicken that may be a little bit more of a battle i can see that messing me up pretty bad so definitely uh would be happy to fight five chickensized horses i would just absolutely demolish them all right i'm not really gonna hurt those animals by the way unless they come after me first then game on you know project is going to be so successful our project first of all but uh thank you and i agree thank you for the support why do vulnerabilities occur all the time is because when something gets updated it's just because um technology grows quickly and when you grow things quickly there are just some spots that kind of just like bugs where building anything uh quickly there are some areas that you overlook uh different use cases that you didn't consider especially with users where you expect them to use your software in a certain kind of way but they almost never do and they find all kinds of new ways to break it a lot of it is unintentional as well glider back computer science okay how can you earn crypto so the crypto that we are building the idea behind it is that the value comes from what you put into it so you earn it by improving the network fixing bugs joining a team helping out the community so on and so forth but it's not anything that as of now you can buy on any exchange mainly because there is still an alpha now and the network is young but no buying so far you have to earn it by helping out the network or helping out the project all right all right all right how much were your crypto be worth min twin um so that is actually going to be up to the market i am assuming hoping quite a quite a bit chat is too fast wtf why am i burping all the time now nice uh chad is too fast wtf i agree tala not even gonna say that just embarrass myself i like turtles me too aren't the horses euthanized when they are injured uh yeah i believe so and that and that was actually uh a big thing at the race well i'm sure you guys don't want to hear about horse racing all the time but um yeah just one last thing at the horse track in or it's not actually in pasadena but san anita real quick close to where i live there's like a a record number of horses being injured on the track that they have to put down and no one really understands why all these horses like it's not more than average it's like this crazy amount of horses that keep getting injured at this one specific track and they thought it was something with the firmness of the track or something like that but yeah it's just like a big mystery in the horse racing community on this track why do horses keep getting injured uh let's see how do you market yourself as a developer i would say by through your skills through your skills uh just being a very strong developer all right probably got a couple more questions here then i gotta peace out oh favorite food i do like some mac and cheese ah let's see what's your guys favorite food pizza especially 99 cent pizza in new york city can't beat it wow that's all it thoughts all right do you still use ergonomic mouse and glows i have to ergonomic mouse in this without it carpal tunnel symptoms get uh pretty bad i watch your video on ten standard after eight years started my own channel you're my inspiration bucky desi coder thank you very much actually i'm gonna check out your channel desi coder how can i join the project if you go to thenewboston.com there is a section that says join the community in one of the menus then you can either join slack or github so on and so forth but i would recommend joining slack and gal why are you using a headphone uh because if i don't then the sound comes from my computer uh and instead of going through my ears it goes to the mic and it creates an echo tacos i just see tacos here oh from the question i asked oh yeah that's another one that's an a very good what is your cultural background nothing fancy born in uh northern new york basically canada and i'm 1 8 filipino great grandpa believe it was and that's as spicy as i get otherwise everything else is pretty much just like boring white standard white person i'm from india please guide for cyber security cyber security that would be another interesting series okay all right lots of cool stuff all right so three hours i think this is good for a test um so streaming works and apparently you guys like to watch a stream as well so i'm definitely going to do this again so thank you everyone for all your questions and i'll maybe i'll schedule this uh so you know i didn't give anyone a heads up i wasn't expecting to stream for three hours today but yeah i see all the comments coming in now thank you guys thank you guys for uh hanging out with me asked some questions and it was fun so do it again now all right so i gotta go i'm pretty hungry but uh yeah thank you guys again and i will post on social media and also schedule on youtube when i'm streaming again so thank you and i'll see you later
