hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video tutorial we're going to look at the document ready functionality and how we can use it in our page to perform a specific set of operations when we load our page now the document ready functionality is part of implementing jQuery and setting everything up so when the document has loaded we can actually start to perform a specific set of functions or something within our page this is important because we don't always want to just allow a user to click something and then perform an action we might want something to happen as soon as our page is loaded and we can also use this as an example of implementing jQuery in order to for something to happen when we start our page up so let's go ahead and start writing out the code now I'm going to create an area here which is a div I'm going to give this div an ID and then I'm going to simply close it here so the ID is just going to be message and this is going to be welcome to my website now the main aim of this video is to when the page loads we want this to automatically fade in so so we need to make this div actually initially hidden so I'm going to use an inline style attribute which I highly discourage I'm just using it for the purposes of this tutorial obviously if you're using CSS it's extremely good practice to put this in a separate file however just for the purposes of this tutorial I'm going to use the style attribute so I'm going to say displaynone and this will just hide this the contents of this div when we load up our page so let's refresh you can see that we have nothing although we do actually have a div here now what we're going to do with jQuery is when the document loads we're actually going to fade this div in so it's the opacity going to start zero and it's going to graduate and eventually be a hundred so 100% visibility so we have jQuery included down here however we want to create an another file which handles the fading in of this div so let's go ahead and create another file and let's just save that inside of our J's folder and I'm just going to call this init Jas now I've caught it in it because it's this is short for initial light initialization or initiation sorry and inside of here we're going to actually use the document ready functionality so I'm going to use a dollar sign and I'm going to say document then I'm going to say dot ready so this here is the function ready this here is the reference and that's the reference to our overall document inside I'm going to create a function and I'm going to create the blocks here and I'm going to pull that down so essentially now what we've done is in here after our document is ready everything inside of this will be run okay so we can either call external functions for example we might have a function up here called load posts and we could say when the document is ready load posts okay so that's an example of what we could do however just for now we're going to create some simple functionality and just embed it within this function so what we need to do is we need to reference this ID which has an ID of message or reference this div sorry which has an ID of message so let's go ahead and do that so dollar sign hash message remember we using hash to reference the element dot fade in and then we're going to give it an a parameter of fast and this will just fade it in quickly in fact let's just do slow so we get more of the effect and visible so now what we've done is on the document ready status we have faded in using the fade in font at a time of slow you can also use a numerical value in here so an integer such as a thousand which would be one seconds because this is a one second because this is in milliseconds or you can use textual representations of speed so I'm going to use sorry not show slow and this will fade in the message div so remember we've initially hidden it however this functionality will actually start to gradually show it until it's at 100% visibility so let's go ahead and just refresh the page okay so it's not working and the I I know why it's not working we've created out init j/s file how we've not included it onto our page so again this is extremely important we create a script here to include this external file so the type is text forward slash JavaScript the source again we've saved it in our j/s folder and this is init j s so let's go ahead back to our browser and refresh again and you can see that this div has just faded in so using the ready functionality R and referencing the document we can perform a series of operations based on when the document has loaded and we can then you know do things like call external functions for example to load a specific set of news or anything so this is an extremely useful part of implementing jQuery to actually allow you to perform things when your page has loaded
