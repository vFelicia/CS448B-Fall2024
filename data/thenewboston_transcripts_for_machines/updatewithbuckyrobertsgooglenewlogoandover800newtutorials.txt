what is going on guys it's Bucky and I just want to give you guys a quick update to talk to you guys about a few things that you might find pretty interesting first of all the new Boston now has a new logo so if you go to the website or the forum you can check out the logo I think it's pretty cool before we didn't even really have a logo we just had some text that said the new Boston wasn't real exciting but now we have an official logo it's pretty cool so go check it out give me some feedback tell me what you guys think so anyways aside from that another thing I want to mention is I now have a Google+ account or profile whatever it's called I never even had a Facebook before so I'm like the only guy in the world that doesn't have a Facebook I know but everyone was begging for me to get a Facebook or a Google+ account so I finally made a Google+ account in I absolutely love it it's awesome it's amazing I love connecting with everybody so make sure to add me on Google+ I'll add a link in the description below so please click on it and add me and you can follow me I'll keep you guys updated like on my love life and all my I'll make sure to post some embarrassing embarrassing pictures for you guys and also a lot of people always ask me when I'm doing my live shows and I don't really have a schedule so what I'm gonna be doing is if you follow me on Google+ I'm gonna be putting out an announcement of when I'm doing my live shows then so then you can go ahead follow me read my announcement and catch my live shows and you can watch them there so anyways make sure to follow me please and keep you guys updated on everything about the new boss and also some stuff about my personal life as well so anyways those are two things I want to talk about in the last thing I want to talk about is this over the less I think it's been like three years since I started the new Boston the support I received from you guys has been absolutely incredible more than I can even put in words it's grown bigger than I can ever imagine it has I think like a hundred and thirty eight thousand subscribers now it gets over a hundred twenty thousand views each today and even my form has like ten thousand members now so everything is just grown so big and I realize it's kind of like this here's what I was thinking about you know the other day when I was a little kid I had to go to school and then the babysitter's and I really didn't want to but you know you go to school cuz you have to and then the teacher gives you homework and you come home and you do it even though you really don't want to and then you graduate high school and you go to college not that you know you're really thrilled about going to college just you know what you're supposed to do something really fun having to take all those classes and everything but it's what you're supposed to do and then you get a job that you probably really don't like but a lot of people get jobs that you know they just like struggle going to work every day and it's like so many things in everyone's life are just you know they're ok you just kind of struggle through life and they're not really happy but with this channel you guys have given me the opportunity to do something I absolutely love and for that I can't thank you enough it's been an amazing adventure an amazing experience and you know something that I would have never had opportunity to do if it wasn't for you guys and I know a lot of you guys are watching me and I can't even express the guys how much this means to me so first let me say thank you for giving me this amazing opportunity and I know I can say thank you day in and day out and you're like alright you're welcome I know you appreciate my gratitude but thank you can only go so far so I wanted to do something to show you guys how much it meant to me so as you know over the past you know a few years or whatever I created roughly 1,700 videos and right now the new busting has about 1,700 videos on our channel so people demand more videos day in and day out but the truth is I don't have time to create all these videos I wish I could I would love to do it but I have a fulltime job and I just don't have time to create all the topics of tutorials of all the subjects and lessons that you guys want so what I've been doing for the last month is I've been recruiting some of the best youtubers from all around the world to give you guys at tutorials that you guys wanted most so you guys always write to me in my form in comments and you guys probably think I never read them but I actually do I've been listening to you guys I've been reading what's Oreos you guys want in by far you guys have demanded for tutorials above the rest so like I said I've been recruiting some of the best youtubers and tutorial developers from all over the world and right now as we speak in development I have four people working on one person's working on a series of 200 brand new Photoshop tutorials another person's working on 200 brand new uptodate csharp programming tutorials another person is working on 200 incredible jQuery tutorials and the last person is working on yes you guys wanted by far the most requested tutorial of all time on my channel 200 amazing from the best developer there is out there brand new Android development soils so of course we got four people developing 800 tutorials exclusively for the new Bossin and of course this allows me to free up my time and continue developing advanced UDK tutorials and then I'm going to be jumping into unreal script so in the next two months I don't want to say I don't know how long it's gonna take them but probably from one month to two month the Newton buffs oh I can't even talk now the new Boston is gonna be adding roughly 1000 new amazing tutorials from what you guys wanted to know so there you go that's what I've been doing I know I haven't made a video in a while but trust me I have been working on buff Trent trying to convince these people to make these tutorials and it finally paid off so that's what you guys have had to look forward to so anyways you guys talked I'd listen so there you go there you have it so once again thank you guys for all of your support like I said the experience has been incredible and trust me guys this is only the beginning so anyways thank you guys so much for watching and thank you guys for all of your support and don't forget to add me on Google+ for all of my you know uptodate in little weird things whatever I post I don't know so uh thank you guys and uh I'll see you later
