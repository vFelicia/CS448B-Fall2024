already houses welcome back and now that we understand the concept of state what I want to do is apply it to my little note program so basically I want to have state because these little notes they're going to have basically two different modes so the first mode is the one you see right now is just normal mode and it means that you're not editing it you pretty much just have a chunk of text that you're looking at so this is kind of the default mode now another mode I want to have is editing mode in other words whenever the user clicks this edit button instead of just having static text right here I want to display a form where they can edit the comment or write a new comment or whatever so basically I'm going to have these notes switch between two different modes or States editing or normal so how do I do that well remember whenever we want to use State the first thing we need is that get initial state function so this function pretty much just sets the initial state now by default I'm going to have these out of editing mode because whenever the user first loads this web page we don't want a bunch of forms popping up we just want you know the default text so I'm going to have one state like I said make sure I spell it right editing and the default state the editing state for all notes is just false this just means normal mode just display the text right here all right so actually I can get rid of these alerts right here and all right I might as well fix these so now let's go ahead and think about this logic a little bit so the first thing is whenever the user clicks this edit button then this edit callback is called so what do we want to do in terms of state well whenever they click the edit button we probably want to set editing to true instead of false obviously so this set state remember this is just equal to basically your states just like this but now we want to set it equal to true all right so what can we do remove we won't even worry about that right now and actually let me go ahead instead of having an alert I just want to log this out because I just don't like those alerts popping up they're annoying and alright so check this out in normal mode we can go ahead and hit edit but then whenever they're in editing mode we don't want to have the edit button still there because they're already editing so instead of these buns we're going to have another button that says save so whenever they're editing and they're done they can hit save and it's going to pretty much save the text so we need one more function and it's going to be a lot like this and this is just going to be called save and all save is going to do is for the moment is just going to set editing equal to false so whenever you're done editing hit save and it's going to take you out of editing mode all right simple enough so now what we're going to do is this you see right here we have one function called a render now render always returns this version of the note right here but what we essentially want to do is we want to say okay we don't just always display this HTML you have to decide if you're an editing mode or not if you're a normal mode then go ahead and display this but if you're an editing mode then you actually want to display a form so the user can edit the text instead so how do we do that well what we can do is you can actually make two different functions and I'll call them a render form and render normal so basically on two different types of HTML and then we'll choose between them so I'll say render normal function and again all this is going to do is basically this actually I can go ahead and cut that all right so whenever we call render normal is just going to display this right like this now we also want another one called render form so what do we want a change of this let me actually think about this for a second all right so instead of this dip we actually want a textarea all right so for the textarea we want to give it the default text of whatever the comment is because whenever they're editing it they want that text in there so in order to do that all we have to do is say default value and set it equal to where is it this thought props that children so again instead of having the text display in here it'll just display in the form and all right that looks good now instead of these buttons edit and remove we actually just want a Save button so it's going to say save and I'll say change that to green instead of blue now on click whenever you're in editing mode instead of editing it again because you're already in editing mode you actually just want to save your text so we're going to call save and then it's going to change your mode to normal mode take you out of editing mode boom roasted you're good to go so all right that looks pretty good for right now now the last thing I want to do is this you see these are just custom functions right here we actually didn't even call them yet whenever we actually use the component it always looks for this function called render so inside here we just have to write a little bit of logic and it's just going to say if you are in editing mode display this if not display this easiest thing you've ever done in your life so I'll say if the state is editing so if this state editing then what we want to do is return this dot render form so if they are editing editing that note then display the form so they can edit it else just display normal so return this render normal alright looking good night looking good so now let me go ahead and refresh this all right now check this out whenever I hit edit it changes from normal to render form and also puts editing mode sets the state of editing equal to true so right now the state of editing is equal to true now whenever I hit saved look what's going to happen it's going to set the state of editing equal to false and the logic is whenever that's false is just going to render normal so return it back to normal same thing when it with any of these and you can even do two at a time it doesn't matter so do you want to put them in editing mode if so it's going to give you a form if not is going to put you back in normal and if you want to change the default of it then you can right here but I mean this is pretty good right now so we got the displace taken care of however we have one issue still whenever the user actually edits the note and hit save it doesn't actually change on the text because we didn't write that logic anywhere so that's what we're going to be working on in the upcoming tutorials and yeah we now know a whole lot about States looking good and now yeah see you guys next time
