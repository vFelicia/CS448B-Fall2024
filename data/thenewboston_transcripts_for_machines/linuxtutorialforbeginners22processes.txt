all righty hostes welcome back and in this video I want to talk to you about processes in Linux so first of all WTF is a process a process is essentially just any program that's running on your computer now the easiest way to just view these is if you type PS this is going to give you a list of processes so these are the ones that are associated with your terminal session so bash of course we know what that is and PS This is the this is actually the process that we just typed in the process to list processes kind of like process setion ooh too spooky for me all right now of course there are a bunch of other processes that are running in the background system processes if you really want to see them then if you type PS ax then this is going to give you a huge list of processes not only the ones that you own but all the stuff that's going on in the background again 99% of these we really don't care about the system processes are just to make sure that Linux is running smoothly and you know all the crap that goes on in the background of your computer what we really care about are the processes that we own pretty much the programs that we started in control manually so before we go any further let's just go ahead and figure out what the heck all this stuff is so each process as you can figure out is just listed on a new line now the First Column right here this P ID this is just the process ID so anytime you start a new process it essentially just assigns it a unique ID number and this is just so you can reference the process it's just easier than you know referring to it by name or any other you know method this TTY this is the terminal where the process is running from so most processes that you start they're associated with the terminal the system processes run in the background they aren't but just remember we're going to see more about this later on but this is the terminal that it's associated with this time right here this isn't like regular you know like what time did it start like 930 no this is the Mount of CPU time that this process took up so if you have a really you know uh timec consuming process or heavy process that you know takes a lot of resources this is going to be higher the reason that these are zero is because little programs like this like just printing text out on the screen they pretty much are really easy for your computer to do so those are just zero and that means that oh this was really easy to run and CMD this is just the command in other words the basic name of the program so PS bash whatever human readable name so there you go that's your real quick overview of processes so why do we care about about this I mean okay processes are programs that run on your computer they have an ID number wow so fascinating who really cares waste of a tutorial well not quite the reason that I'm teaching this is because not every program on your computer runs the same way sometimes you want to have processes that run in the background sometimes you want to have processes that you control manually from the terminal so on and so forth so you know how I say you know command like PS and LS and all these little tools I've been teaching you these are actually programs so even though you know we have a real simple command like LS this is actually a program or a process so even though all it does is list the contents of a directory remember this is just like a mini program just like anything else so just remember that so most of the time whenever you run these little commands you do not not get shell back or you do not have control of your terminal until that program is done running now a lot of these simple commands they run in like half a second or like a millisecond so we really can't tell it looks instant but let's say that we were running a program like this x logo now this program all it does let me see if I can move this it just pops up a little image on the screen but take a note of this so if we look back in our terminal we actually can't type any new commands see we usually have this thing and we can type stuff right after it but since this x logo is still running we don't have control of our terminal yet so watch what happens whenever I close this whenever I close this this x logo program is going to end and then we get control of our terminal back so just remember whenever you run a process from your command line you don't get control of the terminal or you can't run any other ones until that program closes now what you usually want to do whenever you have a process that's going to take a real long time you just don't want to run it have it like you know go through some datab base and just be sitting there the whole time you got other stuff to do you want to work on your computer you pretty much want access to the terminal while that process is running in the background so I'll show you guys this real quick so let's pop up X logo again and my mouse tipped over embarrassing now here I'll move this so you guys can see so anytime you want to end this you can either just close it this way or from the command line what you can do is you can hold down control and hit C on your keyboard now what this is going to do is it's going to send it something called an interrupt signal it's pretty much a nice way of saying hey program can you stop running so again that's control and c and that is going to go ahead and interrupt or stop your program from the command line so let's say that we wanted to do something like this we actually wanted to run this program and we wanted to keep it running but we also wanted to have control of this terminal because you know maybe we were working on something else so anytime you want to have a program run in the background and get control back just type the name of the program and after WR Amper sand so this means hey run this process but run it in the background so go ahead and hit enter and check this out this program's still running but now we can do whatever we want in the terminal we pretty much have full control still now take note of this whenever we ran it in the background instead of just you know popping us to you know terminal control it gave us some information now this information this part right here is the process ID so we can actually see that right here x logo the process ID is 2710 2710 now it also gave us this number right here WTF is this number this is actually called the job number now a job is essentially just a special type of program that we can actually do some kind of cool things with it and I'll show you guys right now
