hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a closer look at arrays and what you can do with arrays so just go ahead or not erase array lists my Ben we go ahead and go to new project will shrink this down a little bit we'll select windows forms application and we will title it array lists go ahead and hit OK and wait for that to load so we're just going to go ahead and add two things to our form we will add a button and a list box now the list box we're just going to use that to print out the items in our array so in this tutorial we're going to be focusing more on the code and not the form so string that down and we'll set some names for this and then we'll be done with the form so we'll go ahead and set the name of list box 1 to list array list and we'll set the name for button 1 to button list items and we will set the text to display array list okay so now I'll go ahead and view the code for display array list and so we created an event that will run whenever button list items is clicked so let's come up here and we will create an array list so let's go ahead and type private and now we're going to have to set a name for our array list so we'll just call it my array list as and then we'll use the new keyword to create an object of a rain list so now that we have an array list let's go ahead and add something to it so we can do this by using the add sub so we'll just type my array list dot add then we'll go ahead add an integer 10 now let's go ahead and cut that and we'll double click on form 1 so with the form 1 loads it will add this to my array list let's go ahead and get rid of some of this white space right here so we can also add strings to my ArrayList so my ArrayList add hello and let's close that in for them and then we can add decimals to it too so my latest add 10 point or 1 point 3 4 so if we come up here and click button list items let's go ahead and add some code that will display all the stuff in my rayleigh my ArrayList so we'll just use a for each loop here so for each item as string in my ArrayList go ahead and do this now you don't always have to use the name item that's just what I'm using you can name it whatever you want and we use type string in here because we're going to be converting each one of these to a string before we print it out inside of our list box and then in my ArrayList so we'll type list array list dot items and we're going to put item dot to string so it will convert 10 to a string it'll convert hello to a string which is already a string and it will convert 1.34 to a string so let's go ahead and run this and do over there if we click display array list we get 10 hello and 1.34 so this is just how you add stuff to ArrayList of any data type you want you can even do it of objects of classes structures enumerations whatever you want you can add to your ArrayList and it has no bounds now you can set bounds and we're going to be learning about that in the next tutorial so I'm practice a little bit with ArrayList and once you've got those down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and we're going to be learning more about what you can do with ArrayList so thanks for watching guys and stay tuned for the next tutorial you
