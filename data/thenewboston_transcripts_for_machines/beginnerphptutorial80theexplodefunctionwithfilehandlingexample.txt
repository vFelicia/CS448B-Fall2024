hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a tutorial for the New Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be learning to read data from a file but obviously when you're reading data from a file it's not always on a line by line basis you might find that you've got commas separating your values and in this case we've got a few names here with commas separating each value now how do we deal with reading this in now we've already seen examples of reading in file data but for now what we want to do is we want to create a handle as we've done previously I've got this names.txt up here but I'm just going to close it so it doesn't interfere with our program I don't change anything inside so handle equals F open and we want to pick a file to open which is names.txt and we're going to eat we're going to open this for reading so we're going to use an R here okay now what we're going to do is we need to create a way to read the contents of the file echo the contents of the file and that that's the first stage I'm going to take just echoing out the contents to the PHP page at the moment the it looks like this nothing's really happening so how do we do this what we do is we we echo F read and we take the handle in there now the second argument in this is the amount of data we want to read in for now I'm just going to type a thousand just to make sure we read in all the characters however well let's refresh first and you can see we've taken in all the data from the names txt far from Alex to sandra we've taken in all the data and we're displaying it now I don't want to read in a thousand bits or but I think it's byte so much I'm not too great with that but this is the amount of data it's reading in could be characters I'm not sure but something to look up so I want to take in the file size rather than keep specifying you know if I was reading in a massive long file I might say Oh we'll just read in that amount of characters you're wasting you're wasting it doesn't look neat either so what I want to do is I want to use a function called file size and then handle so basically all this is doing is taking the file size and reading in the file as a whole not any more not any less so let's see if that's worked oh right okay so okay basically what we've done is um as opposed to reading in the you know a particular file we're reading in this open file so what we need to do up here is we need to specify the file name so I'm going to specify the file name as names.txt that means that down here I can replace this with file name and then I can replace this with file name as well so now let's refresh and we should have that that file up ok so just to show you an example if I wanted to only read in say five we just get the first five characters of that so always use this file size and it will just open the exact amount of data within your file okay so and we don't want to echo this out but what we do want to do is put it in a variable so I'm going to call this variable data in now what we want to do with this is we want to split it up and our the character we want to split from is commas so let's refresh again all right echo that out and refresh now we want to split it up through commas and we use a function here called explode so I'm going to say names array equals explode what we do is we use we tell PHP the character we want to explode it with and then we read in the photo reading the what we want to explode so if for example in here we had Alex Billy Dale okay and we wanted to explode that we just be left with an array with Alex Billy and Dale but because we've got this data in variable with our data all data in I mean that's what we want to read in we want to read in this and we want Alex inner in an array element Billy Peter Dale so if we refresh nothing's happened no errors have occurred which is fine now to test this we can use the for each and we can say for each names array as name and what once there is echo name and then we just append a break on to that so essentially what we're doing is we're converting this file from a comma comma delimited file to a line by line echoing out to our browser and displaying the data to our browser so if we refresh hopefully that should work okay so you can see that they're now on a line by line basis now there's one thing that you need to notice when dealing with these files is that they do actually have extra extra spaces on I believe so let's just add a dot in there to test that another day okay that's absolutely fine that's work well okay so we've now got this data that's been read in on a common line for us we've used explode and we've read this in as an array so now what we can do is we can do anything we like this data because it's invalid it's in an element of an array for example let's just get rid of this if I wanted to say names array and so the say the first element of the array so the array with the key of 0 the key 0 has the value Alex because it's the first name in the list so we just reduce we're just reducing that down and printing out Alex or echoing out Alex so you can do anything you like with this data now that is in an array and we've done that simply by the explode function using a commerce say oh yeah it's separated by comma and if it was separated by spaces you could just use a space in here and then just reading in the data just here so that's how simple it is to read in sort of comma separated values within a file
