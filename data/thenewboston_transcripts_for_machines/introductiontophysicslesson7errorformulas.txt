what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your seventh physics tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be showing you guys how to calculate something called absolute error and percentage error it's basically the formula you use whenever you want to figure out how much did you mess up by it's actually one of the very first formulas that your teacher teaches you in either college or High School physics so say for example that you were doing your very first college lab and your teacher wanted you to find the weight of a cheeseburger or something so what they did is they gave you this cheeseburger however maybe your equipment wasn't right on point or maybe you smoked a little pot before class so you weren't really on top of your game so we needed to you know find out the answer that we got was probably a little bit different than the answer that it should have been so in order to calculate how much we messed up by we can use these formulas called error functions or error formulas for so before we go ahead and get to the formulas I need to talk to you guys about some variables now whenever we're working with these formulas d da is going to stand for Absolute Air now for example this basically means in everyday terms how much did you mess up by say for example we have a cow that weighed three 300 lb however whenever you measured it you found that it weighed 290 lb and that may be because you know you weren't paying attention really to the scale or maybe the scale you waited on is from you know 1,620 the year 1620 so you know it's not the most reliable scale so anyways you messed up by 10 PBS so 10 would be your absolute error so that's your quick little uh you know explanation of that basically means how much did you mess up by now the other variables we need is XM and XM is not the radio it means measured value or basically the value that you came up with so in this case it would be 290 since that's the value that you came up with I have really pretty handwriting I just noticed that and the last variable is X a if I can write that correctly I'll get it eventually give me some time XA equals actual value and this pretty much means the correct value or the value that it should be so the correct weight of the cow was 300 so let me go ahead and just give you guys another real quick example so say we want to C calculate the Absolute Air let me think of something we'll go ahead and do the cheeseburger example so say our teacher gave us a cheeseburger and we needed to find the mass of that cheeseburger well whenever we calculated the mass of that cheeseburger we found that it had a mass of 5.8 kilg however when our teacher did it she got a value of 5.6 so she knows what she's doing so 5.6 kilograms is the actual value so what we need to do is we need to take 5.8 and subtract 5.6 and we get. 2 kilog for da in other words our absolute error is 02 kilograms that's how much we messed up by pretty simple stuff huh so now let me go ahead and add a new layer and show you guys how to calculate percentage error now the variable is a little bit different it's actually just written a little bit different it's D percentage and this stands for percentage air I probably have the best handwriting in the world so d% equals percentage air and this basically means instead of coming up with a value like 0.2 or you know 10 pounds whatever we come up with a percent so it's like we messed up by 10% or 3% or something like that so let me go ahead and change my color let me change it to something like bright red so say we had well let me give you guys the formula for error so the formula for percentage error equals 100 time our measured value XM minus the actual value over the actual value so this looks really complicated but it's actually really easy so let me go ahead and I guess we'll do that uh cheeseburger example let's see if I can remember the values so we came up with what was it 5.8 kg I'll leave the kilograms out and the actual value was 5.6 so what we do is we take 5.8 minus 5.6 and we get 0.2 and we need to divide that by the actual value now the actual value was 5.6 so. 2 / 5.6 equals 0357 so so what we need to do now is we need to take this number and times it by 100 so all we need to do in order to times it by 100 move the decimal points two places to the right so 3.57 is our percentage error pretty cool huh so basically again one last time is we take the measured value which is 5.8 and subtract the actual value which is 5.6 and we get this number right here in this case it was 0.2 and we take that and divided by the actual value which was 5.6 again this number and this number are the same and then all we need to do is once we have our value times it by 100 and Bam there we go our percentage error perfect and hopefully this number is as small as possible if this number is small it means you did a really good job if this number is Big it means that you know you might want to lay off the uh weed before class just a little bit so there you go that's how you calculate errors and uh yeah like I said hopefully we won't be using this formula too much but whenever we need it there it is so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial by
