so this takes the attribute value which will be C colon backslash fake path and then the image I choose so if I click on that you can see you've got C colon backslash fake path backslash Tarson jpg so now that we know that this well I mean that was sort of some useless information I guess in sense of the tutorial but the reason that this change event handler works is because the value attribute is added so as long as you know that you'll understand why we actually are using this event handler but overall the you know the notation of change is quite you know easy to understand so now what we want to do is go ahead and change this submit button so with the idea of submit we're going to reference it as hash submit we want to remove this attribute here so the first way we can do it is change the attribute or we could go ahead and remove it so I'll show you both and you can decide which one you think would be better okay so once the file has changed we want to select submit and then we want to say attribute disabled none so this will change the value of the attribute name disabled to nothing so let's just go ahead and look at that let's click choose file and let's choose tartan dot jpg bear in mind this upload button is still or this upload submit button is still disabled when I click it and nothing's happened so let's check check what might have happened so hash submit to attribute okay so I think perhaps we we might not be able to actually use this so let's go ahead and use remove attribute instead and here we just specify the name of the attribute to be removed so disabled let's go ahead and try that again I'm going to click Choose file click Tartan jpg and you see that the attribute for this upload button has been removed and therefore it we can now click it and submit our file so that's the first way that we can go ahead and do it by submitting individual IDs now what happens if you always had an input file here like an input type file and you always had a submit button afterwards now you could go ahead and set up your form like this you could even set it up without disabled like this and you can have jQuery automatically do this all for you so let's go ahead and just get rid of this here now let's just assume that like I said if you are regular regularly including as part of your page on any page on your website an input type of file and an input submit type as well now let's just like I said assume that we are doing that we're going to use a general selector to select all input fields with the type file so let's go ahead and use a selector so it's an input selector this would select all input fields but this time I want to specify a type inside of here which is file so now I can say dot next and essentially what this will be doing is it will select this file here and the next will be this next element here so I can say any element after this I next I'm going to change the attribute or create the attribute disabled to equal disabled so at the moment this input submit button doesn't contain a disabled attribute however once we've selected any file or the next submit button after this will be you know will be given this disabled attribute so that's now refresh and you can see that that button has been automatically disabled so any input of the type submit' or any any element essentially after this will be disabled ie our button so now what we can do is come down to well we actually would append it back onto here so I can say dot change or sorry dot I think we would have to dot dot previous dot change and then in here we can create a callback function in actual fact let's change this around all together I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to say I'm just going to get rid of this and I'm going to say dot change now as we did before we appended this event handler on but now after this I'm going to add this and now in here I can go ahead and create my function so let me just run along I'm just going to pull that down and I'll just explain what's happening so we select our input type we append an event handler onto it but while we're doing that we select the next element remember the submit button and we give it that attribute so it's still worked as you can see but we can apply an event handler here as well for example alert changed when we go ahead and change something here we get this alert box up so we know that that works now so as well as an pending on an event handler we've also selected the next element and disabled it okay so now inside of here we want to go ahead and enable this once it changes so now all we'll have to do is say this dot next dot remove attribute disabled so once this element here that's been selected ie all file types across our page have changed the next element along which is currently disabled we remove the attribute now it may look like oh okay well once this event takes place we're then going ahead and removing the attribute but then with you know disabling it this change function or this change event only happens once it's changed this happens regardless it will even though the change event handlers before this will always happen so we won't get the problem that it will be reduce abled for example so I'm going to go ahead and choose two Tartan jpg and you can see that the upload button has been enabled so that's just a quick bit of information or a long bit of information but in detail about how we can use this we went for the ID selection before and now we've used this input type file selection and this would work globally across your script as long as you had an input type with or an input field with the type file and an input type with the type input field with the type submit' so this will now work globally doing it this way however if you're only doing this once off you can apply an ID or a class and select it that way
