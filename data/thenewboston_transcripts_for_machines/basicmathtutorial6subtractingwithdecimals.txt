welcome to subtraction with decimals it's the same thing as subtraction with whole numbers except for now we have to worry about the decimal and decimal placement you can go right ahead and bring down the decimal if that's easier for you to remember so again we start in the 10th place so 5 7 we can't do that we have to borrow from the nine make that an eight put the five one there 15 7 is 8 8 4 is 4 and 8 5 is 3 so we come over here we have 7 9 we can't do that so we have to borrow from the eight make that a seven make that 17 and 17 9 is 8 bring down the decimal point very important 7 2 is five over here we have 5 9 we have to get rid of that make that a zero make the 15 15 9 is 6 0 2 can't do that have to borrow and since this is a zero we have nothing to borrow from so we have to borrow from from the seven make that a six make that a 10 but then again cross that again make it a n and make that a 10 we had to keep on borrowing it as far as we can all the way down to where it's needed so 10 2 is 8 bring down the decimal point 9 8 is 1 and 6 1 is 5 over here we have 9 2 is 7 8 9 we have to borrow from the four make that a three make that 18 18 9 is 9 bring down the decimal point 3 4 we have to Bor from way over to the six make that a five this is going to be 10 put have to cross that out again and make it a nine make that a 10 cross it out make it a nine make that 13 13 4 is 9 9 3 is 6 9 5 is 4 and 5 1 is four and there's your answer for here we we have 7 8 have to go to the two make that a one give it to the 10 cross it out make it a N9 give it 17 and that's going to be 9 9 1 is 8 bring down the decimal point and 1 0 is 1 so over here we can just add in a little decimal point just pretend it's there and add in a zero as a placeholder just so you don't get confused so 0 minus 9 can't do that borrow from the three make it a two make that a 10 10 9 is 1 bring down the decimal point 2 2 is zero and bring down the five over here we're going to put in two zero placement holders or 0 7 we have to come all the way to the five make it a four 4 make that a 10 cross it out make it a 9 and make that a 10 10 7 is 3 9 7 is 3 oh two bring down the decimal point 4 4 is zero and bring down a three so over here we have to know our decimal points just notice that there's a decimal point right there so we are going to put in two imaginary decimal places right over here just so you don't get confused and there's a decimal point right there so we have 0 minus six we have to borrow all the way from this eight make it a seven we can go right ahead and make that a nine cuz we know it's going to be nine and make that a 10 10 6 is 4 we have 9 3 is six put the decimal point and then 7 0 is 7 and 1 0 is 1 because there's nothing before the decimal point over here we have 5 9 we have to borrow from the one make it a zero make that a 15 15 9 is 6 0 9 we have the from the eight make that a s make that a 10 so 10 9 is 1 we have the decimal points add that in and then 7 2 is 5 now over here we have only one decimal place and then now we have two decimal points so we need to add an imaginary zero so 0 8 with a borrow from the five make it a four make that a 10 10 8 is 2 4 0 is 4 put the decimal point we have 7 4 the borrow from the eight make that a s make that a 9 and we can make that a 12 so 12 4 is 8 9 6 is 3 and 7 3 is 4 there we go and that's all I have for subtraction with decimals
