what's going on guys welcome back to your 44 C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys about a couple things specifically about the keyword Const which stands for a constant now whenever you use the keyword Const it means that whatever you use it on you typically use on variables and stuff it means that that variable remains constant throughout your program aka it can't be changed or modified in any way so let's go ahead and take a quick look at that say you have an integer variable X and you set equal to 3 whenever you first make it and then later on you want to change it to something like 5 while your program is just going to run fine and whenever you try to print out X or use it in any other way it's going to run perfectly fine as expected so what the constant keyword does in that constant keyword Co n St whenever you're creating something you put the constant keyword in there and it's pretty much telling your compiler all right now whenever I create this variable I'm going to set equal to value and I don't want you to change it for the rest of the program so now whenever you change try to change to something else like 5 in try to run this program is going to get error because it's saying hey Bucky you called this variable constant you promised me we're going to change it and now you lied me right there so that's why I'm giving you an error so that's basically what the constant keyword does and make sure that whatever is constant is unable to be modified so that being said later on in your programming you're going to learn that some objects you create you don't want them to be able to be modified some objects are just regular objects and other objects you want constant you don't want them to be able to change so you use this constant keyword whenever you create an object so therefore you have an object that can't be modified and you might be thinking RA so I can just use it with normal functions and not exactly whenever you have a constant object you can't call regular functions with them you can only call functions that they themselves are constant so constant objects need constant functions and of course whenever you create a constant function you need to make sure it's constant both in the prototype in the header file and in the definition aka the C++ source file so let's go ahead and just create a regular function first and then I'm going to be running it aside a constant object I'm going to be doing a couple things so let's go ahead and make um a sally function and we'll just name it like print shiz and this is just a regular function I'm not doing anything weird yet so see out I'm just like I am a regular function and then end that line and then of course since we created a function we need to prototype it so then it is void I think I named it print shiz just like that so now we can see that we can just go ahead into our main program create a Sally object and then we can use that cell object to call our regular functions such as print shows just like that and whenever we run it everything is going to go smoothly it's going to print out I'm a regular function so I did that and we already know that so let's go ahead and jump into constant objects now whenever you create a constant object you do so doing this throw your keyword Co n st before you create your object and everything else is basically exactly the same you type class you want it to be from and also what your name your object like Const object looks like a pretty good name search and IRA all I need to do is Const object and then I can go ahead and call it my other methods like print shiz well whenever we try and do this we get an error message because it's saying alright you created an object that it was constant and you try to use a function that wasn't constant see this function isn't constant is just a regular function so we need to build special constant functions whenever we create a constant object so you're saying alright let's go ahead and do that then so let's go ahead and create another method on a constant excuse me another function talking in Java another computer program language but let's go ahead and create another special constant function so void Sally let's just name this print shiz and in order to create a constant function you go ahead and you type the keyword constant right after your function definition so Co n s T so now what happens is right after this we build the body for it so this is just going to see out umm I am the constant function just like that and of course we'll end that line right there and now like I said before we need to prototype it is a constant two so we need to basically tell every single file that we're going to be working with constant objects and in order to prototype it here's what we do go ahead and just like before type avoid print chiz yeah that was called printers and you just write Const right there and now you're telling your compiler alright this is a constant object prototype so a lot of people might think you do this add the Const before make sure you add it after the parameters and you should be good to go so now whenever we try and run this constant function with the constant object remember this is our constant object and this is our constant function print is now whenever we try and run it it should be good to go I am a regular function I am the constant function pretty simple so so as you can see whenever we build objects if we build a regular object we can use the regular functions with them whenever we build a constant object we're telling our C++ compiler all right this object we don't want anything to be able to modify it or change it so it told us all right I can do that but you need to build me some constant functions if you do that for me I'll run your program just fine so that was our little deal we had with the compiler and that's why this one ran with the right wave function and this constant object ran with the constant functions so now you should understand how to prototype constant functions how to create them and also why constant objects need constant functions and again later on you're going to be seeing why in like bigger programs um you need to be able to create some objects that you want to be able to make constant and why they were useful for your compiler so for now I just want to teach you guys the very basic so in the next story we're probably going to be covering constants a little bit more because there's actually a lot to go over with constants and classes so for now that's all you get thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
