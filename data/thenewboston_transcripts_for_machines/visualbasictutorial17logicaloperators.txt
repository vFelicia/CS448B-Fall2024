hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash online gamer for the new boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at logical operators now basically what logical operators are is let's say you're using an if statement so you want to do if this number is equal to a certain value or this number is equal to a different value then go ahead and do whatever is in the if statement now the or in that would be considered a logical operator you can also use the and operator so let's say if this number is less than a certain value and another number is less than a certain value then go ahead and do whatever is in that code so let's go ahead and make a little demo program for this it's going to be similar to the login ones that I've done before so let's go and get started we're going to go ahead and declare our username and password so dim username as string now we'll set it equal to nothing and now we're going to make our password so dim password as a string and we're going to set that equal to nothing too so just in case they don't type anything okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt our user to enter in their username console.writeline what is your name and now what we want to do is we want to store their name of course so username equals console dot readline now we're just going to ask them for their password so we'll do console dot write line what is your password and we'll do password equals console getline or dot readline sorry okay so now that we've prompted the user to enter their name and password and we have stored both their name and the password in variables we want to test those to see if we're going to let the user in so we're going to start off by creating an if statement you're going to type if username equals Sam then go ahead and do this so now what we're going to do is we're going to add an or operator to this now to add an or operator you're going to go ahead and just type the keyword or capital o lowercase R so if username equals Sam or username equals Tim not time Tim then go ahead and do this so let's just go ahead and print that out so we can see what happens so console dot write line hello and then we'll just add their username and then we'll go ahead and console dot read line so we have time to read the line before it closes ok it'll say what is your name and if I type in Sam it'll say what is your password I can type in whatever I want to here it'll say hello Sam now if I had typed Tim it will say hello Tim but if I type anything else then nothing will show up so now what we want to do is we want to test to see if their username is correct or the password name i mean if their username is correct and that password is correct so to do this let's just go ahead and close this in parenthesis so this is going to be its own separate part of the the if statement now this may be a little confusing to you but if you just go ahead and practice this after this you'll understand it so if username equals sam or username equals Tim and then the and operator is just capital a and D and you will see that highlights blue now this is very simple in other languages you got some symbols for the and and or operator like the or operator and C++ for example will be that right there but in Visual Basic since it's such a highlevel language it's a very close to English it's very easy to write code and learn fast so if username equals Sam or username equals Tim and password equals the new Boston then we're going to go ahead and tell them that they have access by just saying hello and their username so basically what this does is if anything in here is true so if this part is true and password equals the new Boston is true so if username equals Sam is true or username equals Tim is true then this whole part right here is going to be equal to true and then and password equals the new Boston so this whole part has to equal true and password equals the new Boston has to equal true now this might be a little confusing to you but um just just try to figure it out the best you can if you have any questions leave them in the comments so if these to stay if these two conditions are true then go ahead and let them in and now let's go ahead and type in else and we'll say console dot write line access not granted so if we run this program type what is your name I'll say I'll just say Sam and then I'll type the New Boston it'll say hello Sam now let's go ahead and run this again and you can see that I'll work with Tim to so name is Tim password is the new Boston and it will say hello Tim we've been granted access but if anything is not true so let's say we don't type either Sam or Tim so we type Joe and then we type the password the new Boston even though the password is correct it's going to say access not granted because the name has to be correct it has to be either Sam or Joe and the password has to be equal to the New Boston so I go ahead and practice and make some programs yourself with some logical operators and once you've got logical operators nailed down go ahead and move on to the next tutorials and thanks for watching
