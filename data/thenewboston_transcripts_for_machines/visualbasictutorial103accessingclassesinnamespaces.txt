hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new boss tip and in this tutorial we're going to be talking more about namespaces now if you remember from the previous tutorial we created this people file right here people dot VB and inside of it we created two namespaces we have namespace other people and namespace friends and inside each one of these we have a class called people and you can see here that we have a class called people right there now the reason that these don't conflict with each other is because we have put them in two different namespaces so let's go ahead and come over here and we will add a button to our form one so we'll just make that bigger let's find two text boxes okay so we'll bring this button down we'll put the textbox is right underneath each other and then we'll label them first name and last name so for label one the text is going to be first name and for label to the text is going to be last name so last name okay so now what we'll do is we'll change the text for button one so we'll just click so we'll just type in show friend or let's just do show person and we will set the name values for each of these text boxes so text first name and text last name okay so now we'll open up our code for four more VB and you can see here that it generates the form one load of it now what we need to do is create an object of one of our people classes now for this one we'll just use the class people from the namespace other people we could also use the people from the namespace friends so let's come over here to form one dot VB and we need to create an object of that class so we will type private person as new and now whenever we're making a new person you can see that the people class is inside of the namespace other people so we have to specify the namespace and then we have to specify the class because we are using more than one namespace inside of our program so come up here and we want to declare person as new other people dot people okay so now we can do is type person dot first name over here when you leave that out of there we need to come to our button one event click so person dot first name equals text first name dot txt and person dot last name equals text last name dot txt and we'll just go ahead and show that in a message box so we will type person dot two string and you can see that we override the two string function in each one of these classes so that instead of converting our person object or a people object to a string it will just return their first name and their last name so let's go ahead and run this and see what happens so here's our first name let's shrink this down a bit so let's just do first name Jim last name Harris and we'll just go ahead and click show person and you can see that we get Jim Harris right here and he is of type people from the namespace other people so go ahead and if you have some programs that you've already made you could try organizing your classes inside of namespaces and or make this program right here and once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
