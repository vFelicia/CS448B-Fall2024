hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're gonna be using jQuery now to retrieve a current time so we can match it against an event or a time in the future and and display to the user how many days until this particular event so essentially what we're doing is we're allowing the user or in the backend of our script in ext is we're allowing ourselves of someone else to set a textual representation of a time we're then going to use jQuery now to return the current time and we're gonna work out the amount of days between now and the event so we're going a little bit over the top here with regards to what we're creating but this will demonstrate jQuery now and the use for this quite nicely so the first thing I want to go ahead and do is create an area on my page that I'm actually going to display the amount of days remaining so for example this might say let's say five days remaining if I could spell it bright or only five days until this event I guess we could say that's what we wanted to say this is what we want it to display on the page only five days until this event so we're replacing this with the amount of days hmm okay so what we're gonna go ahead and do is we're not gonna write anything inside of this div we're gonna let ext jus handle absolutely everything so inside my index dot PHP I've obviously included jQuery extremely important because we're using jQuery now and ext dot J is the file that we're gonna handle everything in and that's gonna place the text inside of this div here so the first thing we want to go ahead and do is wait for the document to be ready so I'm gonna say document dot ready so this ear here selector refers to the document itself and this refers to the fact that the it was an event handler refers to when the document is ready and we can start to manipulate things and and you know do things about this is almost instant instant but we tend to do this in jQuery every time we write code okay so now what we're doing is we're creating a function inside of here and inside of the block I'm just going to pull that down so we can start writing our code now the first thing we want to go ahead and do is set a time for our event and this is going to be a string which we're going to supply for example 12th of August 2011 its 8th of August 2011 today so that's about three days to that event so we'll use this as an example I'm going to go ahead and create a variable called event time and this is going to be equal to a string so let's just go ahead and say 12th of August 2011 now whatever first of all want to do is wrap this in the past functionality of date now this isn't really anything to do with jQuery it's to do with JavaScript and but we obviously sometimes still need to use JavaScript jQuery doesn't include some functionality because Jake JavaScript does it on its own well and you don't need a library for it so we're using date dot pass and we're wrapping that like that let's go ahead and just alert this event time out so we can see what we are displayed with let's press f5 now you'll notice there's a number of sort of trailing zeros afterwards what we actually want is we want this to be without the milliseconds afterwards the the zero is the trailing zeros that you see are the milliseconds so what we want to go ahead and do is divide this by a thousand and then we get a presentation of this date in seconds rather than with the milliseconds at the end so this is a lot more helpful because we don't really need to calculate milliseconds okay so now we're going to go and write the or apply the current time to a variable and the value in there so I'm gonna say current time is equal to let's just have these over it's a bit neater what we're gonna say so current time is equal to jQuery dot now as we've seen and again we need to divide this by a thousand because if we were to go ahead and just alert current time on its own and let's go ahead and refresh you see that we've got these milliseconds as well afterwards which change obviously quite rapidly so we don't really want to be counting milliseconds so let's go ahead and divide that by a thousand as well and now we get a representation of the of the time here the only problem is is that we are not flooring this data ideally we want to remove the the what's it called after the decimal point the decimal we want to remove anything in that you know after the decimal point basically we want to round down so I want to say math.floor and wrap that in there and we could do the same for the event time as well I don't know how it handles this but we'll leave it for now because it will work fine without okay so what I'm gonna go ahead and do now is I'm gonna work out the amount of seconds between these two events now because we're returning them both our seconds this is quite straightforward so the amount of seconds between the two events is simply the event time minus the current time and then we have the difference in seconds between the two events so let's go ahead and alert out seconds and that's refresh and you can see that this is the amount of seconds between the two events and obviously that will keep you know changing in value okay so now what we want to go ahead and do is calculate these days so to calculate the days we want to take the seconds and we want to divide it by 60 times 60 times 24 okay so let's go ahead and alert out days and we'll go ahead and refresh and you can see that we've got three days here but we've got point and we've got a lot of decimal places afterwards so we can go ahead and use math topfloor here as well and this will just return a value of three so let's go ahead and wrap this in math dot floor and once we've done that and we alert days out you can see that we've just got three so now we've successfully retrieved the amount of days and all that's really left to do is go ahead and place it inside this day's div here so we'll go ahead and do that now we're gonna use a jQuery selector to select days div with the ID of days remember use a hash to select the ID and we want to go ahead and play some text in here and that text is only X days until the event and with X we'll just go ahead and concatenate on this day's variable that we've created here so now when we refresh we get only three days until the event now obviously let's go ahead and just I'm just gonna tidy this up because that's just what I'm like but we'll go ahead and maybe change this to 20th of August and when we refresh you see you've got eleven days until the event let's go ahead and change this to 2015 and you'll see we've got only one thousand four hundred and seventy two days until the event so using jQuery now and I think the rest are certainly these two lines here this line here are both playing JavaScript however this line here obviously uses jQuery now I think we can go ahead and use a dollar sign here actually that was just check yeah we can we can use a dollar sign here instead of jQuery we don't need to use the jQuery notation also this line overseas is jQuery but essentially what we've done is used now to grab the current time flawed it and then worked out the amount of days so even if you know you didn't learn too much about the now functionality and jQuery you've learned how to retrieve an amount of days to an event so that's about it we've got only one thousand four hundred seventy two days until the event that we specified quite easy piece of code and also quite effective and useful if you are required to use it at all
