all righty hostes welcome back and in this video I am going to show you guys how to use event handling with react so say that you had this component and your component had some buttons on it of course whenever the user clicked one of those buttons you would want to be able to handle that event or in other words just do something depending on what the button said so that's what I'm going to be showing you guys how to do AKA event handling so in the upcoming tutorials I'm going to start making a very simple app to kind of demonstrate a bunch of stuff and I think it's a little bit easier to see how all of these you know concepts are put together in a simple project instead of just showing you guys a bunch of weird demos so what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be making kind of a sticky note app where the user can add new notes or delete or edit notes and I don't know they can write whatever notes they want like walk the dog um have a note for their favorite movies just pretty much a bunch of comments that they can edit delete I don't know it's the first thing that popped up in my head so let's go ahead and make a new component and I'll name it comment now all this is going to be is essentially a block that's going to have some text on it depending on whatever your comment is and we'll have a button for editing it and another button for deleting it so very simple so react create class all right so of course the very first thing I do whenever I make a component is no matter how many different features I want to add to it no matter how interactive it's going to be I just go ahead and I make the plane HTML and then I just add dummy data so maybe this is a component that has a photo that changes all the time well when I first make it I'm just going to put in some image um just some static image just to make sure that it works and is displayed how I want it to so for render remember this is just going to be equal to a function and it's just going to return some HTML so I actually have a bunch of the CSS already styled so you can style this however you want um you know this isn't really a CSS tutorial but if you want the same styling as me then go ahead in the first video um get that repo downloaded and the CSS file is right here so there you go but again if you don't have the CSS then just style it however you want it to look so this entire thing is going to be in a div and I already made a style called comment container so for the class name you set this equal to comment container just like that now that brings me to another point and that is this right here you can add um attributes just like you would in normal HTML using jsx however the reason that we can't write class right here is because class is already a reserved keyword in JavaScript a JavaScript class actually means something so that's why in jsx we have to write class name so most of your other attributes are going to be fine just write normal HTML but sometimes if they clash with JavaScript then that's what jsx did and I'll keep a heads up in case I come across it again but anyways inside this comment what we're going to have is basically a div and two buttons so the div is just going to be the text um of whatever whatever and two buttons all right so this first button is just going to be for editing the comment and this second one is just going to be for deleting actually let me just go ahead and name that remove all right now I already styled these as well so the text it actually has a class name of pretty creative wait till you hear it comment text and all the styling does is it makes it a little bit bold and it adds some spacing between the text and the buttons that's all and um these button classes I already uh styled these as well so I made a class called button primary which is blue and another one that is red called button danger so now our edit button is blue and our remove button is red I thought that was kind of appropriate all right so what we want to happen is whenever the user clicks these buttons then something happens so before we can add an onclick attribute we actually need to make functions because essentially we're going to say whenever you click this call a function in this component now we already have this function right here called render and this is a function uh responsible for drawing or displaying some HTML but we can actually make our own custom functions and name them whatever we want so I'm going to make one called edit and again this is just equal to a function now this can do whatever we want um we can log something out on the screen we can just make some alert pop up and for right now keep things simple we'll just make an alert popup that says editing comment now we're going to make another function and eventually um whenever we call these functions we're going to be able to edit the comment and it's actually going to delete it but for right now I'll just say remove we'll just make an alert pop up to show you guys that hey you can actually have event handling with your components so right now we have these cool functions an edit function and a remove function and whenever you call them they display a popup that says editing or removing comment but we didn't link these buttons to these functions in any kind of way so how do we do that how do we say whenever we click this button to call this function or this function well what you do is you actually add another onclick attribute now this is going to be equal to this function so whenever we click edit it's going to call onclick call this function so how do you do that well since this is a function from the same class we just need to write this and then a DOT separator and then the function name so whenever we click the edit button just call this classes or components edit function just like that now the same thing with the remove whenever you click the on or remove button just go ahead and call this components remove function or method I guess it's more technically called so there you go and now we actually need to render this so let me clean this up so it's noce and neat for future tutorials all right so I'm taking all these comments and I'm surrounding them them inside a board and all this board is is some styling to give it a nice light blue background as you guys can see right here so whenever I want to make a new comment then all I have to write is comment just like that and let right hey now and check this out so whenever I refresh this we can actually test these right now if I click edit we get our alert popping up whenever I click remove we get our another alert popping up so we know that our event handlers they are working properly but again like I said one thing I want to do from here is instead of just having the static text just like this I actually want to take whatever text is in between these comment tags and I want to display that for the comment so let me just write uh something like I'll just write uh hey my name is Bucky for one comment and then for another one I'll write a beans something stupid and then for another one I'll write tuna just so we have three different comments so right now whenever I refresh this and take a look at my application all of these comments are the same because we just said display text we didn't say do anything with this so how do we access the data in between these tags so we can actually use it in our component well this is actually a builtin property called children so again the children property is just any data that's in between the opening tag and closing tag so remember that I said in like two tutorials ago whenever you want to use properties you just use this props and then the name of the property and this one is just children so whenever I refresh this check it out it gets whatever is in between these tags which are the children which is just static text in this example and for each component render it displays it in between this div tag so I know I threw a lot at you guys but again what we covered in this video is first of all event handling now event and handling I can't even talk right now is how you can pretty much make custom functions in your component and you can call those with on click and there are other event handlers as well but on click is the most famous one and also whenever you want to pass data in between these tags you can access it through the children property so pretty cool eh and yeah I think that's it that's enough info for this lesson so thank you guys for watching I will see you guys next time
