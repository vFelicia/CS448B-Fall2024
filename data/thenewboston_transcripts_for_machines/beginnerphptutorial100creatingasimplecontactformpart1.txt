hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and I'm back with another video for the new Boston now in the previous video we looked at sending email using PHP mail function if you haven't already watched that video I recommend you go back and watch it before you watch this as this video is going to deal with submitting a contact form so for example you've seen websites where you have a Contact Us page and you fill in your information and you click the submit button now this then sends where I could do them it could be storing values in a database but for now we're going to be dealing with sending an email address sending the message to a specific email address and that's how we're going to receive it so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to create our form so let's go ahead and say form action equals something and method equals something and then we end with form so the form action is going to be index.php so we're going to be submitting back to the same page and this is going to submit it in post data so we're going to submit a large amount of data that we don't want to be shown in the URL bar so we use the post method to send the data in our form so let's go ahead and set up the form before we start processing our script or inside PHP so the first field I'm going to create is a name and oh sorry and I'm going to break down after this and I'm going to say input type its text because we're taking the text value for the name and the name of this is a contact name okay now we're going to break down a couple of times and we're going to say email address and we're going to break and we're going to set input type equals text again name equals contact email I'm not going to specify things like telephone field this is up to you to an input for yourself but the next thing I'm going to do is message so this is we're just going to be passing three fields through PHP they're going to be sent to our email address so now message we're going to put a text area so a text area is just a large text area that can be typed in the text area I'm going to give this a name of contact text and we're going to set the rows equal to something and the calls or something that's other columns so we've got six here and say 30 a that should give us a large enough space to submit our data so we're going to go on the presumption that all of our fields are required by this contact form so obviously you can chop and change and within PHP we can make the relevant checks but for now I'm going to do a couple of breaks down and I'm going to create our submit button so it's a type submit and the value is going to be send so let's go ahead and save this page and we can preview this in our in our browser so I'm going to refresh the page so you can see we've got a pretty standard looking and looking contact form now it's obviously up to you to change the design of this you can obviously implement CSS if you know how pop this into your own design so for now I'm just starting with the most basic basic layout so we can type information into here and what we want to do is we want to we want to enter a different email addresses and our messages and we're going to test out well we're going to fill in all fields first of all this is what we need to make sure will happen so let's go over to back to our file and edit this ok so inside PHP when this is submitted the first thing that we want to do is we want to check to see if the form has been submitted so we need to check that each element is set so we use the is set construct and we set is set that underscore post because remember we're submitting these variables using the post variable so we post method so we pick them up by dollar underscore post and then inside here we need to specify the first variable that we're passing and this is contact name then we need to say and so we apply the and operator so we're saying if the contact name is set and dollar underscore I'm sorry and is set dollar underscore post and we need to now specify the next field that we are submitting that's contact email at just a word of warning before I continue we're not actually going to be dealing with email validation and the reason for this is it's a lot too too big and too unnecessary for this tutorial so there will be another tutorial in my tutorials for the new Boston that will deal with email validation so go over and have a look at that and you'll be able to apply this to your your contact form
