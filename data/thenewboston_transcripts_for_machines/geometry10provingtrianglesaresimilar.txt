so today we're just going to do another kind of proof which is proving triangles are similar so we're told that AC is congruent to 80 OD is congruent to OG and AC is parallel to OD so we'll just copy are given okay and that's the given so the first thing we can do is since these two lines are parallel we can get this angle congruent to this angle because remember two lines are parallel corresponding angles are congruent so angles see I'm just going to use one letter just because we're going to be doing a lot of work with angles and then it'll get confusing the name it with three every time so angle C is congruent to angle D so our reason is that if lines parallel corresponding angles are congruent okay so the next thing we can do is get this angle congruent to this angle because remember if two is two angled if two sides are congruent then their opposite angles are congruent and I can get this angle congruent to this angle so angle C is congruent to angle D oh no sorry angle sees congruent to angle t angle D is congruent to angle gee that's actually just one step so if sides if congruent sides opposite angles are also congruent okay so now if you look we have a bunch of equations and we didn't okay so now we have to do a really a really convoluted substitution and it'll take a little bit to understand because we're substituting a lot of different things in at once okay so if you look we know that this angle is congruent to this angle since this angle and and since D is congruent to G that means angle C is congruent to angle G because angle C is congruent to angle D and if d is also congruent to angle g that means that angle C angle D and angle G all have congruent measures or equal measures so they're all congruent so I can get see congruent to angle G by substitution and that and I also know that angle C is congruent to angle t so then i can say that angle t is congruent to angle g I know it work it's really convoluted and doesn't make much sense but it's completely mathematical there it's completely legal I guess to do so we're just going to put as there are reasons to substitution okay and that's actually Oh nope that's not our last step our last step we were to prove that CA T is similar to do G so if you remember to prove triangles are similar we only we only need two angles that are congruent so we have T is congruent to angle G so this angle is congruent to this angle and c is congruent to D so this one is congruent to this one so we have enough to say therefore triangle CA T similar to triangle do g by angle angle and that's our only proof we're going to do today but make sure you come back and we're going to learn how to solve the sides of any triangle
