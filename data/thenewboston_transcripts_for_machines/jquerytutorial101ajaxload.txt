hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked with a video for the new Boston okay so in this tutorial we're going to take a look at Ajax requests in jQuery now we've already looked in previous part at get and post requests however what we're going to be doing now is performing an a synchronous HTTP request which is an ajax request so we're going to go ahead and set up our page to look similar to what we did in the last parts of the tutorial which were the get and the post and we're going to create an input text area or an input field then we're going to create a button which is going to submit some data to a file now the first thing we're going to do is just test Ajax on its own and then in the next part of the tutorial we're going to look at submitting data to the file itself so let's go ahead and create a button so input type R is button and we'll give this a value of load okay so we're going to give this an ID that's just going to be button so we can use an event handler in Ajax jas which we've included on our page to actually load a particular file so we're going to go ahead and create a div inside here and this is going to have the ID of let's say content okay so essentially what we're going to be doing is we're going to be clicking this button and we're going to be loading some data into this content div from a file now we've already looked at using the load function in a previous part of the tutorial set however this is a lot more effective way because we can use things that we can use handlers like success and we can use a callback function on this to see if the data was performed correctly or the load was performed correctly so let's go ahead to Ajax jeaious and start to write out our event handler now we've called our button button so we know that we can reference that in here using a selector so we can say button and we're going to say dot click and then we're going to create a function inside of here with a block as we've done before to bring this down and inside of here we're going to create the Ajax request so its dollar sign dot Ajax and then in brackets we're going to go ahead and send multiple parameters to this so let's go ahead and create some curly brackets inside here and we'll just bring that down so it's easier for us to manage now the first parameter we give is URL and this is obviously the page that we want to load so let's go ahead and load a page that first of all doesn't exist so we can test out the next parameter which is success so the page that we want to load is page HTML now we're going to comma separate these values so I'm going to put a comma on the end of this line and come down I'm now going to create a parameter called success and we're going to create this equal to a function and again we're holding the data that's returned from this page to HTML so now we have the well we're going to come down again with these brackets here and we now have this data variable here which contains the values inside of this page to HTML or the contents of this page to HTML so what we can do now is we can go ahead and apply this to content so let's go ahead and reference content with the selector content and then I'm going to say dot HTML data so let's just run over what we've done before we go ahead and look at this in our browser on the click of a button we're calling an eight an ajax request to this URL here page two HTML which doesn't currently exist in our root directory so just take a look okay and what we're then doing is upon success we are creating a function with data and then this data is then going inside of our content area which is our div let's go ahead and refresh the page when I click load you'll see nothing happens this is because the request was not successful and therefore we didn't load any data so let's now go ahead and create this page I HTML file let's save that inside our root directory as page HTML and we'll go ahead and put some strong tags in and loaded okay okay back to our browser let's refresh the page let's click load and you'll see that we've successfully loaded in the contents of this HTML file so obviously this is extremely basic and we're not passing any variables just yet we're going to look at that in the next part of the tutorial we're also going to look at testing whether we have an error and then we're also going to be looking at what we do if there is an error and how we can display this to the user so similar to post but this Ajax HTTP request it's a synchronous HTTP request is probably a lot better to use you have a vast majority of parameters that you can use with regards to this functionality as opposed to the get and post HTTP requests so this is a lot better way to do it if you go over to the jQuery documentation you can read up about this this functionality and performing this request and how many parameters you can actually supply to it and how many different things you can do with it so in the next part of the tutorial we're going to look at sending some data to a PHP file and then returning the result
