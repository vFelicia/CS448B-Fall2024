alright guys welcome to your 33rd C++ oral and in this story I'm going to teach you guys an easier and quicker way to create an array and that's through the use of loops so in the last tutorial I tell you guys what an array was and also that we can create an array using something called an array initializer list and this is actually pretty useful when you're dealing with smaller arrays but whenever we're working with bigger arrays say that store a hundred elements or a thousand elements we're going to need a quicker way to create that array instead of making a huge long list so let me go ahead and show you guys exactly how to do that so in our very first line we're going to declare our array we aren't going to set it equal to any values just yet so I'm going to make an array called Bucky and Bucky can hold nine integers so in this line of code we're pretty much telling our compiler and compiler whenever you run this program you better set aside some space in our memory enough space to hold a nine integers so our compiler says yes sir now what we need to do is well let me just go ahead and whenever I'm done with this tutorial I'm going to print out the elements on one side and the value so I might as well give it a nice little prompt now element and value so what we're going to be doing is we're just going to print out the element on one side and the value on the other side so let's go ahead and take a look at this right now one space for elements and I'm going to list those on this side and right across from it I'm going to list their values right here so we're saying all right you talk to talk now time to walk to walk one way to create an array like I said before is the use of loops and in this tutorial I'm going to be using the for loop so let's go ahead and see what parameters we add for this so we already know that whenever we create an array that holds the nine elements every array starts at zero so I think whenever we created this int X zero would be a good place to start and we also know that if we created an array that can hold nine integers the last index in that an array excuse me the less index in that array is going to be 8 because count with me get your fingers out 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 I only counted to 8 but since we had 0 in there that takes care of our 9 elements pretty cool huh so we only want to loop from 0 to 8 so that's why you're right X is less than 9 we can make it easier X is less than or equal to 8 oops not X comment less than or equal to 8 either way it works fine X is less than 9 is a little bit quicker but you know what's one extra character so now of course we're going to use X plus plus the increment X by one each time so now whenever we see out X and line let's go just go ahead and run this real quick so I can show you guys we get that 0 through 8 and you're saying that's pretty cool so now we have the numbers 0 through 8 and those just happen to be the exact numbers that we need in our array so now what we can do is something like this Bucky X equals 99 or something stupid so what this is going to do is it's going to go through your array each element one by one and assign the value 99 so the first time it loops it's going to set the Bucky zero element to 99 the next time the Bucky one element to 99 so it's basically going to set every element in your array to 99 until it gets to eight and then it's going to do it one more time and stop at 9 so pretty cool huh so let's go ahead and print this out and see exactly what I did so see out first we'll go ahead and print out X which is the element number same as this so this is going to be 0 through 8 on the lefthand side and now just go ahead and give us some space to work with and after this just go ahead and write the value of whatever element is stored in there so this is going to be 99 if we coded it correctly so let me go ahead and end this line and whenever I run this you guys will clearly see what's going on so what we did is we loop through each array element one at a time first Bucky 0 then Bucky 1 the monkey 2 3 4 all the way to 8 in each time we loop through it we set that element equal to 99 so now we have an array called Bucky that has nine elements 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and each of those elements is equal to the value of 99 there are actually a lot of nines in this soil but you know it's good number so you know it feels appropriate so let me talk you guys through this one more time in the code in this line of code we're basically declaring a 9 element Bucky array we're telling our computer make sure you set set aside enough space to hold 9 integers in the array Bucky so it that's what it did in this line and this line all we did was print out a title basically and in our loop we knew that since we're creating Bucky 9 array that the indexes that it need was 0 through 8 so we made a simple loop that basically loop through the numbers 0 through 8 in with those numbers we could reference the Bucky element and assign it equal to the value of 99 for each one and then of course we just printed out the index which was 0 through 8 and then the value which was 99 each time so simple enough so that is basically two different ways to create an array um again whenever you're working with a really big arrays in I don't know it's just a lot easier than using an initializer list because if you created an initializer list with like a hundred values then you would go ahead and have to type a hundred values in here and it will just get messy really quick so this is a faster way um it takes a little more thinking but it's definitely worth it so for now that's all I have for you guys thank you thanks for watching don't forget subscribe and I will see you next door Oh
