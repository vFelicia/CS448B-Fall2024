all right welcome back everybody and in this video what we're going to be doing is working on a ticket from hasu and it's related to the withdraw functionality uh basically he's saying that whenever I'll show you go ahead and show you so first let me go ahead and deposit uh we'll do ten thousand and all right so so I'm going to deposit ten thousand see if we continue refresh and then I can transfer to my main account okay so right now I have uh 999 coins now let's say I want to withdraw a thousand let's see what we can use in his okay so he says well withdrawn a thousand coins um basically whenever you submit this form you don't end up with a thousand coins because the transfer fee is one coin what you end up with in your final account and I'll just make another account real quick two zeros at the beginning so whenever you actually make this transfer what you end up with in your final account is 999 coins and he's saying that a better UI would just be to say whenever withdrawing a thousand coins uh you should actually receive a thousand so the UI can just say um maybe a fee of one in the total of a thousand one and that way whatever you type in to withdraw that's what you end up with in your final account and I thought that was just a good idea so that's what we're going to be working on so the way that I'm going to tackle this is I'm basically just going to make the UI for it and then get the logic working because I have a feeling we are going to need to make some updates yeah since these have a width of 260 but I want to make a little bit more responsive as well so anyways uh we'll do that right now so first of all let's actually go ahead and make a branch for this so we aren't working off a master and ticket number 69 and I'll say hasu fee for the branch so I'm on the front end New Branch 69 a sue fee branch okay now let's figure out where that is so it's in the exchange main area and she's in the wallets so wallets withdrawal section standardize this panel interesting also let me actually look at this to do real quick okay so I had a little to do in there to standardize this panel since you see like I have different sections here and each have this like a light gray outline with some padding and rounded Corners right now all this is like hardcoded in a bunch of these places but I'm actually thinking about just removing these sections since I don't think we actually need the lines I think just the visual space will be good to have the users different differentiate these different sections but for right now just leave that as a to do since it's uh kind of out of scope for this but let's see what we got going on here so for which wrong I got the amount the account number now here is where I want to put something like a fee and total and that would go right here all right so first of all where is this coming from okay the error message when there is no error message yeah it's still a little bit too spaced just getting my spacing off the bat yeah so margin modern 32 is just a bit but yeah we can work with that so another thing that I want to do and actually thought I had this already but apparently it was for another app is well let's just make okay so I'm gonna need a flex area because I want to have fee and then the fee on the right and then those are going to be space between you see my flexbox cheat sheet so those are going to be yeah space between so the name for this can be um key value row what kind of name for this be actually fee total um detail row let me say detail row so detail row is just going to be display Flex and then what was it justify content space between and justify a Content space between okay then I'll say let's say the label and the value and I'll just do something like font weight bold for now even though I want to standardize this with my actually I can do it right now so far away comes from fonts and let's try semiball all right so the label and then the value and maybe it'll be better if these were spans but uh let's just get it working right off the bat so in my detail row I have a label and this can be like fee and then I have a value and this will be one but we'll replace that in a second with our Global constant and then this can be the total and this will be something like a thousand and one so now let's see what we got okay this is why I wanted to restyle this couple of different things so first of all okay let's start with the easy so I'm going to change this from semi bold to bold and I'm also going to make a detail row container and have margin bottom 32 pixels and I'll stick this in there and another thing that I could do is just say get the last child of the detail row and then put a marching bottom 32 on that will save me an element but I think this is all right for now maybe not but we'll adjust this later okay now this entire thing it's in the form and I'm wondering if I do with two 360 pixels okay so let's do this let's style the form 260 pixels okay so import form and then what we're gonna do import form is unstyled form and then we're going to rename this the form and then we're going to say form is a styled version of our unstyled form and then what we'll say is a width of 260 pixels and since the detail rail container is within the form then it'll shrink to the same width as that now another thing that I want to do that isn't really going to matter right now but for these inputs they also have a width of 260 pixels and I want those even though they're the same width and everything looks all right now now I want to just give those explicit width of 100 and then I'm going to let the width of the form dictate pretty much the total width of everything so in that said I am going to import my inputs as you input just like this form EFG hi I'm going to say that input is a styled version of my input except it has a width 100 percent and then these puts can be replaced with my fancy schmancy styled inputs okay now that should be the same however now if I go to my form and I ever want to grow it oh yeah look at that if I ever want to grow it or Shrink it everything kind of sticks with it noise and neat okay so now that that is taken care of let's go ahead and just style this a bit more so what I want to do here is I want to add a space in between fee and total kind of just one of these lines right here I'm wondering if it's going to be easy just to literally stick a line element there and I think it might be and we have a line component I believe don't we yes line all right so first let's stick a line there and hopefully it's close to what we want although I'm already thinking all right actually not even gonna go to this step I'm gonna go right to styling it if it's your jkl because I know we're gonna have to add some Marty margin around it all right so line is going to go in between right here all right looking good so far now let's just get some margin around you so I'll say uh margin uh let's do four pixel zero how's that look not bad not great not bad though great not bad though and not bad I think is what we're looking for all right so we'll do actually maybe if we do this yeah I think that looks alright and maybe all this should be smaller too since look at the labels here so maybe font size 12 on the entire thing but let's get our changes done that we just did so this is going to have a margin uh four pixels top and bottom zero left and right and now this container is going to have a margin bottom 24. I thought that was a little too far away from the button and now let me just refresh this and see what we're working with okay so my form changes aren't picked up and why not form width 260. well that's interesting form oh because this isn't my style form there we go okay so now now all of this is looking at okay now I just want to go ahead and see if I can get the uh see if a better font size would look any better so this all by default is 14 however if I take this container and say oh 12 that's a little bit too small 13 that is not looking terrible well let's just stick with the default of 14 okay all right now since this is looking not half bad what I can do from here is pretty much start building out this logic so first of all I'm gonna go and actually let me look and see if I have this when I withdraw yeah I don't know if I have this default fee anywhere interesting interesting interesting interesting transaction fee huh very interesting okay and now let me check out one of my other projects so protocol core transaction fee okay let me just copy this since yeah this is the fee for the back end I just thought I had a constant for it but apparently not so I'm just going to copy the standard from my other section so in Constance protocol core transaction fee is one so I'm going to say import Constance protocol core transaction fee and then I can use it in place of this hardcoded value for fee right here and also my validation okay so now what I can do is this further instead of so this value is going to be a string right okay and then this okay let's give this one the chat GPT okay instead of 1001 with the uh how do I say this with uh the result of values amount Plus core transaction fee if there is no values dot amounts and I just want to make sure it's named correctly values dot amount then render a hyphen they say then display a just a slightly an empty string then we can change it here's how you can replace this with values amount plus transaction fee okay okay let's pretty sure this is all the same and then actually I'm wondering if we should yeah I'm thinking we should split it out to a function even if it gives us a nonfunction because we're gonna need to use this in the request that as well so this looks correct just thinking if we need to split it out okay so if the amount is one thousand and it is a 1001 and last but not least let me go ahead and hmm let me make a good total EFG all right so this is going to return actually yeah this can return a number and it is going to take an amount string which is a string and we'll say that you will return the amount string plus the core transaction fee say return number or no and I will say and maybe we can just use the string amount here however is that going to get confusing I don't think so then we can just say values dot amount okay so when getting the total if there's values that amount say get total values dot amount all right so this should result in the same logic also now what I can do is I can say to local string and that's going to put my commas in where I want object is possibly no interesting so do I want to do that don't think so so values dot amount so this is guaranteed that we have an amount all right so we'll say we'll call it on a number and it's going to return a number okay all right now even if you have a zero the greater than one one two space nothing okay QA session good so 12 total 13 beautiful beautiful okay so now what's the last thing that we need to do and that is actually get the updated amount here which is uh this amount to basically get total here and this is going to ensure that we have it through validation good good good and submit this okay so now this should all be good now once I withdraw a thousand it says fee of one total of a thousand and if I just send it to the same recipient let's see what happens all right so now I withdrew a thousand and it said indeed a thousand in the total even though it was a thousand one we were able to communicate that information and everything is looking I now okay so probably some styling updates that we can do but I think uh yeah I think this is good for now now before I'm wondering if we should ask chpt if there's any way to uh improve this is out of Mound if not antistring yeah I think it's good all right got this my styles good enough for now got our two dude to take care of but sorry for another day okay so now let me just lint this and push it up so I can run lint yeah that looks good so let's say this is 69. feature of this push that up and on the front end this closes 69. just look at what we changed added a new constant our styling and all right I think we are good so now it's squash and merged it's bad boy in squash emerge squash merge and delete the branch and delete the branch pretty cool song huh yeah just made it up believe it or not all right now that is taken care of let me stop my server and let me pull down master and make sure everything is good go good to go pull those down I believe so okay so now actually let me get my phone in oh here it is so this should be good now by the way thank you sue for that this app is getting better and better each day and I wrote some things down initial State use effects add username wallet balances okay so an easy thing that we can do is add a username here actually let me start writing some of these down so passionation empty States uh let me add on this set defaults for UI I just had a little note here and what I'm talking about in this is that you see whenever you log in and you go to your wallets or something then even though you have a wallet sheet you still need to select one and then click the pause it before you see anything right here however I thought it would be a better kind of user experience is if this was like preselected however I think that the logic can be pretty easy just in this page how we can say components can set their own initial state with the use effect just basically say if I have wallets in here and there's nothing here then just set this in Redux so I end a little note for this I'll say uh using news effect update that basically just converting the notes that I had on my phone since I was uh not near a computer last night okay so another thing that I want to do is of course for this profile I realized that it doesn't even have the username right here my username is Bucky and also another thing that I want to do is I think I want to display the wallet balances right here which are just these balances on the user's profile so I'll say profile UI elements all right my phone keeps turning off when I'm trying to write this okay add username and wallet bound system profile add username and wallet balances to profile new ticket done um okay another thing is the ability to view other people's profile for example Bob is a user but I can't click this to see his profile so I'll say View others profiles no description needed boom roasted that's a ticket another one cup of ataxia social uh users okay so another thing is that users should be taken to their profile on login right now it's taken to the course page there's not really anything uh this one probably isn't going to change all that often and I don't know just want to make it a little bit more social rather than the feeling you come in and you look at chorus and it's like now up so let me check this off users should be taken to their profile on login to their profile on login boom roasted there you go uh let's see and I want to have a feature for private messaging as well but this is actually going to come after my social feature uh private messaging needed okay and she states default for UI pagination profile UI elements view others private messaging I wonder if I could label this as feature uh I don't have all my labels yet but otherwise let me just say social first and add a back end for this and this is probably going to be the next big feature that we're going to be working on okay social so basically I want to allow it where um yeah kind of like your uh what you would imagine social feature the ability to add posts with images optionally and then the ability for other people to comment on those and with that after we have that like core social feature then we could integrate these credits or coins probably for like tipping people or whenever you comment on their post or we'll figure out a way to integrate them but for right now I just want to get the basic functionality taken care of and then kind of worry about um I would say post MVP functionality but either way I yeah what I'll do is I'll just upload this video and oh let me think about what I'm doing next maybe I can get so I'm probably going to be working maybe I'll work on this social feature next because even though we have a lot of little things to take care of and you know I don't like uh having this it's not really detected I would say but um these little features kind of pile up what I also want to do is I want to build the social feature because that's going to start like allowing people to connect and getting value out of this app and before we make everything look pretty we need to make sure that we're getting giving value to the users we can actually do something and also it's going to help get feedback because they can like post if something's not working and it'll um really help us from there but uh either way I think that's good for this video so uh yeah probably gonna just grab a coffee and start recording the next one in just a few minutes but for now thanks for watching and I'll see you in just a little bit
