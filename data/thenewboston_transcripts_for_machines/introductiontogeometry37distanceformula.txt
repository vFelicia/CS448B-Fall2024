So today we're going to talk about the distance formula and the distance formula finds the distance between two points so we have this point X1 y1 X2 Y2 and that's what we just substituted in for the the two points we're trying to find the distance between so distance is equal to the square root of x 2 minus X1 squared plus Y2 y1 minus y1 squared so we're going to do some examples so we have this square root of okay so the square root of 2 minus X1 squared Plus Y2 minus y1 squared so when we solve this first we're going to do what's in parentheses first so 2 minus 6 is negative 4 squared plus 1 minus 4 is negative 3 squared so when we square a number we get 16 plus 9 and that equals the square root of 25 which if you remember is one of our perfect squares and it equals 5. and technically it equals plus or minus 5. but if you think about it you can't have a negative distance there can't be a negative distance between this point and this point it has a distance so we kick out that negative answer and we only take the positive one so it's pretty easy but we're going to do some more examples just to be sure so we have the square root of X1 minus y1 or X1 Plus Y2 minus y1 squared so when you subtract a negative you're really adding a positive so that 2 plus 3 is 6 6 squared is 36 plus 5 When you subtract a negative you add a positive so plus 10 squared which is a hundred so the square root of a hundred and thirty six and remember we only want the positive answer we're going to do one more example here square root of negative 3 minus nine squared plus 4 minus eight squared the square root negative three minus 9 gives us negative 12 squared is 144 plus 4 minus 8 is negative 4 negative 4 squared is sixteen so and if you add those together you get the square root of 160. so that's all for the distance formula make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we go over the midpoint formula
