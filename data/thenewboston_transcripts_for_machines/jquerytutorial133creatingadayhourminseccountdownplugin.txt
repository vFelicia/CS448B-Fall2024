hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're gonna be creating a plugin we're going to be creating a plugin which counts down a particular amount of days hours minutes and seconds to a specified date so inside of our plugin we're going to be giving the option which is a string a date string which will then be converted to a timestamp and we'll perform some calculations based on this timestamp we'll find out the difference between the date now and the date that we want to count down to and then we'll update these divs here now I'm gonna go through first of all the way that the plugin works then we're going to open up my browser and have a look at how this actually looks and then obviously in the second part of the tutorial when we actually have demonstrated this we'll go ahead and write the code so the first thing you'll notice that is that I have a div called countdown this can be called absolutely anything and can actually be you know any element at all as long as we obviously reference this when we use the plugin make use of the plugin I've also got for span tags here with different classes which are days hours minutes and seconds and as long as the class of any particular element this could be these could even be divs inside here as long as they're called days hours minutes and seconds then we can use the plugin and apply the plugin to this countdown div which will update days hours minutes and seconds now by default I've got these set to double zero so if you were to just create this on a page you would have 0 0 days 0 0 hours 0 0 minutes and 0 0 seconds so let's just take a look at what I've included on my page I've got obviously jQuery here jQuery J is the latest version of jQuery I've got countdown jQuery j/s which is this file here which is my account now and plug in and I've got ext J S which is where we call the plugin from so inside the xtj s you see that we've got document ready and then we apply this cow down plug into this countdown div that we're currently selecting we specify a date and then we have a callback function here that runs this line of code when the countdown has finished ie when it's you know started at a particular day this here for example and then reaches you know zero or reaches the current time and date specified here then we just change this div to we're live so in my browser at the moment I'm going to just show you we've got this set as 10th to 10th of August 2011 at 1044 inside my browser you can see that we've got one day 19 hours 13 minutes and 24 seconds and you can actually see that this value is decrementing by one every second obviously we're counting down seconds and just as you notice it come to 1 then it will go to 0 obviously the minutes will then decrease it to 12 minutes so this will that's all you know it's all bleep on so if we watch it now get down to 0 you can see that that's changed to 12 and obviously that that's back to 59 so we're gonna be creating this functionality inside of this to countdown plugin and we're gonna be giving the option to specify a date in string format and then obviously using this callback function so at the moment we are on the 8th of August 2011 and the time is 15 31 so if I go ahead and change this to 15 33 for example or 15year 15 33 you can see that we've got 1 minute and 30 seconds left so if we leave this to run in fact let's change it quickly to 32 okay so we've got 21 seconds left now no minutes no hours and no days when this reaches the end this callback function here will be initiated and this line will be run so you'll see the effect of this so really what we use that we're creating this plugin but then putting it into practice as well so let's just wait for this countdown to reach 0 1 0 and you see that it's changed to we're live so we've we've used the plugin in this sense however when we go ahead and refresh obviously it just stays at where life because the callback function is when this date has reached or is you know smaller than or equal to the current date okay so let's go ahead and obviously blank all my pages so we can start to write this I obviously haven't shown inside countdown dot jquery.js but we'll be looking at that in just a moment and creating all that so I'll go ahead and blank everything and we'll start from scratch okay so you can see that I've got rid of the div here let's go ahead and create the div and then inside ext is I'll explain about how we're doing this on what we're doing so I'm gonna say div ID is equal to countdown and then that there and inside here I'm going to create some spans that have classes of each element of the time we're counting from so span there I'll just say /ban so this one will be days and we can go ahead and just copy and paste this down so we've got span class days then we've obviously got hours and then minutes which I'm just going to say mins and then seconds so I'm just going to put double zero in each of these and we can see that in our browser now we've got zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero for representation of days hours minutes and seconds now what's going to happen is jQuery is gonna find this you know if we if we use the plugin on countdown it will find the element inside with dots days so class days hours minutes and seconds and it will change these values so it's important to have them inside of a of a span or a deer four or something like that a paragraph anything so I'll just go ahead and do this so days hours minutes and seconds and then that looks something like this so we've got not days not hours not minutes and not seconds
