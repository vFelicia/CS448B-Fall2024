hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to be taking a look at the load event handler and how we use it in document loading now if I was to go ahead and use document load we know that that allows us to know when the Dom has been loaded and we can start you know manipulating different elements on a page or anything on a page however if we were to go ahead and look at the example of a large image with a slightly larger file size let's say we wanted to take an image and know when an image had been loaded into the dom so the first thing I'm going to do is go ahead and outline this image in fact let's take a look at this in comparison to document load so I'm going to go ahead and just create some content on a page so we'll just say content so now on our page we have this when we go into ext GS which I've included on my page just here so that's that scripts included as an external file we can often use document dot ready and then here we can define a function for when our document is ready so for example show a dialog box like alert or an alert box saying ready so we have this alert box up now when our DOM is available now let's just go ahead and take a look at a larger image if we were to have say an image here that would say Berlin jpg and we're just going to go ahead and assign a oh no we won't assign an ID to it quite yet but we'll go ahead and use document dot ready with a function inside that will run when our document is loaded so this is going to be alert ready now when i refresh my page this in this image is about one or two megabytes in file size so you'll notice that the alert box will appear instantly even before the image has loaded let's go ahead and refresh you can see that we have this alert box appear our image in the background hasn't loaded it hasn't even begun to load so now when I press ok you can see that the image the rest of the image begins to load and we now have this image inside of our browser now let's go ahead and take a look at what's going to happen if we want this to happen after the image has loaded so we can either go ahead and use window dot ready which is in another tutorial and I'll talk about that in another tutorial or we can assign an ID to a particular element that we want to check for loading and this can be applied to iframes images etc etc so I'm just going to call this image image so I'm going to give an ID of image now inside ext is what I'm going to do is I'm going to select this particular image so image dot but I'm this time I'm going to use load so we're looking at the load event handler and then going to go ahead and define the function inside of this and just bring it down so what we've done is we've we're essentially checking when this image this this object or this element in our page has loaded we then run some code so we can run again alert image load it so now what we're doing is instead of using document.ready we're checking when a particular item has been loaded so in this case we're going to say image loaded when this image is loaded so if we go back to here and refresh the page you can see that the page is actually refreshed and the image was loaded in the background very quickly because it will already be present in my browser cache so now we have this image loaded alert box come up but the image had already loaded before this had happened so let's just take an example if you wanted to go ahead and perform some kind of you know jQuery operation on an image for alignment purposes or whatever you want to do you're looking at making sure the image loads before you start this code so for example you could say image load and then you could go ahead and apply some code directly that to do with the image so you'd want the image to load before you'd be able to perform anything on the image you know anything to do with the image so using the load on a particular element is helpful because you can then go ahead and actually wait for an element to be loaded and like I said this can be applied to other things such as iframes so for example if you had an iframe here go ahead and outline this and then you had the source of this being for example Google what you then do is you would come in here and you could obviously assign an ID to this iframe and we'll just call this iframe and we could then go ahead and just reference this as iframe load and then we could say alert iframe load it so now when we go ahead and refresh we make sure that's loaded which it had before we got this dialog box up you'll probably notice that it did a bit of loading in here before that happened let me just refresh again you can see they all loaded before this happened we'll go ahead and select another website just so you can see that once more so let's go ahead and choose PHP academy' dorg now when i refresh that waits once it's loaded we see iframe loaded so now that we've looked at this we can go ahead and we could also apply that to for example all images on a page so you could say IMG road all images loaded so we're using a selector but we're selecting globally across the Dom all images so now what we could do is go ahead and apply an image in fact let's take a look back at the iframe example because this shows loading a lot better I'll go ahead and choose Google Code at UK and that's going for eBay dot code at UK just an example we can go ahead and get rid of these IDs because they're not they're not relevant in this case we're going to be selecting all iframes so iframe dot load all iframes loaded so now we're using selectors in this case to select all iframes and once they've all loaded we say all iframes loaded so this is going to take slightly longer than we've looked at before so when i refresh you can see that we it waits for all of all three of the contents to load before this happens I will it will happen for each one sorry so yeah as I've just said it happens for each iframe as each frame each iframe loads however we need to look at the possibility of checking if all of our elements have loaded rather than straight after the Dom has been initialized so in the next tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the alternative to this where we look at when all objects in the page have been loaded and then we can say go ahead and alert something out
