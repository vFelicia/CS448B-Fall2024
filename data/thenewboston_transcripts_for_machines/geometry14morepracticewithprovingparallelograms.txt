okay so we're gonna do some more practice with proving that a parallelogram is a parallelogram so for this example you're given that a B is parallel to DC okay and you know that OB is congruent to that should say OD sorry OD prove that ABCD is a parallelogram so first we'll write our given a B parallel the DC o be congruent to OD and we're given that okay so what we're gonna do is we need to get well there's two things we could do we could prove that these two triangles are congruent and then say that this side is congruent to this side and therefore the it is a parallelogram or we could get them congruent and say this side equals this side and then therefore o bisects these two so it really doesn't matter which way you do it one way might have a little less steps to it okay so we need we need to we need to prove that these two triangles are congruent first okay so if you look these two angles right here are a special kind of angle their vertical angles and if you remember vertical angles are congruent so in this step we can say angle and this time we have to write it with three letters because they share this same vertex so angle a OB is congruent to angle D OC vertical so if vertical angles then congruent okay the next thing we can do since we know that this line is parallel to this line and there cut by this transversal we can get angle be congruent to angle D so angle a be au is congruent to angle D excuse me not angle D angle C D oh and that if lines are parallel then alternate interior angles are congruent so now we have an angle a side and an angle and if you remember that's one of our properties for proving triangles congruent so triangle a B oh is congruent to triangle C D oh by eight goals side angle and then we can get a be congruent to DC if triangles are congruent their corresponding parts responding parts are also congruent and finally I can say a/b c/d is a parallelogram because if opposite sides are congruent and parallel then it is a parallelogram so it's congruent to triangle E Dez by sideangleside so now I have one opposite pair of opposite sides congruent and that's to prove it's a parallelogram we need this pair of opposite sides congruent so since we just proved that the triangles are congruent we can say a B is congruent to DC if triangles congruent corresponding parts are congruent and finally because I have two pairs of opposite sides that are congruent I can say ABCD is a parallelogram because two pairs opposite sides congruent then it is a parallelogram so that's all we have to do with parallelograms today but make sure you come back when we move on to circles and a sector of a circle and an arc of a circle
