okay so the first parameter we need to feed in is the image itself which we've created up here with the name image so let's just load that in first of all okay so the next parameter we need to give it is the watermark file so essentially what we're saying is put this on top of this so we're saying put the watermark on top of this image so there the first two parameters easy to remember the next of them is the obviously the position of the watermark so that's x and y remember we created our X variable here and our Y variable here which is minus 10 pixels from the bottom and the right in the very corner now we need the is that so this is the the position of the watermark the next is the destination source which not the destination source sorry the X&Y coordinate of the source point which we don't need to worry about in this case we can set that to zero the reason being is that we're starting at zero zero in fact earlier I said that zero starts from here and many apologies its from here okay so we're saying we're sort of saying zero minus ten in words type thing if your own oh wait I'm not actually sure where the corner putts start point anyway so zero zero for this bottom corner and we're going in ten okay so the next is the watermark width and the watermark height so this is very important obviously so water mark underscore width which we determined earlier and water mark underscore height which we also determined earlier and put into these variables okay so the last one is the opacity of the watermark now like I said I want this at a twenty percent opacity the maximum or the minimum value is zero for this which would render it sort of invisible and the maximum is a hundred so I'm going to set this to twenty so it's going to give us a nice of fading image okay so that's the image copy merge function all done it's quite harmful with all the parameters we need to give into it but now we should have achieved we won so the last function we need to supply is the image JPEG function and what this is going to do is it's going to actually put the image onto the page so remember earlier we changed our header file to an image JPEG now what we need to do is actually process this image onto the page so I'm just going to supply with the image file there which is what we supplied earlier and we've copied a watermark onto this so now hopefully when we supply a source file this should work let's just create an error message at the end of here just for purposes and our own purposes no source supplied so let's go into our browser and just go over to generate dot PHP on its own and we should have received no source supplied oh no we haven't obviously because we've sour our our content type that's just me being a bit stupid so okay let's um let's just come onto our generator PHP file okay now let's first supply our source in so I'm going to say source equals phone JPEG so as soon as I do this this the phone JPEG file will be read in by this the source will become phone dot JPEG and the rest of our code should process so fingers crossed that this is going to work okay yet so it's worked we have successfully merged with a 20% opacity our logo here on to our main image so let's just fill around with this and I'll explain for us to do a hundred opacity you can see that this has come and basically you can't see through it so that's something that you could change another thing that you could change you say change these values let's go from minus 100 and we'll see that our our watermark comes in words more so 10 is obviously 10 it's probably good when you could go as those two I guess or even zero to have it on the very outside of the page but 10 I just played around with it earlier and I thought was a nice whip away obviously you can change your watermark you are not limited to PNG files but I recommend you probably use these anyway and just generally have a play around I mean you can you can specify different settings things like that we we've already looked at what each function does and why we've given a variable particular value or why we've created specific things in specific places so yeah that's basically watermarking now what we want to do is this generate PHP file exists solely as an image so you obviously don't want to you know do this to show this to your users or anything but what you want to do is show this from an index index file now we're going to do this and then we're going to have a look at saving out our generated file as well generated image rather so in the source I can type in generate dot PHP sorry so we can create this PHP file inside this HTML element in the image element as as an image so even though it's a PHP file it now exists as an image because obviously we've changed our header our content type at the top so now we can say source equals phone's jpg so this is what you would do if you wanted to just display a watermark image on the fly if you like let's go over to index dot PHP you see how this is moved in now we can grab it we can copy it we can paste it in things like that however this is useful in some instances but if you were were to say let's give an example you were you were allowing file uploads and you are allowing users to upload JPEG images well you might want to do somewhere in your upload process is run this run this generate PHP file and you might want to read in the source file but then all you want to do is you might not want to output it to the screen you might want to save this JPEG or overwrite it so what we essentially do is we create a new file with the merge things we don't just want to output it to the user so how do we go about around here saving our file rather than just displaying it out well the solution is simple we don't actually need to delete anything or create any new functions but we can take take advantage of it additional parameters that this image/jpeg function allows us so let's just open and see what we've already got here we've got logo dot PNG and we've got phone dot PNG we don't have a combined version of the two these two both correspond to their own and their own rights they the logo is the logo the phone is the picture of the phone however if we just stick a comma in here and we specify where we want our file to be written to and what we want to call the file then we can create a new file from this so let's think logically about this if the if the name of the file is to be called source at the moment it's called phone jpg we want to name it something similar so source but then we want to append on what's phone its source jpg we could say dot watermark dot jpg for example so we've got will now have phone jpg watermark jpg or even underscore watermark drop jpg whatever it doesn't really matter you can call it the original file in it or I think it'll overwrite itself anyway so now let's have a look what happens when we run our index dot PHP oh okay okay maybe not let's just check inside our room we don't want that let's just check inside here okay yeah so we've got phone jpg dot watermark jpg let's have a look at that in our browser so we go over to phone jpg which is the original by the way dot watermark dot jpg okay so yeah it's saved it hasn't displayed out to us and but this is obviously again a perfect example of why you might not want to display it to your user but you might want to just watermark images as you upload them so this is a great function to use if you were to be doing something like that so you know uploading a file allowing your users to upload a file you can automatically create a watermark on it save it and then reference back to the filename in whatever methods you choose so this is basically being watermarking images with GD library and site PHP have a play around with it see what you can do
