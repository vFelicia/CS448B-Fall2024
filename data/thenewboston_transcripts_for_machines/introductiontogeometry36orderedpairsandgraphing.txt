so our Focus today is on graphing and so this is called an ordered pair and it's you've got an x coordinate and a y coordinate and this is how they're written XY this point right here Z Zer is called the or origin that's where the two set of axes the X the X AIS and the y axis meet at 0 0 so first we're going to do some practice graphing so remember this is X comma y so this is the x axis this is the Y AIS so we we're at 0x so we stay here and we move up so we're here on the on the Y AIS and we're going to go up three so one two three this is our first point the next one is over two we have an x coordinate of positive2 a y coordinate of 2 so that's our second point three we go over one two three up one and then1 down one4 so when we write the equation of a horizontal line it's just y equals a number and for the vertical line it's x equals a number so we're going to write the equations for this for these lines this is line one and this is line two and don't forget that these lines right here these are just the axes so this is a horizontal line so we're going to write it with x equals and this number right here is whatever number x equals so x = 2 this horizontal line because it's horizontal it's y equals and y equals the number that y hits every time SO3 so the last thing we're going to talk about are points of intersection so it's where two lines meet it's the two places they have in common or it's the one place that two lines have in common so this is point a and we want to name the point using a ordered pair so to get to a I'm going to go to on the x axis so my x coordinate is two and I have to go up two for my y coordinate for B I have to go over two so if I have to go left this is 2 and up two and for C I have to go over two to the left and down two and and notice how since this is a y = a number the Y's were the same and this was x equals a number so for these two the X's were the same so that was just a quick review of graphing um it's going to help us for our next video where we're going to talk about the distance formula
