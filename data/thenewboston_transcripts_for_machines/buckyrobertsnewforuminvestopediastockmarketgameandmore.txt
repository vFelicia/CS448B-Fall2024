what's up guys was this gang sign or something anyways what's up guys it's bucky and uh welcome to just a random update video it's not even really an update video it's just a random video i uh i don't know i haven't made a video and put on my channel in a while so i was like well i'm not doing anything tonight might as well make a video so i want to tell you guys about a couple random things not a lot to do with my channel just you know i figure i might as well waste some time and make a video so first thing i want to tell you is that i made a new forum it doesn't have anything to do with my old forum doesn't have anything to do with computers or computer programming or anything like that um a lot of you guys know that i'm a huge ufc and mma fan so i thought it would be cool to make a ufc forum so the name is ufc forum online and pretty much if any guys are in the ufc or mma like that like i am um go check it out it's cool place you know talk about ufc get all the latest news and rumors and stuff like that and in addition to that if you guys want to stay updated when like the ufc payperviews or um strikeforce paid events are going on i'm going to be covering all of those live i got some cool software on my forum so if you like can't afford the fight or you're in a location where you can't get it and you don't want to go out to a bar or anything like that then go ahead and whenever there's a payperview or strikeforce event or any mma event that you have to pay for and you don't want to pay for it just go ahead in my form and i'm i'll give you guys minute to minute details i'll sit at my tv blogging on my little uh laptop so anyways that's going to be cool so don't forget that what else i want to talk about i got a little cheat sheet of stuff i want to talk about let's see talked about that check oh this other stupid thing i want to tell you guys about like for last week i've been getting involved in like stock trading and just you know something to waste my time so anyways i signed up for this website it's called investopedia.com not my website and they let you have these games where you start off with like a hundred thousand dollars and it's pretty much like pretend stock trading but you use the real stock market and it pretty much gives you fake money and it's like a stock market simulator so anyways i made a game called bucky's game so if you sign up for investopedia.com and whenever you're searching a game type in bucky's game without any apostrophes or anything like that then i'm already signed up for it so you can play against me and every anyone else who signs up for it and it like i said you're gonna start off with a hundred thousand dollars and pretty much trade stocks and see how much money you can make so if you ever wanted to you know get into stock trading but you don't have any money um go ahead and join my game and maybe i'll give out like prizes or something at the end whoever wins the most money in the stock market but um i don't know i'll think of something stupid to give out to like the top five winners or something but anyways sign up and play against me it's gonna be fun uh not really a whole much more to say about that and what else was i gonna talk about oh yeah i was making a couple php tutorials in like the last few months and i was gonna make one tonight and i was gonna talk about inheritance but i couldn't figure out if i covered inheritance before or not so instead of looking through my videos to see if i covered it or not because that will definitely take like four seconds and i do not have that time i'm a busy man i got things to do let me know if i covered inheritance or not and if not i'll make a tutorial about it if i did then i'm going to move on to the next subject and the last thing i want to talk to you guys about is my computer doing a bunch of crazy stuff the last thing i want to talk to you guys about is a video series that i'm thinking of making in the next couple months what i'm thinking about doing is for those of you who have watched us surviving the wilderness series i'm thinking about doing it myself in either the adirondack mountains or great smoky mountain national park so if you would like to see me in a surviving the wilderness series and for those of you don't know it's pretty much you go out with i think it's a knife a flint and a machete and see how long you can last in the woods no cell phone no gps no i don't know no food no tent nothing like that it's pretty much you have a knife and you see how long you can last and i'll be filming the entire thing so anyways i want you guys feedback before i make this video if you think it'll be a good idea then let me know if you think it'll be stupid and you don't want to see me in the woods for however many days then uh just tell me it's going to be stupid and don't do it just keep making tutorials so anyways um like i said that's all i have for you guys nothing important uh nothing really new and exciting to talk about but anyways if you're interested in signing up for my ufc forum or you want to get like all or you want to not get but you want to follow along without payperviews or paid events definitely check out my forum if you want to play against me in the stock trading game definitely do that and uh let me know if i covered inheritance or not and i'll be making some php tutorials in probably the next few days and lastly tell me if you think surviving the wilderness is a good idea or a bad idea that looks pretty cool on camera actually anyways that's all i have for you guys so uh thank you guys for watching this useless video and uh i'll see you later
