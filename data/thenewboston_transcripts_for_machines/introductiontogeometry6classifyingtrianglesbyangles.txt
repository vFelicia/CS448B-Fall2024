ok today we're going to be talking about classifying triangles by angles and there's four types of triangles first there's the acute triangle and like the name suggests it's a triangle with three acute angles and remember an acute angle is just an angle who is greater than zero degrees and less than ninety degrees okay next we have the obtuse triangle and it has one obtuse angle and for this one that is right here and an obtuse angle is just an angle who is greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees our fourth our third type of triangle is a right triangle and it has one right angle right here now a right angle is an angle whose measure is equal to 90 degrees and there's two ways you're gonna notice either they're gonna tell you that it's a right angle or there's gonna be a little square right here to indicate that it's a right angle you can't just think it looks like a right angle and say it's a right angle you have to be told that it is a right angle now our fourth kind of triangle is an equilateral triangle and like a equilateral triangle whose sides are congruent all their angles are also congruent so this symbol just means congruent and when we are congruent the angles have equal measure so we can mark this by do making we can mark them as congruent by doing this these little tick marks indicate that it's these angles are congruent okay so now we're going to do an example we have triangle ABC and triangle BCD and because the triangles are already marked we know that these three angles are congruent so since the measure of angle BCA is equal to 60 degrees an angle BCA angle C a B and angle ABC are all congruent we know that the measure of angle C a B is also 60 degrees and the measure of angle ABC is 60 degrees as well so this is 60 and this is 60 so that makes triangle ABC and equilateral and acute triangle because all three angles are equal and all three angles are less than 90 degrees so we want to find out what kind of triangle triangle B DC is this triangle right here well if you look at these two angles right here you'll notice that they're supplementary angles so we can add 60 plus we're gonna call this angle angle X plus X and we're going to set that equal to 180 to find out how big x equals so if we subtract 60 we find x equals 120 degrees and since 120 is greater than 90 but less than 180 we know that this is an obtuse angle so that makes triangle BDC and obtuse triangle be sure to watch the next video where we're going to talk about the interior angles of triangles
