all right guys welcome to your 63rd udk tutorial and in this tutorial we're going to be basically continuing the last tutorial and I'm going to be teaching you guys how to change or animate materials so basically what we did was we made a material instance constant and we applied it to the static mesh right here so now we basically need a way to reference this material instant constant in kisma and Mana so then we can tweak the settings of it however there's no way that we can just open kisman and you know hit new object using material instant constant H maybe if we you know if we select this and then open this no it's not working so what we need to do is we need to add something called a material instance actor and this actor is going to link your material instance constant to it and then we can reference that actor in matina and it's basically the exact same thing as referencing your material so in order to do this go ahead and make sure you have your material instance constant selected and in your actor classes select material instance actor now go ahead and right click and now you can see it says add material instance actor here now this is basically an object that you can link to a material instance so you can reference it in matina so basically this actor and your material instance are going to be the exact same thing so you're probably asking all right how does this actor know which material it's supposed to reference it's supposed to reference this material this material this material well we need to tell in the properties so go ahead and hit F4 open up the properties and make sure you have your material instance Conant selected and we're just going to hit use from content browser and now this material actor right here is associated with this material instant constant so this constant and this actor are basically the same thing so now we can go ahead and exit uh our content browser finally and let me think if there's anything I'm forgetting I think I should be good so now that this is associated with this material go ahead and open kismat and what I'm going to be doing is creating a new MAA so go ahead and right click and hit new matina and now let me just bring that up a little bit and I guess I can go ahead and open Mata right now and let me make sure everything is looking pretty good already so go ahead and right click and of course we need to add a new empty group and we'll just name this door material looks pretty good so now what we need to do is we need to add a new track inside this group and the track is going to edit the material so go ahead and right click and under new Vector material parameter track this is the track we add if we want to add edit material parameters so of course we're going to grab that one and in order to do this we need to look at it in the curve editor so go ahead and hit curve editor and I'm just going to go ahead and give myself a better View and get rid of that Loop and now I'm going to add a couple key frames in our animation so I guess we'll just keep this 5 Seconds long might as well so go ahead and hit enter to add a key frame at 0 seconds and go ahead and scroll to 5 seconds and hit enter again so our entire animation is 5 Seconds long so now what we need to do is we need to change the colors in the curve editor so what this curve editor actually I kind of forgot an important step this material parameter Track Associates it basically does this it edits the parameter of a material so it already knows what material we're using let me go ahead and drag that over over there it already knows what material instance we're using so what we need to do now is we need to say what parameter in that material we want to edit because if you remember from this whenever you're making a material this material that we just made has one parameter but typically materials have dozens and dozens of parameter so in order to tell Mata what parameter of that material we want to edit we need to specify that right here in pram name now if you remember my pram name was called doors main color now let me go ahead and make sure that all right so it turned black which means it found that color and now we're working in the door main color parameter so basically that's the parameter the main color of the door that we're about to edit so go ahead and select your very first key frame and if we go ahead and just edit the red color for now again if you don't know what I'm doing make sure you watch my curve editor tutorial and I'm going to go ahead and rightclick this and set the initial value to one and go ahead and click okay so it's 0 seconds my door has a red value of one a green value of zero and a blue value of zero and what we're going to want to be doing is over time over 5 Seconds we're going to be want to changing this door from red to Green so let me go ahead and select red and green so we can see both one and at0 seconds as you can see my door starts out it red all red no green so if I go over to 5 seconds and select that key frame now what I want to do is I'm going to go ahead and see my red is good right now because red is fading out but I want green to fade in so now let me go ahead and click green and set the value to one and go ahead and click okay so now if I uncheck all of these so we can see all my curves what we're getting is and you can see this in the uh perspective view as well what we're well yeah I guess the only views are perspective view but oh well so what's happening is it's starting out all red and the red is fading out and the green is coming in so that is our animation right there so that's basically well all I have to talk about so if we just go ahead and X out of this and now we say all right I already kept that trigger from the last tutorial so whenever we hit that Tri trigger go ahead and play this matina and change your material's color so now let me go ahead and X out of this and I guess I can go ahead and test it out right now so it starts out is Red by default and whenever I hit that trigger it slowly phased to Green over 5 seconds so that is how you can edit movement and materials in the udk so hopefully you guys understand how to edit materials now and again it's not the material you're editing it's the material instance which is basically a different version of that material that's editable so if you have any questions just make sure to ask me on my Forum the new boston.com forum and I will be glad to answer them for you but for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
