hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a more indepth look at message boxes now if you remember from two two tutorials ago we did the windows forms hello world and in that we used a message box now I'm going to show you some more stuff that you can do with a message box so let's go ahead and create a new project here we will select a Windows forms application we will call it message boxes and we will just go ahead and click okay now we'll wait for that to load and we'll go ahead and shrink it down a bit and let's come up here to our toolbox and we will add a button now we will just make the button a bit bigger or here let's go ahead and just do this let's go ahead and dock it and make it fill the whole screen okay so let's set the text value for this button to show message box and we'll change the name to button show message okay so now that we've designed a little window here we'll go ahead and double click on so show message we'll get the tool boox out of the way here and zoom in some now you can see here that we have our sub button show message click so now this is going to run whenever they click the button so let's go ahead and type messagebox Dosh show and we'll type this is a bare message box so that is the messagebox doow that uses one argument in the parameters now we can use the messagebox do show that uses two arguments in the parameters now in the first one the the single argument in here is the message that's going to show in the message box and there is no title to it so we'll make another one and we'll say this message has a title We'll add a comma and we'll go on to our second argument which is the caption and we'll just set the caption to title now we'll create a third message box this message box will say we'll do messagebox doow this has an icon we'll go on to our second argument set it to title or here comma we'll set our second argument to title and then now we have a third argument and you can see here that it says buttons as system. windows. forms. messagebox buttons now we're going to select we're going to go ahead and type message box and you can see here down in Intellis sense we've got messagebox buttons. okay messagebox buttons. okay cancel we' got retry cancel we got yes no and yes no cancel we're just going to go ahead and go with okay and now we'll add another comma and what we do here is we set the icon and it's icon as system. windows. forms. messagebox icon so we'll just type messagebox icon do information okay so now if we run this you can see you can see here is our form one and if we go ahead and click on this you can see we get one message box that says this is a bare message box and now you can see that this is the only message box that has opened up and when we call more than one message box after each other it's going to wait for the first one to close and then it's going to open the next one so this is a bare message box and then when we click okay it's going to open up the second one and it says this message box has a title and you can see right there that it says title and now the third one it says this has an icon icon and it's got our information icon and you probably didn't hear it but coming from my speakers there was the windows um default information sound now if you set it to error you're going to get the error sound um you can set if you set it to warning you're going to get the warning sound now I'll just click okay there and we'll go ahead and exit out of our program and now here's one more thing I wanted to cover with message boxes um that the net the people who created uh Visual Basic added just to help developers out a little bit so instead of having to type messagebox doow which may take a while you can just type message box and then your parameters and now you can see if we go ahead and run this let's go ahead and add a message for this we'll just type message okay so now if we go and run this we're going to click so show message box we got bear the one with the title the one with the icon and if we click okay we get another one that says message and you can see that the default title uh is message boxes so whenever you type the shorthand version of showing a message box the title is automatically going to be set to message boxes unless you override that by using the argument okay so now that you guys have seen a look at message boxes you can go ahead and make programs that will show message message boxes when the user clicks on certain things and um once you got that nailed down and you're not going to forget it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
