what's up guys is Bucky and welcome to a quick little video just wanted to make a quick video giving you guys an update about a couple things the first thing is you guys probably notice I'm not in my room anymore so if you guys are missing that beachbum poster in the background I apologize but I'll find something cool to put back there later on but I actually had to rent a couple offices in the city next to me next to where I live because I was getting too much equipment in too many computers in my room my room was like 10 foot by 10 foot and I like five computers in there so I finally decided that it was time to move out from there and get some more space so anyways at least a couple offices and carry which is the town next to me and I put all my equipment here now another reason that I needed to move out of my room is because there's gonna be some big changes to the new Boston coming up not even for the next month but for the future the biggest change is that not only are we gonna continue teaching computer programming tutorials but we're gonna expand to other subjects as well and this pretty much is every subject that you can think of I'm talking math biology physics chemistry we're gonna begin teaching all the subjects under the Sun so what this means for all you computer programmers is nothing bad because I myself in continue I'm gonna continue to teach computer programming and you know like Adobe products and all that I'm gonna pretty much be covering all computer science aspects so um if you're saying alright you're gonna start teaching that that means you're not going to teach a computer program and anymore no that's not what it means I'm gonna be pumping out a ton of computer tutorials so you guys don't worry no that leaves who's gonna be teaching all that math and biology and chemistry physics and stuff like that well actually I got another office right over here I'll show it to you guys later but I'm gonna hire people to tutor in all those subjects I just talked about mostly math science says all that good stuff so it's not only gonna be me making tutorials anymore it's gonna be a team of people in the new Boston so I another thing aside from that is I used to make tutorials probably 2 hours a week or you know maybe less than that maybe a little more but I'm gonna use make a couple tutorials a week and that's all gonna change see I have a fulltime job then I work from 700 until 330 and that covers my bills and health insurance and everything like that but from pretty much like four until when I go to bed at night and also on the weekends what are we gonna be doing now instead of you know going home and playing ps3 I'm gonna be coming here and I'm gonna be making tutorials so I'm pretty much gonna have two fulltime jobs I'm gonna dedicate all of my free time to helping them with Soros and also pumping out more computer programming tutorials myself so that's another thing that benefits you guys a lot more tutorials a lot better quality so the last thing I wanted to mention is not only are you going to get more tutorials in different subjects but I invested it in more computers faster computers the best software so the quality of these tutorials is gonna be amazing and not only that but there's gonna be no more you know doing a couple videos on this and cutting off the series halfway through whenever I start a series now I'm gonna finish it all the way to the end so pretty much like my C and my JavaScript tutorials I'm even made 10 or 20 and just cut it off halfway no more that I listen to you guys and this is what you guys want you guys want full indepth tutorials covering the whole subject not just you know the first couple chapters so that's what I'm gonna do for you guys whenever I start a series I'm gonna finish it all the way to the end in the last thing and again of course this isn't anything new but I just want to reiterate the fact that all my tutorials are continuing to be free you know charge for anything I'm not selling any DVDs I'm not asking for a subscription fee I'm not going to give you like some websites give you the first three lessons for free and then make you charge for all the good stuff everything I give you guys is gonna be free oh my tutorials all of their tour everything is free I'm never asking guys for one penny so um those are some changes that are going on with the new bus and I can't wait to start hiring people in pumping out tutorials I'm actually gonna start tutorials tomorrow so uh you guys who are creating the tutorials I know I've been gone for a while but there you go so anyways um that's all I have to say um stick around and I'll give you a tour of my office so yep all right so as you guys saw already here is my garbage not bed and here's the tripod where that camera is set up I'm holding it now and here's all the crap I had to buy a couple new computers this desk that took me about seven hours to put together all this stuff I'm actually on the second floor right here got a nice American flag in the background a little different than the beach bums poster but you know we'll deal with that um all these chairs I hope you guys like my set up right here I'm the most fire hazard of wires just laying on the ground so yeah it's only a matter of time before I burn this baby down so anyways that's my office right here that's where I'm gonna be making all my tutorials and here is the office I got for my employees let me open this let me stand back give you guys a little better view here is a Mac that I got Mac station and here is the PC station right here so I'm probably gonna have to hire two people fulltime and also a couple people parttime maybe that helped me on the weekends or after school or whatever here's just a plain old closet and I was actually gonna get a bookcase to get right there but they shipped it to my house and it's like eight foot tall and I don't know how to get it in my car so if you guys can just picture a bookcase right there then yeah that's what's going to go there so anyways here is uh their computers their stations and here is mine and this is the beginning of the education revolution so this is where all is going to start so maybe in a couple years I'll have my own ten story building but for now this is all we got guys so I hope you enjoyed that little quick tour of my office and thank you guys for watching thank you guys for subscribing and I'll see you guys later
