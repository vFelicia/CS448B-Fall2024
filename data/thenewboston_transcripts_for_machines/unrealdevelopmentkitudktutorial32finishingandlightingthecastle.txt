alright guys welcome to your 30 second and last saw real working with the castle and actually I want to tell you guys something I actually just recorded this story ille and I press produce to actually make the video and it said oh you gotta air Camtasia is messing up so now I have to do the whole dang thing again but for you guys I guess this is your first time watching it so here we go so where we're going to be doing is we have the basic shell of our castle made and now I want to add some lights to it so let's go ahead and up in our content browser oh I already have my light selected right here because I already did the freaking tutorial I'm sorry guys okay calm down calm down Bucky so let's go ahead and drag this out right here and I'm just going to go ahead and position this exactly where you want it and what I'm going to be doing is the very first thing I'm going to be doing is resizing this light and I'm going to resize it to 2.25 because our this store on this and that's the size i need it to be so anyways now just go ahead and grab a slight and first position it vertically like right about there and now what we want to do is in our top view drag it right I want to add three lights along the hallway the first light i'm going to add it kind of near the statues so let's go ahead and rotate this and rotate it 90 degrees so we can stick it right on the wall nicely so right about there it looks good and actually if we go in our front view we can go ahead and move this and push it right back and make sure it's Tucker right on the wall so go ahead and make sure in your perspective view that it looks about the right height and that looks pretty good to me so now if we go ahead in our top view we can go ahead and duplicate this a couple times I'm just going to add three lights like I said so go ahead and alt drag that out and alt drag that one out so now we have three lights along the hallway and actually what I'm going to be doing is going to hit control control so I have all three light selected on that side and if you go ahead and switch over to rotation mode hold down alt and rotate we're going to go ahead and copy all three of those lights so now just go ahead and move this in zoom out make sure you don't deselect them because switch over to move and position those directly across from your other lights so now you can make sure they're directly across because if you go up in your side view right here just make sure there but it up right up against the wall and we can verify that by if we fly around perspective mode we can see that these lights are indeed but it up against the wall nicely so what I'm going to be doing is actually before I even continue if we were to go ahead and play this game right now we won't notice that there's a little light coming from here and there's a little light coming from the statue but that isn't a game light that's just from the emit mode on the materials so actually let me go ahead and pause this video and show you what I'm talking about so I'll be back in one second her all right i went ahead and i built my lights and I was kind of making some noises I know if you guys heard that but let me go ahead and hit play from here and show you guys what I was talking about see those lights right here those aren't game lights those are just the material that's lighting up remember when we talked about material in like less I know 10 towards Orioles are go there's a certain aspect that you can add to the material to make it appear to glow but this isn't really useful whenever you're trying to play the game so whenever we're playing the game we need to add some real legs and in order to do that probably the easiest way is hello didn't know my camera was that fast okay the easiest way is just go ahead and hold l and click on the light and then this adds the actual game light so if we go ahead and switch to a lip mode real quick we can see that there is now a light coming from where that light should be pretty sweet huh and actually you want to pull this out just a little bit to make sure that because you know we don't want it to be in the static mesh or else it might give some weird vibes so go ahead and just pull that out a little bit and now what we can do is switch over to top view and just add one of these lights on top of each of our lights in the game so hold down alt and drag alt and drag and now hold down alt and drag it on the other side let me scroll out to give you guys a better idea of what's going on and all in drag and all in drag so now if you go ahead and hop over to oh we already are in lip mode our hallway is looking pretty good and lit up but if we scroll out here we notice that the front entryway is kind of dark and trick or treaters might get kind of scared to come up through her house and ask for candy during Halloween so we're going to go ahead and light up the outside so go ahead and what I'm going to want to do is just copy oops controlz I'm just going to go ahead and copy one of these lights so go ahead and alt and drag that out and I might as well rotate it 90 degrees right now 90 degrees great like that and oh let me see who's texted me you guys don't mind I'm in the middle tutorial right now it's my mom and she says when with a question mark but i forgot what i said before that so I'll worry about that later so anyways if we go ahead and in our move tool drag this above our peak and that looks pretty good right there and now in our front view we can go ahead and push this right to the wall and if we go ahead and switch over to our unlit mode and in perspective view we can verify that this is indeed blooded upright against the wall where we needed to so now I want to add one of these lights to the other side so gret go ahead and grab one of those and hold down alt and drag it to this other side and now hold down L on your keyboard click and add some game Lights right there so add one right there and in our side view right here go ahead and hold down alt and drag one over here so now if you go ahead and scroll out and look in lip mode our game is now looking that looks pretty epic the only thing is this light looks like it's a little bit in our static mesh so go ahead and push that out just a little bit and now we get a more natural light so what I'm going to do is actually going to go ahead and build my lights pause this tutorial and when everything is built I'm going to actually played the game in you know maybe I'll talk a little bit more so hold on one second as soon as I restart this tutorial my mom text me again so let's see Oh interesting my sister's texting me about Twilight and uh well I won't spoil it for you but she's basically keeping me updated on Twilight so any anyways my level is now built so if you go ahead and hit play from here check it out we now get a sweetlooking level and you might not be able to tell in this hallway because i added you know a lot of lights but as you can see outside light is emitting exactly come on cheese let me see what she said yup interesting whoa easy mouse so as you can see a light is emitting exactly where we wanted to be a low light source so that's all I wanted to cover in these tutorials again I know I didn't go over a whole lot concerning static meshes but they're basically isn't a whole lot to go over concerning static meshes once you know how to work with them and place them it's basically practice makes perfect so what I would do is if I was building a real level i'll go ahead and line everything up real nice and neat but for the sake of this story I just wanted to you guys the quick basics of static meshes and you know how to use them and how you can piece them together so what I want you guys to do is build the best level you can and share it with the community show us what your level looks like and you know you can either put it as a video response or take a screenshot and add it to my forum or a website you share it with everyone so I want to see your guys's level hopefully it's a lot better than mine because this one only took like what 10 or 15 minutes but anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
