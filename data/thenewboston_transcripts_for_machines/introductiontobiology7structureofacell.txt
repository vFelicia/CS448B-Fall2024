welcome back everyone my name is Sarah and in this video I'm going to talk about cells and cell structures just a random side note I picked up a Java monster Irish blend Irish coffee without the alcohol in it it is absolutely fantastic so now that I have a massive amount of caffeine and whatever other energy supplements they put in this thing I'm ready to go cells come in a variety of shapes and sizes they are you can have unicellular organisms which only have one cell or multicellular organisms which have two or more cells humans for example contain about 1 trillion cells that's a lot of cells cells perform metabolic functions to sustain life and they divide to produce new cells that are identical the parts of a cell are known as organel or little organs most of these organel are only found in ukar iotic cells unless you decide to take a microbial diversity class in which case you will find that this is not completely true but you don't need to worry about this for the scope of basic biology anyways the first organel we are going to talk about is the cell membrane this is the outer boundary of a cell also called the plasma membrane this is composed of a by layer or double layer of phospholipid molecules with proteins embedded within if you remember from my organic chemistry lecture video rather a phospholipid you've got your lipid molecule here with your hydrophobic Tails hydrophobic meaning water hating and you've got your phosphate group here which is hydrophilic or water loving the cell membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell and it is semipermeable which means some molecules can enter some can't and the model we use for the cell membrane is called the fluid fluid mosaic model you have your proteins embedded within the phospholipids there's another protein you've got the hydrophilic phosphate groups on the outside interacting with water and you've got the hydrophobic Tails facing each other so they interact with each other they don't have to worry about touching water or anything like that the cytoplasm it is all the cell material between the plasma membrane and the nucleus and organel are located within the cytoplasm you have the cytoskeleton these are proteins proteins that are located in the cytoplasm responsible for maintaining cellular shape holding organel in place moving the cell and moving structures within the cell and the cytoskeleton is composed of microfilaments and microtubules microfilaments are really long thin structures microtubules are tube tube shaped structures we next have the the endoplasmic reticulum or ER not to be confused with ET over here which is extraterrestrial anyways ER is a system of membranes extending from the nuclear membrane it control it's responsible for movement of materials through the cell synthesis of proteins and modification of other molecules and you have two different types you have rough endoplasmic reticulum which hasi organel called ribosomes bound to it and you have smooth endoplasmic reticulum which does not contain any ribosomes ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis there are freestanding ribosomes which are just scattered throughout the cytoplasm or you have ribosomes that are attached to the ER ribosomes that are preing are involved with cellular protein synthesis ribosomes that are attached to the ER are involved with um proteins that are going to be exported from the cells we next have GOI bodies are also known as the GOI apparatus this is a series of membrane Stacks they receive what these little transport things called vesicles from the endoplasmic reticulum and they modify and package these molecules for transport and vesicles are just little storage areas that are enclosed by some sort of membrane vacul are big storage areas lomes are a special type of vacuum these contain digestive enzymes so if you were to bust open a lome within the cell it would destroy the cell it would eat the cell alive basically lomes are different because they have not one membrane but two membranes so two phospholipid B layers instead of just one next we have peroxisomes they're similar to lomes and they con contain enzymes or proteins that neutralize toxins glyoxysomes are similar to peroxisomes they contain enzymes proteins that convert fatty acids to carbohydrates we next have the mitochondria these are the powerhouses of the cells they have two membranes and inner membrane and an outer membrane the outer membrane separates the MIT Andria from the cytoplasm the inner membrane is the site of the electron transport chain and ATP adenosine triphosphate synthesis this is called they are the sites of cellular respiration the nucleus is the location of most of the DNA and RNA the cell makes it's also a double membrane so two membranes containing these big holes called pores where things can enter and leave the nucleus and within the nucleus is a structure called the nucleolus which is the site for synthesis and storage of RNA next we have fella and cyia these are cytoskelet cytoskeletal extensions from the cell's surface and they're involved with movement think of fella as these long tails that extend from the cell Celia are more like little itty bitty tiny hairs on the surface of the cell the cell wall is composed of different molecules depending on what type of organism you have organism you have for example plant cells have cell walls composed of cellulose fungi have cell walls composed of a molecule called kiten cell walls are very rigid they're involved with um structure and support of the cell as well and they are located outside of the plasma membrane plastids are found in organisms that are capable of photosynthesis you have lucast or amop plast that store a molecule called starch chromoplast store pigments which are involved with color different pigments produce different colors red white green blue what have you and then you have chloroplast which contain the molecule chlorophyll and these are the sites of photosynthesis and finally we have organel called centrioles which are involved in cell division you really only find these in animal cells but this is all I have for cellular structures in my next two videos I'll be going over the differences between plant and animal cells I'll show you pictures of everything so hopefully it'll make a little bit more sense
