hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be working more on the truck class and then we're going to start building the interface for our program and adding more to it so let's go ahead and um add one more thing that we're going to be that we're going to need for our truck class so we'll just add a function that gives the information about the truck so let's come up here to our car class and let's find the two string function that has been overridden so you can see here we've got uh name color uh number of doors and speed so we'll go ahead and copy that because we're going to use that as the base for our uh get information now you may be thinking we could just use the two string and then add stuff to that well we're going to be adding stuff in between those values so that won't be very practical so we'll type public function get truck info as string so it's going to be returning a string so we're just going to return the name the color the number of doors and in between here let's go ahead and add uh the cab size so and then we will add um truck cab length so then we'll add the uh bed length so we'll just type bed length and then we will add um the length value so truck bed length and now we will add uh just the number of doors so we're going to need a new line in between each one of these so environment. new line and then we'll add this string right here and then one more new line uh right here so environment. new line okay so now that we have everything we need for the truck class let's go ahead and minimize that and you can see that I've organized all the code in here we got the car super class now the super class is the main class that all of these inherit from sports car truck and then our two enumerations so we'll come back here uh into form one. VB we'll zoom in some so let's go ahead and go to the designer and we'll just add a list box that will hold all of our um car or truck or sports car objects so this box right here we'll make it a little bit bigger and we'll um shrink it we'll bring it down like that now let's go ahead and bring it down a little bit more and we're going to add another button so we'll come back to our toolbox we'll click button or we'll add button one and we'll set the text to new car and then we'll set the name to button create C now we're not going to be using that right now uh but we will um later on so we'll come back to form one. VB and now what we're going to need is a an array list that's going to hold all of our car objects now we going to use an array list because we don't know how many objects the user is going to be adding to the list box so we will type private um cars as new array list okay so whenever our form loads let's just go ahead and um add these two objects right here to our array list so we'll just type cars. add and the will then we'll add default car and we will add the default sports car okay so now that we have these two cars in our array list let's go ahead and um add all those items to our form one or to our list box now let's go ahead and rename the list box right here so we'll just call it list cars and we'll come back in here and we'll create a sub that will do this for us so we we will type private sub add all cars and this is just going to run once um when the form one loads so what we're going to do is add all cars so we'll type for each car as and then we want to do it of type we'll do it of type all cars . car so you can see that we can use polymorphism in this um in this uh for each Loop right here because we can pass a car object we can use car objects in this but um we can also use sports cars and trucks so hold on let's typ this again um in so our array list that we're going to use for this is cars so for each car as all cars. car in Cars that might be a little confusing but we're just going to go ahead and add that to the uh list box right here now as I was saying we're going to use polymorphism for this because we can treat sports cars and trucks as a car because they inherit from it um so we don't have to do a specific type in here so we'll just type list cars. items. add and then we're just going to add car dot car name so this is going to add our car name to the list box so let's go ahead and run this and looks like we're getting an error here so we' got in speed is not accessible so we're just going to have to make that uh let's see here we're going to have to use this property right here so we can just go ahead and instead of typing in speed we'll just type speed so we're accessing the speed property and not the variable itself okay so now let's run this again and see if we get the desired output um looks like we're going to have to call that sub so we'll just type add all cars okay so now it should work but before it we'll be able to print out uh the car name of our default car and our default sports car we're going to have to actually set the name or it's going to be printing out a uh null object inside of our list box and you won't actually see it so we'll set the first one to uh we'll do a Honda CRV and then for the sports car we will just call it uh Mustang GT so Mustang GT right there okay so now if everything runs right hopefully we get each car um inside of our list box now we can actually um show the information of each one of these different cars but we'll be doing that in the next tutorial as you can see if I select CRV it gives us the Mustang GT info and that's not exactly what we want so go ahead put this code in if you haven't already and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
