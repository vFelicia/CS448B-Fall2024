okay so today we're going to talk about proving lines are perpendicular now we haven't done any proofs yet proving that lines are perpendicular but we've talked about what perpendicular lines mean they intersect to form right angles and they have opposite reciprocal slopes but today we're going to use the fact that they intersect to form right angles to prove that these two lines a b d or excuse me that b d is perpendicular to a c so we're given that AB is equal to CB and that b d bisects this angle right here ABC so prove that b d is perpendicular to AC so first thing we're going to do is rewrite our given AB congruent to CB BD BCT uh I'll just fit that right there this is going to be um one of the longer proofs we've done so I got to save some room so I can fit it all on here and the reason for that is given okay so you're probably wondering how do we prove that these are parallel or perpendicular well to do that we have to prove that they're right angles but to do that what we're going to try and do is get them to be congruent so first we're going to try and get these triangles congruent which is always a good place to start if you're not really sure where to go like which direction to go in when proving something if there's triangles you probably want to get them congruent so next we we're going to take the definition of BCT which we talked about in our last lesson and rewrite or write the next statement so if B D bisects AB C that means it splits it up into two congruent angles so this angle is congruent to this angle so angle a b e is congruent to angle e b c oh I'm sorry I wrote that wrong I didn't write it in the same order this should be c b e and that's if bisects two angles that are congruent we have two angles that that are congruent okay so now we're almost there we have a side and an angle congruent to a side and an angle and if you look they share this side be e and we've used this many times that be e is congruent to be e and that's reflexive property so now we can get these two triangles congruent triangle a b e congruent to Triangle CB e I'm just going to name them the same way I name these two angles and that's by side angle side and you have to remember that this angle is the included angle of those two sides see if we knew that this one was congruent to this one we couldn't use side angle side for that okay so now we can get like I was saying we can get be EA I'm going to use a different color we can get this angle congruent to this angle so angle b e a is congruent to angle b e C and that's if two triangles are congruent and then I'm just going to abbreviate this so I save space corresponding parts are also congruent so then if you look these two angles right here have a special kind of relationship they are they are supplementary because they form a linear pair which if you remember one of our linear pairs is supplementary angles so then we can say that the measure of angle be EA plus the measure of angle b e c is equal to 180Â° and that's the reason for that is if two angles form a linear pair and I'm going to have to abbreviate that too then they are supplementary okay so next we can say and you don't know this reason yet because we haven't talked about it yet but next we can conclude that that angle b e a and angle b e c are right angles now we can conclude this because if two angles are congruent and supplementary then the angles must be right angles because if we were solving this mathematically we knew that they're 80 180 and since they're congruent they're two equal parts we would divide 180 0 by 2 and get them both equal to 90 so that's why we can say that these two are right angles so if angles are congruent and supplementary then right angles and now we have one last step to say that BD is perfect perpendicular to AC because if right angles lines are perpendicular because right angles are only formed by perpendicular lines so that's the only proof we're going to do proving that lines are perpendicular but make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're going to do more proofs using the definition of a rectangle
