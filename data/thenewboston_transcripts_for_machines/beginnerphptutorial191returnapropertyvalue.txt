hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in the last example we looked at classes properties and methods now in this example we're going to look at how we can put this into use and actually display out our balance so what I've already done is I've created a class called bank account which going to reference as a new bank account later and we've created a property called balance which is equal to zero now at the moment you may be thinking well I can do this normally in PHP so why would I change it the difference is is its structured so much better that later on what we can do is we can give a bank account two to three for a hundred people without having to store any particular information so we can we can create two different instances of this bank account and run along having two different balances so this object is reusable okay so in our public function display balance we need to echo out our balance so we're just going to basically simply say echo now usually in procedural PHP you'll think to yourself oh yep this is absolutely easy we're just going to say echo balance and then that's it however what we actually need to do is we need to reference the fact that we're taking a variable from this class itself now we've created the the balances public so we're able to use it wherever we like what we do is instead of just echoing out the balance itself we need to say echo this then we do a hyphen and a greater than sign so we're taking something from this and this as a variable with a with a dollar sign means this class in general so we're taking it we're echoing out a value from this now we need to specify the variable name now this might confuse you because what we're going to do is we're going to type the variable name like this we add the semicolon on the end so that's nothing to do with this but you'll notice that I've I reference the variable balance without the dollar sign so this is the way we prints variables when we're talking about within a class we just give the plain name and this will take the value of balance which is zero at the moment so at the moment we have created our balance to be zero earlier on and now we're echoing out this balance we're echoing out the balance here and you can do this with any other properties that you might have so we're essentially just echoing out our balance that's it so let's make this a bit more userfriendly before we begin I'm going to say balance and then a space and then we're coming out the balance so how do we go about echoing this out now we can't just say echo something or bank account something what we need to do is we need to create a new instance of our of our class and our class name is bank account so let's let's create a variable called Alex for example so I've created a variable called Alex and this is going to be my new bank account so I'm going to say Alex equals new bank account so new is the key word we use in creating a new instance of our class so we're creating a new instance of our class which is going to be held inside Alex so what I can do now is I can say Alex and I can use this notation here to grab different things out of my class so what I can do is I can say Alex and then there so our and our greater than sign and then what I can do is I can either echo out properties within my bank account or I can run method so I can say display balance so all I need to say is display balance so let's recap on what we've done we have created our method before and now what we've done in this part of the tutorial is we've echoed out this balance we've taken this variable here from this bank account okay so now what we've done is we've created a new variable called Alex and assign this to a new instance of the bank account class we don't need these parentheses here by the way sorry so we just need a bank account on its own so remember this is case sensitive so ensure you've got a capital B n/a for these two depending on what you name your class they classes can be all lowercase but it tends to be standard notation that you use camel caps or capital letters it's somewhere so it's easily to read or easy to read sorry so now what we're doing is we're taking this new instance of Alex and we're displaying the balance so remember you're going to need the parentheses here because it's a method within our class so let's go back to our page and refresh and see what we've got okay so we've been displayed with balance zero so we've successfully used a method within our class to read out or echo out rather a a property within our class so let's change this to 10.5 and let's refresh to see if that works ok yeah so the balance is now being updated so we have uhm yeah like I said before we've taken a method called display balance and we've echoed out the balance that's currently inside this bank account now when we create a new instance of this class in another variable this this property balance we'll be able to change depending on each each variable we assign this new bank account to so we'll look at that a bit later on but I just thought I'd mention it now because you may think that as it stands you could have done this just you know normally in PHP you wouldn't have had to use objectoriented programming so let's think about returning a value rather than displaying it so let's return balance so now what we can do is we can write echo here and we're basically echoing out the return value so when we refresh we get exactly the same thing up so this is probably a bit better way to do things just so you're returning a value and we can do whatever we want down here with the balance so it's exactly the same as functions in PHP we're returning a value from this method which is grabbing this property up here and then we're echoing out and so you can see that if we did it without the echo you're going to get basically nothing up on a screen because you're not doing anything with the return value so we can echo this we can even create a new variable for example called balance and that equal to our display balance however we're not going to be doing that for now because we could just going to be demonstrating echoing out different values
