hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new bustin in this video we're going to take a look at the document ready handler in or the ready handler in jQuery now you can see at the moment I have a basic page just setup an html5 document with a title stylesheet and I also have included jQuery now when we write jQuery code we tend to want to load all of our code at a particular point straight after the document object model is available or the Dom for short you'll probably see it written like this quite a lot of the time and for this we use the ready event handler and we bind this to the document the overall document and what this is a lot what this allows us to do is load in our code before anything else starts to load so we have an advantage where we quickly load in our code or what we want our page to do so our from our events etc animations before the page is loaded so there are are advantages and disadvantages to this method however I'm going to go ahead and show you how we would use document ready so the first thing I want to do is go ahead and create an external javascript file so I'm going to open up a new file in my text editor and i'm going to save it inside my javascript directory and i'm just going to say save this as ext js4 external now we need to go ahead and include this on the page so let's go ahead and type out our script tags the type is text JavaScript and the source is Jay s /e xtj s which is the father we've just created inside of our Jay s folder now let's just say we have some document content here that's going to look in the browser very much like that so nothing really too special so I want to go ahead and I want to load or do something before the document has loaded so I can go ahead and I use a selector to select the document and then I say dot ready now inside the dot ready Handler we need to create a function and this is the standard notation that you'll use or in fact the overall concept of what I'm talking about is what you would usually use when you were would load jQuery code or write jQuery code so inside here we outline a function and then we give it some curly brackets and what we want to do is just pull this down and now inside of here this is where all of our jQuery code would would go so essentially as soon as the document is ready ie straight after the Dom has been registered we can go ahead and actually start to write something out so in this case just for this example I'm going to go ahead and alert something out so I'm gonna alert out document is ready so now when we go ahead into our browser and refresh just go and refresh you'll see that this has been loaded straight away now we've only got some page content here however you'll notice that as soon as the page was reloaded this alert box came up so if we were for example to go ahead and write some other code in here we now know that as soon as the document is ready we'd be able to actually go ahead and it and you know write our code inside of here alternatively if I was just to go ahead and say alert ready for example it does more or less the same thing but the standard way that we would write in jQuery we would usually use document dot ready every time we were to write some jQuery code so it's probably best to get into the habit of when you write any jQuery code and you include it you know as we will be doing in this tutorial series in an external file go ahead and use document dot ready just to allow the jQuery code that you've written to be run as quickly as possible
