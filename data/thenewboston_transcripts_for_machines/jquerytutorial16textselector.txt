hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston now in this video we're going to be talking about the text selector in jQuery now the text selector will select all input types with the VAT with the type text so for example input type equals text if we were to use the text selector this would be the field that would be the current element so we've got this input type of text let's go over to our browser and refresh and preview this you can see that we've just got a text element now if we wanted to create a global styling system I guess where every time we were to click onto an element or a focus in on an element and then focus back out we created a background color of yellow for example or in actual fact we could create a border or apply any CSS rules to this so let's go ahead and test this out we're going to go over to selectors jeaious which we have included in our page and inside selectors jas we need to first of all reference when we click this or when we click or focus into this particular element so the element is text and we use a colon and then text to reference this so now we can say focus in and we can create a function inside of here so we're creating a an event handler for all type all input fields with the type text so now when we focus in on something we can just alert hello to test this out so when we focus in that's not worked so I think we need to create that small eye okay so now that we've focused in to our text area we get this message hello yeah obviously that's going to keep coming up now because we're constantly focused in however what we can now do is we can reference our our text area by using this and then we can say dot CSS and we can apply some basic CSS to this so I'm going to say background color yellow yellow so now when we focus in on this the background color should have changed to yellow ah so let's go ahead sorry that's er that's my fault though we need to supply two arguments the first one is the property itself and then the value of this property so let's go ahead and refresh when we click on here we see that the box turns yellow when we come away nothing happens because we haven't set the the focus out to this as well but for times sake let's just go ahead and copy and paste this down and then change that to focus out and change the background color to white okay so now when we click in here we get yellow when we focus away should be on oh sorry it would be below when we focus in and then out it should change but it doesn't let's just try and amend that there should okay yeah so I forgot the hash okay so now when we click in so we when we focus into a text box and we focus out this now changes the background color so we have the effect here but now what happens when we add other elements such as the text area now text area does not belong to the type text input field set so when we click on this we don't get the same effect so we can set specific effects to input fields by using this text selector we could for example change this to you I think it would be text area I'm unsure let's have a look no it's not so yeah so just as another example let's go ahead and change this to button and button and now you'll see that we can't click when we click on here the background color doesn't change so we're specifically selecting this text area and changing all this text form field and changing the background color when we focus in and then removing it and change back to white when we focus out so this it's selector is extremely useful for when you have form fields and you want to apply styling to all of these particular fields text fields but you don't actually want to apply it to things like the buttons and anything else like that so obviously we can use the input selector as well and what the input selector will do will will change everything with the value input so it still works on here it doesn't work on it well it does work on the text area okay so now it's also worked on the text area so just by using input we have any input fields it applies to all of them however we can select specific form fields as well with specific values for example we can also choose password we'll be looking at that in another part of the tutorial
