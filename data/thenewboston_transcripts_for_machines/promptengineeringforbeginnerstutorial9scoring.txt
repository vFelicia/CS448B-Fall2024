hey welcome back everyone this is Ian bringing you another video in this AI series with the New Boston in today's video we're going to be talking about another feature from prompt layer and that is scoring our prompts it's really simple so this video is not going to be very long but this is a super impactful feature and I definitely recommend that you play around with it so you can see at the top here we are bringing in OS and prompt layer setting up prompt layer with our API key and then pulling in open AI from prom player then we create our client from open Ai and we're ready to use the openai API while also tracking it with promp player so that's the same as it's been in the last few videos nothing new there but if you need to get caught up to speed go back a couple videos we have an explanation of every line of code that you're seeing here so all promp layer requests have unique IDs and these can be optionally returned when logging the request using prompt layer and the request ID we can score a request with an integer between 0 and 100 this is most often used to understand how effective certain prompts are in production so essentially what it's saying here is that we can return an ID that allows us to connect a prompt with a score that we give to it and we'll see that here in a second in our actual code but if we score our prompts let's say that we have a prompt maybe multiple prompts and we're doing like some AB testing then we can run our prompts get our responses and based on the response we can say okay this was really close to what I wanted or this was exactly what I wanted or this wasn't what I wanted at all and then we can score those accordingly so we can say okay it wasn't what I wanted at all that's a zero this is exactly what I wanted that's 100 and then when we go back to our prompt player dashboard later we can see all the scoring attached to all of the prompts and their responses this is especially helpful for working on teams so everyone can see how well these various prompts are performing okay so down here is the actual request to the openai chat completions API and you'll notice this is similar to our previous video where we have two variables here response comma plore requestor ID so the first thing that we're getting back from this call right here is going to be the actual response object and then the second thing is going to be the prompt layer request ID and the reason we're getting that second thing is because inside of this call to. create at the very bottom we have an argument here return plore and we have it set to the Boolean value of true so what that does of course is it gives us back the prompt layer request ID which will show you how to use here in a second at the bottom when we actually connect the response to the score that we're going to give to it everything else is the same we set our model we have our messages list which has an object inside of it we tell it what the role is and then the content in this case what is the capital of New York and then how many tokens we're going to use and then we have some tags if we want to add some tags to this request so in this case it's a list of strings and I just created one specific tag you can put as many as you want comma delimited this one is just going to be scoring uncore example so we want to make sure that we have return Poore ID set to true that's super important because we do need to get back that plore requestor ID so that we can actually use it to track the request with the score that we're going to assign to it so down here we're going to print the response we'll print a space after that we'll print the prompt layer request ID another space and then we'll Traverse through the response to get the content of the message inside the choices list and we'll assign the result of that to the answer variable which will then print the answer should contain the word Albany in it so we're going to say correct uncore answer is equal to and then in all lower case we say Albany in answer. lower and what this does is it returns a true or false Boolean based on whether or not the word Albany is inside of the the answer so we're going to use that to determine whether or not we give a 100 or a zero in our score so as we go down to the very bottom here this is where the magic happens so with prompt layer we can call Prompt layer. track. score this takes three arguments so the first one is that request ID and that's why it's so important for us to have the plore requestor ID because that's what we put in here so now it's matched up to the request that was made and prompt layer knows okay this is the one that we want to add the score to so then we give it a name in this casee I'm going to call it capital of NY capital of New York you can name it whatever you like you just pass that in as a string and then the last thing here is super important is the score so in this case I say score is equal to the number value of 100 if correct answer so if correct answer is true then it's 100 else it's a zero so here is just Boolean back and forth between 100 and zero you can modify this logic if you want it to be a different number based on some other outcome but for us it's a matter of did it work or did it not work if it worked and it had Albany in the answer then we give it 100 if it didn't work false no albony in the answer then we say zero and it's as simple as that so we can run our request and when it comes back to us we'll have printed out the response we'll see that prompt layer request ID and then we'll see the actual answer so here is the response object here's the specific request ID and then here's the answer the cap of New York is Albany you'll see that the A and Albany is capitalized that's why we have to use a lowercase Albany and then take this string and make it to lower so that when we do the comparison we get a one toone comparison to find out if the word albony is actually in the answer in this case it is and so our score should be 100 so let's head over to the promp ler dashboard and see what it looks like there all right here we are in our dashboard you can see that it's updated automatically with this most recent request you can see that the tag scoring uncore example is there and if we click on this it takes us over to this part of the dashboard I'm going to go ahead and move my camera out of the way and you can see that we have this thing called scores in the top right corner so if I click this little carrot to drop it down you'll see that there's the default score is set to no score however down here you can see capital of NY which is what I tagged this specific score as is set to 100 so we can actually add multiple scores to a single request so if you were to do the same code that we did multiple times maybe with different tags because you're trying to figure out different aspects of the response then these would show up layered on top of each other there is of course the default score and so in this case you can go in here and score it manually if you like anything from Z to 100 and apply it and when you apply it you'll see it when you drop down it's still set also I should mention that if you do not include a score name here if you were to Omit this then it would give give you the score value but it would not have a name and therefore it would override the default value so the default value that we saw over here where it's either no score or score that's the one when you don't include the name in our case we did include a name and so it set the name to the value that we assigned to it so that's it for scoring with prompt layer super easy super quick but a really powerful feature that'll allow you to get some really good insights into your prompt requests and the outputs that you're getting back from them thanks a lot and we'll catch you all in the next video
