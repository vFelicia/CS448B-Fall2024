hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to look at jquery toggle and actually toggling and we're going to be performing an action depending on when the button is clicked so for example we're going to use a link now let's go ahead and create a link in our markup and i'm going to write in here press me or click me would be more appropriate okay so inside the href we need a hash and we want to create an ID and i'm just going to call this click me now what we're trying to achieve is when we click this the first time we click it we are going to do something and this second time we click it we're going to do something else so let's go to our browser and preview this and you'll see that we just have a link click me when we click at the moment it does nothing so we need to create a handler that checks when first of all this is clicked oh in fact no we can just use the toggle so when this is clicked we can append the event handler toggle and this will do two things the first thing that we'll do is show us something the second time it will revert back or will show us something else then it will revert back to the first option so let's go ahead and create a div underneath here and we can give that an ID of click event so once this is clicked we need to show an event and then another one and then revert back to the first one and the toggle function actually allows you to show and hide elements for example simultaneously so you can use the same button however in this tutorial we're just looking at the event so this will show you how it works and then later on we can use toggle to actually hide and show things in a preview in a later tutorial so now we want to go ahead and create a new javascript file and this is going to be called toggle j/s and we want to include that in our page as well so you just copy and paste this down here and change this to toggle Jeff's okay so we want to add an toggle event handler to this click me so let's go ahead and type a dollar in parentheses we need to reference it which is click underscore me then we say dot toggle now this time we're going to be creating two functions inside here as opposed to one as we've seen in previous tutorials so we want to first of all create a function here with the block and then we want to create another function here with another block so let's just go ahead and pull this down and the same with this one so we can work in a in two different areas so we've got here and here okay so the first time we want to click the button or we click the link we want to display something so we need to reference our click event div and we're going to play some text inside of here so let's go ahead and say click see what I called it event click event dot HTML which is going to place some text inside of this div let's just say yes and then we can go down here and choose to do the same thing so click event and dot HTML no so now what's going to happen is when we click on the link here we're going to use the toggle to first of all display yes in this click event div then we're going to display no the second time the user clicks on it what will happen is when they click on it again it will then display yes again now you may be wondering what use this might have well if you had two different options for example you wanted to say I've no display link to say do you like jQuery and the you want to give the user the option to click it and change the value I mean so that's an audit example but hopefully through this tutorial you'll see the functionality of it so now that we've got click me when we click it once you can see that we've displayed yes as we've seen in our code when we click it again this now changes to no so you can now see that when we click it a third time it changes back to yes so essentially what we're doing is we're checking for the click of this but we're toggling so we're toggling between yes and no so hopefully now you can see the advantage of being able to use this and use it easily being able to change an option for example this could for example be an option that the user might want to change within a settings area on a web site it could have it has a variety of uses and a wide variety of uses at that so I'll leave it up to you with as how you use this and how you interpret the uses it can have however for now that is the toggle event handler in jQuery
