all right ladies and gentlemen welcome to your 27th udk tutorial and this is one of the last tutorials I'm going to be going over when it comes to materials it's this one and then I got one more so 27 28 and then I'm going to be going to food lion grams some oatmeal cream pies and watching some netflix movies so we only got two more tutorials on materials to go and then we can move on to the next topic so in this tutorial I'm going to teaching you guys about emissive materials now we can go ahead and look at the emissive property right here and the emissive property or attribute of a material is pretty much the glow so we can have like a spaceship with lights on it and we can make those lights emissive AKA glow pretty cool huh so I already know what material I want to work with so go ahead and select textures right here and we're going to be grabbing two textures now go ahead and search wall light and I found this one in this one right here and by the way I want to give you guys this little tip whenever you're looking through textures you can kind of see what they're used for by the last letter for example this last letter is d this means it should be plugged into the diffuse property this one is n this one should be plugged into the normal map this one is e m that means a missive map so we're going to be grabbing that one for the emissive map by anyways since this is the that's the one we want for diffuse so go ahead and we're going to be making out of fuse and in a missive texture so now let me give you guys another shortcut in order to add textures really quick just go ahead and hold T on your keyboard and click so I'm going to click with T right there and it's going to add my texture and I'm going to click with T right here and it's going to add my texture now this one is already set up since we had this selected in the content browser so go ahead and hook this up to diffuse however this one is the wrong one I just wanted to add that real quick so we will actually want to associate this texture with this emissive mapper here so make sure you have this a Miss and map selected and go ahead and hit this green arrow which means use the selected object in the content browser and whenever you hit that it switches over to your missing absence this was a texture that was selected so now go ahead and expand that because i'm done with the content browser and also expand your preview window just because i think you look better and now look what happens whenever i plug this a missive map into this missive property keep your eye on the preview window whenever i plug it in those lights kind of light up and that's basically what an emissive map is an emissive map is basically a blackandwhite map and the white parts tell the udk what parts of your material needs to glow so wherever this a Miss map is white that's the part that glows wherever it's black that's the part that stays dark pretty cool huh so now you're saying all right that's pretty cool but what if I want to kind of change my lights a little bit say for example I want to make them a new color or I want to make them brighter or dimmer well in order to do that the easiest way is probably to add a materials expression so go ahead and we're going to go ahead and delete this connection right here and actually I'm going to drag this back so what we need to do is we need to add a multiply expression what the heck was that noise that I just get it email you guys hear that anyways go ahead and hold em on your keyboard and leftclick and this is a shortcut to add a multiply so go ahead and let me see how i want to set things up I actually want to control this down here and there we go so what we're going to be doing is we're actually going to be hooking up this multiplied to the emissive and now this multiplied needs two values in which to multiply just go ahead and plug in this one for B and you remember before when we use that constant three vector i'll go ahead and show you if you rightclick constant constant three vector this is a vector with the r g and b value so go ahead and grab all of those and plug them into a and basically this red is going to be multiplied by this red this green is going to be multiplied by this screen in this blue is going to be multiplied by this blue but if we see right now since all of these values are 0 this red green and blue is going to multiply by zero and remember anytime you have a number and you multiply by zero the outcome is zero so right now we're getting these three RGB values we're multiplying them by 000 in our outcome is 0 0 0 so this basically has no emissive properties right now and we can verify that by taking away this connection you see when we take it away and add it take it away and add it our material doesn't change glow so what we need to do is we need to change the globe properties and we do that by changing the mult or excuse me the constant 3 vector properties so let's go ahead and boost one of these colors by the way by default if you want to get your old glow back just type 1 11 and there's your old glow back so say we want to add a little more let me think of a cool number let me go ahead and boost my green by like eight hundred and then go ahead and focus away from that and now you can see we get in a nice powerful green glow and this green glow needs a little bit of blue so I'm going to go ahead and boost that by 200 and check it out I get this nice looking green and blue glow pretty cool huh so here's what's happening it's taken the red value and multiplying it by this red value so we get the same since any number times 1 is itself it's taking the green and boosting it by 800 and taking the blue and boosting that by 200 so now since your boosted the green and blue we get a nice green and blue effect and we've done all that by taking pretty much to list of color multiply them together and getting the final list of color which we plugged into the emissive property so that's basically how we work with the emissive property to control the glow of our material so thank you guys for watching if you have any questions don't forget to sign up for my forum and I'll answer them for you then so thank you guys one last time and i'll see you guys in the next video
