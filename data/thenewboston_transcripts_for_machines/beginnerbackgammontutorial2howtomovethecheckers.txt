the number of spaces or points you can move is dictated by however whatever numbers on these dice so for example if you say you roll a one you can take hey now get over here you can take a checker and move it one space remember you always move in the same direction from high to low so if you roll let me roll something else a six you can take this Checker and move it 1 2 3 4 5 six space so again like I said um the number on the dice dictates how many spaces you can move so here is how we start the game as you can see since you're Brown you have two brown dice go ahead and put one in your Shaker since I'm white I have two white dice I'm going to go ahead and put one in my shaker now pretend that this is your hand and this is my hand both players are going to roll at the same time now since I have a two and you have a one I don't know if you can see that but I rolled a two and you rolled a one since I was higher that means I go first now if we tied and we both rolled let's see where's it two if we both rolled a two then what we would do is we just put them in the Shaker again and we would keep rolling until one of us got higher but since I got a two that time and you got a one if I can find it there we go here's what I'm going to do to start out I'm going to move one of my Checkers two spots and one of them one spot so let's go ahead and let me think of a good play I'm going to go ahead and move this one too one two and I'm going to go ahead and move this one one remember I'm going to be moving all my Checkers like this and you're going to be moving them all like this so now my turn is over I'm going to pick up my dice put it back in my dice cup now you pick up your dice and put it in your dice cup cup and since I'm done it's your turn so now put your dice in your dice cup and roll on the right side of the board now check this here's some little rules about rolling first of all your dice have to come from a dice Shaker you can't throw them from your hand or anything like that another thing is both dice have to come out if you roll and only one dice comes out of the Shaker it's invalid you have to roll the game and the last thing they have to be on the right hand side of your board they can't go off the board or anything like this and the last rule I want to tell you they can't be cocked on like any chip or they can't be cocked up against the side of the board or they can't land on any chips like that they both have to land on the felt if any of these rules are broken um you're going to have to roll again and again these are the strict backend rules it's like um you know not only commment courtesy but if you're playing in a tournament and you try to get away with a roll like this then they probably beat the crap out of you so anyways make sure you're using proper rolling techniques so let's go ahead and put your dice in your dice Shaker and let's see what you get you got a three and a two so here's what this means you can move one Checker three and one Checker two or you can combine one Checker and move a total of five spaces so let's go ahead and take a look at some options go ahead and move this Checker 1 2 3 and this one one two you could do that for example or what you could do is move this Checker five spaces so 1 2 3 and your two would be one two so check that out those are your different options so I'm going to go ahead and leave you with that second option right there moving one Checker five spaces now the only thing I want to point out before I let you guys go for this tutorial is one thing that you can't do one thing that you can't do is is you can't land on a space where I have two or more Checkers so for example you can't take this Checker right here and move one 2 3 1 2 my Checkers are already there so you can't land on my space so I set up kind of a block for you right here so if you you know if you were thinking about landing on a space like this or landing on a space like this it's invalid you can't do that so let's go ahead and play your 1 2 3 one two right now and now your turn is over so go ahead pick up your dice and put your dice in your roller right there and until you put your dice in your roller you can take back any move but as soon as you put your dice in your roller that's like saying that's my end of my turn I pass so now let's go ahead and we'll give me one more roll before I let you guys go so now again since you just went it's my turn I got a four and a three so here's what I'm going to going to do let's go ahead and move this one 1 2 3 4 just like that and I'm going to move this one one 2 3 just like that now I'm done with my turn go ahead grab my dice put it in my shaker and now it would be your turn so now we learn the basics of back am and how to set up the board what the bar the points the checkers mean all the terms and in the next tutorial what I'm going to be teaching you is about hitting which is pretty much means how to make your opponent really mad how to Bear off and basically how to win the game so there are a lot of other little rules and once I teach you guys all the basic rules then I can begin talking about strategy and some neat little tricks that you can do to give you the competitive Advantage so thank you guys for watching and uh I'll see you next tutorial
