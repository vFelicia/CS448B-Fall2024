hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on the game so let's go ahead and we'll close out of this right here and let's open up the form 1. VB designer so we will right click and click view designer so here's our form we've got our timer and our form right here so let's go ahead and we'll come down here and let's make it so that the person can see uh the health of the um current player and the enemy so we'll come over here to the toolbx We'll add a label and we will make another label so we have label one and label two so we'll set the text of this one to health and we'll set the text of this one to Health 2 so we'll come back over here and we need to change the names of these so that we can remember what they are so label popey health and then label enemy Health okay so now let's go ahead we'll come back here into 41. VB and so the form unloads what we want to do is generate an enemy so here here's our generate enemy sub um if you don't know what this is then you may want to move back and find where we did that so after they have created the enemy what we want to do is just go ahead and set the health label so we'll just type label enemy health. text equals health and then we will add um current enemy do health so what is is going to do is it's going to set the text to contain uh the current health of the enemy now if you notice we have done this several times whenever they attack it sets the um progress bar right here so let's just go ahead and we can create a sub that will do this 4S so we'll just type private sub update enemy Health go ahead and hit enter and we'll make another one for the hero so we'll just do update popey Health okay so whenever we update the enemy Health what we want to do is set progress BAR enemy. value equal to current enemy. health and then after that we want to set this right here so label enemy health. text is going to be equal to health and then the current enemy so to update the popy health we do pretty much the same thing but we're using different variables so progress bar poey do value is going to be equal to hero. health and then we'll set label popey health. text is going to be equal to health and then we'll add hero. health so now that we've created these two subs let's go ahead and uh use them in our enemy attacks and our other attack methods so for enemy attch uh we're just going to try and update popey health so if this returns an error it's going to um do everything in the catch block so progress of our pop. value is going to be equal to zero and then we'll set Health back to 100 and then we are going to put that back up to the top so we'll just go ahead and leave this the way it is and when we click attack um it's going to attack so let's just go ahead and try to update enemy health so it's going to update the enemy health and it's going to start the timer now we'll go ahead and run this and see if everything works the way that we intended so here's popey it's got health and you can see that we didn't initialize it uh when the program starts um but we can fix that easily so we can go ahead and attack and you can see the health goes down to 95 and then when a Popeye gets attacked back his health goes down to 90 so we can attack again it goes down 10 and this one goes down 10 this one goes down 20 and then this one goes down 10 this one went down um I don't remember what it was may have been 30 something and then this one went down I think eight so we can just keep doing that and the health is going to update um as we go along and you can see that the health here uh is set to zero so we'll come back in here and whenever an enemy is generated let's just go ahead and update enemy health and whenever the form one loads we want to update enemy health or that's going to be done through generate enemy so um when generate enemy is run it's automatically going to update the health inside of that and we also want to update the Popeye health so you can see that we got Health at 100 so we take away 15 and then we get attacked for five damage um take away 10 and then we get attacked for a whole bunch um think that we still have eat brains um to do 50 damage then we can continue to attack and you see you can see that uh popey loses and whenever we click okay on that button what we want to do is we want to update the health again so for enemy attack it's going to um say that popey is lost and then we'll just update popey health so let's go ahead and run that and let's try to get a zombie here so here's our zombie and you can see that Popeye has lost and when we click okay it says his health back to 100 then we can attack again um until the zombie is dead and you can see that we have a little problem if the health is equal to zero it technically isn't um out of bounds so we'll go ahead and look at how to fix that in the next tutorial so go ahead um create these two methods if you haven't already then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
