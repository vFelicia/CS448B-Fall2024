all righty guys welcome back to your seventh C++ tutorial and in this tutorial as promised I'm going to be going over basic C++ arithmetic now I don't know I think it was like tutorials go I gave you guys a variable and I showed you guys that instead of just setting it equal to a plain old value like this you can use basic arithmetic like 4 plus 6 and then when you go ahead and you print it out X or anything like that it actually calculated the value and printed out the answer so go ahead and run this and you see that X now equals 10 4 plus 6 so aside from addition I want to show you guys all the arithmetic operators that you can use and they're a little bit different than you might expect so let's start with the easy ones first the first one is subtraction and of course like 8 minus 4 this would be valid if we go ahead and build this we saw that the answer would be 4 so addition subtraction easy enough but also aside from addition subtraction you can use multiplication but make sure not to use X like that because that will mess up in order to multiply in computer programming use the asterisks and that's the symbol above the eight on your keyboard and what this is going to do is multiply these two numbers eight times four so now if you go ahead and run this we should get 32 and check it out 32 just like that so the well let's go ahead and before I go over this let's go ahead and go over division in order to use the vision in computer programming let's go ahead and take 81 divided by 3 division the symbol for this is the forward slash so let's go ahead and take 81 divided by 3 and we get 27 just like that simple enough but check this out what if we have something like 81 divided by 2 well this I mean it should be 40 but it has a remainder of 1 so let's go ahead and try to build and run this and see what we get well it just has 40 and that's not entirely right because it should have a remainder of 1 with it so we're saying all right we're working with integers right here and we any other data types so how can we get that remainder well whenever we want to use the remainder we need to use something called the modulus operator and that is the percent sign like this what this is going to do is it's going to give you the remainder of the answer it's not going to say 40 remainder one it's just going to give you that one so let's go ahead and build and run this and you can see that whenever we do 81 modulus 2 it's going to give us the remainder which is 1 so let me show you guys a better example on maybe 24 modulo 7 well we know that 21 or excuse me 24/7 is 3 with a reminder where the remainder of 3 so let's go ahead and build this in again it doesn't say 3 remainder 3 it just says the remainder which is 3 simple enough so now that we know all the arithmetic operators I can begin teaching guys about order of precedence now aside from just you know one number of rithmetic operator another number you can have complex calculations like 6 times 4 plus 8 times 4 plus 9 divided by 20 and if we go ahead and build and run this let's see what we get 56 birthday in our a so what order is just doing this in is it doing 6 times 4 and then plus 8 or is it doing you know 4 plus 8 and then times that by 6 because depending on how you do it it's going to come out with a different result so the basics is this if you remember way back in like seventh grade math you know something called your associative property and that's pretty much this anything that's in parentheses gets done first if you don't have any parentheses it goes like this it does all the multiplication in the vision which would be this this and this it's going to do that first and then it's going to do you're dissin addition and subtraction if you don't have if you know if you just have like four plus eight plus seven um you're saying all right then is it going to do a plus seven first or four plus eight first it really doesn't matter it comes out the same either way the only time you have varying answers is when you have like four plus three times seven for example if you did four plus three it would be 7 times 7 would be 49 but whenever we run this whoa easy box we get 25 why is that because it uses the associative property it actually multiplies first which is 7 times 3 and that's 21 plus 4 which is 25 so again if you want to explicitly say 4 plus 3 first you need to surround that in parentheses so now whenever we build and run this it's going to run your parentheses first and say our a 4 plus 3 equals 7 times 7 equals 49 so remember the rule is this parentheses first then your multiplication in the vision and then your addition and subtraction so remember that and if you get confused it's called the associative property you should have learned it in like eighth grade math or ninth grade math or maybe 7th grade I don't know I can't remember it was a long time ago for now that's all I want to talk to you guys about basic arithmetic and how it works in C++ so for now that's all you guys get so thank you guys for watching this tutorial if you have any questions go to my website the New Boston calm and click on forum and
