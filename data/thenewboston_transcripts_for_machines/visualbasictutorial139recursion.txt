hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about recursion now what recursion is is is it's basically a sub or a function calling itself over and over again so let's go ahead and make a little demo application for this we will create a new project select Windows forms application and we will call it recursion we'll wait for that to load okay so once it's open let's go ahead and make the form a little bit smaller and we will come into our tool box and we'll add a button and a text box okay so we'll set the text of button one to recursion and we'll set the name to button cursion okay so let's go ahead and we'll double click on that to open up our form one class and the event handler uh The Click event handler for button recursion let's go ahead and come below this and create a function so private function and we will just call it recursive function and for our arguments we will take an integer so argint as integer and we want to return a a double just in case we get a a decimal value so now let's go ahead and create an if statement so if argint is less than or equal to 10 then let's go ahead and return argint now else if our int is greater than 10 then let's go ahead and call this function again so we will turn recursive function and then AR int and this time let's divide it by two so that we get different values each time because if we just kept passing ARG into it it would keep calling itself over and over and over and it would never in so we're we're going to return that and divide it by two it's going to keep doing that until it is less than or equal to 10 and then it's going to return the original integer not the original one the one that was passed to the last uh occurr into the function so now let's go ahead and whenever they click on the button let's output uh what the function sent back so we'll just type messagebox doow and let's go ahead and show um recursive function and then we want to convert so convert. to in32 and we want to use what's in textbox one. text so this is all one statement right here we're calling recursive function and the argument that we're passing to it is the stuff in textbox one. text and it's converted to an integer so let's go ahead and add one more parenthesis to finish this off and let's go ahead and run this and see what we get let's see here okay so here's our form let's go ahead and type 10 in here and when we click recursion we get 10 back because if it's less than or equal to 10 it's just going to give us back the original integer so we'll do four and it gives us four now let's go ahead and do 20 now before I click recursion let's try and figure out what this is going to do so since it's greater than 10 it's going to call itself again and it's going to do 20 / 2 so we should get the value 10 now let's go ahead and do this with 30 so it's going to do 30 ID 2 which is 15 then it's going to call itself again and it's we're going to get um 7 and a half or eight it rounds it automatically rounds up to eight because we're using an integer in here let's go ahead and do this with the larger number let's do 246 and if we click recursion we get eight back because it keeps dividing by two until it is less than yeah until it is less than or equal to 10 so let's do 300 and you can see that we get 10 back so now I'll show you guys what will happen if you don't have a way for your uh recursive function or sub to exit so if we just keep doing this it's going to create an infinite Loop and it's never going to stop recalling itself so we'll just do 23 and you can see that the program freezes up because we've created an infinite Loop and we'll go ahead we'll go ahead and have to stop it right there so make sure that when you're using recursion you always want to have a way for your function or your sub to exit or else you'll make you'll create Loops that are infinite and it will crash your program so thanks for watching guys um practice a little bit with recursion and then once you got that down I know it's kind of a hard concept to grasp but once you've got that down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
