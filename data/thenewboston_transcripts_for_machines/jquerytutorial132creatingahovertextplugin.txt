I'm gonna go ahead and change this to mouse over just to see if that makes any difference oh yeah we have we've got that okay so let's try this yeah okay right okay so let me just explain how I fixed that and then I'll tell you how stupid I am so we've got focus in here we'll change this to mouse over which I guess is a better event handler for this here focus in would be for something like a text field or a text area you know sort of anything like that that we focus in either by clicking on or tabbing to mouse over is obviously we using our mouse and we're going over an element the other thing I didn't do is I set well we'll see with just changing mouse over we don't have any div displayed and this is because using var here this title variable is belongs to this function here and when we apply it in title in another function it's not globally available so by removing the var we just have this title equals something which means it's globally available to be used here so when we refresh is you know available and it's a happily working again so yeah that was a bit longwinded and we had a couple of problems with obviously dealing with the code and I moved things around and changed things around but you know it goes to show that you've probably got annoyed you know some of you might be shouting at the screen but eventually we fixed it and it's just goes to show that fiddling with things and and thinking logically which I'm obviously not you know just goes to help so essentially now that we've created our plugin that's it you know we've we've outlined our plugin and we've used this and etc etc etc we could go on to for example change some kind of setting I'm not going to go too much into defining session settings of you know normally but what happens if we want to create a say boolean parameter which you would fade in effect or not fade in so we could supply say true to fade in or folks not to fade in or just not supply it at all so inside of here what we want to do is we want to take a parameter and our function so we could say for example fade and what we could do is we could go ahead and instead of using show here we could get rid of that and we could create an if statement which would supply so for example if fade equals equals true then we would want to say hash hover text dot fade in and then we could fade it in say fast or something otherwise we could go ahead and say hash hover text dot so so now what's happening is we're allowing the user to sort of submit this parameter foot fade which he that can either true or false if it is equal to true then we fade in otherwise we could say if fade is equal to false then show or fade equals equals undefined so fade equals undefined would be to not supply it we could say false anyway and that would mean that we don't fade in so let's just try it out first of all with nothing in here its refresh and hover over and something's gone wrong once again let's just double check there fade is equal to true oh no sorry I've supplied this in the completely wrong place no I haven't so function fade fade it was it was true maybe we do need to supply in here so lots of things are going wrong no not at all let's just go back to plug in and let's double check this stopped fading don't show oh sorry else if okay right so you can really shout at the screen now okay so now we've just got our normal showing you know no animation going on if I was to change the to false we would also obviously get the same effect where nothing nothing fades in but if we change this to true the promise that we've taken which is fade is obviously set to true now so we fade in fast rather than just showing so when we refresh we actually just you can see if sort of fading in so it looks a bit nicer so that's an example of just basic parameter passing or argument passing inside of your plugin there are much more advanced technique so go ahead to the jQuery documentation and have a look at how you would pass you know more advanced option option variables to your plugin but for now that's just a simple plugin we've spent you know longer than we should have probably debugging it but then again that's just life it does actually happen so I hope you enjoyed creating this kind of plugin go ahead and feel free to start making your own plugins it's quite fun and I hope that that you know sort of helped you with the fact that I couldn't actually write the code out and I was you know messing around a bit but there we go that's that's it but yeah your first plugin or you know something that's a bit more advanced than you might usually create but nevertheless it works and it's
