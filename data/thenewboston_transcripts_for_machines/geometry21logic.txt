so today we're gonna start talking about logic and geometry is the most logical math it's very systematic and there's always a reason for everything you do so a huge part of geometry is these ifthen statements and they allow us to do a lot of our proving of things so a conditional is a statement is a statement that follows this pattern if P and P is just an action then Q and Q is just another action so for an example if it rains then soccer practice will get canceled where you have one statement P that implies another statement Q so the conditional that you're given is always true we're gonna talk about some other kinds of statements that are not always they're not necessarily always true okay and one of those is called the converse where you take the two statements and you flip them so if Q then P so if soccer practice is canceled then it rained where you're saying that instead of P implying Q you have a Q implies P so if you look at this one if soccer practice is canceled then it rained that's assuming that the only time soccer practice is canceled is when it rains if there's not school like if there's a snow day or something soccer practice is going to be cancelled too that's why this statement isn't always true for certain statement for certain ifthen statements it could be true but we can't say with certainty that it is true so now we're going to talk about another statement called the inverse where you take the opposite of the first action and then and say that if not P then not Q and this little symbol right here means you negate it which is which just means when you put not in front of P you're negating the action so if it is not raining then soccer soccer practice is not canceled so not P implies not Q but this you have to be careful with because like the converse the inverse is not always true because think about it if it is not raining then soccer practice is not canceled well didn't we just say that there could be other reasons soccer practices cancelled it doesn't always have to be when it's raining it just says that if it does rain soccer practice is canceled so we can't just simply switch we can't negate each one and say it's true so a last one and this is the only statement other than the conditional you're given that is always true so if not Q then not P so the contrapositive is really just taking the converse and taking the inverse and doing it at the same time because we're going to switch the order of the two actions and we're going to negate them with the not statements so if soccer practice I should say practice if soccer practice is not canceled that it is not raining where we have not q that implies not P so think about if we were gonna state this a different way we it would just it would just say that if soccer practice is if they are having soccer practice then it's not raining which makes sense because our original conditional said that if it rains they will not have a soccer practice so this is the only statement where it's true so it's really important to remember this one because this there's contrapositive of some of our theorems that we have learned it's gonna help us solve some proofs later on so that's all we're gonna do with logic but as promised our next lesson is gonna deal with more proofs so make sure to come back and watch that
