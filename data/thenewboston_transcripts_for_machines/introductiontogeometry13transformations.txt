so our lesson is about transformations and when we take an object or like like a triangular square and we move it some way we want to be able to describe how we moved it so there's three basic movements of transformations so first is the translation and it's more commonly known as the slide where we just take this is triangle a and this is still triangle a it's the same triangle we just took it and moved it over and up so if we were to describe this transformation we said we translated it Layton triangle a over right and up so the second kind of transformation is called a rotation where we have this arrow and we just rotated it 1/4 of the way to the right or 1/4 clockwise so we there's if it if we had done it a full rotation it would have been down here we could have translated it or excuse me we could have rotated it 3/4 of the way and it'd be here or we could have done a complete rotation and it'd be right back here so the last kind of transformation is called a reflection where we reflected this shape over this line right here this is just gonna be called our reflection line and we reflected it over here to the right just like a mirror when you look into a mirror it reflects your image back on you that's why wouldn't you move one way it looks like you're moving the other way in a mirror so let's do some practice with these transformations and we're just gonna describe them so I had the letter F right here and now I have it like this so if we were to describe that we would say that it is a reflection because it was literally flipped over to look like that I was talking about this one well I have this letter and now it looks like this well it's not a translation because if it was just a translation it would look like that it's not a reflection because a reflection would look like that so it has to be a rotation and it was rotated once twice so we can say that this is a half clockwise rotation it was because it was rotated twice until it got upsidedown this next one we have this one and this one was our original one and this is our new one so this was just translated so we have this and this is we're just going to call this point a so point a is here on this hexagon as well so because a is in the same place on both of them we know that it was moved right and then down so translated right and down so those are the basic transformations and they're gonna help us out later when we look at triangles and try to compare them to one another so make sure you come back for our next video where we talk about the parts of congruent triangles and proving them to be congruent
