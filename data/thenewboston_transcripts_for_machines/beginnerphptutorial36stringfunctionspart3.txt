the semicolon on the end of my line there okay so you can see that oh sorry string rev okay let's go refresh Oh No okay again yep sorry I've added that so it's STR Revu can probably tell I didn't use this function too often but just for demonstration purposes you consider what it's done now is reverse the string now I've just actually while I've been doing this tutorial thought of a good way that this might be used and probably not recommended to but let's say we uploaded a file say called image jpg we could echo string reversed and we could do the substring of this and we could get the first say three three letters which would return our file type however if you think about it this actually will work because it could be jpg or jpg so that's the string reverse function just thought I'd drop it into this video anyway if you can find a use out of it that's great and the only use I can think of it is for novel to use but there we are so the next function we're going to look at is slightly more useful it is comparing two strings for similarity let's go ahead and get rid of everything here we can start from scratch okay so we use this function slightly differently let's go ahead and create two strings and we're going to calculate the percentage and similarity between two strings now you can use this in a variety of functions for example two peoples well I can give you an example plagiarism for example if you are checking for plagiarism between two different say essays written you could use this similar text function and it would return the percentage and similarity between each essay for example but obviously in this example we're just going to be dealing with simple strings so I'm going to say string 1 is equal to this is my essay I am going to be talking about PHP for example let's go ahead and escape that character there string two might equal this is my essay let's say someone was to slightly change an essay I will be talking about the subject PHP now what we can actually do here is we can now use the string function to compare the percentage and similarity between these two strings so let's go ahead and say similar underscore text it's not required to put into a variable because we're going to be returning the result within the within the function in one of the arguments and then echoing that back out so the three arguments we need to pass are string one string two and then we need a result variable here so we've got this result here which we can then go and echo out so we could say the similarity between between is and then we can append on result that's right there so the similar but similarity between is let's go ahead and refresh you can see it's 78% so for example if you if this was a if this was a long essay and the similarity was 78% there's obviously something you know wrong here for example if we convert to completely change this string my essay is about PHP and I'm going to be talking about everything to do with PHP let's just go ahead and escape that let's go ahead and refresh and you can see that the percentage has dropped significantly however if this was a longer string there will be more to compare if they were very different you'd get something completely different so for example my essay is about cats I'll escape that be talking about cats and their colors that'd be nice okay so we're let's go ahead and refresh and you can see that the similarity drop still so that's how you use this function and giving you an example of why it might be useful okay so let's go ahead and talk about some more simpler functions let's go create our string here that's going to be equal to this is an example string okay so the first one we're going to be talking about is the string length so string length is equal to and this function is called STR then with no underscore and then you just feed in the string d1 this is a really really useful really really useful function because for example if you were validating a form and you wanted to check that the length wasn't any bigger than a specific amount you could then just use this inside an if statement to check the string length for example if the name you know the name of the user or the user name wasn't meant to be any more than 25 characters you could say something like if string length is smaller than 25 then we can you know say yep that's absolute you find otherwise we could produce an error just for an example let's go ahead and aircraft the string length just to give you an idea of what this returns so return an integer value this counts the characters so we've got 26 that seems about right that's including the fullstop as well so it's any text inside of here
