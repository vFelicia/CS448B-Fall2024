okay so today we're talking about how to solve the sides of a triangle or the angle of a triangle using What's called the law of cosiness so in any triangle a BC a s which is the length of this side equals b^2 + c^ 2 2 b c cosine of a and remember cosine is is a trig function so we're going to have to use our graphing calculator that has a cosine function on it it looks like it just it looks like this and you're going to put an answer in here and you're going to close the parentheses when we're solving for that b^2 = a 2 + c^2 2 a c cosine of B c^2 = a 2 + b^ 2 2 a cosine of C so B basically the length of a side is equal to the sum of that side is equal to the sum of the other two sides minus 2 side one * side 2 cosine of the angle across from that side I know it's kind of confusing but it's really actually pretty easy so we're going to do some examples now okay so we're trying to find out what x equals so X2 is going to equal a 2+ b 2 2 a * B cosine of the angle opposite the one we're talk opposite the side we're talking about so cosine of 75 X2 is equal to and this is where we're going to have to start using the calculator so 15^ SAR is 225 + 11^ 2ar is 121 2 15 * 11 is 165 and we're not going to plug in cosine yet okay so 25 225 + 121 is 346 minus 2 * 165 330 cine of 75 okay so this is where we have to plug stuff into the calculator so this is how it's going to look when you plug it into the calculator you're going to plug 346 minus 330 cine of 75 just like this except there'll be a parentheses here and you want to close that parentheses too so let's go ahead and type that into the calculator 346 330 cine of 75 close the parentheses and rounding to the um second decimal place we're going to get x^2 is = to 26059 so now we want the length of X so we're going to take the square root of it and in your calculator if you hit second Square the squared button you'll get the square root and then if you hit second answer it'll plug that answer that you just got right back into it so it's more exact so then you you want to round at the very end so you get about 16.1 14279 we're going to round that to 16.1 43 it's always good to round to the third decimal place okay we're going to do one more example except this time we're going to find what that angle is so we're going to have to use some stuff called Arc cosine and Arc cosine is just like the opposite of doing cosine I'll show you what I mean in a minute so we're trying to solve for x so we have to take the side opposite x 11^ 2 = the two sides squared 2 side * side cosine of x so we're going to get 121 = 5 2 is 25 + 5 2 is 25 50 2 * 5 is 10 * 5 is 50 cine of x^ SAR or no that should just be cosine of x so now what we're going to do is we're trying to solve for this so we're going to subtract 50 over and you'll get 71 is equal to 50 cosine of x we're going to divide the 50 over and we're just going to leave it as a fraction for now equals cosine of x okay so when we don't know the value of an angle we're going to use the inverse we're going to use an inverse function so in order to find out what x equals we say x is equal to cosine in inverse of 71 over 50 so basically it's saying that this angle it this side of the equation is basically just saying whose angle has a cosign of 51 over50 so when we do this we're solving for the angle so when you type it into your calculator you're going to hit second cosine and it when it when you you do that this will pop up this is what it should looks like look like and then you're going to plug in 71 / 50 close the parentheses and and if you type that into a calculator you'll get about 63Â° so that's all we're doing with law of cosiness make sure you come back and watch the next video where we're going to talk about of signs which is another way to solve problems about triangles
