welcome back eyes through 34th C++ tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to teach you guys how to use an array in calculations and it's actually a pretty simple program definitely useful definitely something you want to stay tuned for so let's go ahead and make an array right now let's call it tuna I'm getting tired of using Bucky every time and let's set the tuna array big enough to hold five integer values looks good enough and now let's go ahead and use an array initializer list um let's go ahead and throw in 2050 476 832 and whatever this number is right there so now we created an array called tuna and it has five different elements or five different values in it so now what we want to do is say our boss came to us are a teacher and he's like build a program that calculates the sum of all of these elements so we're saying all right the first thing we need is a variable to hold that sum and by default since it doesn't have any elements at first we're going to set it equal to zero so what we could do is this sum equals looks I try to type Bucky again tuna zero plus tuna oh you know what I'm getting a bunch of typos and this is just taken too long not very efficient way of doing it although it would work so let me go ahead and show you guys a much easier way to use an array in calculation so instead of all that typing let's go ahead and make a for loop instead so now what we need to do is just like before find out which array index is our array is going to need and just use our for loop to loop through those array indexes so of course as always we need to start at zero because the first index in every array is zero alright now let's do a little bit of thinking but not too much tuna holds five values so that means the last index in that array is four so if you're right X is less than 5 what it's going to do is going to go from zero to four it's not going to do five because five is not less than five so now when you press X plus plus we now have a four loop that loops from zero to four so it's going to go zero one two three four those are going to be your X values so what we can do now is just use some plus equals tuna X now what this is going to do is this the first thing it's going to do the very first time it runs the loop is going to say this all right X is equal to zero so add tuna zero which is 22 the sum now the sum is going to be equal to 20 the next time it's going to be one so add tuna one which is 50 for equal to the sum which is 20 so now it's going to be 74 so it's going to go through each of these elements one by one and add each value to the value of sum so let's go ahead and just print out this on the screen um see out some end line and now you can see a better idea of what's going on so like I said one by one the very first time it runs it's going to add tuna zero equal to sum the next time tuna one equal to some tuna two three four so if you add up all these values right here you get the value of 1528 so one last time what we did is this we created an array called tuna using an array initializer list that holds five integers 1 2 3 4 5 now what we wanted to do is we wanted to calculate the sum so we made a variable called sum and of course by default since it didn't have any value we set equal to 0 then we made a for loop using the value in here excuse me the variable to loop through each index of our array so it started at 0 and since we know this one was two and a four that's what we put for here X is less than five and of course we want to go one at a time we don't want to skip you know this one in this one or anything so then what we did is we loop through each value and added it to the variable sum and then we just printed out some on the screen and that's what we got 20 74 115 9 82 15 28 so that's a real simple program in order to use arrays and the array indexes and elements and values and calculations yadda yadda yadda all that fun stuff so now you guys know how to use arrays in calculations you're ready to move on to my next tutorial we're going to be talking I'm going to teach you guys something else about an array that's actually pretty cool so don't forget to watch that tutorial thank you guys for watching and don't forget to subscribe
