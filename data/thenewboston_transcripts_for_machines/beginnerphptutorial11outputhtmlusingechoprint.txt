hello this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and in this PHP tutorial for the new Boston I am going to be showing you how to echo HTML out to a page so we already know how to echo data it's just basically echoing out whatever string data we want and this will produce the result here now what happens if we want to echo out some HTML data let's say I want to echo out an input text for a form so normally this would be done outside our PHP tags and we have input type equals and we'd have two double quotes and this will be text because I've name equals let's just say name and value equals at the moment we can just say Alex although this can be used as specified so we don't really need this now as this stands this is going to produce this result we've got just a simple text area here we can type text in here simple now what happens if I want to somewhere in a PHP program when we develop into more advanced PHP programs or code rather I want to echo this out inside here now you saw in my previous examples that I could use double quotation marks and this produces a result similar to this okay so it works now let's just say I want to put this straight into here now you think well it's just going to echo echo the text out that's absolutely fine it's going to process this as HTML as we've already seen now let's refresh you can see that we've received this past error and it's saying expecting a comma or a semicolon on line two so if we go over to line two we can see it is indeed this line here and we it doesn't tell us where we're expecting a semicolon necessarily within but we are in fact expecting it here and the reason we're expecting it in this position is because this has told us that we're ending our echo output and the reason for this is because we've started with double quotation marks this appears to be ending with double quotation marks now there are a few resolutions in order to to correct this we can in fact use single quotes inside a double quoted echo output so we're using double quotes on the outside here and then what we can do is we can use single quotes on the inside which will still correctly be processed by HTML so if we refresh that we get exactly the same result as we did beforehand now this in fact is by standards incorrect we want to use double quotation marks wherever possible so how can we resolve this if we need to use double quotation marks inside now there are one of two ways the first way to do this is to change the double quotation marks on the outside of your string to single quotation marks and you can see that if i refresh we don't produce any error so this has worked also using double single quotation marks is a lot quicker so we're processing this whole line a lot quicker than we would be if we were using double quotation marks and the reason for this is using double quotation marks it's looking for variables inside and generally it is just a tiny bit slower and so if you can imagine you've got a long program that you're racking out a lot of data try a new single quotation marks and you're going to speed up your script more than significantly so there is another option if you must use double quotation marks on the outside for any reason and we can use a specific character to escape another character and in PHP this is a backslash so if I was to create a backslash here and a backslash here a backslash here and a backslash here you can already see that there's a pattern emerging we're escaping this character this character this character and this character so any character after this is going to escape it and what I mean by this is it's going to it's going to tell PHP that we want to process this not as anything within PHP but we want to process this as something in an output so let's refresh the page and see what happens you can see this worked so we can even just to test that it's definitely working add in a value to this form field of Alex inside this box so we refresh and we see that that's updated absolutely fine so that's just a short and sharp way of learning how to echo HTML inside obviously when you get to more complex programs and you're using lots of double quotation marks and you're echoing out maybe a bit more HTML data which isn't recommended anyway but if you must then it's probably better to just use your single quotation marks in the outside and then there's no need for these escaping characters to appear within okay so that's basically it on echoing HTML inside PHP
