I'm Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial on PHP variables for the new Boston now if you've programmed in any other programming languages you'll know what variables are and you'll understand what they do that you have to assign values to variables and there's different types of variables now in this video I'm going to be showing you how to create variables by assigning value values to our standard structure that we use for variables and then how to echo them out to the browser so usually in programming languages such as JavaScript anything like that you'd have to use a keyword such as var then what you do is you type the name of the variable and then you'd assign a value to it so in this case it would be var name equals Alex and this would be surrounded to show that it's string data now same as if you would say save our age equals 21 that would be exactly the same example however in PHP we don't really need to use any keywords to define anything all we really need to do is use dollar sign notation or variable start with the dollar sign they can either start with an underscore or a character an alphanumeric character circum it can be upper case it can be lower case or in fact it can be it can start with a number that can't consists of just a number so if we were to say create a variable here called text and we could make that equal to hello world so the notation that we've used is we've used the dollar sign to start our variable notice we haven't specified what type of variable it is it's not a string usually we might have to use a string keyword we've just used dollar sign text equal so we're signing a value to this variable here and the value that we've assigned to some string data a nice hello world inside there now we could say and a sign we want to create a variable with a number so we could type number equals and without using quotation marks because if we were to put say a number in here this is now classed as string data so if we take it out you can see that my text editors turned it red and we're just dealing with a numeric value an integer value and as well as integers you can also use a floating value so you can use decimal points within so we could have a hundred point five for example but for now I'm just going to work with integers we also have things like boolean values which is equal to true false and it is equal to this a boolean for true would be the same as one it just means that something's true so we can use that later on when we work with if statements and things like that so we've got our variables but how we're going to output them now there's one easy way to output variables and that's just to put an echo straight in the middle so what or at the start sorry so what we're doing and just add a false up in here what we're doing is we're echoing out essentially the assignment of the very the text to the variable and here we're coming out the assignment of this integer to this variable but this will work so if we have a look and refresh you can see that we've got hello world and then the number 100 printed now this is a not a great way to do things because what we want to do is we want to declare the variables up here and what with our assignment and then here we want to display them to the user so for example I could say echo text and we can refresh our page and you can see that that's just echoed out our single variable text so we're just echoing text don't forget your line terminator as well we can echo number so if we refresh we've got 100 there so we've just basically echoed out a number now as you're programming and you find different uses for storing different things for example you might want to take the users age or take the users name you'll find that you will be storing things or you'll be storing string data and you'll be storing numerical data as well so integers floats things like that so in actual fact it's so easy in PHP because you don't need to think about what data you're storing you just need to use the notation with the dollar sign the variable name following the rules and then just the value to the variable so you can see that PHP variables are in fact really easy
