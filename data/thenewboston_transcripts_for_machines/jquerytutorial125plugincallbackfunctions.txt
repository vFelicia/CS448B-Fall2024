hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked with a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video we're gonna be taking a look at creating a jQuery plugin but this time we're going to be allowing a callback function for our plugin so what do I mean first of all by a callback function now let's take a look at how this works is a simple countdown where we can specify a single integer and we count down from that integer to zero when we reach zero we then give our you know indication that the function or the plugin has completed and then we can run the callback function and in this case the callback function is going to be an alert box so when i refresh the page you can see that we start counting down from five when we reach zero or when we reach you know one still displayed but I you know haven't gone into technicality with the plugin we show this done input field so essentially what we're doing here is I'm applying this to a difficult countdown we have the div here and I'm using my countdown plugin which I've created inside plugin is I've got an option that I can specify from and I'm saying from five so we can go ahead and change this to ten if we like and it'll go ahead and count down from ten at ten nine eight blah blah blah and then this is the callback function here so when it's done ie when it reaches zero we use that weand so send this callback function or allow this callback function to be executed and that just alert it's done so this could be anything it could be something like window dot location sorry equals HTTP Google Doc credit UK for example so we could count down from say three you know there's there's many useful ways that you could go ahead and use this application and you see we're now at Google so there's you know there's there's a variety of you know ways that you could actually take use of callback functions particularly when you are creating your own functions let's just go back and okay so we need to figure out what we're doing now if you haven't already looked at creating parameters or sending settings to plugins I recommend you look at that first because I'm not going to be going over it too much in the tutorial but the main thing we're focusing on is this second option about our plugin declaration and that is our callback function so we're going to be creating this countdown timer so if you wanted to follow along and create that as well we're going to be creating it as a plugin obviously and then sending this callback when we're done or when the counter reaches zero so without further ado let's go ahead and take a look at the code okay so on the index page here we're going to need to create an area on our page for the countdown to be placed so the numbers that are decrementing and eventually reaching zero are placed so I'm just going to go ahead and create a div and this is going to be called countdown now inside ext ojs we can use our countdown to apply our plugin and I'll plug in wherever it's called on which selector that it's called will place the countdown so this could be absolutely anything it could be a paragraph as long as it as long as you select using the plugin it will always place the that the numbers that are you know decrementing in that area so inside ext look Jess let's go ahead and outline how we might want to use our plugin before we go ahead and create it inside plugin j/s so the first thing I want to do is say document dot ready and inside here we run a function so this is just standard you know sort of notation for when we start a jQuery application or jQuery code now inside here I'm going to go ahead and select what was it called countdown so we want to select countdown and we want to apply it the countdown plugin to this now at the moment I'm not going to go ahead and specify any options we'll do that as we go along and as we create our plugin but essentially now we are creating the countdown plugin to this countdown selector so the numbers will be in here like 10987 blah blah blah as I as I've shown you before we need to specify two things in here the first one is the options that we want to send to the plugin the second is the callback function so we'll do that in a minute but now let's go ahead and start to actually create our plugin so if you've already dealt with creating plugins we use function and sorry that needs to be in brackets so we use function and then we use a dollar sign in here don't worry if you're a bit confused with this it you know it doesn't sort of really make sense but this is the way we make plugins and then we come down with this sort of block here if that makes sense now after this we want to go ahead and write jQuery and then a line terminator and this here is the standard notation of creating or outlining a plugin we then need to go ahead and name our plugin so we use dollar sign in place of jQuery remember we would usually use jQuery but now we can use dollar sign dot F and which stands for function name or function and then we call our function you know whatever we want to call it as long as it doesn't conflict conflict with an existing plugin or another functionality or another you know jQuery functionality now now that we've said dollar dollar function count down this is equal to a function and inside of here we'll go our code so here it goes our code now inside of here what we want to do is we want to go ahead and actually create the countdown itself with an interval we're going to be setting an interval but inside this function here we first of all want to specify which options and also callback so options we're going to sort of condense down into a list of settings and at the moment we've only got one and that was from and a particular number and then we have our callback function at the end so let's deal with this from 10 at the moment so specified the setting as as I call my plugin now I need to go ahead and work out how to handle it so the first thing I need is a variable called settings and this is array of data and that array of data takes the argument or parameter name and then a default value so I'm going to set the default value to 60 what I then want to do is check if a user has provided these options now this settings hit not to be confused with the option set but what we want to do is we want to go combine them if options have been provided ie if the user has typed in here so I'm gonna say if options and the block that we want to run if options are available is we want to extend settings
