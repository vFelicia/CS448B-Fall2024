hello this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a PHP video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video tutorial I'm going to be talking about code indentation what code in tentation is and why it should be used now for an example let's take a look at the following file I've got index 2 PHP now this file works it works perfectly in fact apart from one thing I've just spotted and named it was STR to lower this needs to change SCR to lower ok so I always forget something ok so the file that we're looking at now works perfectly let's go ahead and open our browser and test it okay so let's open up ok so it says you're over 21 yes 1e is equal to 1 so let's go back to our code and see why so if the name the string name to lower blow of it doesn't really matter what the code looks like as equal to Alex then do this echo this part of the code otherwise say you're not Alex so if we change this name here to say Dale and we refresh it says you're not Alex so the code works that's essentially we need to move for now now the problem with this is the way that we have not indented it so there's no code indentation therefore it's hard to see where an if start if statement starts and where an if statement ends so if we needed to make modifications to a program it's going to be a lot harder if we don't use code indentation now there's 14 lines to this program can you just or this code this page or script if you like imagine if we had 1400 lines and we didn't use indentation you can imagine how often it's going to look how messy is going to look so let's go ahead and look at index.php which is a duplicate of this however I've created line indentation for each where it's necessary okay so what I've done is after the first if statement I've indented to make a new if statement so if and then inside here we've indented and now inside this if statement I've indented all the code here okay so the estate and everything by default starts on without being indented we've made the first if statement so the block I can already tell it's just from the start of this I here down to here so this is the start of the block and this is the end of the block here and this is the start of the top block and this is the end then we say else so inside of this block here where we're saying is age greater than or equal to 21 this is inside and we can also politically tell that because we've got straight down here straight down here and straight down here and then we've indented just the echo inside of here so you can sit so you can see how code indentation makes a whole lot of difference when you're trying to view a file so for example if I want to say if age does not is you know saying if age is greater than or equal to 21 I won't say well maybe I want to create an ifelse statement rather than just an if statement let's go down and we can also likely see that's the end of the block and we can start typing on here my text editor automatically indents for you I think notepad plus plus is a lot better at this than context as well as a variety of that of other editors but now we can just type in something here not over 21 for example and when we change this to say 16 we know that our program is going to work because we've already seen the indentation and we've created the code we've created the program to to work according to these and the indentation makes everything a lot easier to see so always use indentation in your code it's part of the coding standards which is very important when you're looking at code especially when you're going to be distributing code or you need other people to read code you may understand how your code works and it may work in fact so you might think why do I need to indent and everything like that well the answer is is that if other people do need to see your code or if you need to make quick modifications to your code it's going to be a lot easier to see if you've used indentation
