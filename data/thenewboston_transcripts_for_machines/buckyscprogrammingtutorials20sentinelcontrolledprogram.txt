what's going on guys welcome to your 20th tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys how to build a sentinel controlled program now let me explain to you guys what that is you remember in the last tutorial where we built that program and we ran a loop five times and each time we allowed the user to enter a number well sometimes we're going to want to build programs where we don't know how many times the user wants to enter a number so if you like were calculating the average uh grades for kids in your class you know how many kids are in your class if you are calculating the average age of like people in your family you know how many people in your family but if we built a program and we just sold it to everyone in the world everyone's family has a different size every teacher's class size is different so we don't know exactly how long to make that Loop last so what we do instead is we give it a special code and this code is usually something like negative one and we use this because ages and weights and you know number things cannot be negative one so whenever we enter negative one this is when our program knows to stop and you know make its calculations or do whatever it does so let's go ahead and I'm going to be building a program that we enter the ages of a bunch of people how many we don't know yet but we're going to enter the ages of a bunch of people what our program is going to do is figure out how many people we entered and calculate the average age of all those people people so let's go ahead and it's pretty much an age averager if I was to make this program I would name it age averager 5.0 why 5.0 I don't know I just like five so let's go ahead and we're going to need some variables the first variable we need is someplace for the user to enter and store that age each age at a time so they're going to enter someone's age like 32 we're going to store it in the variable age after this we need some way to keep track of all those ages a total so if they enter 32 then 32 we want this to store the total which would be 64 because we're going to be averaging it later on so int just name it like age total and this of course is equal to zero first but it's going to be the total of everyone's age combined and the third thing we're need to keep track of is how many people did they enter so you take the total over how many people they entered and this give us the average age so in number of people entered and I don't really like making variables that long because it's easy to make a typo the longer your variable is but it's descripted for this tutorial so the first thing we want to do is just write a parm on the screen see out um enter first person's age or12 quit so what we're going to be doing is our code is negative one whenever we get the input negative one from the user we know we know that they want to quit the program so let's go ahead and then give them something to enter age so they're going to enter a number and it's going to be stored in the variable age so now we just need to test make sure it's not equal to negative run and we need to Loop this program as many times as possible as long as the value is not equal to Nega 1 so as long as a AG is not equal to 1 go ahead and run this program and at the heart of this program is this what we're going to be doing is we're going to be taking the H total and it's going to be a running total of the old H total plus the new value that they entered for AG so the first time say they enter six it's going to be 0 + 6 the next time they enter 10 it's going to be 6 + 10 so the total would be 16 so then when we divide it by the number of people which would be two their average age is is eight so let's go ahead and now each time this Loop runs it means that they entered a new person so let's go ahead and just write number of people entered Plus+ because remember Plus+ is the same as adding one to it each time so now we said all right our age total is good and the number of people entered is good so now every time we run this Loop we want to give them another opportunity to hit negative one or enter someone's age so make another C out and just write something like enter next person's age or negative one to quit so right now they're going to enter negative one or someone's age and let's just go ahead and end that line so now semicolon there we go so now we're going to store that value in h so they're going to keep running this and every time it runs they're going to have a chance to inut input an a what this Loop is going to do is check and it's going to run the loop over and over and over and over again until the user enters negative 1 once they enter negative one it's going to say all right that's my sign to bail out of this Loop and go ahead and make my calculations so for the calculations let's first go ahead and make sure our program is going to work properly by saying let's first tell number of people entered and I know I spelled that wrong big deal who cares and now we just output number of people entered looks good end line and after this what we want to do is we want to find the average age of all those people so see out average age and then we just go ahead and the formula for average age is age total over number number of people people entered for example if your age total is 100 and you entered 10 people then the average age would be 10 so let's go ahead and run this program first to see if it works see if I forgot any semicolon or anything all right so the program is up and running it looks good so what I like to do whenever I build programs like this is I like to enter values that I already can calculate in my head just to make sure that computer is calculating so let's go ahead and enter a person with the age of 10 the person with the age of 20 and a person with the age of 30 now I know that whenever I average these together 10 20 and 30 well that's 60 so 60 divid 3 is 20 so I'm going to be expecting 20 and that that way I know that my uh uh program is working correctly so let's go ahead and quit by hitting negative1 and go ahead and hit enter and it says number of people entered three which is correct 10 20 and 30 average age of them is 20 because 60 divid by 3 is 20 so that is pretty cool in our program works fine number of people entered it got that right and it calculated their average age rate so that's what I like to do before I enter big numbers like 87 uh 685 and all those like five is a real big number so anyways how our program worked is this what we did is we built three variables well let me just go ahead and skip to the good stuff it says all right enter the first person's age and we went ahead and we entered 10 right here so it says all right is 10 equal toga1 nope so let's go ahead and run this right here I'm going to go ahead and store 10 in age total and change the number of people entered to one and now go ahead and give me another age well we went ahead and we entered 20 so now 20 + 10 our age total was now 30 and our number of people entered was two so it said all right give it to me again we enter 30 so now our age total was 30 + 30 which is 60 and number of people entered was three so then it said all right now give me another H or negative one to quit we gave it negative one to quit so it bailed out of the Sloop and it went ahead and just make the calculations for this calculation it just printed out the number of people entered which is three and for this one it said the age total which was 60 divided by the number of people entered which was of course three 60 over 3 is of course 20 so again that is called a sentinel control Loop because we can run this program and it doesn't matter how many numbers we enter you know we're not limited to five or 10 or anything as soon as we hit negative one it calculates how many people we entered and their average age so again this is much more Dynamic program in the sense that you're not only limited a certain number but you you can disperse this you know maybe a bunch of different types of people and it doesn't matter their sample size any size any amount of people in this program is still going to continue to work fine so that is the beauty of a sentinel controlled program these are the loops that you're going to be using more often rather than you know a fixed number so get used to it become familiar with it and once you are you're good to go so for now that's all I have for you guys in the next tutorial don't know what I'm going to be covering but my my throat was dry now so I need to go get a drink of water and you need to watch more of my videos or something I don't know so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you next time
