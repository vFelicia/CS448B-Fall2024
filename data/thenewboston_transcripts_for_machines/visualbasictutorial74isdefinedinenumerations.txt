hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be taking another look at enumerations so let's go ahead and open up the projects from last time it is the one the sports analyzer that has the two list boxes and analyzed sport so what we're gonna learn in this tutorial is how to check and see if a certain value is defined in an enumeration so the way we do this is let's come out here to button analyse click we're going to add some code here so we're gonna declare a boolean value up here so we'll just type dim is define bool as boolean and we'll go ahead and set that equal to false and now what we're gonna do is let's say below this one we're going to we're going to show a message box and see if a certain enumeration value is defined so the way we do this is we're going to type well instead of assigning it down there let's go ahead and sign assign it up here so it's divine bool as boolean and we'll set that equal to system the system namespace dot enum the enumeration class dot is defined now is defined will take two arguments so the first one is the enumeration and the in the enumeration type so what we're going to do is we're going to type get type so it returns the system type object from the specified type name so we're just going to get the type of sports and now what we're gonna do is we are gonna put a value in so check to see if this value is defined so we'll just type in baseball and so this should give us a value of true so I'll just type message box dot show is defined bool dot to string okay so now if we go ahead and run this here is our program let's go ahead and pick a sport here we'll pick basketball click analyze sport and it says true let's see all the way hello let's pick baseball and it's true yeah so I'm sorry about that yeah it'll say true no matter which one you select because it's not checking what we've selected there so basically what it does is the system is I saw in them that is defined so it's the the function is defined or the method we pass the type of the sports enumeration into it by using get type and then we check to see if baseball is defined now if we do something like I let's do soccer so if we check to see if soccer is defined we can go ahead and pick anything in here it'll still give us the same answer each time click analyze sport and it gives us a value of false because soccer is not part of our an enumeration so um this is very simple you may not find a need for it at the moment but you probably will later on so it's a good thing to know and every time you learned something even if you not gonna use it right away it's always good to know it in case you need it so thanks for watching guys and stay tuned for the next tutorial
