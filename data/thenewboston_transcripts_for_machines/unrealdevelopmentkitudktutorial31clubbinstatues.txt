alright guys welcome to your 31st tutorial in the UDK and in this story I'm probably going to be goofing around some more with static meshes I'm actually probably going to be finishing my castle say that three times fast finishing Castle finishing Castle to Castle got it and yeah that's basically it so the first thing I want to tell you guys is I added this little column right here so now I think it's time to add some flavor as I would say to the front walls here so let's go ahead and open up our content browser and let's go ahead and search for those arches I saw some arches earlier that I kind of liked and there are these ones right here these arch walls my fate these ones oh I like them both so much 1 0 I get 0 on do I get we'll just stick with this one for now so go ahead grab that drag it out and the very first thing we're going to notice is that if we scroll out of here we probably want to push it back a little bit and we still can't see and that's because we need to rotate it let's go ahead and rotate this 180 and check it out my Lions face is now facing the front but as you can see now I could leave it like that and make it kind of like a window looking thing but I really don't want to do that I want to grow it by a little bit so let me grow it by like two let's see how that looks to play and let's go ahead and push that back for some perspective hey where my other views go out there you're all rascal alright so let's go ahead and grab this and we'll go ahead and I don't know if I want to set it right on the ground yet yeah I think I do let's go ahead and pop that right on the ground and actually can do that in this view right here and now in my front view which is actually my side view go ahead and put that like right there looks pretty good guys think that looks good actually want to pull that out just a tid bit just like that so that looks pretty good and actually I changed my mind actually want to drag that up again I probably should have planned on these tutorials probably should have done a lot of things probably went to college probably showed up you know what nevermind so anyways let's go ahead and just all this and I think this is looking pretty good to be honest and make sure we're not looking at any of our orthographic views because we want those to be nice and uneven this is looking pretty epic to be honest pretty darn good so now with that being done let's say that uh I'm just going to make a game called find the statue and this is level 1 so the goal of this game is our players going to start right here and his goal is to find a statue so in this a level we're going to go ahead and put the statue right here so let's go ahead and I'm actually going to put this statue on a pillar so if we go up in our content browser and just drag out grab like a pillar or stand or something and let me look this one looks pretty cool or do I want to use this one Oh any meenie miney moe this one it is and go ahead and drag that out and it is incredibly tiny right now actually this one looks a little more epic yeah there we go so go ahead and I'm gonna grow this to like let's say let's give it a nice two point oh and all right looks looking pretty good Bucky so go ahead put it right there make sure that's lined up in our side view which a good enough and now in our top view we can make sure it's lined up right where we wanted to which right there it looks pretty darn good so now what I'm going to need to do is now that I verify that is indeed on the ground go ahead and put a statue on it because again the name of this game find the statue so we of course need to go open up our content browser and find a stitch you for this one looks pretty good eeny meeny miny mo ok I'll choose that one hello statue you're a little too close to my camera so what we're going to do is drag you over there and make sure you're sitting right on top of this little fellow right here and now once i got that complete drag you over right there and you should be placed perfectly what i could do is rotate you and that's actually what i'm going to do in my top view i'm gonna rotate you just a little bit so you're like oh oh look at him dance Oh dropped beat up on fifth base boom boom boom club it belong ok ok enough me I goofing around so actually this is looking pretty cool right there so yeah so our game is almost complete but check it out if we were to play this game right now then everything would be incredibly dark I mean look at art Castle this look like 15 minutes to create aside for me talking about just like stupid random stuff so imagine what you can create in like an hour or two you might be able to add like podiums with flayer and more windows up here make a castle look better but for now the only thing I have left to do in this castle is I'm going to add some lights right along here I'm going to be adding two lights the first kind I'm going to be adding just game 3d model lights now whenever we add those 3d model lights they of course aren't going to act like real lights in our game so then we're going to need to do is add real lights on top of them so our player can actually see and if you don't know what I'm talking about then you guys have to wait for the next tutorial we're going to be finishing up our castle adding some lights and actually playing the game find the statute so that's what you have to look forward to but for now this is all you guys get just a plain old castle so in the next sort of like I said we're going to be finishing everything up so make sure to check that one out so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next time
