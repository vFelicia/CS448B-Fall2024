hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to start learning about inheritance now inheritance is a very big part of objectoriented programming and it's a way to uh write the code once and be able to use it over and over again now let's go ahead and come into our allc cars. VB file and you can see here that we have our class car now this is inside the Nam space all cars so let's come down here and just under class car we're going to make another class so we'll call it sports car we go ahead and hit enter and you can see it adds in class to us so now we have sports car and car inside of all our all cars name space so what we need to do to inherit from the car class is type inherits car so basically what this is saying is that um everything that the car can do or all of the functions and methods and variables inside of a car we can use those inside of our sports car without having to rewrite the code all of all again now if we didn't inherit we would have to copy all this and paste it down in here make our code really ugly and you'd see a bunch of the same thing over and over again so what we're going to what we did is just we inherited from car so now let's add um some values to our car so we'll come up here and we will add private weight as uh let's just do integer so we have a weight variable to get the weight of our car and now what we need to do is come down here and since uh we're making a sports car uh you're probably wanting to know uh what the horsepower is actually I got that Miss Mech mixed up um we want to add horsepower up here and then the weight down here so when you have a sports car um you probably are wondering what the uh weight is in terms of performance um for the ratio of weight to horsepower and this is something that you would look at when you're uh trying to choose a sports car so now that we've added horsepower and weight let's come up here into our um sports car class and we'll just uh end that right there now we come back here to form one. VB and we will create a um a sports car object so we'll do private default sports car as new and we'll use the namespace all cars. sportscar okay so now we have our sports car now let's come back here and we'll add a a method that will send back the attributes of the sports car now you can see that we have uh the overrides function two string for this now this is what we use to get the general information of our car so what we want to do is we'll just copy this right here and we will make a sub so public we'll make it public so that we can access it outside of this class Public Sub get Sports info uh we won't need any arguments we'll just paste this right here and what we want is we want the name the color uh the doors the speed and then we're going we're going to add the weight and the horsepower so we'll just add horsepower and then we'll just type horsepower aha here's our error I made it a sub and not a function so we wanted to we wanted to make it a function and we wanted to set it to type string so that it will return all of this so we'll just send it uh the horsepower and then the weight and we'll just go ahead and put speed right there so that it accesses the property speed and you can see here that we are not getting any errors errors now the reason we're not getting any errors is because uh the sports car inherits everything from car so whatever is in uh car we can use it in sports car now you can see we do get an error on the horsepower because we made that private now let's come up here and we will make a property to get or set the horsepower so gets and sets horsepower and for this we'll just add int horsepower right here so it we'll type public property um horse power as integer now for our git we will just return int horsepower and for our set um we'll type int horsepower equals value okay so that will get rid of our error right here you can see that horsepower shows up and whenever you inherit from something if you're inheriting private uh variables they will not you will not be able to directly access them uh through this like I did you can see that car name is public so we can access that so let's come over here to our form one. VB again and we will just set some of the values for our default sports car now the sports car inherits The Constructor from our car so it sets the color the speed and the number of doors now sports cars ideally have two doors but we'll go into overloading Constructors uh in the next tutorial but we're just going to need to set the weight and the horsepower so for now we'll just make weight public and then we'll add a property later on okay so we'll come over here to 41. VB we'll type default sports car weight and we'll set it equal to let's say 1,000 PB and then we will set the horsepower do horsepower equals and let's just give it 500 horsepower now for show info uh where is it right here we'll just go ahead and type default sports car and if we use2 string it would work fine and give us certain information but we we want all of the information so we'll just type uh let's see get Sports info okay so let's go ahead and run this and we need to hurry up here because I'm running out of time but we'll go ahead and click show info we've got um the name we haven't sent it a name yet color red number of door is five speed is zero horsepower is 500 and weight is 1,000 now I didn't add a new line in there but uh I will add that and we will talk more about this in the next tutorial so thanks for watching and stay tuned for the next tutorial
