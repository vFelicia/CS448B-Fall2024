what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your sixth physics tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about division in scientific notation but before I even begin that I want to mention that as you guys might be able to hear right now there is a huge thunderstorm going on outside my apartment so you know I just wanted to tell you guys in case I don't even know if I'm going to make it through this tutorial before my computer shuts off but if I do I just want to let you guys know that you know there isn't a car crash going on outside it's just thunder so you know uh probably didn't even need to tell you that but I did anyway so let's go ahead and jump into division with scientific notation so just like multiplication we need to pull this number and this number first so let's go ahead and do that right now so 7.62 times 10 to the third divided by 2.1 times 10 to the fifth equals 7.62 divided by 2.1 and then we go ahead and once we figure that out we need to multiply that by this divided by that so we have 10 to the third divided by 10 to the fifth so let's go ahead and figure out each side of this equation 7.62 divided by 2.1 is 3.629 now what we need to do in order to figure out 10 to the third divided by 10 to the fifth the kind of shortcut for this is 10 to the 3 minus 5. now 3 minus 5 this goes ahead and stays the same 3 minus 5 is of course negative 2. so now we have 3.629 times 10 to the negative 2 and check it out that is already in perfect scientific notation form so that's our final answer right there six point I mean excuse me I can't even read today 3.629 times 10 to the negative 2. pretty cool huh so now let's go ahead and jump into another example using a negative yeah that's going to happen a lot and you know what I noticed I don't know if you guys care about that but whenever I'm doing uh well never mind this is just going to be like useless information that you guys don't even care about so let's just go let's just go ahead and move on instead of me randomly talking so now we have an example with a negative and a negative exponent so what we need to do in this case is pull these first numbers right here so it's basically 3.1 divided by 6.4 so we're going to go ahead and figure out that but then we go ahead and times that by 10 to the negative 3 divided by actually we can just go ahead and skip this step so negative 3 minus this is going to look weird negative 7 I might want to go ahead and Surround those by parentheses so negative 3 minus negative seven let's go ahead and figure out each side of these so 3.1 divided by 6.4 equals point four eight four times 10 to the negative 3 minus negative seven so what we're basically doing is saying all right negative 3 plus 7 so it's 10 to the fourth and again as you can see this is in kind of scientific notation but in order to get it proper scientific notation or standard notation or it's not called standard notation it's called I don't know I'll just call proper standard scientific notation it's my tutorial 4.84 and since we moved decimal point Place one point to the right we're going to go ahead and times that by 10 to the third take away one from right there so here is our final answer with one digit to the left of the decimal so there we go and we have one more example we want to cover and yes this is the very last example when dealing with standard arithmetic is that what it's called math functions yeah arithmetic is so much harder to say than math so we got one more example to go and then uh yeah that's it for these dumb scientific notation tutorials so let's go ahead and pound our way through this so 5.9 times 10 to the fifth divided by 1.7 times 10 to the negative 3 or negative third nah negative 3. so 5.9 divided by 1.7 and we're going to go ahead and multiply that by 10 and I'm just going to go ahead and do the shortcut right now 5 minus negative 3 which is pretty much 5 plus 3. so on the left side of this equation what we get is 3.47 times 10 remember 5 minus negative 3 is pretty much saying all right 5 plus 3 so again we don't need a calculator for that 5 plus 3 is 8 so that's our final answer right there and that's already in proper format right there so 3.43 times 10 to the 8th is in proper scientific notation form we can go ahead and you know put that on our test and our teacher gives us you know 10 out of 10 and they say good job and they say see me after class and they might have a little winky face right there what if your teacher did that she's like see me after class and she put a winky face what'd you see here or would you not I'd probably be like you know what I think I'm just going to walk out of class and yeah unless she was cute then I'd have to see her but anyways I'm rambling on so there you go there you have it there's your basic math functions whenever you're working with scientific notation again if you come across any problem that's more difficult than these you know maybe you have like a scientific notation that you need to put to the like the eighth exponent or something like that if you have anything weird like that just just go ahead and use a scientific calculator now that we know the basics of it we can go ahead and just use a calculator anytime we want from here on out so I needed to teach you guys this because whenever you're working in college in high school the teacher makes you show your work and it's good to understand you know what's going on behind the scenes so you guys don't just depend on your calculator all the time but now that we understand this we're ready to move on to something a lot more interesting so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next tutorial
