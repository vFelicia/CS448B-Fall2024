hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at dynamic arrays now arrays by default are limited to the number of items that you set when you declare it so let's say you declare an array and you have it hold 6 items so 0 through 5 once you get to 5 you cannot add any more items in this tutorial we're going to be learning how to make an array bigger than it originally was by using the read in keyword so we'll go ahead and open up our toolbox we will add a list box and we will add a button we'll go ahead and close out of that so we'll come over here and we'll make each one of these a little bit bigger so we'll just set the text for button 1 to read in and we will set the name to button 3 dim and we'll set the list box to list array okay so go ahead and just make this a little bit smaller we'll go ahead and double click on read them to open up the event for it and what we're going to do is we're going to come up here and we are going to declare an array so private and we'll just do string sports and we'll set it to 2 so it'll hold three places as string now we'll go ahead and populate it so we will do baseball basketball and football and we aren't going to need this right here so let's go ahead and take that out okay so now we have an array that holds three items 0 1 & 2 so whenever they click read in we want to add those items to the list well first we'll add items to the list and then we'll read eclair it so for each item as string in string sports we want to go ahead and type list arrays listed items dot add item ok so go ahead and run this and you can see here that if we click this button we get those three in there so now what we're going to do is we are going to read eclair that so let's wait for this to load here okay so we'll add another list box so let's come over here to our tool box find list box okay so we'll shrink this down some to fit into our form and let's just make this a little wider and wilt it will set the name value of this to list new array so now we'll go ahead and come back here and we will find our button read them click event and now what we're going to do is we're going to read Eclair string sports so we'll type re dim and if you read the description says reallocate storage space for an array variable so it just pretty much starts over from scratch so we'll read in string sports and this time how many places we want to tap well right now I have two let's just do four syllable whole five and then we'll just go ahead and assign those to something so string string sports three it's going to be equal to wakeboarding and string sports four is going to be equal to let's just do soccer okay so now if we do another for loop so for each item as string in string sports we want to go ahead and type list new array dot items add and we're going to do we're going to add brackets right here and then we'll add we'll add item and we will add more brackets now the reason we're doing this is so that so that you can see each of the items enclosed in brackets and since some of these items are going to be no we need to put other strings in here because it will start complaining and it tries to print out something no and your program will crash so we'll just go ahead and add these let's go ahead and do it up here too so you can see so you can easily compare them and we will add them to the other side okay so now if we go ahead and run this you can see that here's our read in button if we go ahead and click that we get baseball basketball and football and then over here we have empty empty empty wakeboarding and soccer now when you read Eclair an array it's going to clear that array and set everything back to nothing and it's going to make it bigger or smaller whatever you want now there is an easy way to fix this and we will learn about that in the next tutorial so thanks for watching guys stay tuned for the next tutorial
