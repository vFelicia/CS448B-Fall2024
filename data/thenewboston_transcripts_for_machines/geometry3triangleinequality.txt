So today we're going to talk about triangle inequality properties and there are three that we're going to talk about so our first one says if one side of a triangle is longer than another side of a triangle then the angle opposite the first side is greater than the angle opposite the second side so say we know that CB is longer than C A so which we can tell just by looking at it so that means that this angle angle a which is opposite CB angle a is going to be greater than this angle that's opposite CA angle B so our next property says that if one angle of a triangle is longer than larger than the other angle the side opposite the first angle is longer than the side opposite the smaller angle so this is basically like the last one just reversed so if you know that this angle angle a is greater than angle B then the side opposite angle a which is CB is going to be greater than the side opposite B which is c a whereas the other one we knew this and then we could figure out that and last we know lastly we know that the sum of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side so that means that the sum of the sum of CB plus C A is greater than AB the sum of ab plus C A is greater than CB the sum of C A Plus and C A or no excuse me CB plus AB is greater than CA so now we're going to do some examples where we use these to solve things so is it possible to have a triangle with sides with the following lengths 209 and 8 so first we're going to add them all up and make sure that like the length of these two is greater than this one for every single pair of angles so 20 + 9 is greater than 8 yes that's true 9 + 8 is greater than 20 oh wait we have a problem right here 9 + 8 is only 177 and 17 is not greater than 20 so no it is not possible okay with lengths 9 12 and 15 so 9 + 12 greater than 15 this is 21 21 is greater than 15 12 + 15 is greater than 9 well that's 27 and 27 is definitely greater than 9 and 9 + 15 is greater than 12 this would be 24 which is greater than 12 so yes it is possible which angle is longest so we know that the sides measure x x + 2 and x + 8 if we were to order these from these sides from least to greatest we would have x x + 2 because this x has the same value for each side so if I just have X that's going to be less than if I have X and two more than x so and then x + 8 because this is saying 8 more than x and this is only 2 more than x and since X is greater than two this is our order so this is from least to greatest well our angles opposite these sides are going to be the same way so that means since x + 8 is the greatest side the angle opposite x + 8 is going to be the greatest angle so angle 2 is largest which side is longest okay well we know this is a right angle and a right angle measures 90Â° we need to find the measure of this angle so that's 30 by the way if you couldn't tell 90 + 30 is equal to 120 and so 120 + x is equal to 180 because remember the interior angles of a triangle equal sum up to 180 so then if we subtract 120 over we get X is equal to 60 so this is equal to 60 so the side that is opposite the largest angle is going to be longest so since this angle right here is the largest that means side a is the largest so this is all we're going to do for today but make sure you come back and watch the next lesson because we're going to start talking about how to geometrically prove the triangles are congruent
