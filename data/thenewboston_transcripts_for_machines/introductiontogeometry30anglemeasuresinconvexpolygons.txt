So today we're talking about um the angle measures in convex polygons so a convex polygon has angles that all open inward so to find the sum of the angles you're going to pick a point or pick a Vertex we picked vertex a and you're going to draw all the possible diagonals from that point so there's one right there and one right there so you multiply the number of triangles that you achieve by drawing the diagonals by 180 so there's 1 2 three triangles and we're going to multiply 3 by 180 because we know that the sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 and once you do that you get 450 so each one of these angles added together is going to give you 540 so we have this first polygon and it has one two three four sides if I pick this point I'm going to call this vertex a and if I draw all the possible diagonals in I only get two triangles so 2 * 180 equals 360 so each one of these angles added together will give us 360Â° so number of sides this has one 2 3 four 5 five six sides and we're going to pick this point D and we're going to draw 1 2 we're going to draw in three diagonals which leaves us with one 2 3 four triangles so then we take four multiplied by 180 which will give us a total of 720 so we know that each one of these angles once they're added together is going to equal 720 now this par particular technique only works when you have a convex polygon and you'll know if you do or not because when you try and draw the diagonals in they won't leave you with triangles so now that we talked about the angle measures in convex polygons make sure you come back and watch the next lesson where we're going to talk about angle measurements and regular polygons
