hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org and this is a video tutorial for the New Boston now in the last video we take took a look at the manipulation functionality of jQuery and we looked at append and we looked at how to append a particular value from a text box onto um a the end of a sentence inside a paragraph tag so if you haven't already looked at that go ahead and take a look at that now we're going to take a look at append two now let's just say we have a paragraph just up here and I'm going to give this an ID ID of par graph one uh I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to copy and paste that here and I'm just going to call this paragraph 2 now I'm going to put some contents inside paragraph one so this is a paragraph uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to allow a button to then take this and append it to the end of here so uh oh in in in actual fact we'll do this example I'll put my name here and my name is and a space here So eventually what I want to do is uh click a button and I want this paragraph here to be appended to the end of this paragraph here so instead of going through the process of taking the elements contents what I actually want to do is reference this paragraph 1 and append it to the end of paragraph 2 so let's go ahead and up here just create a paragraph and inside of this create an input field or a button sorry um I'm going to give this a value of append 2 and the ID of this I'll call append okay so inside append DJs which we have included on our page we can go ahead and create an event handler for this button and then go ahead and use the append to function to append this paragraph here to this paragraph here let's go ahead and create our event handler first so we've called the button append so when the button is clicked we want to carry out a particular function and inside this function block let's just bring it down a moment uh we want to append this first paragraph to the second paragraph So we reference the first paragraph which is paragraph 1 and then we use a pend to instead of just aend on its own and then we can simply choose another element on the page so this is obviously paragraph 2 so now when we've clicked the button paragraph one will be appended to the end of paragraph 2 let's just open up our browser and take a look at this Okay so we've got Alex just here when we click append to this Alex here should be referenced and appended to the end of here let's go ahead and click it okay so um you can see that we have a slight problem and that is the fact that I have Alex inside of a paragraph let's just go back and change this and I'm going to change this here to a span uh because then we'll have the contents all on one line um let's just change this here to span and this just a paragraph and we'll go ahead and change these names accordingly okay so that was my mistake the uh example uh looked a bit odd okay so now when we click appen two you can see it now says my name is Alex now you'll also notice that the first uh the span has actually been moved rather than just uh cloned and appended to the end of here so what we're actually doing is we're taking one element and we're appending the whole of the element onto the end of another so you can you can start to see how useful this would be in a more practical application if you were actually taking values and you wanted to place them for example if you had a user that was uh for example constructing something constructing a sentence or you know something along them lines or maybe you had something like a menu builder that built menus up you might want to append the different uh menu items the subcategories onto the main menu uh there's the uses for a pen 2 are really unlimited um obviously against your imagination so what we've taken is we've taken this span here and we've appended it essentially removed it and placed it here and that's what you see on the page so let's just take a look at the page Source you can see that we've got the span oh no it's it it won't show because we've um we're obviously using jQuery and that's not going to show up in the source uh but essentially this is what would have happened uh this is the uh the result of when we Ed the append to uh by appending this span onto that paragraph
