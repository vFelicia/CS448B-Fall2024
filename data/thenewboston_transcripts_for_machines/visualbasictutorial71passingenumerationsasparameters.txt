hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking another look at enumerations now sorry I've been jumping around a bit in these last couple tutorials but um I'm just trying to hit the uh most import important points and sometimes I feel you need to learn uh maybe something about enumerations after you learn about properties and when we make those demo applications so um all that aside what we're going to do is we're going to be passing an a numeration to a sub or a function so let's go ahead and create a new project we will select a Windows forms application and we will call it passing en nums okay so we'll wait for that to load and we will go ahead and Shrink this down a bit and we will select the toolbx we will add a combo box right here uh let's see right there and we will add a button so here's our combo box and we'll add a button okay so now we'll shrink this down some close out of the toolbox and we will make the button a little bit bigger so we will set the name of combo box one to combo Sports and we'll go ahead and set the button name to button analyze and we'll set the text to analyze sport so in our combo box we're going to go ahead and come over here to the collections uh property so here's items and we need our we need to add stuff to the collection so we'll just add baseball basketball and football and we'll go ahead and click okay so now we will go ahead and create an event handler for analyze Sport and we'll just let that sit there for now and let's go ahead and zoom in and create an enumeration so private enam Sports and now what we're going to do is set the data type for that so private inom Sports as uh let's is to integer okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to set baseball equal 1 basketball equals 2 and football equals 3 so now we're just going to create an object of this enumeration now object probably isn't the best word for that let's create a variable a data type of this enumeration so we'll just type private my Sport AS Sports and now what we're going to do is we're going to come over here and create an event so you can see that the uh default event handler is the selected index changed um now you can come over here to the lightning bolt and change it and um you can uh select which one you want but we're just going to use selected index change so now what we're going to do is we're going to type my sport equals combos Sports Dot and now let's go back here and we can look at our collection for combo Sports we got baseball basketball and football so let just go ahead and click cancel there and you can see that we have uh the same Valu set in here now let's start from Counting from zero cuz it's always good to count from zeros in programs because that's how computers work they start counting from zero so my sport equal combos sports. selected index now the selected index for combo Sports starts at zero which is going to be baseball um the uh then the next one up would be one and the next one after that would be two now if no uh no item in the combo box is selected it's going to be equal to negative 1 so what we can do to uh handle any errors that might happen we'll just type if combos sports. selected index does not equal 1 then go ahead and do this so we'll just cut that out right there and paste it in okay so now that we've got which sport they collected what we want to do is we want to analyze the sport when they click analyze the sport so um we'll just create a sub that will do that for us so so we'll go ahead and come down here below combo Sports and we will type private sub analyze Sport and we will just go ahead and byal sports list as Sports so basically we're passing a an object of the sports data type which is an an enumer a so now we're just going to use a select case statement so select case and we're just going to go through sport sports list so we will type case um so case is and now what we can do is we can check to see if it any one of the values in our Sports enumeration so the way we would do this is sports do baseball let's try this again sports. baseball and we need to add an equals right here that's what I was missing okay so case is Sport equals sports. baseball so if the sports list that they pass to it is equal to baseball then we'll go ahead and type messagebox doow your sport is baseball and now I'll do case is equal to sports. foot we don't want sports list we want Sports so if it's equal to sports. foot we will just type messagebox Dosh your sport is football and we'll do that one more time so case is equal to Sports sports. basketball and now we'll just use the shorthand for message box so we'll just type message box your sport is basketball and then we will do a case else so then we'll just type message box you don't have a sport okay so now if we go ahead and run this we've got our combo box right here nothing is selected so if we click analyze support analyze support uh nothing's going to happen because we forgot something really important when they click uh button analyze we want to call analyze Sport and then my sport okay so now let's go ahead and run this and you can see if there's nothing selected uh it'll say looks like we had a problem there uh let's go ahead and select baseball so so say your sport is baseball we select basketball your sport is basketball football your sport is football so um you can go ahead and try passing uh enumerations to uh subs and functions if you want and um you can even I'll scroll up here so you can pause and look at this code if you miss some of it put that in uh change some of the code do whatever you want and then move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
