okay today we're going to be talking about congruent segments and they're just segments that have equal measurements um since the only way we measure a line is to measure its length we're going to say that they are segments that have equal length so down here I have two segments drawn already and if you were to measure them you would find that the distance from A to B is five cm so we write that as a b and since it's a line segment we put a little bar on top of it is equal to 5 cm don't forget your units those are always really important in Geometry okay we're going to measure C to D and you would find that the length is also 5 cm so I write that c d is equal to 5 cm and since they have equal length we can say that line segment AB is equal to line segment CD or that A and C D are congruent line segments okay all right let's say you're given this information and they want you to find the length of a line segment a d given that ax is equal to 4 cm and XD is equal to 8 cm so we're just going to label this right here four and eight and since this is what we're trying to find we can add a X Plus x d to find out what a d equals and this this is called the addition property of segments and it allows us to take one part of a segment right here and add it to the other part of the segment to find the whole measurement of the whole segment so all we do is we since we know ax is 4 cm plus XD which is 8 cm we just add those together and you get 12 CM therefore a d the length of a d is equal to 12 CM now the only reason we can do this is because X lies in between a d if x say x was over here somewhere and this was X and we wanted to find the length of a d we couldn't we couldn't do anything with X it's only because X is between A and D that we can add ax + XD and this makes sense if you think about it because if you had a pizza and you had this much of a pizza say this is 1/4 of a pizza and that's how much was eaten if the rest of it was also eaten 1 14 + 34 gives you the whole pizza it's kind of like these are fractions of a line segment so that to get the whole number you add each part together okay so using those two um definitions we just learned we're going to do some examples okay so we already know that the length of a a b is equal to 3 that's already given to us right here so they say if BC is equal to 12 CM how long is AC so since AC is the whole segment we're going to take each part of the segments and add them together to find the whole length so 12 cm+ 3 3 cm is equal to 15 cm therefore AC = 15 cm all right so on this second one this one's a little different they tell us what the whole length is if HJ which is the entire light line segment is equal to 10 cm what is this part equal to so using the same idea we're going to take the whole length minus part of the length to find out what the other part of the segment equals and I J = 5 cm okay for our last example we're going to put the two things we learned together so if ab and BC are congruent and ab is equal to 8 C CM what is the length of AC okay since we know that A and B are congruent that means that they have equal length so if AB is equal to 8 cm that means that BC also has to be equal to 8 cm so to find the whole length of this we're going to add a and b c together so we get 8 cm Plus 8 cm equal 16 cm so AC equal 16 cm okay now that you understand the basic properties of line segments um be sure to come back and watch the next video which is going to go over the properties of angles El
