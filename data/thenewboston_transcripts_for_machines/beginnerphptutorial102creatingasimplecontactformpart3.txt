so let's go in here and we need to first of all set a few variables up so we need to say two is equal to something and that's just clearly my email address so I'm going to be sending this to my own email address since it's a contact us form the inquiries are going to come to me so this is my email address the next one is the subject so I'm just going to pre define the subject as contact form submitted just to let me know when I receive an email the subject is contact form submitted and what's this going to do is it's going to just let me know that a contact form has been submitted that's all basically yeah it's up to you what you set the header to now the body is going to equal the contact text so the text that the contact the user sorry has entered in this text field here and we are going to also set headers and the headers is just going to be from and then the email address is going to come here so what why do we do this so let's I'll just put the variable in first so contact email now what this is going to do is when I receive the email on my squirrel mail client here when I get the email it's going to say it's from and the email address that the user actually typed in in the HTML form this way what I can do is I can quickly press reply and it will set up a reply to this email address where it came from so it's really nifty way of being able to quickly instantly reply to a user Wow after you've had contact form submitted and if you don't understand what I mean then I'll show you a bit later when I actually receive the email so everything seems set up now we've got the contact text in there we've got from and we need the also the contact name so we can put this anywhere really we could say body equals and contact name and then we can append onto it remember when we want to do a line break we need to use double quotation marks we can append a line break on there so we'll have the contacts name and then a line break and then what they've written in the form so now that we've got each value here we can use the mail function so mail the parameters are first of all who it's to and then the subject and then the body and then the headers but what we want to do is we want to double check that the email has actually been sent so we can enclose this in an if statement and what this does is if this returns true it means the mail has been successfully sent so we can echo out a confirmation message and we can say if mail then echo mail or or thanks for contacting us we'll remember to escape that character there because we're using single quotation marks and we used a single quotation mark inside the string with the single quotation marks we'll be in touch soon for example otherwise we want to let them know that we couldn't send the mail at this time we're not going to be echoing out any errors so we want to put an @ sign in front of the mail so if this does return any errors we're not actually displaying these to the user so now we can say echo sorry an error occurred who spoke heard well please try again later okay so if the male sent and we're silencing this so if we do receive any errors from this it won't be displayed to our user we're going to say thanks for contacting us we'll be in touch soon the you now will then be sent automatically even though it's inside an if condition and then otherwise we're going to say sorry an error occurred peace try again later let's go ahead and save the changes and we'll come over to our contact form and test this out so I've got my squirrel mail client opened at the moment this is a test email that came in earlier when I was testing this so don't worry about that for now but we'll let's fill out this form to see if we get an email back so let's say Alex my email address I'm going to set to Alex at PHP academy' de org and here I'm going to say hi just wondered how to well we can write anything really how to create a PHP file something silly lilacs we're doing doing a PHP tutorial so why not so now let's click send thanks for contacting us we'll be in touch soon let's go over to the squirrel now and click inbox and you can see that I've got an email from Alex at PHP academy' de org remember the email address that we are saying it from is this email here that we filled out let's go ahead and click on it okay so it says now Alex this is the user that has sent submit to this form so the name of the person that submitted the form and then like I said before we're breaking down and we're saying hi just wondered how to create a PHP file so we've got the name of the user here and we've got the body of the text that they fill down the text area here so now when we go to click reply here what it'll automatically do is reply to the email address that the user supplied in here so this is a really useful way of doing things because then you also got their text here their question that they asked here and you can just come here and type in your reply here so that's how to create a basic contact form in PHP and there's a couple of things that you need to take into account before you actually put this on a public server
