so what we do is we first of all check if options are available so if the user has specified options and then we extend which is essentially just merging uh two objects or arrays in this case together and we want to merge or extend settings to options so now what we've done is we've just basically taken values and then combined them with the predefault settings that we've created here that's really all there is to it so when i whenever i'm creating a jquery plugin and i'm using this notation i always go ahead and alert out one of my settings so i know that it's actually working so we're going to go ahead and alert our settings and because of course this is an array we're going to alert out color so inside ext.js let's just go ahead and apply this plugin to the document so it's uh dot highlight and then inside let's not specify anything at all and let's refresh you can see that we've got null returned here that's obviously because like i said this is the default value i haven't supplied any sort of options or settings inside of here therefore null is the correct is the predefined or default value if it was yellow and i refreshed we get the value yellow up so now what we want to do is i'm going to go ahead and change that back to null and i'm gonna actually supply uh some you know options to this plugin so let's go ahead and type in color which is the name of my option remember over here my name the name of my option here and color is going to be yellow so now that i've actually supplied it we have this if option so this equals true we extend it in and then this takes over this value so now when i refresh you see we get yellow if i was to go ahead and inside of here specify this as red or red rather not read and refresh you can see we've got red so we've now successfully passed this you know parameter or this setting to our plugin so now what we can go ahead and do is use this.css and we can set the background color to settings color because we've already echoed this setting out so we know that it works so we can go ahead and use css to set the background color in this case so let's go ahead and refresh oh let's go ahead and specify color color and change that there in actual fact no we don't need that sorry i forgot to actually go ahead and apply it to something relevant we used this without the dollar sign and whatever else because we've used this notation here we're not required to inside of our plugin we're setting the background color to the settings specified as we've already talked about here so in this case it's red um let's go ahead and actually apply this to something relevant and in this case it's the strong tags or in this case every strong tag on the page so now when we refresh you see that the background is highlighted with red we can go ahead and then specify something like yellow for example and refresh and you can see that it does exactly the same thing now let's go ahead and look at what we want to do if we want to add a second option into here so essentially what we do is we might say foreground black or foreground white for example so what this would do is we're supplying the first which is the highlight color and then the foreground color we can do as well so let's go ahead and modify our plugin i'm going to go ahead and pull this down here and i'm going to comma onto the end of here and i'm going to say 4 ground null so by default it's nothing let's just pull that down a little bit more if options this line we don't need to change because we're still extending the options given to our predefined setting array so we're extending them settings to our options we're then saying this.css background color is settings color but now we can again say this.css or this dot css color which is obviously the foreground color in css and we can supply foreground from our settings so we've quite easily added in another option here which is foreground and this won't take effect just at the moment but if we go ahead and specify foreground let's say red in here you'll see that that's transferred through to our plugin using the foreground option there we merge and then we use this settings array to change the color using css in jquery so in this tutorial we've learned how we can obviously create our function which you should have already known i guess if you're watching this from the other videos we predefine our settings in my case i always choose them as null however if you wanted the default for background color to be yellow and the default foreground to black or hash naught or naught you would do that and then we merge the settings with the options that are given so we can then use them use the user settings and we use this array to access each one so we've created more or less a pointless plugin but it has demonstrated how that we how we pass options uh to our plugin and actually make use of them
