alright guys welcome to your 25th udk tutorial and in this lesson I'm going to be going over all these math functions why we have math functions what they do and when you would use them I'm actually going to just be teaching you guys one of these but once we learn one of them we can see why math functions are useful but before I begin I want you guys to notice that I now as when my subscribers are requested have a highlight over my mouse cursor as you guys probably knows if you guys like it then let me know if you guys don't like it then tell me you don't like it whatever you guys vote I'm either going to keep it or delete it from now on so I thought I'd test it out in this video because someone commented and said it would be a good idea so let me guys know let me guys know let me know guys so with that being said I'm gonna be going over the multiply expression and how we can use it so say that these bricks are looking pretty good but we were making a game and we put them into a level that was supposed to be scary so we want them to turn from this you know pale tan red color it's kind of a cool scary blue color so go ahead and first thing we need to do is disconnect this right there and by the way you disconnect something by holding down alt on your keyboard and clicking it so now what we need to do is go ahead and hit ctrl and drag this up because we're going to be adding a bunch of stuff before it gets to the diffuse now the very first thing we're going to be adding is a multiply expression so go ahead and rightclick and under math we're going to find multiply so go ahead and drag that pretty much in the center right there and what multiply expression does is it takes two numbers and multiplies the result and outputs the result so if this number is three in this number what's three it would take three times three and note output nine so go ahead and as the first number and put the bricks texture right here now let me just go ahead and give you guys another number and there is actually an expression just to hold constant numbers so go ahead and rightclick constant and we're going to pick a new constant 3 vector if saying all right how do I know hold on a second I got like an eyelash in my eye if you guys are saying all right how do I know whether it's use constant constant two three four we'll check it out I chose constant three because remember a vector is pretty much a list of numbers now in our texture sample we have RGB values already in there we have a value for red green and blue now in this constant three vector check it out we have values for r g and b red green and blue so whenever we plug this in to be this is what's going to happen right now well let me go ahead and plug this in to be so here's what's going on in our material editor right now we have this texture of bricks now this texture has builtin value of red green and blue even though we can't see it it's there trust me now what it's doing is it's multiplying this red value by this red value which is zero and any number times zero if you remember format class is zero so it's taken these RGB values time in the red x 0 that gives us output of red zero blue x 0 and that gives us a value of blue zero in green x 0 so we're basically getting as output zero zero zero since all these values are 0 and let me go ahead and add a little comment constant 3 so now what we need to do is we obviously need to change these values from 0 to something else so if you want the texture to be the exact same go ahead and change everything 21 and if we change everything to one check it out this texture right here now is the exact same as it was before because let's go ahead and verify that by dragging this over just plugging in the regular texture of your diffuse and check it out whenever you multiply anything by one you get the same number like nine times one 95 times 1 is 5 so whenever you multiply everything by one you get the same outcome so that's why when we multiply the r g and b all those by one we got the same r g and b but say we wanted to boost the red value well let's go ahead and do what i'm going to do in this tutorial we're going to leave the red the same because we want to turn these bricks more blue so let's go ahead and what we can do is we can up the blue value a little bit by multiplying this by three now whenever we focus away from that we're going to see that our texture now turned blue so what this is basically doing is taking this blue value in multiplying it by this blue value so it's going to take whatever value ahead in here for blue and timesing it by three and therefore we pump more blue color so say we had a blue value of five in here well whenever we times it by three it would now be 15 so that's why we got more blue color in the final outcome and say we want in just a little bit more green in here so let me go ahead and put like 1.75 and now let me focus away and we now get a little more green in our bricks so basically it takes the RGB from before and it pumps it or enhances it by a new level by using this multiply parameter right here and it multiplies the final outcome together and whatever your final RGB is that's the value it plugs into the diffuse so again I only tell you guys one math function to multiply but that's how all those math functions are useful I know before your guys are probably wondering why the heck would I ever need the divide function when working with textures but there's your answer right there the multiply function allows you to change your overall color of your texture pretty much so using these math functions in these constants and all these other things we can create some pretty cool looking textures but for now that's all i wanted to covering the story so guys don't forget to let me know if you like or you don't like this mouse cursor so I weather so I know whether keep it or get rid of it or not but for now thank you guys for watching and don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
