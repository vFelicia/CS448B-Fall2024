so now we're going to focus on arcs and chords and their relationship to one another so two chords are congruent if they intercept congruent arcs so on this circle Z the arc zy is equal to 108° and Arc w X is equal to 108° so that means zy is congruent to Arc WX so that means that chord zy has to be congruent to chord WX oh so so if z y = 10 that means WX also has to equal 10 okay two arcs of a circle are congruent if their chords are congruent so this is like the other one it's just the contrapositive of it so these two chords so St equals 10 and V equal 10 so that means St chord St is congruent to chord Vu so that means that chord or sorry arc V is congruent to Arc St so if arc V equals 93 then St also has to equal 93 so now that we know that we're going to take it one step further so the perpendicular bis sector of a cord of a circle so we're talking of about this chord of this circle so the perpendicular bis sector which is this line right here because it intercepts this cord to form a right angle well four right angles these are all right angles and it has to contain the center of the cord and it bcts The Arc of the chords so that means that QR this chord right here is congruent to RP q n this chord right here is congruent to PN to PN and since it's a bis sector it means it bcts this chord QR into two equal parts so that means that Q um we're going to call this point right here R so that QR is congruent to RP which makes sense because if these two chords are congruent then these two segments must be congruent so now we're going to do an example so we have this circle where K is the center of the circle m I we're going to try and tell what kind of relationship Mi has to J L well since there's a right angle right here that must mean that Mi I is perpendicular to L J this line right here because when they intersect it forms a right angle so so KH right here is equal to 6 and LJ this entire thing is equal to 16 so first we want to know that what LH is congruent to so LH is this piece right here it's congruent to JH right here because when Mi I intersects J L it non only forms the right angle it cuts J L into two equal pieces so Arc G LM which is this Arc right here is congruent to this Arc right here JM because these if you look at Mi it's also the diameter of this circle so this Arc is the corresponding part of this is corresponding to this Arc so I am bisects first we're going to give it the line that it bisects which is J L it also bcts this whole entire circle so that it bisects i j m and ml because it divides this entire Circle up into congruent pieces so the midpoint of LJ which is this line right here is what well if you remember the midpoint of a line is the point that divides that segment into two equal parts well right here I have two equal parts so that me mean that H is the midpoint of segment LJ so LH right here equals what well since we know that LJ is 16 and that H is the midpoint of LJ we can just divide 16 / by 2 and you'll get eight if you do that so that each one of these pieces has to be eight I think it's cenm 8 cm so LH is 8 cm and JH is also 8 cm now they want to know the length of l k this segment right here well if you think about it k l has to be congruent to J K because if we were to do the Pythagorean theorem we would have an A which is8 a b which is six and a c right here for this triangle and we'd have an a of eight a b of six and a c right here of this triangle so in order to find out what L K and J K equal we're going to use our Pythagorean theorem so we're because these are right triangles so we're going to take 8 2ar + 6 SAR and set it equal to c^ 2 we get 64 + 36 = c² c^2 = 100 and if you remember the square Square < TK of 100 is 10 so C = plus or minus 10 now let's talk about that answer for a second since these are distances C cannot be negative so C has to equal 10 so both L K and J K equal 10 well that's all we have for today be sure to watch the next lesson
