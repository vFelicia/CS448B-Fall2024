hi there this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is another video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video I'm going to be talking about concatenation within PHP now if you've ever come across the word concatenation you'll understand what it means or if you program before you might understand how to concatenate different variables together on how to print out things and then concatenate variables in so you can view them in a sentence if you like now in PHP it's really really simple let's start out by creating just a few variables so the first thing I'm going to do is create a variable called day and this is going to be equal to the day of the week so today it is Thursday and I'm going to create another variable called let's say date and this is just going to be simply equal to the day in numerical value so it's the 31st today now down here if I wanted to say echo out the day and then the date so eventually I want it to say there so let's just echo it out so we know what we're doing Thursday I could say the date is Thursday 31 just just to make things simple we could eventually faff around with St but that would use if statements which is later on so the date is Thursday the 31st this is what we want our program to display we could in fact incorporate the year in as well so I'm going to say year equals I'm going to say 2011 now the reason I'm doing this is for example if it was the year 2000 in actual fact it would work so yeah okay we'll keep this as in to the data so the year equals 2011 so we've got a variable called day we've got a variable called date and we've got a variable called year so we'll eventually we want this program to display the date is Thursday the 31st 2011 but we want it to use these variables rather than a predefined set of text that we've written out so the way we do this is we can either you our double quotation marks which is going to make life a lot easier for us orga new singles now I'm going to use singles at first because it's a lot better for you to learn with single quotation marks and then you can go ahead and be lazy and use the doubles if you like so with a single quotation marks I'm going to start typing the date is okay so I've left a space here on purpose now after the last single quotation mark but before the line Terminator we want to add a full stop so it's just a single dot on this line then what we need to do is just simply address the variable that we want to echo so this is still all included on the echo line if we put the day here it's still going to echo out day even though haven't sort of preper echo in front of it so concatenation just basically means we're joining something on to the string that we already echoing so the date is day then we want a space so I'm going to concatenate on and a piece of string data with just a space inside and then concatenate on as well with another dot date and then I'm going to concatenate on another space so we're using the full stop and then the space here with the with the sir single quotation marks and then eventually we're going to do yeah now obviously we don't need to concatenate anything else onto the end of that because that is the end of our line so now we can just preview let's have a look in our browser refresh and you can see that it says the date is Thursday 31st 2011 now what helps to make a change here so I could say it's Friday the 32nd 2011 I know that's an unrealistic value we'll go for 30 then to see don't go confuse so you could say it's Wednesday okay so it's Wednesday the 30th 2011 let's refresh and you can see that's updated itself again the same with the year and this can be changed as well and it will just simply update the output so this is the harder but faster way to sort of echo variables within string data as well obviously we can also echo things onto the end of this example we might do a strong tag and then we might put a strong hug just before here so the way this is going to work is we're echoing out normal text a bit of HTML just before we declare this in within the concatenation and we have a space we have the date we have a space we have the year and then we end with ending the HTML so let's refresh and you can see that that's time bold so this is a better way to do things but now let's take for the easy way so let's echo the date in fact we're using double quotation marks now you're going to see how easy it is to do it this way the date is day date year and that's it we don't need to concatenate because we're using variables within a string now you might think that this will output dollar sign year in actual fact if we had single quotation marks you can see what happens you can see that it's literally outputted the dollar sign day the dollar sign date the dollar sign year when in actual fact we want it to reference this very these various 3 variables here so all we do is change these to double quotation marks and you'll see that that magically updates itself and puts the variables in there for you so it's it's totally personal preference like I've explained before single quotation marks are faster concatenation gets you used to looking at complex code and understanding what's outputted where so I'd always recommend using the single quotation marks and the concatenation for each variable so that's basically concatenated with in PHP
