today we're going to talk about factoring and we're going to start off with finding the greatest common factor which I'm sure you've done before you just might not have known what you're doing so when we find our greatest common factor we're going to write the number and we're going to list all the numbers that divide evenly into that so our first example is going to be with 18 and 30 so if we go through the list of numbers we know that 18 is divisible by 2 x 3 and x 6 30 is divisible by 2 3 5 & 6 so when we found the greatest common factor we're finding the largest number that we can pull out of both of these and it has to be the same number so if you look they both share two in common but that's not the greatest common factor they will share three but that's not the greatest common factor either but they both share a six and since that is the largest number that they are both divisible by evenly divisible by 6 is our greatest common factor okay so we're going to do a couple more examples and then we're going to talk about the greatest common monomial factor which has to deal with monomial or binomial expressions and factoring out of my no monomial so we're going to list these two numbers the exact same way we did before and we're just going through all the numbers that are that evenly divided into twenty eight and forty nine so 28 is divisible by four and seven and that's it 49 is divisible by seven and that's it so that means that our GCF is the biggest number that they are both evenly divisible by which for this one happens to be seven so this is our last example for a greatest common factor so 48 is divisible by 2 3 4 6 & 8 72 is divisible by 2 3 4 4690 8 9 and 12 and I actually forgot one more for 48 because if you divide 48 by four you get 12 so that means it's also evenly divisible by 12 so as you can see 12 is going to be our greatest common factor now if you're not sure how I got all of these numbers all I did was went down a number line and figured out which numbers are 48 and 72 are evenly divisible by once you get used to finding the GCF it'll be easier to list the factors out but um until then sometimes it's just guests in check work so now we're going to switch gears and talk about the greatest common monomial factor so it has the same idea as finding just the greatest common factor but we're talking about expressions polynomial expressions and what we're trying to do is figure out what is the largest monomial factor that we can pull out of both so the way we're going to approach this is we're gonna this is how you write my bad when we factor this out what we're going to do is we end up doing reverse distribution so we're going to have a number here and then a expression in the parentheses so we're going to look at each one of these terms 12 and 15 each one of these parts of this term so we're going to look first at the the coefficients which are 12 and 15 and if we list those factors out 12 is divisible by 2 and 3 and 4 and 6 and 15 is divisible by 3 and five so we can pull out of three of both of these so what we do is divide each number by three so 12 divided by 3 is 4 15 divided by 3 is 5 so we're going to outside is going to be a three and then it's going to be a for something plus of five something now we look at the second number or term which is a we have an eight cubed here and an a here so what is the largest term that we can pull out of those 2a terms well we can pull out an and then if we have a if we have an a out here a times how many a's will give us a to the third well if you remember our exponent rules this needs to be an a squared because when we multiply we add our exponents and this right here since we've divided by n a there's going to be no a right there then we're going to do the same thing with be we're going to look at the beater meeeeee and we're going to decide how many bees we can pull out of both of these terms and have it divided evenly so this is B to the one and this is B to the three so all we can take out is a B and here the same thing if you have B to the one and you / b you're going to have no bees left in this term and for this one using our exponent rules again we know that this has to be B squared so we're going to do one more example with greatest common monomial factors so here we have a trinomial but the process is going to be the same as it was before we're going to have a number a monomial out here and some expression inside these parentheses so the question we always ask ourselves when we solve when we factor a binomial origin and wheel or any polynomial is what is the biggest number I can pull out of each one of these terms evenly so 13 as you guys probably know is a prime number it's only divisible by itself and one and if you double check 26 is also divisible by 13 as well as 39 so we can pull out a 13 from each one of these and we're going to get with one + 26 / 13 is two plus 30 or sorry that should be a minus minus and 39 / 13 is three and then this has an M and M squared and then I'm cute so the largest amount of Em's we can pull out of each one of these terms is just one so you're just left with one here M squared divided by M leaves you with one M and M cube divided by M leaves you with M squared and that's all there really is to factoring so that's all we're going to do today we'll make sure you come back and watch when we're gonna go over how to factor the difference of two squares
