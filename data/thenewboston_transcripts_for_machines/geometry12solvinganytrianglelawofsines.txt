So today we're going to move on to law of signs and using this law to solve sides of a triangle and angles of a triangle so in any triangle ABC S A over a so s of this angle over this side is equal to s b over this side equals s C of this angle over this side so now that we know what the law is let's you do some examples so they want us to find C so just so you know that when we do these problems we don't have to have all three things equal as long as we have S of a over a equal s of B over B and then we can cross multiply to solve for them so I'm just going to set up two eight two two equal fractions to cross multiply so s of 25 oh no not s of 25 okay we only have the measure of this angle so that means we have to use this angle pair and this side pair so we're going to have sine of 35 over 20 is equal to S of this angle but we actually have to know what the measure of this angle is so say the measure of this angle is 62 so sign 62 over C now we're going to cross multiply s of 35 * C is equal to 20 sine of 62 to solve for C we're going to divide s of 35 over and we're going to plug it into our calculator just like that so we're going to put parentheses around 20 sine of 62 time and then we're going to divide it by S of 35 and if you plug it in the calculator you should get 30.7 87 remember we're always going to round to the third decimal place so let's do another example so we know okay so we're trying to find C and we know this angle and this side in this angle so we're going to say s of 10 over 6 is equal to S of 150 over C multiply both sides by c s of 10 is equal to 6 s of 15 because we cross multiplied and we're going to get C is equal to 6 s of 150 over s of 10 so then we put it in the calculator we're going to do parentheses 6 s of 15 50 parentheses parentheses / s of 10 and if you do that you get C is equal to 17276 and since we're given units 17.27% we come back because we're going to move on to proving that a parallelogram is a parallelogram
