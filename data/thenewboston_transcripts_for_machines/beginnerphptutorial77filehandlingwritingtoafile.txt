hello i'm alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video for the new boston in the video we're going to be talking about PHP file handling now you can see at the moment I've created a single PHP file file dot PHP I haven't named it index dot PHP for the purpose of this tutorial so we can keep a track of inside this directory now let's open up our text editor and we can start writing out in this file now PHP file handling is on the basis or first of all opening the file then what we do is we want to either I mean in this in this example I'm going to be writing data to a file but you may want to read data in so there are different attributes if you like you can give when you open the file the first one is W and this is for writing so obvious it stands for writing the second one is R which is for reading so reading and the third one is a which means append so or appending depending on what you want however you want to say so obviously the first one we're going to use two the first one which is W we're going to use to be writing to a file R we're going to be reading from a file and a we're going to be appending to a far so basically adding to a file so let's get rid of this ok so how do we start up the first thing we need to do is create a handle which will open the file now even if the file doesn't exist you can see at the moment inside here no other files except file dot PHP exists we create something called a handle which uses the F open function to create the file even if it doesn't exist so the first argument we give it is the file name itself then we use a comma and the second argument we give is whether we want to either write to the file read from the file or append to the file so in this instance I want to write to the file so I'm going to use R I'm sorry I'm going to use W I want to write to the file and the file I'm going to be the file I'm going to call is going to be called names dot txt so it's a text file so we can open it up and we can view it as a txt okay so now if we execute this PHP script if we run this PHP script rather let's just refresh here and click on fired up here screen nothing has happened as per yet if we visit go back and refresh you can see that a file has been created called names txt so we can click on it there's nothing in it at the moment so the next stage is to come down and what we need to do is to write some data to the file so we don't need to use a variable for this we've already created our hand or when a variable up here and it's really important to create this as a variable because when we want to write to the file we need to address the handle so I'm just going to type F right and use this function and in the brackets I want to write first of all the handle so I want to specify where I'm writing to so I want to write to names.txt and then I want to specify the data that I'm writing so I'm just going to type in Alex now what this is going to do is we're going to obviously reiterate the code this is going to run as well it won't duplicate obviously the file it will just create the same file and it will come and it will write Alex to it now if we come in and refresh and click on file now we go back and we click on names you can see that alex has been written now you may think oh now what we can do now is and even if we change this we want to say right Billy because we've still got this right and here all it's going to do is it's going to reopen the file and it's going to write again so unless we do something like the following bili like that every time we're going to be opening the file so now if we come back and click on file dot PHP and we go back again to names you can see that it's written two names now now say I want this on a line by line basis how do I go about this now you need to append on in it has to be it absolutely has to be double quotation marks and you do a backslash and an N and this creates a new line so now let's go back click on file up here again click on names and you can see that a new line exists between the end of this and the start of that so it's written to a new line so we can write as many names down this list as we want so these are the basics of writing to a file with PHP in some of the other lessons we're going to learn how to read data from a file and we can also mess around with showing it as a ray element so for example Alex would be an element in an array and Billy would be an element an array now one fun note just to just before we end the tutorial is the importance of the F close function and you need to specify in here the file you've already opened so we've opened handle here and closing the file just closes this connection with the file so it doesn't remain open so this just closed the file we can echo after here say written and let's go back click on file written we can go to names dot txt we can say these two names have already been written so in the next part of the that file the handling tutorials we're going to learn how to read from a file in fact we could probably learn I mean beforehand you might need to think about how you want to append to a file this is always going to open it and write the content here that you know it's going to sort of create a new file so even if names do exist within this if I was to under here open the file again and rewrite some names it would just erase everything so I think in the next tutorial we can look at appending data to a file
