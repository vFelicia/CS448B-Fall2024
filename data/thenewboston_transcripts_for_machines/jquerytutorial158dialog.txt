okay so the next thing I'm going to do is just a bit of animation so more aesthetic at the moment you notice that when I click the Save button this just appears there's no animation associated with it whatsoever what I'm going to now do is define the show option and we can do things like fade all the all the usual jQuery animations so you can go ahead and look these up but now when I click Save you can see that fades in as opposed to actually just appear so perhaps looks a bit nicer depending on the application that you're creating and we can choose more fun things like bounce if it's applicable to what you're trying to do you can see it just bounced in and now we can click OK I find this one to be a bit annoying but there you go it depends on what kind of application you're creating but by default it's just set to show so that means that it will just appear and nothing else now another important thing to look at is the modal option now modal is when you have a dialog box up here and this will become center stage almost and anything else will be disabled so at the moment for example if we were to click Save and it said settings are saved we might be able to then cap well we will be able to then carry on using the website as normal so let's say you had a variety of other buttons and menus the user would be able to carry on you know using your website and they would just be able to leave this dialog box open so what we can do is we can go ahead and we can set modal to false sorry to true and this will automatically allow or create the dialog box as the main window and we have to close that before we can do anything else it'll also apply a really nice background image to show this effect so it almost that's not worked so modal model it will set this nice background faded image and we can't actually click any other buttons so we've got our dialog box up and we hat we've got no choice but to click OK or close this off or any other buttons you might want to specify before we can return to our normal site and start to use some of the functionality so modal is a really great way of allowing this really quickly and also with this nice background image as well that doesn't allow them sort of simulates to the user that they're unable to use anything else on the website so the last option we're going to take a look at is the positioning of this window now you might want the window positioned in a particular place so I'm just going to use a comment here to separate and come down so it's a bit neater and I'm going to go ahead and set position now position can be textual with regards to giving it a single piece of text for example top if we were to set the position to top this would automatically appear at the top of the screen I could also then just change this to bottom and that would then appear at the bottom of the screen and the only problem with this is that we can't supply different parameters so we can't say top center for example or we can't say topleft this isn't gonna work it will return an error though it won't return narrow but it's not gonna allow us to work so you can either specify a single option so for example top or center which is set to by default anyway so that shouldn't really be too much of a problem but we can also go ahead and set numerical values so I could say 100 by 100 and this will space it from the top left hand corner or the left top hand corner of the page so now when i refresh and click Save you can see that's 100 by 100 away from the edge of the screen the very top hand corner of the screen so you can specify this any dimension you like and that will place that onto the page now alternatively if you wanted to use the top or the textual in conjunction with each other you can do this in an array so we can specify two different options for example if we were just if we were to supply top left now what's gonna happen here is this is gonna produce all this isn't going to work it's not gonna produce an error but this isn't gonna work and the reason being is that left is where we start the the very left hand side of the screen so down here what is essentially the yaxis we start up so when we supply top left it's not actually gonna work so let's go ahead and check that out you'll see that is it's just in the center steel so this is because we always start at the left hand side so we're positioning it at the left hand side and then we're positioning it at the top so if this isn't working for you and you're returning an error make sure you're supplying the the xdirection before you supply the ydirection so left is a is essentially translated into a coordinate of the xaxis left right or center and the Y is either top center or bottom so we need to supply the xaxis before we supply the Y so now I've put this position as left top you can see that we have it at the very top hand corner at the left so now that we've changed this positioning around it's worked so it's important to note things like this when you are writing your code okay so that's a bit about the jQuery dialogue the jQuery UI dialogue let's just go ahead and get rid of this for now and you can see that it's extremely easy to implement a dialogue and create the functionality you know geared towards the site that you're creating you see here we've created something that can't be moved and essentially is a prettier JavaScript dialogue instead we're using a div so the initial advice I gave about just keeping this dialogue as standard means that you could then go here and if you had another button down here you could then change the dialogue title and the dialogue text to suit you before you show it so you can apply this single div to a lot of other events as well so that's a quick demonstration and a bit about the options inside the jQuery UI dialog window
