what is up guys welcome to your sixth JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking to you guys about something called functions now a function is basically a mini program it's a mini program that you can use anytime you want throughout your javascripting for example if you're making YouTube they probably have a function to play the video whenever you hit the play button they have a function to pause the video whenever you hit the pause button they have a function a function to add add a vote to the thumbs up whenever you click the thumbs up button so as you can see a function can be called not only as soon as the web page loads but it can be called anytime you want so let's go ahead and make a function right now in order to make a function you first type the name oh let's give us some space type the name function this tells JavaScript all right we're about to make a function now after this you give a name to your function I'm going to name mine funky because this function is funky now after this you add two little parentheses I'm not going to be talking about these yet but these are called your parameters so we'll just ignore these for now until the next tutorial and then after these you add two little curly braces now inside the curly braces is where you're going to be putting all of your JavaScript code all of the code you put in here all the statements is the code that it's going to run whenever you want to use your function so if you're making that YouTube page whenever they clicked the play button you would play the video now so anyways you can see that this is the code that we want to happen whenever they call that function AKA whenever the user wants to use that function so let's go ahead and in our function we'll make it do something really simple let's go ahead and make a popup appear on our screen so making popups is really easy in JavaScript all you need to do is write the name alert and this means make popup on the screen now inside the parentheses for this you write what you want to appear in the box so just go ahead and write like ouch or something like that now whenever this function is used a popup is going to appear on our screen and it's going to say ouch so let's go ahead and well let's go ahead and use the function right now so in order to use a function you go ahead and write the name of your function funky and then you go ahead and write those parentheses which we don't know what they do yet but we'll be learning that in the next tutorial and then since this is a statement we go ahead and end it with a semicolon so anyways our our JavaScript is going to say all right we have a function right here prepare to use it whenever we call it so right here is when we call it and by the way like I said anytime I say call a function I mean use a function calling a function is just a technical term so use my function so is going to say all right call funky now so a popup is going to appear so let's go ahead and save this and see this baby in action as soon as we load our page it's going to call it bam look at that a popup appear here and it said ouch so let's go ahead and um maybe it will be easier to see if I actually add a button on the screen so you guys can see functions don't need to happen as soon as you load your page but whenever you need to call them so let's go ahead instead of just calling it right or right right away like right then let's go ahead and add a form on our page because if we add a form we can go ahead and add buttons so actually we need to do that outside the JavaScript since it isn't actually part of JavaScript it's actually part of xhtml so go ahead and add a form and end your form right here and inside your form you're only going to have one element the input and by the way if you have no idea what I'm doing right now go ahead and watch my xhtml tutorials I talk all about forms and stuff like that so the input the type of this is button it's just going to appear as a button on your screen the value is what you want to say on the button and it we'll just write touch me and there is another parameter that you can add to your buttons and that's onclick and inside or the value for onclick you go ahead and you write the name of your JavaScript function and I'm just going to go ahead and write funky because that's the name of the function so so anyways check this out if we go ahead and save this and launch it in Chrome we go ahead and we have a button on the screen that says touch me that's by default what's loaded on our web page but you can see we added a attribute to this function or excuse me this button called onclick funky that means whenever we click this button we want you to use a JavaScript function called funky so whenever we click this button an alert box is going to pop up that says ouch so let's go ahead and click this button and we see the alert box pops up and it says ouch press okay and that's it so that is the beauty of you know not only how to make buttons but also how you can call a section of JavaScript by using something called functions so anyways by default your web page loaded and it loaded this form with a button on it by default it did nothing but whenever we clicked it it said all right whenever you click me I'm going to call this function called funky so that means I'm going to go back up here and do whatever you told me to do inside so by the way the line of code inside your curly bracket is called the Declaration some people call it the body but I just call it whatever codes inside your curly bracket and that is the basics of how to create a function just go ahead and write the name function the name parentheses curly brackets and write your rules inside your function and also how to call a function fun whenever you want using a button or you can just call it automatically by writing the name of the function but anyways in the next tutorial I'm going to show you guys what these parentheses are and why they are useful and why most functions actually use those parentheses so anyways thank you guys for watching this tutorial thank you for learning the basics of a function if you don't quite understand just stick with me in the next tutorial everything will clear up for you so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys next video
