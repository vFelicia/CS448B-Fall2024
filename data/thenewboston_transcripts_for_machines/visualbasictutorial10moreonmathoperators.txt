hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and this tutorial we're going to take another look at math operators and some other things that you can do with it and stuff that I left out in the last tutorial so let's go ahead and get started here's our main cell right here inside of our module and we're just going to start off by creating a variable so we'll use the dim keyword to say that we're going to create a variable we'll give it a name which is my double then we use the add as keyword which tells the compiler that we're about to tell it what kind of data we want to use and we'll just do double now we'll set it equal to 11 now if we do console dot write line my double well this is going to do is just just going to print out the value 11 now if we come down here and change the value of my double we'll do my double equals my double plus 23 then we'll do console dot write line my double now if we run this we're going to get the values 11 and 34 but if we just take this line out right here hey let me copy this okay so if we take this line out right here and add the plus 23 into the arguments of console dot write line well this is going to do is it's going to print out 11 and 34 but the value of my double isn't actually changed so if we write out console dot write line my double again we're going to get the values 11 34 and 11 because we never changed the variable you can see it right there okay so now what we're going to do is I'm going to cover a bit of shorthand math so here let's type my double equals my double plus 23 which is what we just did now there's an easier way to do this whenever you want to add you to a variable that you have all you have to do is do this let's comment this out we'll do my double plus equals 23 so this tells the compiler that we want to take the variable my double and we want to add the value 23 to it and now if we just print that out again we're going to get the value 11 and 34 now let's go ahead and make a short little simple program here that's going to take our variable and it's going to track it throughout the changes that we made so let's take this line out right here and what we're going to do is we're going to use a string inside the arguments of console dot write line so we'll type initial value 11 and then we'll type new value and now to combine these two together we're just going to use the + sign so what this does is it takes the string that we've made and then it adds my double to it and what this is going to do is on the console what we're going to see is this these letters right here it's going to say initial value 11 new value 11 but since we don't know what the new value is going to be we're just going to use the + sign and print out my double which changes whenever we change it throughout the program and we don't have to know specific specifically what it's equal to so we'll just copy this string right here and we'll do one more action let's go ahead and do my double x equals 126 now whenever you do this right here you can use it with any other math operator you can divide you can subtract you can multiply you can add whatever you want so let's do console dot write line and then we'll take this right here we'll add it to the argument and then we'll print out my double with it so now if we run this we're going to get initial value 11 which is the initial value of my double the new value is 11 because we hadn't changed it yet in the code and then in the line down below that it's going to say initial value 11 new value 34 and then below that again it's going to say initial value 11 new value 4200 84 so that's just a simple program that will track a variable when we make changes to it and if you have any questions feel free to comment them I will be monitoring these videos and thanks for watching stay tuned for the next tutorial
