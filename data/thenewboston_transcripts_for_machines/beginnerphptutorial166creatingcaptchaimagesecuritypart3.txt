okay so you can see that we are generating at generating out some data and displaying these numbers that have been generated so let's refresh a couple of times and see if these change yet they are in fact changing now let's have a look at the width of the image so the width of the image is a bit off it's way too big so we need to decrease it by about half so let's go ahead and do that this is not really going to be much changes to be made so let's change that to 100 and come into refresh okay so that looks about right actually our image size our that's the problem because we might have a slightly longer characters so let's change this to 120 just to be safe maybe 110 so it's just a matter of fiddling around with things until you're happy so I'm quite happy with this now the only thing the only problem with this is that we need to generate some kind of noise and we need to generate something that masks these letters and is still readable by humans but might not be readable by a computer so let's come down to just after we set our text color because the function that we're going to be using is going to require a text color in there and the function that we're going to be using is image line and this image line function takes a few parameters I'll just explain the function before we continue the first one is the image that we're working with the second one is we need we need to specify x1 and y1 and x2 and y2 and then the text color so we've already got this variable defined here so this is even though it says text color where we're creating the lines to be black as well this is the exactly the same so these are just the coordinates that we're creating that so we want to do something we want to create coordinates that are completely random that so they're going to be splashed across our image so how can we do this well I'm going to create a for loop for this and we're going to loop a specific amount of times and we're going to generate for variables which is x1 x2 y1 and y2 and then what we're going to do is we're going to put these into the image line function in order to generate random lines with different coordinates that are going to be you know changing chopping and changing each time so we've created a for loop the skeleton for our for loop we're going to set the variable first of all which is X equal to 1 and then I'm going to say while X is smaller than or equal to let's give it a value about 34 now what this means is 30 lines are going to be generated because we're going to run this image line function inside our for loop so 30 lines are going to be generated remember we need to increment our x value each time so essentially what this does is it's going to loop 30 times this is this loops going to loop 30 times so for each 30 times that we loop we want to create a variable x1 y1 x2 oh and y2 and these are going to be equal to a random value okay so we need a random value for each one of these so again we can use make use of our round function as we did in here but this time we're going to be generating a number with a lower limit of a hump lower limit of one and an upper limit of a hundred so we can do that for each one I mean again you feel free to chop and change with these you can mess around with values depending on what kind of output you're looking for but for now this is going to generate a number between 1 and 100 and now down here we can apply that to our image line function so remember I said the first parameter is image width which is the image we're working with at the moment and then we're taking in x1 and then we need to take in x2 or y1 sorry and then I mean it doesn't really matter in the order that you put them in but I'm just adhering to the order in which this function takes parameters so the last one we need to put in is y2 and then obviously like I said before we need to define a color for these lines so you can feel free to choose your own colors but I'm just going to be creating this black because I feel it merges with the fun a lot better and this means that it's going to be a bit harder to read so we're inside our image we're creating a line so using the image line function in these coordinates which would tightly round them so it's going to splash them across our image and we create new in black so now let's go back and preview our image and see what it looks like okay so great what we're doing now is we're generating our random lines they're all across our image and it's quite hard to see the numbers but if you do look carefully you can still make them out I think this one is 3 9 it's either a 7 or 1 and 3 and some are going to be harder to read than others I think this is 6 4 double 1 so the point across it at the point of this is it's still human readable but by a computer standards it might be quite hard to read this because we've got these lines going across okay so what are we going to do next well we've generated everything here now what I want to do is just echo out on this page and we're going to come down here under our image and that's put a line break on the end of our image so we keep everything neat and tidy I'm going to echo out the secure session just to make sure that each time it matches what we have in our image so let's refresh now we've got eight seven five six here this looks like eight seven five and a six to me we've got nine one two five here so we've got gnome one to five that looks about right and two three seven nine so you understand the point of this is that we're just making sure that they match every time
