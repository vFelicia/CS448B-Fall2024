hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to look at some manipulation of element and we're going to be looking in particular with the append function now we're going to go ahead first of all we're simply going to create a small script that's going to append in a particular string of text or HTML string to a particular element so let's go ahead and create a paragraph and give this an ID I'm going to call this area and then up here I'm going to create a button so an input type button with the value append and we'll give this an ID as well so we can reference it when we catch the event I'm just going to call this a button okay so essentially what we want to happen is when we click on this button we want to append something to this area now this is obviously different to the HTML and the text functionality in jQuery where we actually append as opposed to replace the contents now towards the end of the tutorial we're going to take a look at appending to several different elements at once as well so this is just appending to this one element P this paragraph tag which is called area so before we do anything else let's go ahead and create a new file which is going to be our JavaScript file I'm going to call this append j/s I'm then going to go ahead and include it into my page so by typing out our script tags and this is text forward slash JavaScript and we obviously need to include the source which is Jay s /a pend j s so everything is now set up and we can go over to appendage a s and start to work on this now the main thing that we want to do is catch the click of this button using an event handler and then append something to this paragraph the contents of this paragraph in here so let's go ahead and first of all setup the event handler we're going to say button we're referencing with the hash box that's the ID of this button and then we're going to say dot click inside of here we need to create a function and then we come down and inside here we can start to append so every time we click on this button we want to append some text to this paragraph or the contents of this paragraph so we reference the paragraph as area and we just simply use dot append and then in here we can type in something we want to append so I'm going to choose just one and then a space afterwards so every time we click this button this action will be performed and it will append a one and a space onto the end so now that we're now browser let's just go and refresh the page now when I click append you can see that one has appeared inside of this paragraph now when I click it again you can see that the same thing happens and we have another one and we can just keep doing this and it will keep appending this value to this paragraph now what we can also do is we can reference this and actually generally add to an element so for example if I was to get rid of this P here and I was to create two or three of these down the page we could say perhaps give them the class of para just go ahead and copy that down there and we'll give this class a different name so we'll call it last so these are the first two paragraphs and this is the last one what we can then do inside appendage is is change this accordingly so we reference a class instead of the ID of the element so I'm just going to choose para now what's going to happen is we're going to append a one on to this paragraph and this paragraph however not this last paragraph so let's just take a look so I'm going to click append and you can see that we've got the first paragraph here the second paragraph here and the last paragraph which is called last these two have been called to append this value and therefore they both have the values appended each time we press the button okay so now that we've completed this example let's take a look at a slightly more interactive probably not useful but an interactive example the first thing I'm going to do is create an input field and this is going to be type text I'm going to give this an ID of name and then I'm going to create a button next to it and this is going to be called well this is a type button and the value of this is just let's say submit ok so inside here I want to create an ID attribute and I'm going to call this button and now what we want to happen is we want a sentence to be appended to so for example in this paragraph here which I'm going to call sentence I'm going to say your name is and I'm going to leave this part blank now what we can actually do is because there's already text inside of this paragraph when we use append we're just going to append a name onto the end of here so whatever the user types in here and then when they click the button it will append it onto the end so we've left a space just in here ok so let's go ahead and change this around so we've got button click we have the same event handler present we now just need to get rid of this we're going to create a new variable called name and we're going to make this equal to the value of our text field here which is called so hash named dot Val okay so now what we want to do is we want to append this name onto the end of this sentence so let's go ahead and reference the sentence div or paragraph sorry and then we want to say append name okay so now let's return to our browser when I go ahead and type my name in here and click Submit you can see that that appended on to the end of that string so it's extremely useful in this in with regard to if you wanted to build up data on a particular line if you wanted your user to build up specific data one example I can think of is if you were to create a calculator and you wanted a string of text to show the operation that is currently in progress so for example if there was a button on the page saying and a button saying 3 and a plus symbol you could say 2 plus 3 and you might want to just build up a string of the operation that the user is carrying out there's there's loads of cases that you'll probably come across to actually use the append functionality in jQuery however this is just a basic example to get you started
