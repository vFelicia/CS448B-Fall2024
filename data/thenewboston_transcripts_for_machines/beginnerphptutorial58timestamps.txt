hello this is Alex from PHP academy' and this is a video tutorial created for the new Boston now in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about time stamps in PHP now time stamps are a widely used standard that has been utilized by PHP in order to keep track of the current time the current day and in fact we have functions that can retrieve say a date and a week or so or we could go with just things like that now a time stamp is a numerical value of the amount of seconds so it's an integer value of the amount of seconds from the first of January 1970 so for an example let's just echo out time we're going to echo out time and this is a function that returns the current unix timestamp so let's come into our page here and refresh and we can see that we're giving given a large integer value now this value here that you see is in fact the amount of seconds from the first of January 1970 now if you watch carefully at the end here we've got 75 let's refresh the page and see what changes you can see it's changed to 90 now if we do that again we're going to 94 and if I gradually refresh it say every one second you can see that this value keeps incrementing so it's really useful to keep track of the amount of seconds or sorry of the current time depending on you know the account depending on how you process this value at the moment if I was to say I uploaded a file or a process to comment or I just did anything on a webpage that would require me or the functionality would be there to tell me when I did it for example let's say I did post a comment I might want to create my website to show when the comment was posted now if you were showing you used as this value they wouldn't really make much sense of it I could say for example the echo the current time is um and then I append the time on to the end of that if i refresh and this is really onions not userfriendly at all because what we're doing is we're showing we are showing the time in terms of from a certain day in it within seconds we're not actually displaying in a human readable form so how can we how can we change this well let's just get rid of that for now and let's go up here and create a variable called time and give it the current timestamp now down here what we can actually do is we can create a new variable called actual time and we can proce this process this using the date function now the date function works with x as well and it takes two arguments the first argument is how you want it to be displayed that will go in here and we have keys of different things to use this and then the second argument is the is a timestamp so I'm going to type in time which is obviously our current timestamp here so I'm using this date function to process our timestamp and show it correctly so obviously after this we wrap we're going to show the actual date so we can append that on there now at the moment nothing is going to happen if we refresh you can see that it's blank because we've taken the timestamp but we haven't actually processed it in a way now the most common way would be to do H a small I and a capital s this is just the way I always do it I prefer now this is the hours this is the minute and this is the seconds so we can put a colon in between each one let's refresh and you can see that what's happened oh no what's happened okay yet that's because I've actual date instead of actual time there that's my variable naming wrong there so let's refresh we'll see what's happened well we've got s T there oh that's it sorry that's a small X refresh so okay now we're showing the current time is 2014 34 and if I look at my clock on my computer right now that you can't see I know that that's correct so if i refresh you can see that this time will increase and as we come into the 50s we see this time start to increase and go up and then instead of just showing the normal boring seconds that we've shown before in the timestamp you can see this changes according to according to the time Stan that's dynamically updating because the seconds are increasing so we can format this in any way you like if you go over to the PHP manual and search for the function date you'll you'll be shown lots of examples of how to format this now what we can also do in here is we can include the date itself so you can do something like a capital D so we could say D and Y so this is going to show you the date the month and the year because obviously using a time stamp we can work out what the day is the month and the year as well so if i refresh that you can see it's coming up with Friday April 2011 so I can change this again I can put say a small D and a small M and what this is going to do is this could this is just going to process it slightly differently and show it a numerical format so there's a lot there's lots you can do I'm not going to cover everything that you can type in here in every way but what we could also do is we could say D my and we'll just change this to make sure it makes sense time or the date time and then I could say at H I sorry H PI s the code the colons in here are just for display purposes so this now reads the current date time is Friday April 2 eleven at to zero or 816 and 31 seconds so by doing this I have taken a time stamp which originally we let's just kill the page there originally we found hard to understand because it's just an amount of seconds however PHP has some really useful functionality in order for us to turn this into a readable date so that's basically what a time stamp it is that's how you use it in PHP and like I said if you go over to the PHP manual and search for the date function you'll have a lot more that I have a lot more options there that you can format the date and time in
