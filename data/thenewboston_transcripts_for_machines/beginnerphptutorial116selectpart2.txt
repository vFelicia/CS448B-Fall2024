so if the query is a load of rubbish and doesn't make sense even if it does return it wouldn't return because it would fail but query success doesn't necessarily mean it's returned any rows it just means that it's structured properly and its end is run correctly so let's just test this first of all you'll see that we've got all query failed okay so let's see what could be wrong okay I've included this extra comma here which I didn't mean to so now let's refresh query success but now you can obviously see if we do something like an extra comma or say we don't include an extra apostrophe on there we'll return a query failed so you'll know now if your query has worked or not what you can also do is if the query has failed you can return the specific error so what we can do is echo MySQL and error and that is of query run so what we can do is we can refresh and this is a success however if we do something like add an extra comma in and we refresh we get this my sq oh no not valid okay yeah sorry umm there we go so you don't need to supply an argument in here it's just my skew our error and what this will do is this will pick up the error from the last query run so else echo MySQL error now let's read this you have an error in your SQL syntax check the manual that corresponds near corresponds to your MySQL server version for the right syntax to use near from food order by ID so that's the rest of it so what we can determine is just before from food we've got this comma so we can delete that we can refresh and our queries worked so now that our queries worked we need to grab the data of our query and display it so the best way to do this would be to use a loop because we have multiple rows to return if you look we've got pizza and salad query is just going to return if you would just echo out the values it's just going to return one of the rows but what we want to do is we want to return all of the rows so we do this using a while loop and inside our condition for the while loop we need to reassign avere or we need to assign a variable and we need to create an associative array from our results now remember an associative array and contains a key which is in a textual form and a value in this case a little and an associative array return from this the keys will be ID food calories and healthy and unhealthy or in the case of our query we're just selecting food and calories so our associative array will contain the key food and calories and the value will be each one of these so what will be this one first then this one so we can then return them in a loop so what I want to do is I want to say while row equals mysql fetch it's said a sock I guess but we're actually this is actually short for associative so my SQL fetch associative and we reference the query that's been run so we've executed our query here here what we're doing is grabbing an associative array of our data and assigning it to the array and it's named row okay well you can call this query row so query row is now an array because we've grabbed our data from our query as an associative array and put it into this variable okay so now let's see what happens when we run the code and it will be nothing so nothing's happened so we haven't failed but we've created this while loop in which we can echo out the data from each row now how do we do this usually for best practice I reassign the variables so what I do is I say food equals and I own we need to now take an element of the array so we need to say query row food and I'll do calories and then I'll explain this okay so we've got a variable now called food and we've got a variable called calories and they're both equal to the reference of this array remember using square brackets and because it's an associative array array we're taking the value from the field name food and the field name calories so this food here and this calories here correspond to this and that the first time around this loop food is going to equal pizza and calories is going to equal 1,000 the second time around this loop remember cuz we're using a while loop food is going to be equal to salad and then calories is going to be equal to 200 so all we do now let's run it first to make sure we don't have any errors always good to check as we go along note no errors returned so let's say echo food a break in fact no we can say food has calories so we're just basically concatenated on text between our variables so and then we can break down so the first time around the loop we're going to say food has calories calories so this will be pizza has 1000 calories the second time around the loop we say salad has 200 calories so let's just test it out and see if everything's working okay so now for the first time that you can you can see that the query has returned the data we're looping through each of the rows that have been returned by our query and we're echoing out the results so now essentially what we've done is taken data from our database via PHP now what we can do is change our query round slightly so we can retrieve different information so for example at the moment this is pizza first then salad now what happens if I want to order it by ID as we've already seen I want salad to come first then piece I want the last added row to come first so that's simple we just modify our query up here order by ID descending so we're ordering in descending value let's come back to our PHP page and refresh and you can see oh no we've got an error so okay order by oh yes sorry of okay I've duplicated this we've ordered by ID but we want to order now by descending so order by your ID descending let's refresh
