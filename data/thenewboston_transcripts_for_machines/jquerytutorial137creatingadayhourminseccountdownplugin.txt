okay so what we're gonna need is an if statement or a shorthand if statement for each value and we want to check if the length of it doesn't equal two and if the length doesn't equal two we want to append a number in front for example if we were to say if the length of days doesn't equal two which it doesn't we want to add a zero in front of here so it'll show zero one days it just adds a bit more structure but obviously this at this point it's optional let's go ahead and do this anyway so what I want to do is I want to redefine each variable so I'm gonna say days equals and then here's going to be my condition so I'm gonna say string days we're converting days which remember at the moments an integer to a string and then we're using dot lengths to check the length of it so if this doesn't equal two I want to go ahead with a question marks the first option so if this if this statement evaluates to true I want to go ahead and say days is equal to zero plus days else using a colon I just want days to equal days so we're just reassigning the same value so you might may have seen something like this if you've studied other languages are the programming languages it's just a way to say days if days if the length of this or if this conditions evaluates to true then this value here will be assigned to days otherwise this value here will be assigned to days so we can do this for each one so we've got days hours equals and the same thing string hours dot length doesn't equal two if it doesn't equal two we append a a zero onto the front of ours otherwise ours is just step back to ours and the same with minutes we say mins equals convert temporarily mins to a string check the length doesn't equal two if the length doesn't equal two we have a zero appended on two mins otherwise we had just have mins and the same for seconds we convert seconds to a string we check the length a story check the length against minus 2 and if it is we just go ahead and pop it and see it right in front of seconds otherwise it just stays a seconds so quite straightforward here let's go ahead and just test this when i refresh you can now see that we've got oh ok so let's just take a look at what we've done oh okay sorry the the countdown here as obviously as it reached now hasn't let's just have a look them I'll right okay so I called this minutes and this seconds and let's just realign these up so the wrong variable names obviously there we can just go ahead and correct this so minutes and seconds and the same with this minutes and seconds okay and the last one seconds right okay so we've obviously got days hours minutes and seconds being reassigned depending on their length and we're adding a trailing or a leading zero if not so now you can see that we've got one day which is 01 now 21 hours which is two characters so we haven't appended on a zero to the front or prepended a zero we've got two minutes which does how many have one character so we've prepended on a zero here and then the seconds work in exactly the same way as when they get down to like for example the number 9l which we'll see in just a moment we then can see that it will add to zero on so that's all that this does obviously it's optional depending on how you want to display it but if you want to sort of keep the same size elements this is really useful because you're keeping the same size depending on how these change if for example 22 seconds comes down to nine seconds in a moment this will shift everything inward if you didn't have the prepended zeros so it just makes it look a lot cleaner as well and it maintains the same thing so you can see there it's just changed and it hasn't shifted everything inwards okay so now what we want to focus on is checking whether this date is a number or not because remember we're converting a string based date here to a timestamp so what we want to do is if if it's not a number we don't want to display anything we want just you know not do anything we're not gonna give an error I mean we could give an error but we're just gonna want to not do anything so for example at the moment if I go to ext Deus and just change this I'll just type Alex and capitals in the middle of this when i refresh you can see that we've got n a n n a n n a n and n am for not a number because this has had a problem converting with Alex into a timestamp so what we want to do is before we display everything here we want to say if not is n a n so if this if something inside of this bracket is not a number which is event date then we want to display this so if it's not not a number which means if it is a number we could even go as far as pulling this up to up to here I guess yeah I suppose we could actually that would probably be the correct way to do this and let's just go ahead and undo all of that so I'm gonna say a just up here I'm gonna say if not is not a number event or settings event Oh an actual fact now we need to convert the value beforehand to check whether as a number so what would is we'll just keep it down here we use slightly more processing power before we actually work out if it's not a number
