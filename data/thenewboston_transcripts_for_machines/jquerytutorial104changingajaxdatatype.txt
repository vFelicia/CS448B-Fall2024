hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston now in previous videos we have looked into the Ajax function not as much as possible because there are many many many you know many sort of things based around this this this request there are so many different ways to use it and so many different things we can do with it however for now we've looked at enough so we can actually post data to a page retrieve pages load files etc now one thing that I haven't mentioned is the ability to change the the method I guess as you'd call it in a form an HTML form and this is how the data is sent so we can actually change the way this data is sent from when we pick it up in for example page PHP at the moment I've just created a name variable from a well taking a value from a text field and I'm posting this to page dot PHP the data that I'm supplying is name equals and then I'm supplying this name that has been typed now this will automatically be sent as get data so it will automatically using get data here to post this to page dot PHP therefore inside for example page dot PHP we would have to use dollar underscore get and the name to retrieve this value here however what we can do is we can change the type of request inside of our Ajax request altogether so this is quite simple what we need to do is just come up here and as one of the parameters that we specify to this request we can just specify a type parameter and then obviously we comma seperate is now this can either be get or it can be post so now that we've changed this to post this variable here which almost looks like a get variable I guess will actually be sent as post data so if you're using the age to request and you are we need to send large amounts of data all you need to protect page dot php' against people changing you know values in the URL obviously it's not completely protected because if people can see the variables that you're sending that will always be able to send data there themselves however for these I guess two reasons and they're probably a few others you can change the type to post so with the Ajax request not only can you just default and get you can change type to post to send this same data so you don't there's no need to change the way this data is displayed you can then go on to send additional data so text equals hello for example using an ampersand here there's no need to change that at all it will this line here will handle the type of request so you know so it actually changes the request type then when you go ahead and pick it up in PHP you can go and use dollar underscore post instead
