hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to create a favourite viewer now this is going to be spread out into a bunch of different tutorials because this is a fairly large application compared to what we've made so far but compared to all of the apps this is pretty light so like the paint program that we created a couple tutorials ago this comes directly from beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by Theron Willis and Brian Newsome now I don't take any credit for this all the credit goes to them I'm just walking you guys through the program and teaching you what it does so you can understand it so let's go ahead and create a new project select a windows forms application and call yours favorites viewer now I'm just going to add YouTube at the end of this because I've already created a favorites viewer and while we're waiting for that to load I just want to apologize for any background noise and there's nothing I can really do about that so let's set the file name instead of form or dot VB we'll call it viewer VB so it's easier to use and work with and form one is kind of hard to know where it is and you want to use names that are easy for you to recognize and know what they are so we'll set the title of it to my favorites and we'll come up here and we'll set the icon to that same star icon that we used in our FTP download now the reason we use it in the FTP downloader is because we didn't have any other icons we could use so we just use one that we could find now this star is actually made for favorites so we have my favorites now let's come down here and it will set the size of this so we want to set it to 470 pixels by 300 pixels so now that we've done that let's go ahead and we will set we will add a list view control now don't get this confused with a list box so here's our list view and we need to anchor it to the top the bottom the left and the right so we will find anchor and we'll just anchor it to all of those okay let's see where were we so let's go ahead and select our list view and let's rename it so it's easier to use later on so we'll call it list favorites and we'll go ahead and press Enter now what we need to do is we need to dock this to the sides of the form so we'll go ahead and just dock it to the top and we'll drag it down to about right there that looks good so let's come over here and we'll add some columns to it so we will set we will add one we'll set the name of it to header name go ahead and click OK and then we will set the text do name so let's find the text here and let's go ahead and add one more so we'll set this one to header URL so this is this is going to hold the URL of our favorite so we'll set the text of this to URL now let's set the width of each of these so set the width of this one to 220 and we'll set the width of this one to 220 so it's going to be cut in half so go ahead and click OK and you can see that it hasn't shown up yet so what we need to do is we need to come down here and set view to details and you can see here that our columns will show up show up where we have the name and the URL so we can just make the URL a little bit bigger okay so now let's set full row select equal to true so what this means is that let's find a here first full row select is going to be equal to true so if we select an item over here in name it will also select the corresponding item in URL so now let's come over here to our toolbox and we will add a link label so we'll set the name of this to link URL so link URL and we will anchor it to the bottom of the left and the right now let's go ahead and hit enter there and now we need to do is we need to align the text to middle left so we'll set the text line to middle left okay so your program should look something like this by now and if it doesn't you may want to move back and find out where you messed up and once you've got this created go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
