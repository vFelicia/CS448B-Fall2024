okay so today we're going to switch from talking about um right circular cylinders to talking about a pyramid and the volume lateral area and total area of a p pyramid so the volume of a pyramid is equal to 1/3 the area of the base time height so if you remember the area of a base of a pyramid is equal to length * width * height so for this pyramid we have 1/3 our length of the base which is four our width of the base which is also four times the height now remember this height is really important that you remember it's the height perpendicular to the center of the base it's the one that goes It goes up from this point to the point on the base so our height for this is six so 1/3 4 * 4 is 16 * 6 16 * 6 is 96 so 1/3 * 96 and that actually goes in perfectly and you get V is equal to 32 and pretend this said inches it' be 32 in cubed because cuz remember we're in we're talking about volume and volume is always a threedimensional measurement so okay so now we're going to talk about lateral area now our lateral area is equal to 1 12 the perimeter of the base times the slant height because when we find our lateral area we're finding everything but the area of the base so each one of these triangles right here we're finding the area of so there are four triangles we're finding the area of so we're going to take 1/2 the perimeter of the base which is 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 times the slant height now remember the slant height is is not the same as the height we use to solve volume our slant height is the height that is goes from the top of the pyramid down one of the triangles and is perpendicular to one side of the square so we're told that our slant height is 7 so times 7 so our lateral area is equal to 1 12 3 + 3 is 6 + 3 is 9 + 3 is 12 12 * 7 well 1 12 of 12 is equal to 6 so 6 * 7 is equal to 42 so if this said cenm this would be 42 cm squared because when we talk about area we're always in a twodimensional measure and last we have our total area now when we found our lateral area we just found the area of each one of these triangles now this time we're finding our area of this entire shape so we're going to take our lateral area which is 12 the perimeter of the base times the slant height plus our base area which is equal to length time width so total area of this is 1/2 the perimeter of the base which is 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 so 1 12 24 times our slant height which I don't know if you can see it or not but it's right here it's already been drawn in for us and they tell us it's four so times 4 plus length * width 6 * 6 so our total area is equal to 1 12 of 24 which is 12 * 4 + 6 * 6 so 12 * 24 is 48 + 6 * 6 is 36 and if we add those together we'll get 84 Pretend This said cenm cm squared because area is always a twodimensional measurement so that's actually all we're going to do for pyramids today but make sure you come back and watch our next video where we're going to talk about the right circular cone and we actually didn't get into a lot of this into intro to Geometry so be ready to learn a lot
