hello this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with another video for the new Boston now in the last video we talked about arrays in this video we're going to be looking at associative arrays now associative arrays store data in the same way but allow you to change the key from 0 1 2 3 4 however many keys you have to a name of your choice so first of all and this is from the prior example I'm just going to do this now as it stands we've got an array set up with four different types of food in so we've got pasta pizza salad and vegetable which turns out to vegetables so at the moment this is key 0 this is key 1 this is key to and this is key 3 now I want to store some useful information about this at the moment we've just stored like this ok it's not very useful and as it stands and obviously if we want to list this food then it is useful however I want to add some elements to this array that are could be used in say a specific in reallife environment now what I want to do is I want to rather than have this as the value I want to assign a value to pasta of the amount of calories that you might find in it the same with pizza the same with salad and then lastly the same with vegetables so I want to assign a value and to assign a value to this key remember this isn't a value anymore I'm going to say equals and then a greater than sign and I'm going to add a certain amount of calories that this can be equal to so pasta we might say and 300 calories Pizza we're going to say equals and greater than might be a thousand calories salad we might say is equal to let's say 50 calories in fact now that's not really realistic 150 calories and then vegetables I'll say you equal to 50 now if you carefully watch remember using our commas after this we're assigning this all in one and then it's separated by commas if you watch carefully and how this will change and I'll tell you how this will change before it does now this zero is going to change to pasta and then this equals and grater and sign is going to tell us how many calories here and the same with the pizza salad and the vegetables so if i refresh you can now see that pasta is equal to 300 Pizza is equal to a thousand salad is equal to 150 and vegetables is equal to fifty so our key of pasta is holding a value of 300 our key of Pizza is holding a value of a thousand our key of salad is holding a value of 150 and our key of vegetables is holding a value of 50 so now what we can do is instead of accessing let's just comment this out as before we accessed array element like this we used 0 1 2 so if you imagine this would be 0 this will be 1 this would be 2 this would be 3 now if I was to try and access say element 0 that's past of 300 calories and when you refresh the page you can see nothing's happened now why is nothing happened because the key of 0 doesn't technically exist anymore at least well view in actual fact this has now become an associative array because we're associating pasta with a value of 300 so now if we echo out the food the contents of pasta with in this food array will now retrieve the value 300 the same as if we were to echo out the calories in pizza this will then equal 1,000 so you can see that we've now created an associative array we're associating values to different different keys and it's by Association so you can understand now why it's called an associative array so this is a best way in PHP especially when you deal with databases later on these if you've worked with databases before and you know what fields are or column column names are sorry you'll have you'll have the option to use an associative array when you gain data from a database so associative arrays are really really good to use especially when you don't want to remember you know 0 1 2 3 because that can be a bit annoying but yeah that's basically associative arrays in PHP
