all right guys in this video I just want to show you a few other things that you can do with shell scripting and I don't want to get real in detailed because again this series is just for Linux and shell scripting there is a lot to cover so for now I just want to give you guys the basics and show you guys that shell scripts do exist and you know just a couple cool things that you can do with it so if you guys are familiar with programming you probably know about if then else statements and you know all that good stuff so if you want to use if statement in Shell scripting then what you do is you can do this and I'll also show you guys how to use parameters which is that other optional information that you can use whenever you're running commands so for the first parameter I'll just check if it's equal to like a hot dog whatever and then if you write then on the next line if the parameter equals hot dog then we can just you know do whatever we want to do like you um type hot hot dog now you can also add an else condition and for this else condition you can just say Echo out um uh I don't know this is going to be the dumbest thing ever like uh you did not type hot dog and we can actually use that parameter again so whatever they typed we can get that information from them so I'll just Echo something like it was and this is actually kind of weird how you use them uh dollar sign one so that's how we're going to interpret it now at the end just write fi so make sure you save it and I know I'm going over all of this real quick but again I just want to give you guys a real uh basic overview of this not go into anything in Real uh you know grave detail so bash Bucky let's just go ahead and add hot dog first and it's going to say you typed hot dog now since we added that else condition we can type anything else like tunafish hit enter and it says you did not type hot dog it was tuna fish so this is a really simple explanation of how you can get your shell script to make some really basic decisions now there's also I'll just show you guys the last thing um Loops since any like even simple programming demonstration I feel the need to cover Loops so I'll say something like for string I'll say for X in uh like uh dog cat fish and I'll just write do Echo X so at the end of this I'm just going to write down and this is just going to Loop through this so in this series dog cat and fish and actually I can't use cat because that um so I'll write um like I don't know elephant like it was that hard to think of an animal all right so for this series right here it's going to Loop through each one and tree each element as X now for each of those elements it's just going to print it out on the screen and the reason that I couldn't use cat because remember whenever we use cat it's a keyword that's built into Linux for displaying stuff on the screen so we can't use builtin keywords or it'll throw it and remember to save it again and Bash Bucky boom roasted dog elephant fish so that is your really like the shortest tutorial on shell scripts that you have probably ever watched but that's the basics of it that's what you can do with it and in the next video I'm going to show you a much better way to automate Linux Comm F and that is through the use of python I cannot wait I will see you guys then
