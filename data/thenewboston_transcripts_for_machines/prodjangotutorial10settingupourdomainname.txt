already I'll welcome back and in this video we are going to be setting up a domain name for our front end because remember in the last well not the last video but a few tutorials ago what we did is we deployed our front end and we pretty much saw how to host the website from S3 and set up our CDN as well however with that we just got this long honkintalking Cloud for a kind of default domain name and in this video like I said we're going to be figuring out how to use our own domain name so the users don't get carpal tunnel trying to type this thing in each time so anyways go ahead and head over to the cloud front distribution that you set up and you can just go ahead and click into it and on just the general tab you're going to see this little section right here which is your domain name and just go ahead and click this icon to copy that and from here we're going to head over to Route 53 and hopefully you already got a um you already like bought a domain name in uh of course you're going to need the domain name to actually set it up I am going to be using this one right here vitaxia.io now what you are probably going to see let me minimize that is you may have in a record already so if you don't you're just going to need to create one but if you do go ahead and select that and we're going to edit it right here now typically these a records uh they point to an IP and this could either be a ec2 instance or an elastic IP but what we are going to want to do is kind of change this default configuration where instead of this we are going to use an alias and what we want to do is we want to I'll show you this route traffic 2 and for the endpoint we want to choose an alias to a cloudfront distribution and then for the distribution we're just going to go ahead and paste in what we have now another thing that I want to know is that remember when I said click that copy icon and we're going to use that value right here whenever you copy this it included this https colon forwards S4 slash but whenever you paste it in here make sure not to include that part so it's pretty much going to be that value that you copied without that and then once that is all good to go just go ahead and hit save so now your a record should look like this so the taxi i o pointing to our cloudfront distribution without that https so now this is all good go for the time being now hop back into that cloudfront distribution and then from here go ahead and click edit and what we want to do is look for this section alternate domain name cname and we pretty much just need to link it up to the domain name that we got so that is vitaxia dot IO now what we also need to do is we're gonna need to set up a certificate so we can serve our site over https so from here I'm going to go ahead and hit request certificate and then yes it is a public certificate go ahead and hit the next and for this fully qualified domain name butaxia.io and for this validation method make sure that you choose DNS validation I'm going to show you how easy it is to set up pretty much AWS has builtin tools to take care of all this it's going to be a piece of cake and all of this is good by default can just go ahead and hit request right here and now let me close out all these prompts taking off like half my screen here alright so in a little bit you can see you may have to refresh it as well but you should see that this is set up pending validation and what this pending validation means is that yes you requested a certificate but we aren't sure that you actually own that domain name yet now in order to kind of prove that we do we need to set up something with our DNS configuration however like I said AWS is going to take care of this so let me show you how to do it right now so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click into this and then what I'm going to do from here is I'm going to hit create records in Route 53 and actually let me show you kind of what's going on behind the scenes so in a new tab again I didn't close out of this one but I want to show you in a Route 53 if I go back into vitaxia.io you see that I have three records right here in a and NS in in SOA well whenever I hit this button right here which is create record in Route 53 I just need to verify this hit create record then what it's going to do and I probably have to refresh this is you see we now have a new record right here and this is pretty much um kind of to this like certificate management process how we can prove that we own this domain name and it pretty much does this by saying that if I was able to create this record and modify this domain name in this kind of way then of course it acts as proof because you know I have access to this domain name so anyways that's kind of the process behind the scenes and I just thought it was uh cool to let you know that but anyways that's really all we have to do for this and just to make sure this is all good I want to refresh this and all right so I paused the video and came back because it did take like a minute and I I don't know just didn't think it was a very entertaining just to watch me refresh this for another minute but eventually after like 30 seconds or a minute go ahead and keep refreshing and eventually you're going to see that it is now issued which means that yes it was uh verified you own the domain name you're good to go and now once you see the screen check mark head back into your cloudfront distribution settings in here where we just came from uh under this custom SSL certificate option we can just go ahead and refresh this list by clicking this button and now you should see your certificate right here so this is my new one that we just set up and all of these defaults are good to go just go ahead and hit save changes now and then we also need to wait probably a minute or so for this to deploy however at the end of that all right so that actually only took like 20 seconds or so but we can now see if we go to vitaxia.io it now is pretty much pointing to our cloudfront distribution and also you can see by this little lock icon and this https it is now served over SSL and yeah everything is uh good to go so that ladies and gentlemen is how you set up your domain name to point to your Cloud friend distribution set up your domain name for your front end and yeah so uh thanks for watching and I'll see you next time
