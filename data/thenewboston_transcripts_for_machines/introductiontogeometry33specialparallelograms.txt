So today we're going to focus on rectangles rhombuses and squares which are all special kinds of parallelograms so for each one of these the rules of a parallelogram also apply so opposite sides are still congruent opposite sides are still parallel opposite angles are congruent and consecutive angles are supplementary so each one of those things is still true but there's also more to them so a rectangle is a parallelogram with four right angles so that means in a rectangle every one of its angles are congruent not just opposite angles so all angles are congruent with their measure equal to 90Â° because they're right angles so di diagonals of a rectangle are congruent which is a new thing before we just knew that they cut each other in half now for a rectangle we know that they're congruent so for a Romus it's a parallelogram with four congruent sides so opposite sides are still congruent but it just means consecu consecutive sides are also congruent and the diagonals are perpendicular which means when they intersect each other they form a right angle so they form four triangles when you draw both Di in they form four right triangles on the inside of the rhombus so last we have a square and a square is a parallelogram with four right angles and four congruent sides so basically a square is a combination of a rectangle and a rhombus so because it's a combination of a rectangle and a rhombus everything that's true for a rectangle and true for a rhombus is true for a square so these diagonals are congruent so they have equal length and they're perpendicular to one another so when you write the diagonals of a square in they're going to form four right triangles that are also congruent on the inside of the square so now we're going to do some true or false questions so a square is a rectangle and a rhombus well if we if we go back to what a square is it has four right angles which is true of a rectangle and it has four congruent sides which is which is true of a rhombus therefore number one is true so number two a rhombus is always a square if we go back a rhombus is a parallelogram with four congruent sides but a square has four congruent sides and four right angles so number two is false a rectangle is also a square if we go back and look at what a rectangle is it's a parallelogram with four right angles but a square also has to have four congruent sides so a rectangle is not also a square so make sure you come back and watch the next video where we talk about other kinds of parallelograms called a trapezoid
