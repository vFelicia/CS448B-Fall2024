so what we want to do is inside style.css we want to create a new class called border and this is going to essentially just contain CSS that would outline a thin black border on this element then what we're going to do is as we draw as we hover over this we're going to change the border of this to black and then it will make it look a bit more like we're able to drop something so this border class here is just going to be border one pixel it's going to be solid and black so now that we've got this class set up with a border of one pixel solid and black we can apply it into here so I'm just going to write border okay so now as we drop any element over this drop droppable div the class of it will be added the border class will be added to it so let's go ahead and test this when we drag over you can see that the border changes so now it looks more like that we can actually you know we can like you know it's more feasible that you could drop something into this box than if nothing changed at all so it works as you hover out as you come out as well so it's only as we're hovering over this that we actually get this this border appear okay so now that we've created this we need to find a way of creating a tolerance as to when this is actually classed as hovering over and is has the ability to drop inside so at the moment we have the default tolerance set however what we're going to do is change this so I'm gonna create a new option tolerance and this is going to be equal to either fit intersect pointer or touch so the fit let's go through the first option or the value for this first option is fit now fit means that the the draggable which is this here has to completely be inside of this div here so as at the moment you can see that supposed to drag it from here as my cursor reaches the first part of this element or sorry the middle of this the middle of this draggable object reaches the first part of this element that's overlapped by at least 50% and that's the intersect option so that's the default option so at the moment 50% and it looks true and it looks droppable so fit will mean if we refresh that we can that we notice now that we have to have the whole of the element inside of this innate to be able to drop it so it works I guess a bit better you could say a bit more sort of like naturally as we fit the whole of the element inside that then means that we're able to drop it inside so that's the fit as I showed as I said before intersect is the default it works exactly the same way so at least 50% of it inside means that it's droppable let's look at the next option which is pointer and this is when the amount the mouse pointer itself overlaps the dropper ball so if I grab this element from the very end and force that in as soon as my mouse pointer enters this div that means that it is droppable so I could do it from the front or there take it there and drop it just in like that so that's the pointer value for this tolerance option we've also got touch which is when the element that you are dragging touches it by any amount whatsoever so this is somewhat of a you know you could regard it as somewhat of an illogical choice to make however you want to create something that feels natural to both yourself and your user and that you think will be beneficial when you're drag dragging and dropping objects so that is the tolerance personally I prefer the pointer because the user generally tends to look at their pointer as their point of dropping something in and for me it just feels a lot more natural when you you know as soon as your pointers inside somewhere that means that you can drop it so for now we'll leave this tolerance as pointer okay so the last thing we want to go ahead and look at is the accept option and we're going to have to change a few things around for this now accept looks like this it's just the option name is accept and we can we can provide a particular group of objects by class that we want to allow to be dropped into here so for example let's go ahead and change this span from drag me and let's create a few more names but first of all I'm going to give this a class of name and I'm going to copy this and paste that down and I'm gonna enter say Alex in there and Billy in there just put a slash after that and then the last one I'm gonna give a class of place and I am going to write London so now we have something that looks like this at the moment nothing is dragging at all because we haven't picked up on this in UI j s here however we're going to be changing that around in just a moment so this is our drop area it's remained the same however what we want is only specific elements based on the class so name or place to be allowed to dropped in drop inside here now you might be wondering why we do this now let's just say you had particular elements you wanted in particular boxes for example you might have another div next to this one
