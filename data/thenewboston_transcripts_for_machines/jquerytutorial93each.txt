hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston now in the last video looking at some of the jQuery utilities with regards to functions we looked at in array and this checked whether a particular value was present in an array in this video we're going to take a look at inserting values into arrays using just the standard JavaScript just standard JavaScript and not a jQuery and not the jQuery library but we're also going to be looking at the each utility or the each function and this will loop through element in an array and we're gonna just display them out on took you know area on our page so the first thing I want to go and do is just modify this form that we used in the last tutorial if you haven't already seen this tutorial all we have is an input box where we can type a user's name and then we have a button that in the last tutorial we use to check if this was in a particular array now what we're gonna do instead is change this value here just to insert and we're gonna allow the user to enter a name into this text box and then pop that into an array or push this into an array and then we're gonna be looping through the results and just displaying them out so they'll get instant feedback so let's go ahead and change this to insert as well as the value as well I'm gonna go ahead and create a just a div content area down here where we can list out these names and I'm just going to call that names so we've got util jeaious which i've included on my page and we can start writing out code in here the first thing I'm gonna do as with the majority of code you're right is document dot ready and inside here we'll have a function which we will then just pull down and inside here is all the code that we're going to use when the document is loaded okay so the first thing we want to go ahead and just and do is just outline a function that's going to loop through the the values in a particular array so I'm just gonna define this function and we're not going to fill it in just yet so the function is going to be called display oh right and underneath here I want to be able to check whether the insert button has been clicked so I'm going to go ahead and set up an event handler for our insert button so we use a ID selector to select insert and then we say dot click and then inside there we create our function and we just pull that down now just up here after the function definition and before this event handler I'm gonna go ahead and a create a an array called names I'm gonna just put three values into this so one two three and the first one just Alex Billy and then Dale so we now have this names array so what we want to do is when the user clicks insert we want to retrieve the value let's just refresh we want to retrieve the value from here put that into an array and then we're going to use our function to just list everything in the array down here on a line by line basis so the first thing we want to do inside of our click function is grab the name so I'm going to create a new variable called name and again we use an ID selector to select the name text area and we just take the value from that using Val okay so now what we want to do is go ahead and pop that into the array or push this into the array sorry so we use names which is our a name up here and we use dot push and dot push is just going to take a value or a set of values that we want to put into the array so we could specify them like this or we could specify just one element and that's just going to be name so the name that's currently that's been entered once the button has been clicked that goes into the array and then we call it the display array function we also want to go ahead and call the display array function just down here so as soon as the user lands on the page the array is displayed as well so now that we've done this all we've essentially done is created our array with three values in to begin with we're displaying these values initially to the user and then once they click the insert button it will take the value from the name input field here and that will push that into the array and then it will just redisplay the array so that we've got enough to do now is use the each utility which is the whole point of this tutorial to actually display this now the first thing we want to go ahead and do is just clear the names div so I'm just gonna say names text and then we'll just enter an empty value in there now what we want to do is go ahead and loop through all of our results so at the moment when i refresh and type in a name let's just say Ashley the array now contains the values Alex Billy Dale and Ashley but obviously we haven't displayed this to the user yet so we need to use dollar dot each and then we fill this in to actually loop through particular results from a specified array so this is going to take two parameters and then we have a callback function with two additional parameters and what we want to do is say names and that's the name of the array so we've specified the name of the array which is names and then we want our callback function just here I want to go ahead and just pull that down and inside a function we're gonna take two parameters or feedback two parameters and that's index and value so index is the position that each element is located at so for example Alex is located at zero Billy at one day lat and then so on and value will be Alex Billy and Dale so we can also point out where the the elements are located so this is would be good for you know searching in an array and then you know modifying an array perhaps taking values out and putting new values in so it's extremely you know powerful way to hold data as I'm sure you already know if you program before so now what I want to do is for each name I want to go ahead and append this to the names div so I'm going to say name names dot append and in here we want to append on the value and then we want to append some text and then the in there are sorry yeah the index so I'm gonna say value ie Alex Billy or Dale or anything else I'm an actual fact no we don't need to do that that was from the last tutorial sorry what we want to do is display the value and then a line break okay so got a bit ahead of myself but yeah we've got the value and then a line break so at the moment when we enter the page we call this display array function and what it will do is it all it'll show Alex and then a line break and Billy then a line break and then Dale and then another line break so when we add another value in it will just keep appending to this list and remember the function does the display error sorry the display array function clears this before it really fills the div with this data just so we don't get duplicate data so let's go ahead and just refresh you can see that we've now got Alex Billy and Dow in a list and what we can then do is go ahead and enter a name so when we click insert we'll just run through it again we have the handler here we grab the value from the text field we add it to the right and then we again call the display array function so that will just display that back out so when I click insert you can see that that's just pushed on to the end of the array so we can go ahead and type in you know a variety of names and they'll just be added to the array so a somewhat useless application you know depending on you know you might want to go ahead and and use it somewhere else but a somewhat useless application but it demonstrates the use of each and also you know sort of like an original JavaScript functionality with regards to pushing a value onto an array so hopefully you've learned a bit about arrays and also looping through arrays and as I mentioned before if you want to go ahead and hold data in the front end in JavaScript variables and it's lots of data that obviously belonged to one category or one you know group you can go ahead and use a raise because it's extremely powerful and jQuery does have some utilities that do deal with arrays so go ahead to the jQuery documentation lookup utilities and see what other things you can do with arrays such as converting etc so yeah that's a the each utility in jQuery
