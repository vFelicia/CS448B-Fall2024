right here trying to find the missing side of the quadrilaterals the quadrilaterals is just a fancy word for a foursided shape so right here we have perimeter of six the perimeter is given so we have four eleven and thirteen always to do is add those sides together eleven thirteen four four or five six seven eight twenty eight right now have a total of 28 and we know we have to have 36 so we take 36 minus 28 borrow from the three eight zero so we know that the sides eight like a different color same thing with this side a perimeter is 40 that's sixteen fourteen and eight let's take 16 14 8 8 9 10 11 12 12 and 6 is 18 3 so we have 36 so far when trying to get to 40 so 40 38 borrow from the 4 we have 2 and 0 so we know the size guy b2 now over here we have a perimeter of 37 so we add 911 we know it's 20 and plus 5 is 25 so we take 37 minus 25 and 7 minus 5 is 2 and 3 minus 2 is 1 so we have a side of 12 and that's the simplest way of finding the missing edge of a perimeter if the perimeter is giving then it's pretty simple just to add up the rest of the sides and subtract the remaining sides with the total perimeter and that's your answer
