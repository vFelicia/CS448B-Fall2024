so our focus is on regular polygons specifically the angle measures in a regular polygon so first you need to remember that a regular polygon has all sides that are congruent and all angles that are congruent that's what makes them a regular polygon so to find the measure of one angle in a Rel regular polygon you're going to find the sum of the angles which you can do by drawing in your diagonals and multiplying by 180 and then divide by the number of divide by the number of angles so this leads us to this little formula right right here which allows us to do this in one step so n is the number of sides or angles because this this is a hexagon so it has 1 2 3 4 five six sides but it also has 1 2 3 four five six angles so you take the number number of sides or the number of angles which is six youus 2 and times it by 180 this top part is number one finding the sum of the angles and this and when you divide by the number of sides you're doing when you divide by six you're doing number two and we're just doing it one step so the measure of angle one is equal to 720 / 6 which gives us an answer of 120 so the measure of angle one right here is 120 and that means since it's a regular polygon that every one of these angle also measures 120° so we know that this is a regular quadrilateral which is also known as a square and we know and since it's regular that means these are all congruent and we know that the length of one side is four so that means all the sides measure four so if we want to find the measure of of this angle angle X right here we're going to plug it into our formula so we have four sides so that means n = 4 so 4 * 2 4 2 * 180 / 4 gives us 2 * 180 / 4 360 / 4 means that the measure of angle X is equal to 90 so for the next one we know that these sides all these angles are congruent and these sides are congruent because it's a regular triangle or an equilateral triangle so we to find the measure of angle we're going to call this y we take 3 2 * 180 / 3 is equal to 180 / by 3 which equals 60 you also could have solved it using your knowledge of the interior angles of a triangle since the sum of a triangle is 180 de and there are three equal angles you could have just divided by that by three and gotten 60° either way you get the same answer so we're going to do it now for a regular de decagon and if you remember a decagon equals 12 sides so our n is 12 so the measure of of we're just going to call it angle one is equal to 12 2 * 180 over 12 so you get 10 * 180 over 12 and if you put that into a calculator you'll get the measure of one angle is 150° so a regular 100 gone so that means there's 100 sides so the measure of one angle 100 2 * 180 over 100 and we're just once again we're just going to plug that into the Cal and you'll get make sure you come back because in our next lesson we're going to talk about specific types of polygons starting with parallelograms
