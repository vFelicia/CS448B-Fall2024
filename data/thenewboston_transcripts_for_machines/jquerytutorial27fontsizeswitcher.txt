hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to look at creating an example application that's going to reference the paragraph using a selector or some paragraphs on a page using a select using selectors in jQuery so essentially what we're going to be creating is an application that allows you to increase the text size on a page between paragraph tags so the first thing we're going to do is set up our page so we know exactly how it looks so let's first of all go ahead and create our paragraphs I'm going to create a paragraph here and that's going to have some text inside of it so this is some text I'm then going to create another paragraph just below this this is some more text so now just up here we want to create some links that are going to allow us to click smaller or bigger in order to increase or decrease the font size of this text so let's go ahead and create our links so this one is going to be well we'll put a label here so font size this one is going to be smaller and this one here is going to be bigger so the link is going to be hash because we're not actually linking to a page we're using jQuery to handle when we click on these links but we're going to give each one an ID so the first one's going to be smaller and this one is going to be bigger so now what we can do is we can create event handlers for each of these links and then actually perform an operation on the paragraphs on the page I increase their size using the bigger link or decrease their size using the smaller link let's just go over to our browser and take a look at our page so this is how it looks at the moment we've got a smaller link and a bigger link which we can click on and then once we finish the tutorial and actually created the jQuery functionality these paragraphs will increase now we're kind of taking the long way round however the reason I'm doing there is to demonstrate the use of selectors and just to make things a bit easier to understand so we've included selectors jjs inside of our page as well as jQuery j/s and we have selectors j/s here open in our text editor ready to start editing so the first thing we want to do is create event handlers for both these links so we're going to use a selector to reference the smaller link and then when this is clicked we want to run a function so we create our function definition and then between these paragraphs hit our these curly braces here we are going to perform a function and this function is going to be change underscore size we're going to go ahead and look at the parameters in a minute when we've done the same for bigger and then we'll be you know feeding in the parameters and and looking at creating the actual function itself so the next is a hash bigger and we want to again create the same on the same click event handler and again we want to outline a function here and between these brackets we want to run the same function now the parameters that we're going to feed here is which element we want to be made bigger now for example we could choose the element or an asterisks or for all elements on the page or we could just choose a specific element and in this case we're just going to choose a specific element so the element that we want to feed in is P and the next parameter will just be smaller so what's going to happen in this change size function we're going to change all of the elements that correspond to this selector to a smaller font size and we're going to use an if statement to check this value inside of this change size function so we'll do that the same for this one we'll select all paragraphs and we want to make them bigger okay so let's go up and start to define our function and the parameters that we need to feed in and then we'll create the rest of the function so the function is called change underscore size we'll create our block and then we'll fill in the parameters that we need to feed in so the first is the element that we want to change or the element set that we want to change and the second parameter is the size so this element here corresponds to the P and this size here corresponds to this textual representation of where we want the size to go do we want to increase it or decrease it okay so inside of our function we need to grab the current size of the text inside of these paragraphs so there'll be a default text size for these paragraphs which we can retrieve so I'm going to create a variable called current and that's going to be equal to element CSS
