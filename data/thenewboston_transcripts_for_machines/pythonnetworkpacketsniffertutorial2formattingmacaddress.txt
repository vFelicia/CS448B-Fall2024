alright guys welcome back and in this video all we're going to do is we're going to take the MAC address and format it into a human readable format kind of the standard convention because right now we unpacked it but it's all broken up into chunks and the standard convention for a MAC address is to have two decimal places in there each separated by a colon so like a a BB yada yada yada tomato tomato tomahto so we already made this function and get MAC address so that's what we're going to do let me add a comment I'll say a return hopefully formatted MAC address all right so define get MAC address and what we're going to do is we're just going to test it in the bytes address so actually let me give myself some more lines I like to be able to scroll around oh yeah there we go May there we are alright so this is pretty much um the address that's broken up into chunks it's an iterable and from here what I want to do first is just convert it to a proper string format each chunk so I'm going to take bytes string I'm going to set this equal to map and if you guys don't know what the map function is again look at my Python 3 tutorials it's basically a way that you can pass a function in here and in iterable and it runs each item in there through your function so what do we want to do with each chunk of the mac address like this chunk in this chunk of this chunk well all we want to do is we want to format it to two decimal places so have single quotes curly brackets and if you're right colon 0 to X that's what that is going to do dot format holy alright dot format we're never using map you don't use those curly braces and what do you want to loop through or just this right here so basically what this is doing is taking all those chunks and formatting them correctly pretty much stripping out everything and making sure that we only have two decimal places for each one but now what we need to do is we need to take each of those chunks and make sure that they're all uppercase and also join them together with colons so how do we do that well let's just say MAC address that's what's going to be the ending return value and just set this equal to colon in between single quotes and what do you want to join together well let's just go ahead and join together these chunks and we also want to make sure everything is uppercase so this made the proper chunks and this just joins them together with a colon in between all of them and actually instead of even doing this return MAC address what we can actually do is just return this and it'll save us a little bit of you know clutter looking good so there you go and let me go ahead and write bit uh I'm not like a quick little demo of what it is so be like a a BB CC DD e FF and these are of course colons not semi colons and that'll just help anyone reading later on I'm going to be putting this on get help later on so if you guys want to make sure to follow me on github and you'll be updated on everything but that is the format that we are going to be returning so now we have a nice beautiful properly formatted Mac address that we can display to the user we're now ready to move on to the next step
