hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be continue continuing working on the game now you can see here that we've created our dragon our villain our zombie and our enemy class so let's go ahead we'll come up here to file and we will add a new project so let's go ahead and save this let's save the project as game go ahead and save that okay so now it opens up our add new project dialog so what we want to do is create a windows form application and we will call it the game UI for graphical user interface if you didn't already know that so we'll just wait for that to load you can see here in our solution we've got our game library and our game DUI so one thing that I wanted to change from the last tutorials is our ArrayList so instead not our ArrayList our race so instead of making them private let's create them public and readonly so that the user can access them but they can't change anything about them so let's go through here public readonly okay so now that we've done that let's go ahead and create a little rough draft for our game so we'll come over here to our tool box and let's add some picture boxes so this picture box is going to hold your character or popeye let's go ahead and size the image so we'll stretch the image to fit in there now it will make another one and we'll just put it over here so we'll set the name of this one to picture Popeye and then this one to picture enemy so now let's go ahead and we'll add a button so the button will say or we'll set the name to button attack is gonna say attack on it now we won't be able to do anything with the villains because they're going to attack on their own and we're gonna be creating a timer that will pause their attacks for a second or two in between the time that we attack so that it does not automatically attack as soon as you're done as soon as your characters done attacking so now that we've got that let's go ahead and add some progress bars so that we can monitor the health of our of Popeye and our enemy so we'll just bring this down some I will press ctrl C to copy it and we'll make another one so we'll set this one to progress bar Popeye or and then we'll set this one to progress bar enemy okay so this is just a rough outline of what our program is going to look like so let's go over here to the picture properties of the Popeye and let's go ahead and set the picture so we'll go ahead and import a local resource we'll go to desktop and here we have Popeye go ahead and open that and click okay so here's Popeye right here let's go ahead and make him a little bit skinnier there okay so this is always going to be the same now let's add a button and it'll say spawn enemy so we'll set the name to button spawn and then we will set the text to spawn enemy now we will be making several changes to this throughout the program and the reason I'm doing this is because I'm going to show you what it's like to develop your own programs that you make changes throughout it and that you're not going to just come up with your best ideas at first so whenever we spawn the enemy what its gonna do is going to generate a random number and then pick from a series of pictures to put in here so what we need to do is come over here to game GOI and we'll go ahead and open up the properties of it and we can come over here to resources and we can add some resources so let's add an image so we will add let's say a JPEG I don't let's add an existing file sorry about that so we'll come over here to the
