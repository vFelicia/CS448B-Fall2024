hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial uh we're going to continue working on our favorites viewer application now before we get started I just want to give full full credit to the authors of beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 um the authors are thean Willis and Brian Newsome they created this great program and I'm teaching you guys um how it works and how you can make it yourself so in the last tutorial we created our web favorites collection so we need to come over here to my project or not my project favorites viewer YouTube and let's add a class so we'll set the class name to favorites so what this class is going to do is it's going to go through our favorites folder and it's going to find all of the favorites and it's going to give us back a collection of a web favorite collection and it's going to hold each one of our favorites and those are going to be of object type web web favorite so what we need to do um is let's Implement I disposable so that we can dispose of our objects when we're done so let's go ahead and minimize out of this region right here and we'll start adding our code so we need to create a an object of our web favorite collection so we'll type public favorites collection as web favorite collection so you can see that we didn't use the new keyword because we don't want to create a new instance of web favorite collection we're going to be assigning this right here to other web favorite collections later on okay so now what we need to do is we need to add a property uh that will get our favorites folder it'll find it based on what machine we're on so we'll make it read only because we don't need to write I'm going change the favorites folder so public readon property favorites folder as a string so when we press enter it's going to add our G for us now what we want to do is we want to give back the path of the favorites folder so what we're going to do is type envir ironment dot get folder path so we're going to be getting the folder path of our favorites now how are we're going to find favorites well what we can do is type environment. special folder. favorites so I can continue to Mouse down here um and you can see that here is favorites right down here so I can just press Tab and that'll fill that in for us so it's going to get the folder path of the favorites so now that we're done with this property right here let's come down below it and we need to create a method so we'll call it Public Sub scan favorites now this is not going to take any arguments because we don't need anything to do this so whenever we scan the favorites what we want to do is call Scan favorites and we'll use favorites folder now this is going to turn an error right now because scan favorites has not been created yet or let's see well it has been created right here but we're going to we're going to make um another version of it that's going to overload it and let's see here too many arguments to public subcam favorites now the reason we're getting this error because there's no arguments right here so when you what we need to do is type Public Sub scan favorites and for this we're going to need an argument of folder name as string so whenever we create duplicate um methods what it's going to do is it's going to allow the developer or user to call either one of those so if they call just scan favorites um with no arguments all it's going to do is just going going to scan the favorites folder but they can also call Scan favorites and then add their own arguments in there to find the specified favorites folder so either one of these will work um and we can make as many duplicates as we want with different arguments in them so if our favorites collection um variable hasn't been uh in initialized yet then we need to go ahead and create it so here's favorites collection right here so we'll use an if statement so if favorites collection is nothing then what do we want to do so we're saying if favorites collection is equal to null for all of you um developers who've used another language so if it's nothing and there's nothing in it and it's not equal to anything then we need to set it equal to something so favor collection is going to be equal to a new web favorite collection and that is the reason we didn't create a new instance of this up here is because whenever they scan favorites it's going to change that and set it equal to a new web favorite collection now web favorite collection is just the list that's going to hold all of our favorites so let's go ahead and come down below this end if and now what we need to do is we need to go through each file in the folder and find our favorites so we'll use a 4 each Loop and we're just going to call string file as string in my. computer. file system doget files and then folder name so what this is going to do is it's going to get each file in this um folder name directory right here here which is what's passed to this uh method so for each of the files inside of this directory that has been passed we want to go ahead and try to find the favorites file in there now the favorites file end with URL so we can just use an if statement to see if the file ends with URL so we can just use if string file. endswith and ends with is part of string so we can check to see um if it ends with something so if it ends with URL and comparison type so if that's true and the culture is nothing and it says determines whether the end of the string instance matches the specified string when compared using the specified culture so culture could be the language of the program um you don't really have to know what that is right now because you're probably going to be working with English um so it's not that big of a deal deal unless you plan on releasing your program to other countries so thanks for watching this tutorial um put in this code if you haven't already um if you have any questions leave them in the comments and then in the next tutorial we're going to be filling in this if statement right here
