so let's remove my IP address from here and see if that goes okay so it's gone so if we've got the IP address in we're producing the result found otherwise we're not so let's just take it all out first of all okay so if the IP address has been found we don't want to do any sip anything so if it hasn't been found we want to increment the value of the database in the count txt file so now what we can do is create a handle to open this file so we're opening yet we're opening I will create a variable quick filename and that's going to be count to X T so we're opening County exit es we're just substituting that in there and we're opening this to read in the value okay so now what we want to do is we want to grab this data so we can say current equals F read and we're reading from the handle and we need MSI's to specify size so as per the last example in the nonunique hit counter we use the file size function and we used we specified file name so now what we can do is we can close it here using the F close function and we can echo out current just so we know what we do so if the you the address hasn't been found we're going to echo out 0 which is the current which is the current value encountered txt now what we want to do underneath this we don't allow any more now all we want to do underneath this is say current Inc equals current Plus once we're incrementing the value and remember this is all while the IP address has not been found in the database or in the count txt file now what we want to do is we want to open up a new handle so we want to F open we want to open file name this time too right so if you've dealt with file handling you'll understand this if not go and have a look at file handling and this will clearly make sense to you we then want to F right and we want to write to this current handle and we want to write the value of current Inc then we want to close the file so we're closing handle and therefore the value has been updated because we're taking this current ink we're adding one to the value of current and then we're rewriting it into the file so right it's going to overwrite everything so let's just double check and see if this works so at the moment it's zero I'm going to refresh the page and hopefully well we've got a message here saying the file count look txt has been changed reload we click yes and that's been updated to one so let's just close that for now I'm going to refresh again and you can see that if we open up count on txt it's changed to two now this is all well and good but at the moment it's not unique so what we want to do is after we've inputted after we've written to this file we want to open and open the IP txt file and we want to append an IP address onto the end of it so what we want to do here is create a new handle and this is F open and this time we want to open let's go up here we can just specify that in here actually we want to open I P dot txt and we want to open that to append on to it and what this means is we're going to be adding on to it we're not going to over writing let me do with the W we're not going to be reading like we do with the are but we're appending to the end of the file now what we can do is we can say F right and we're writing to handle we want to write the current IP address of the user which is IP address here so if we come down IP address then what we want to do is we want to add a line break onto the end of it by a backslash and and even notice I've used double quotation marks this n won't be processed as a newline if you use single quotation marks so if you're not if you're if it's not writing into a new line for any reason it might be because you haven't used double quotation marks and now we can F close and we can close this handle so we've got a lot of repetitive code here but perhaps you could come up with a function if you want to to shorten this code up so now we've written to the file we've pretty much done because we've written back to the file the IP address and now next time when we check our IP address is already stored so we won't be carrying out the rest of this block that makes sense so we'll come to counter txt make sure that zero come to IP make sure there's nothing in there now if I was to refresh Kate we're obviously not getting any output now let's open up count dot txt you can see that's now a value one let's close that let's open up IP dot txt and you can see that my IP address is written in there now let's close this and try and refresh again so we've refreshed again now normally without the with with a nonunique hit counter this value would have incremented here but because we've done this loop here the IP address should have already been detected found will be set to true and therefore this block here will not be run sorry this block here will not be run so we're not going to be updating this and we're not going to be adding the IP to the file so let's open up account dot txt this is still at value one because we've already recognized that our IP address has visited this website if we open up IP dot txt the IP address is still there nothing's been added because it has been detected therefore our value has not been updated so this is a really simple way to create a unique hit counter the code has been reused in to some extent here so you could perhaps come up with a function that would allow you to combine these and write particular data to them but for now I'm not going to be doing that because this video is just about creating the hit counter it's totally up to you to tidy up the code from what you've learned with dealing with functions and arguments but for now this is the short and sharp unique hit counter
