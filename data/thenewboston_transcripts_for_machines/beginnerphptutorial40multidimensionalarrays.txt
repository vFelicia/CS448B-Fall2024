this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with another tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be looking at multidimensional arrays now multidimensional arrays put really really put into use or into practice the use of arrays now as it stands we've created this array at the moment we have an associative array with different food types here and we've assigned values of the amount of calories in each food so we've given an example of how an associative array can be useful now we're going to move on to something slightly more complicated which is multidimensional arrays it sounds more complicated than it is but in actual fact the basic concept of this is an array inside an array and this can be multidimensional so it can be a two dimensional array and three dimensional array and so on and so forth and you need to really think about this as categories now in this example I'm going to be creating two categories I'm going to creating a category called healthy and unhealthy and then inside these different categories I'm going to be adding different types of food so I'm going to class pizzas oh sorry pizza as unhealthy and I'm going to be classing salad vegetables there vegetables and pasta as healthy food so this is basically a multidimensional array because we're going to have an element two elements healthy and unhealthy and then we're going to have more arrays and pizza is going to be within and around itself and salad vegetable and pasta is going to be in the right in fact we'll add another another unhealthy I'll say icecream okay so this is what we want to achieve so let's modify underneath here will comment this out just so it's not going to be taken as code okay so we've commented that out this is essentially what we want okay so this is the this is the top array so let's delete everything we've got inside the first thing we're going to do is create two elements to our array the first one is healthy the second one is unhealthy okay so now what we want to do is we're creating essentially an associative array because I want to add a value to this and a value to this like we did in the associative arrays tutorial but now instead of assigning a value you may think oh yeah I'm going to start to assign salad as healthy and then blah blah blah it's going to get all mixed up so what we do is we take it into another dimension and we say we're assigning the value so we have created an array inside an array so we're already talking into a second dimension so if I add another array in here let's just run this to prove that is going to work ok yes we're not receiving any errors at all now inside these arrays we can start to add our our foods so let's add salad vegetables' pasta and then in unhealthy let's add pizza and ice cream okay so now we've essentially created a multidimensional array what we can do is we can bring this down to make here sort of look a look a bit better so pull this down to here it's a bit tricky with this text editor that I'm using but you get the general idea of how we can how we can make it you know look a bit a bit more easy to read if you like so let's get rid of this here just so a bit neater okay so let's run this and to make sure everything's working yep we've not received any errors so now how are we going to access each element of this array so what we've essentially done is we've created an associative array with the value of the of the associative healthy and unhealthy as an array so we've created a multidimensional array so how are we going to access these different elements or we can echo out food again remember we're using our square brackets and then we address healthy but then what we do is we need to access either element of either room key 0 1 or 2 so what how do we do this you know we need to add something around here to two out be able to access that all we do is we put another pair of square brackets next to it and then we type the element so as this stands we're accessing the array food the key of healthy here and then inside that the first key which is salad so we're essentially here echoing out salad now you can already see how this is to start starting to pull together into a database type structure so let's just refresh and see if that works we're echoing salad now we can change this to make so perhaps two that's going to echo out pasta and let's refresh pasta okay so we can obviously change this to unhealthy and access element 1 which would be ice cream so you can see how we can do this and change it and you can see now how it's got multiple dimensions to this array so that is basically an and a multidimensional array in PHP and how we declare it and also how we access each each element
