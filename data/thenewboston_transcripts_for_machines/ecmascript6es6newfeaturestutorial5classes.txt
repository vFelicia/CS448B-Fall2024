all righty mate so this is one of the tutorials that I am most excited to teach you guys about and that is the new class syntax with es6 because I had a real problem with classes and you know the traditional version is the JavaScript it's like if I want to create a class I know how to do it I'm just going to use the class keyword write the name of the class then I have constructor tomato tomato it's simple but JavaScript no have to make it so confusing have to make functions and prototypes and god forbid even try to use inheritance because get ready to pull your hair out well now with es6 it changes all that it allows you to make classes pretty much like you should have been able to since the beginning so let's say that I want to make a new person class so all I have to do is write class person and of course whenever I create a person the instant that I create them I want to give them some initial values I want to be able to give them a name maybe an age and maybe a weight I don't know maybe this is like for a doctor's office where you have to like store their weight who knows so I thought that was going to pop up but basically anytime you want to do that you have to make a constructor and you just call it constructor easy enough so now any values or attributes that you want to initially set you just pass in some name age weight boomer Elstad now of course you want to make these attributes specific to this object so thankfully we can use the keyword this now whenever we hit something like this name equals name then what this means is whatever name we passed in is equal to this object's name and of course what this allows is for you to be able to create multiple different people and they each have their own name so Bucky can have his name we can create another person called Sally she could have her name so on and so forth so this would be something like this age equals age and this weight equals weight so later on I'm going to show you guys how to create multiple objects in they each have their own set of properties and that brings me to another point people ask me a lot when do you use classes and when do you just create a bunch of you know standalone functions you're going to create a class whenever you have a bit of code that you need to be self aware so I always have like helper functions like to write a file parse JSON do whatever whenever I use those they're pretty much just a little snippets of code that run and then they're done I don't need them to remember anything or do anything special now whenever I create a person object then this person or this little bit of code it's going to need to remember its name it's going to need to remember its age it's going to have some bit of memory that it needs to be aware of so that is when you write a class versus just a bunch of functions whenever you need a bit of code to be self aware or remember something stick it inside a class also if you just have a bunch of similar code and you want to group it and make it a class but there you go all right so instead of just making a constructor in here you can also have methods so I'll say display weights and this is just method that displays the person's weight so I'll just say console.log um I'll just say this weight so again whenever we create methods inside here we have access to the objects attributes so we can just log out this object's weight and it's going to print out their weight right there so with that being said let me go ahead and create a few objects I'll make one called Bucky and this is going to be equal to a new person object and of course it takes three parameters the name the age in the weight so the name is going to be Bucky how old am i 87 and how much do I weigh so centering six thousand six hundred and fifty pounds all right beautiful night now anytime I want to print out my weight I just call the object we only have one which is Bucky and then display weight and boom look at that now again like I was saying we can also do is we can create another object named Sally that is an object from the same class the same template of course Sally she's my girlfriend in case you guys never heard verse she's actually 21 years old and she owning lace 89 pounds what I yeah she's pretty cool I guess sometimes you get in the movies and whatever but anyways anytime I want to display Sally's weight then all I have to do is something like that boom roasted there you go so I'm not going to go in too many details about how to work with classes because I'm assuming that as programmers you guys already know um es6 just makes it a lot easier to use classes and create objects and makes the entire syntax a whole lot cleaner so yeah thanks for watching and in the next video I'll show you guys how to use inheritance with es6
