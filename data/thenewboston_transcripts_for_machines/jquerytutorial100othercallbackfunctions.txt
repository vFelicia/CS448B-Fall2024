hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in the last tutorial we looked at the get and post HTTP requests in jQuery now there's a few additional things you can do to actually create a better working and you know more flowing script I guess okay so we have some cool back functions additional callback functions that we can append onto the end of our request so we have our post I poke dollar sign post here so we have our HTTP request in place now what happens if we receive an error now if we receive an error in this at all for any reason for example reverse doesn't exist or you know something's gone wrong we can actually bind onto the end some checks now we have three checks that we can complete and that is success complete and error so for example let's go ahead and try error I'm just going to use at the end of this here you'll notice that it starts here where my text editor is highlighted it read and ends here so this is really after the post initial post request we can set another callback function so function again we create a function inside of here and then we have some curly brackets I'm going to bring this down and if there is an error I'm just gonna alert to the user an error so an error occurred okay so you don't obviously don't have to have an alert you can do absolutely anything with this you could put some data into this feedback just say error occurred in fact other thing we'd probably do that now that's probably better feedback dot text an error occurred okay so if we have an error we are using a callback function to put the text an error occurred inside the feedback div so let's go ahead and test our script again Alec says hello that would just be Alex s hello now what happens if for example our file doesn't exist well let's go ahead and rename it let's go over to PHP remember our file is called reverse PHP that we've called just here so let's go ahead and rename that to reverse one dot PHP okay so let's go ahead into our browser let's press Enter let's go ahead and type my name and a little message again we click go now we get an error has occurred error message being returned to us the reason that there's an error is because this file doesn't exist and this error will be fed back for a variety of other reasons as well depending okay so let's rename our file back the way it was and I'm gonna go through some other you know callback functions we can use so we also have dot complete and this is a callback function to run when the request is complete so let's go ahead and for this we'll just alert in fact we'll create another div just under this one and we'll call this messages okay so back into Ajax j/s will put this here as messages so if there's an error we have a request a some text going to there now if the function or if the post request is complete we can again put a message into messages so dot text request complete okay so now let's go ahead and press refresh have Alex and hello click go request complete and Alex says hello so now that's telling us that the request is complete okay we also have dot success now this is only run if the current operation is successful now if we look at the difference here we could say get rid of that now and go ahead and rename our PHP file again so let's go ahead into our PHP directory and go ahead and rename reverse ok I'm also going to use this and say append rather than text that just makes it easier to see each request in total so let's go ahead and run this and click go okay so you'll notice that we have a request complete but we also have an error occurred now that's the difference between complete and the success callback which we're going to write in a moment successful only success will only be returned if the if the operation is obviously a success if everything's gone to plan and we've returned some data in the file exists bla bla bla complete will always happen as long as this post request this HTTP request has been completed so we can go ahead and we can add on a success callback function as well so inside here we create a function and we pull that down and we can go ahead and copy and paste this into here and this will be messages dot append requests successful okay so now when we return here and we click go again you'll see that we have is appended it on but we have an error occurred and requests complete however we don't have a success message so now let's go ahead and go back to our PHP directory rename are far back again so we have the the correct file being called now the callback functions that will be returned our request complete and request successful we don't have an error the request remember always completes well almost always completes and the request will be successful because we already know it works so let's go ahead and test out and we'll see them two messages appear okay so we've got risk request successful and request complete so why is this useful well if we have an error for example we might want to log this error we might want to go on and display a message to the user to say there was an error retrieving your account information an excellent example is Twitter twitter has a system in place that when the loading point is taken to it tells you that tweets are taking too long to load so this wouldn't really have anything to do with the error part of this but it does give a good example of how if there is an error for example if you know something wrong was returned or if the file didn't exist you can alert the user rather than nothing happening or displaying them with a long error inside of the page okay so these are the callback functions that you can use on either the post or the get HTTP request in jQuery
