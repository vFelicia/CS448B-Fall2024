what's up guys it's Bucky and welcome to another back Amon tutorial in this tutorial we're going to continue talking about back Amon strategy and specifically hitting versus making a new point now you know that it's always good to hit them when they have one checker on a point or to make a new point which means taking two or more Checkers and owning a new Point both of these are good tactics but you often come across case scenarios where you can either have the option of a hitting one of Checkers or B making a new point on the board so in this tutorial we're going to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both now the common rule is it's usually better to hit them than to make a new point and this doesn't only apply to back ining but everyday life usually you want to hit someone as often as you can so you know I'm not only teaching you back gaming lessons but also life lessons as well whenever you get the opportunity to hit someone do it that's all I'm saying so anyways let's go ahead and take a look at a back gaming example so we now rolled a 31 U as brown so here are your two options you can go ahead and play 1 2 3 one and this gives you a new point and you now own the Five Point making it harder for them to escape this is a good move but it isn't your best option you can also play your 31 this way you can also move one Checker 1 2 3 4 hit them and send them up on the bar so when you have the option between making a new point and hitting them what do you choose and why well the correct answer like I said before is you should hit him in this case scenario and in most case scenarios and you should do for do that for three main reasons the first reason is look how close white was to bearing off they were already in their home board so they're ready to Bear off and that Checker is ready to go from the end game start bearing off and potentially win the game but now whenever you hit them it sends them way back to the beginning and now this Checker instead of being able to Bear off with a five now has to travel the total distance around the board in order to Bear off so that's why hitting them is good in that sense another way is you know how I said making a new point is a good idea like you could do right there we'll check this out whenever you hit them you don't just knock them on the bar but you also are making a new point or at least starting to right here this is half a point basically and all you need to make a new point on this 20 is to roll a four on your next turn on your next turn as soon as you roll a four not only do you got your new point right here but they're also still on the bar so that's pretty much like making half a point already so you can either make a point with this or hit them and make half the point just look at it that way and the last thing I want to point out is if you don't hit them and you make a new point right here what happened you gave white the opport opportunity to make a new point on their next turn so if they roll a one that five the five point now belongs to them or your 20 point so instead of you taking that point they now have the point and that gives the potential for your Checkers to be trapped back here so you never want to give them the opportunity to trap your Checkers behind and you always want to make points so not only when you get uh attacked and you need to reenter that it gives you an opportunity to reenter more successfully but also your trekers you don't ever want them to be trapped here for example if they made a perfect prime or any Prime so anyways those are three reasons why you should hit them rather than making a new point a it sends their white Checker all the way back so they have to travel the total distance of the board B you start a new point which on your next turn it only takes one/ four to make your new point anyways and see the last thing you never want your Checkers to get trapped back here so whenever you get an opportunity and make a point in their home board you want to do that so anyways that's all I have for you guys for this tutorial remember it's always better to hit someone than to not so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
