now we can alert text value okay so we're just using get element my D and then we're putting value on the end so let's just test if that works let's refresh we'll type in test click Submit and it's not working so let's go back and see what we might be doing wrong perhaps if we change the value of this so I could say insert a text say insert text value refresh that typing test click Submit no nothing okay let's try I'm far let's try and refresh test so I've been note now I think I can see the problem and we need to change this to ID as opposed to name because we're getting element by ID so let's change this back to text just to keep things simple and we can also change that back to text there and we can remove that we don't need to declare it as a variable so let's try and refresh and see if this works hopefully it does then we can proceed with our code no it hasn't so let's just go back to how we were so ID insert text and insert text okay so let's come a refresh test no okay well I can see the problem and a guy I he document dot get element by ID obviously so so yeah so now this is fixed let's go and preview this in a browser song on a type test in here click on submit and nothing's working dad this is annoying insert text to change this back to name something that might be the problem now let's refresh test No so document dot get element I did value insert text think of that and let's change let's see if that works nope okay so maybe this to ID refresh W or something okay so right I wish I was better at JavaScript I'm really not so um please forgive me for that okay so I hope there's probably lots of you screaming at the other screen at that point telling me why I was doing wrong so now we've tested our value we know how to get our value eventually we've got this element by ID insert text I'm actually going to change this back to text now because I'm going to keep things simple for the purposes of the tutorial so again whatever we type in here we are just displayed to the screen in the text box for now that's just for testing purposes so let's get rid of that after all that hard work let's get rid of it okay so now let's go into creating our jar our sorry our Ajax itself so the first thing we want to do is we want to say let's come in here and say if window dot and we basically need to specify for different types of browsers which which method we're going to use to create our XML HTTP variable or rather what we're going to set it to so we say if window dot XML HTTP request and then we come down and we do something if that's if that's so true otherwise we do something if that's false so what would we do if it's true or we set a variable good ate XML sorry XML HTTP equal to a new XML HTTP request so essentially what we're doing is we're checking for this first inside the window and then we're creating it if it's true so that's just four different browser support otherwise we want to say XML HTTP equals new I'm going to create a new active X object and parameter that's that we put into here is Microsoft XML HTTP now bear in mind while I'm writing this code that everything I'm writing is casesensitive so for example this XML HTTP request object is in capitals for XML and then a capital H small TTP a capital R and in the rest of request is small so ensure that for everything you write inside of here it's a bear in mind it's case sensitive so what if you ended up with it not working just double check the case next to what I've done
