hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be finishing our day action program that we have been making now if you have no clue what what you're looking at right now you might want to move back a little bit to the enumerations tutorial and these last couple two doors built build on each other and we make a day action program now if you remember from the previous tutorial when we run the program everything compiles and it works and if we change the date it says as 1600 richard is but it doesn't actually tell us what he's doing so what we're going to do is we're going to use this enumeration right here and we are going to use state because we haven't your state anywhere else in here so what we're going to do is we're going to set the value of state according to whatever the value is that is passed to the set function in property so we'll go ahead and just before we set the text of label state we're going to get the value of the value that is passed it's an integer we're going to get the value of that and set state up here according to the value so let's just go ahead and use an if statement so if value now let's come up here and see what we have for the first one so we have asleep so if value is let's say what are they going to be sleep let's say 10 o'clock to 6 o'clock so if value is greater than or equal to 20 and value is less than 6 then what we're going to do is we're going to set state equals and since state is of type day action we can set state equals day action dot and then we have our options right here we'll just go ahead and go with asleep now let's go ahead and come up here and look what else we have we have waking up so what hours would they be waking up so we'll go ahead and do an elseif right here so else if value is greater than or equal to 6 and value is less than 7 so if it's 6 to 7 then what do what do we want to do well we'll set state is equal to day action dot waking up and we'll just go ahead and do this for each one of the values so we can go ahead and type else if again and we can type if value and let's see what we have next we at school so let's just say that at school from 8 o'clock until 3 o'clock so if value is less than or equal to let's say greater than or equal to 8 and value is less than what's 3 o'clock in military time we got 12 13 14 15 let's do 15 so if it's greater than equal to 8 and less than 15 then day action or state is going to be equal to day action dot school and we'll create another elsif here so else if value is let's see what they have lunch so let's just say they eat lunch at 11 to 12 so if it's greater than or equal to 11 and value is less than 12 then state equals day action dot lunch and we'll do this two more times so if value is greater than or equal to let's say they get home and they do let's just say this is when they're doing homework so when they get home so we'll go ahead if it's greater than or equal to 16 and value is less than let's say they work until 6 o'clock so let's do 18 then state is going to equal day action dot home and we'll do this one last time for the programming so let's just say they do this as a hobby or something so we'll go ahead if value is greater than or equal to 18 and value is less than 10 o'clock so 20 then go ahead and state equals day action home now when I was making this elsayf right here I did 16 greater than or equal to 16 in less than 18 I just went ahead and gave them an hour for the bus ride but to make it simpler let's just do 15 right there so this one has to be less than 15 but this can this one can be equal to 15 so now we're going to use state to tell the user what Richard is doing so we're going to go ahead and type an end sign right here and then we can just do current or not current state dot to string so what this is going to do is it's going to take the value of state and convert it to a string so if the hour is image 1 6 & 7 then it's going to say Richard is waking up so let's go ahead and run this and we will bring it over here and you can see it says at 18 o'clock Richard is home so right now Richard would be home so we'll go ahead and we'll set this to two o'clock and it says at 14 Richard is school or at school and let's change is something else I change this to 22 or here let's do 12 o'clock p.m. let's see um let's try something else let's set this to 12 a.m. and it looks like we have a problem with our code so if values greater than equal 20 and value is less than or equal to 6 ok looks like we had a little bit of a problem with the sleeping due to the way that the time is set up so I just went ahead and took that out so let's go ahead and get rid of a sleep right here so we'll go ahead and run this and we can go ahead and set this to 6 a.m. and I said says s 6 Richard is waking up now let's send Richard to school so at 1000 Richard is at school and now let's get him working on his homework so at 16 Richard is home now let's have Richard start programming so we'll set it to 800 p.m. and at 20 Richard is home let's set it to 1000 p.m. okay looks like we have another area we need to come down here and find this and set it equal to programming okay so at 18 richard is programming so go ahead and if you have an engine in this code and already you can enter it in play around with you want sorry I have some errors in this program but I've had some people comment on my other channel saying that when I make errors it seems more realistic because it might be something that they run into so practice with this make some properties if you want to find you can challenge yourself to find a different way to do this because in programming there's a lot of different ways to do the same thing and as a programmer you need to find the most efficient way of doing it so you can make this program modify it do whatever you want then once you're done with that go ahead and move onto the next tutorial
