alright guys welcome to your 68th c++ tutorial and these next couple tutorials are gonna be a chain of tutorials I can't teach you guys what I'm gonna teach you in one tutorial so it's probably gonna be like a 3 or 4 part series but anyways what I'm gonna be teaching you guys is this I'm gonna be building a really cool program showing you how to work with files and by the end of these tutorials you guys are gonna be a pro on how to work with files so basically what we're gonna be doing is we're gonna be pretending we're making a computer game now in this computer game we have a character and this character in his own little world is going to come across a bunch of different objects some objects have no effect on them whatsoever zero effect on his health or is you know happiness whatever you want to call it some objects like ninjas meth and dirty needles they harm our character so they're gonna you know have negative 50 for energy or what you say it's like energy or something now some objects like a fruit a soda and candy help our character out so they're going to give them positive energy so as you can see we have a file with a name and the effect that it has on our character's energy so we're going to be building a program just to print out these different types of items and groups for example we're going to have the user press one if they want to print out all the plain items like a shoe a pencil and chair press two if they want to print out the helpful items like fruit and soda and candy and press three if they want to print out the harmful items like a ninja meth and a dirty needle now we'll have them press 4 if they just want to quit the program altogether and you know go watch YouTube videos so that's the basics of what we're gonna be doing we're gonna be incorporating a program with a file and it's gonna work beautifully together but like I said it's going to take more than one video so just be prepared for that so let's go ahead and start coding this baby right meow so the first thing we want to do is we want to give them a menu to choose from now this menu is going to be 1 2 3 4 depending on what they press we're going to output the appropriate items so we're going to want to store this variable either 1 2 3 or 4 in a variable so just go ahead and make will store this number in variable named what they want now this will be equal to one two three or four so now what we can do is we can just take that variable what they want and we're going to set it equal to a function in order you know to get the number from them so we'll just name this function get what they want now we didn't build this function yet and this obviously isn't a built in function on C++ so we need to go ahead and build it right now so what I like to do actually is whenever I'm building a big program that's gonna be working with a lot of functions above each function well I'll just do with main first I like to leave a comment just the function name like a main function and you guys may be like alright why the heck do you want to do that well if you notice the comments are a different color and it makes it really easy to find functions whenever you're scrolling through like three hundred three thousand lines of code so you guys might be like alright that's kind of dumb but trust me do it it's gonna save you a whole bunch of headaches in the future so we're gonna be building this get what they want function so the first thing I'm gonna do is get what they want function and I probably spot it wrong yep but you know good enough so now remember this function has to return an integer that's going to be either 1 2 3 or 4 so our turn type is going to be integer now the name is get what they want so just go ahead and copy that and paste that and it's not going to take any parameters we don't have to give any information into it we just want to get information back from it so that's why it's not going to take any parameters so now what we wanted to do is we need a variable to temporarily store one two three or four so we got to make an int variable and we'll just name this choice name or whatever you can name it X if you want really doesn't matter so now what we want to do is we want to output the their choices forum so you know they know whether it enter one two or three or four so just go ahead and make four different see out statements we can make it all in one statement but it would probably look cleaner if it's just four different statements so and the first one we'll just put enter one for just plain items and you probably want to put each of these on a new line so just copy this three more times copy and we'll go ahead and write enter 2 4 2 can be let's say helpful items and this will be the you know candy the soda is that really helpful for a kid I don't think so but in this game it is and 3 will be for the harmful items and this will be like the the ninja they're dirty needles and the what else I put oh yeah meth definitely harmful for a kid and 4 will just be like quit program so whenever they press for the program is going to quit so now what we want to do is we want to allow them to input of course one of those numbers so CIN that's how they get information from the keyboard and whatever number they enter it's going to be stored in the variable choice now all we need to do is take that variable choice and return it in our function so whenever return choice it's going to store that number and what they want so now this got what they want function basically gets a number from from the keyboard and it stores it in a variable what they want so now we have a variable either 1 2 3 or 4 but we didn't do anything with that variable yet and what we want to do is since this program is going to keep running until they hit 4 we want to throw pretty much our entire program inside a while loop and this while loop is basically going to say ok keep running this program until they hit the number 4 so we're gonna say alright wow that what they want variable is not equal to the number 4 keep running this program and of course at the end of this at the end of this while loop well let me think actually no okay I'll save that for later on but basically what I'm gonna be doing is this I guess I can throw it in right now at the end of this while loop we want to give them another opportunity to you know get what they want to enter another number so go ahead and copy this and well I guess I can show you guys what's going on right now basically this program is going to run and I didn't prototype it always remember to prototype your functions ladies and gentlemen and whenever you prototype something just copy the header and paste it at the very top and that way whenever your program comes across it like it did right there it's going to know what it is so let me show you guys what's going on so far well the very first thing that we did is we ran this program and it called up this function right here now once it got that function it pretty much took a number from one to three or four and stored it in the variable what they want and we said all right keep calling this function in making equal to store to what they want until they enter four so whenever they run this program they're gonna be able to enter one it's going to do something to it's going to do something three it's going to do something they can enter three hundred times if they want but as soon as they enter for the while loop is going to end and the program is going to quit just like that so we have the basic shell of the program right now we basically are getting a number from them and we're going to keep getting a number from them until they enter four so now with the basic shell done the only thing that we need to do now is whenever they enter one handle that one appropriately and show all the plain objects whenever they enter to handle that appropriately and show all the helpful items whenever an INT will enter three show all the items that are harmful to the character and now that we now have the basic shell we can move on to that but we can't in this story because if I do I'm going to run out of time so copy all this code down make sure you know how this menu function works and also make sure you understand why how we keep looping through dysfunction until they enter the number four and by the way as soon as they enter number four this while loop is going to be false and it quits and as you can see whenever it quits there's no more quote there is no more code after it so the main function ends in our program stops so once you guys understand that you're ready to move on to the next tutorial so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys
