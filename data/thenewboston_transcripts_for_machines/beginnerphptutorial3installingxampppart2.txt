um once that is downloaded I'm just going to cancel this cuz I've already got it installed so uh once it is downloaded what you want to do is you want to uh run through the installation process um hopefully you won't get any errors if you do get any errors go on to xamp um and see if you can find any support follow the instructions for installation um and once you've installed um we're going to get to the point that I'm going to talk to you now in the video so uh if you'd like to pause the video or uh or close whatever um in install examp and um we're going to go ahead and test everything okay so hopefully now you have examp installed um I haven't talked to you about what we're going to do next but what we're actually going to do is we're going to open up something called the xamp control panel application now what or the xamp control panel now what this is is it's a control panel for your uh services that are included with xamp I'm not sure what version of xamp I'm running at the moment uh but is a slightly older version so depending on when you've completed the installation um this video was recorded 2011 so depending on when you're viewing this video uh your control panel may look a bit different but nevertheless control panel is available from uh your programs menu within windows so open this up and what you want to do is you want to make sure Apache and MySQL are running for most cases you're going to be using uh well for all cases you're going to be using Apache but for some tutorials and for database usage you're going to be using MySQL so make sure these two are running if they're not running they'll look something like this yeah okay oh so they're going to look like something like that and uh to start them you're just going to Simply click Start and vice versa if you need to stop them for any reason uh just click stop so now that they're both running um we see here Apache started Port 80 and MySQL started Port 3306 now to access um um Apache and the files that you're going to be creating in PHP uh this is pretty simple with mySQL you're going to be using a web application called PHP my admin admin and this is bundled with examp now PHP well MySQL for stter is a database system you may have heard of it if you haven't already heard of it go to Google read up about it see what it's about you don't need to download it because obviously um what we can see here is bundled with xample already so the first thing we want to do is we want to test if our web server is active now you're not going to be typing any uh domains in here or anything else uh what we're going to be doing is we're going to be typing Local Host okay so it's just it's just simply Local Host so if we press enter hopefully you'll get this screen up so if you have uh got this screen up then uh it's got a little congratulations message you've successfully installed xamp on this server on this system so this will mean that uh xamp is is installed now you can also access it using uh 1271 uh it's entirely up to you but I prefer Local Host personally and that's what I'm going to be using throughout my tutorials now you'll see at the side here you've got things like status security the documentation PHP PHP info function which is going to give you information uh about your uh PHP installation I do have a tutorial separate on this so go ahead and watch that if you want to learn more you've also got some demos here which we're not going to really be discussing in so now that we've got xam successfully installed we want to start running our own uh file so we want to start running creating a PHP file and uh and running this file um so we're going to deal with that in the next part of the tutorial this one's just about installing xamp now um we we need to um now have a look at PHP my admin and what PHP my admin is is uh the administration for your database uh there are tutorials that will take you through this so you just need to know that you can access access it via this link down here and you can see that the address is 1271 PHP myadmin or as we looked at before uh localhost PHP myadmin okay so that works as well so hopefully now you've got xamp up and running uh the next tutorial in the series is going to talk you through how to create your file and where we're going to find uh the place to uh put our file uh to make it uh accessible uh through our now Local web server so we're going to be looking at creating a file in the next tutorial um and displaying it um with the local host address
