hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be looking more at enumeration and we're going to be taking a look at get values now in Visual Basic there's libraries that you can use that are readily available in every single application you make now in this tutorial we're going to be using the system's namespace and we're going to be using the enum class so we'll go ahead and come over to our form 1vb and we'll just go ahead and make this a little bit bigger here so let's just go ahead and move these over we'll move these to the middle just to make it look a little bit better and now we will add to list boxes so we will add let's see where are they list box okay so we're going to have a list box for the values of the of the items in the enumeration sports and then we're going to have a list box for the names of the items in enumeration sport so we'll go ahead and set the name of this to list enum values and one set the name of this one to list enum names now we may not get two names in this tutorial but we'll just leave it there for the next one so let's go ahead and move this around a bit okay so now we'll go ahead and open our code for this and so what we're going to do is we are going to use systemtm get values to get the values of all the items in these sports enumeration now you can see our values are 0 1 & 2 and let's say we don't know what these values are what we can use get values to do it so let's just minimize analyze sport here we'll come up here to button analyze and let's go ahead and before before it shows the message box let's go ahead and go and add each each of the values to the list box list values so we'll do this using a for each loop so for each item as integer because our enumeration uses integer value types for it and we'll type so for each item as integer in will use the system namespace dot enum the enumeration class and then we'll type dot get values so get values is going to have a single argument so it's going to be the enum type s system type so what we're going to do is we are going to type get type and if you worry to the description for this it says returns a system type object for the specified type name so it's just going to get the type of the enumeration that we're using and forget type we're going to need one parameter for that which is the object and the object is pretty simple it's just sports now bear with me here this might be a little confusing but let's go ahead and come down here and we'll press ENTER so we can fill in the rest of our for each loop so now we're going to do is we're going to type list values or let's see list enum values so list enum values dot items dot add and then we'll do item dot two strings so I'll just convert that integer to a string so what we did is we took our sports enumeration we didn't use my sports because that is an object all by itself we're accessing this enumeration directly to the enumeration so for each item as integer because enumerations take the data type integer or we set ours to take the data type integer you can do whatever you want so item has integer in and then we use the system in um the system namespace and the enum class then we use the function get values now for our arguments we used get type which is going to get the type of sports which is an integer type so get type in the argument of that is sports so it's just going to give us it's going to say it's integers so now we're going to do is we're going to type listing them values the items that add and I don't up tuition so it's going to go through this loop for every single value inside of sports and it's just going to add it to the list now let's go ahead and run this and see what happens here so we'll go ahead and click football here and we'll analyze that sport and you can see a message box pops up that says your sport is football and in all this box it lists all of the values inside of our enumeration sports so you may not think there is a practical use for this this function right now get values but later on when you're programming you may run into it the people who created net know what they're doing and they obviously people are going to need get values or else they wouldn't put it in there so I'm practice with this a little bit you probably won't be using it but it's a good thing to know and let me create myself you probably won't be using it for a while but it's a good thing to know so thanks for watching guys and stay tuned for the next tutorial
