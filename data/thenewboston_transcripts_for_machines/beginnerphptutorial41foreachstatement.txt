hello this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video for the new Boston in this video we're going to be talking about the for each construct now it's commonly referred to as a for each loop because it does actually loop through elements of an array and allows us to sort of iterate over an array and take out different elements now I'm left with the example here of when I did the or the code from the multidimensional arrays tutorial and but what we're going to be doing is we're going to be displaying to the user a list of healthy and unhealthy food so we can sort of see the practical uses of multidimensional arrays and then using this for each construct to to basically display all these values rather than accessing the values like so we could do food healthy and then access element 0 which would be salad so if we refresh that we have salad up here so we start by just writing for each and we have some rounded brackets and then we have a block so it's as simple as that that's the syntax for it now inside here we need to address the array so that would be food and then we need to say as so food as an element okay so food as element is taking it's taking our element which in actual fact is healthy and unhealthy now because I also need to take into account these here I'm saying food as element equals greater than food oh sorry I'll just do an item for example okay so food is the array overall element is healthy and unhealthy and item is this array here so food element is this sorry is this here and this here and then the item is each one of these so in fact I'll call it in a element just so it's easier to recognize now I'm going to echo element and then get append a line break on the end of that so using the dot and then I'm echoing out some HTML so now we need to refresh to see what's going to happen now and you can see that we're presented with healthy and unhealthy so already we've categorized the two different elements of this array inside here now what we want to do is we want to further access our inner elements so at the moment if I was to come down here and echo inner element spell it right you can see that we're not going to have much luck because what we're trying to do is echo out an array so let's just refresh that you can see under each one we've already we're already starting to pull together some kind of structure where we're going to list our healthy and unhealthy food however we just been displayed with this array keyword so you'll probably remember that the we need to loop again to find information about these and so we've already looped to find information about these however what we can now do is we'll scrap this line here and we can say for each and create a new for each so now what we can do is we can say for each inner element which should really be called inner array so let me just change this because it it makes a lot more sense as harder than you think naming variables so so we've echoed out each element of this so these health this healthy and this unhealthy now we need to go in and echo out each one of these so salad vegetables and pasta so now what we can do is say inner array as item item is equal to salad vegetables and pasta for this element here and and for unhealthy its equal to pizza and ice cream so now all we really need to do is say echo item a Pender line break on and we're done okay so now when we refresh you can see that it's taken each element of that and it's put it into a list if you like so what I'm going to do is make a simple change here I'm going to append strong tag on the start of there and a strong tag ending there that just sort of separates our tables by making them more bold so now what I can do is I can update this as much as I want so I could say popcorn and refresh and it just adds an element adds a value just straight into there so now you can see using this for each we've been able to take the inner inner array of this associative array overall it would be called a multidimensional array and we've just echoed out the data that we need to
