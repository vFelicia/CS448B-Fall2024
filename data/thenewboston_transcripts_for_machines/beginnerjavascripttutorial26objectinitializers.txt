what's going on guys it's Bucky and welcome back to your 26th JavaScript tutorial now in one of the tutorials before I told you guys that there are a couple different ways to create objects one way is to use something called a Constructor function well in this tutorial I'm going to be talking to you guys about the different type of way or another way to create objects and this is called object initializers an object initializer is a lot faster than a Constructor function because it's only one line of code as opposed to a whole function and then creating the object it pretty much takes everything and squishes it together in one line and why would you use this and when would you use a Constructor function you would use this whenever you're creating basically only one or two objects of the same type for example if you had if you're creating like 500 person objects then you probably want to use a Constructor function but if you're just creating one Bucky object or a Bucky and a tailor object object then this is fine so for this example it's probably a little more easier and this is probably what you want to do when you're just starting out making objects so let's go ahead and in our head since we're just going to be creating our objects now not typing anything out let's go ahead and create our objects right now so you don't use the keyword VAR and you don't use the keyword new the only thing you need to do when making object initializers is type the name of whatever you want your object to be named and I want my object to be named Bucky and go ahead and set that equal to all the properties you want to set equal to whatever it is so like before we made a Constructor function that had a name and an age well now let's go ahead and do the same thing so in order to do that go ahead and write the name of the property which is name then add a colon now after this you write the value which you want it to equal so I want the name of Bucky to be Bucky Roberts and now you say all right we want another property now so in order to do that just go ahead and separate it with a comma and then go ahead and type the name of the property which is age and set this equal to whatever value you want to be equal to 24 so as you can see instead of writing each property on a separate line with the Constructor function all you do now is separate your properties with a comma and go ahead and list the property colon value property colon value and I have two properties in here but you can have a thousand if you want the only thing you have to remember is separate them all with a comma pretty cool huh so now let's go ahead and make another object so so so so what the heck one of my Chinese just so we can see more clearly what's going on so I'll go ahead and make that other tailor object just like before and sorry if I offend it and any oriental people there but uh one of the properties is name and I would want this to be equal to Taylor Swift and another property is age so go ahead and add my comma property age and for the value is 20 so now we have two objects Bucky's name is Bucky Roberts Taylor's name is Taylor Swift Bucky's age is 24 Taylor's age is 20 easy enough so now now just like before the body can be the exact same anytime you want to use your object it's no different than before just go ahead and write your object name like Bucky and then go ahead and write whatever property you want to use like age name whatever so let's go ahead and take a look at a quick example document. WR and go ahead and write like Bucky name love loves Taylor name because she is Taylor H now let's see if I mixed anything up or messed it up whatever Bucky Roberts loves Taylor Swift because she is 20 pretty cool so like before we can see that whenever we want to use one of these properties just go ahead and write the object property object property object property simple enough eh so now we see that we have two different ways we can make objects using object initializers which are these or using Constructor functions and like I said if we had more than two people like Bucky Taylor John Steven uh Tony Mikey Maddie we would have to I mean we won't have to but it's better to use a Constructor function but now that we only have one or two objects using um an object initializer is fine so that's when you would use object initializers as opposed to Constructor functions so for now that's all I have for you um in the next tutorial I don't know what I'm going to be talking about but trust me it's going to be awesome so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe don't forget to check out my website yada yada yada and I'll see you later
