create message subs let's create one more that will send the message so private sub send message and then we'll just do SMTP or SMTP sender dot Sindh and we're gonna send my message now what we're gonna have to do is enclose this in a trycatch statement so in case something goes wrong our whole program won't crash so catch e^x as exception and then we'll just in try so if something happens and we get an exception let's just go ahead and show that so message box dot show e^x dot two string and we gotta close this with one more okay so now let's double click on button sin and what we're gonna need to do is call each one of these so we'll start off by creating the message we will create the SMTP and then we will send the message and now for discard all we have to do is just clear each one of the text boxes so text body dot clear text from dot clear text pass dot clear I had the subject we got to clear the subject and then that body or weight okay so let's go ahead and run this and hopefully we won't get any errors and it will send our email so we're gonna do from and it will just do my email address so this is going to be censored out and one more thing before we actually send it let's go ahead we'll go over to our text pass properties and we need to not show the text so password character is going to be a star or an asterisk so let's go ahead and run this again so we'll do from type in my email address password you can see that the password is all stars right there now I'll just send it to myself I will do visual basic email and then we'll just say turtles let's go ahead and click send and you can see because I enabled SSL encryption my avast detected it so let's just go ahead and we'll close out of this and we'll go back and disable SSL so we'll just set that equal to false let's go ahead and run it again so from okay so we'll go ahead and send it hopefully everything works now we'll open up my email and we'll just click send or receive if it's on here now here let me drag this away real quick and you can see here here's the message that says turtles and it's Sam McNally from Sam mcanally and then we've got turtles which is the one we said before that was blocked by avast and I guess it got through so go ahead make this email sender if you haven't already you can learn a lot from it you can change stuff inside of it and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
