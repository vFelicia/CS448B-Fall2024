so now what we're gonna do is use everything we learned in these past couple lessons about multiplying to solve polynomial equations so the first thing we're gonna do is distribute this 2 and this 3 and we're gonna collect like terms and solve so 4x minus 2 is equal to 3x minus 6 plus 10 I combine these two I get 4x minus 2 equals 3x plus 4 I'm gonna add this 2 over and subtract this 3x over and I get X is equal to 6 so now we're just gonna do some more examples practicing's solving these polynomial equations ok so we're going to distribute this 2 again and this 3 2y plus 2 times 1 is 1 is 2 plus 3 times y 3y minus 3 times negative 1 3 9 so we're gonna combine these like terms so we get 5 like positive 2 minus 3 negative 1 is equal to 9 subtract that not that one over and we get 5y is equal excuse me add that one over I've I is equal to 10 y is equal to 2 okay so this one looks a little more complicated but the main thing to remember right here is that this negative right here stands for a negative 1 so even though it doesn't look like we have to distribute it we do because the signs gonna change when we multiply by that negative 1 so X minus x squared minus 1 times 2x x times negative 1 negative x negative 1 times negative 1 positive 1 5 plus 2x minus three x squared oh I forgot an x squared on that X right there so X minus X those X's are going to go away negative x squared minus three x squared gives me negative three x squared plus one is equal to 5 plus 2 X minus 3 X well I'm gonna bring this five over here and subtract or add this 3x onto the side so that's gonna go to zero one minus a negative or one minus 5 gives me negative 4 is equal to 2x if I divide by to get X is equal to negative 2 so we're gonna do one last example and this one's a little more complicated because we have a lot of squaring out to do but it's really helpful if you remember this little pattern that we figured out when we square binomials remember you get a squared plus 2 a B plus B squared so for this one 2x plus 1 squared I just have to square the first one 4 x squared I multiply these together 2x times 1 just be 2x multiply it by 2 plus 4x and square this term right here which is just going to be 1 and this is gonna be and at first I'm gonna keep I'm gonna square this first and I'm gonna keep these terms inside parentheses so that I don't forget to distribute this negative 1 so I'm gonna do the same thing right here first squared is 4x squared these two multiplied is this time it's going to be negative 2x times 2 negative 4x and square this one it's still going to be positive 1 I'm going to square this one the same way x squared multiply these together you get 6x times 2 is 12 X plus this one squared 36 x squared so I'm gonna combine these terms on the side just because I know that x squared x squared is just gonna go to 0 now I'm gonna distribute this negative one to each one so I get 4x squared plus 4x plus 1 negative 1 times 4x squared negative 4x squared negative 1 times negative 4x it's gonna give me positive 4x negative 1 times positive 1 is going to be negative 1 and I just have 12x plus 36 left on this side well a positive 4x squared and then negative 4x squared is gonna cancel and positive 1 and a negative 1 are gonna cancel and 4x plus 4x is 8x is equal to 12x minus 36 I'm going to subtract the 12x over an 8 minus 12 is negative 4x is equal to positive 36 divided by negative 4 again X is equal to negative 9 so that's all we're gonna deal with today but in our next lesson we're going to talk about how we can use algebra to solve geometric problems like in geometry when we find perimeter or area we're going to use our polynomials to solve those so make sure you come back and check that out
