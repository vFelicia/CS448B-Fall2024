what's going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your let's see what tutorial does 51st I think udk tutorial and in this tutorial actually in the upcoming tutorials what I'm going to be teaching you guys is going to be awesome I'm finally going to kind of step away from putting the pieces together in the visual aspect of our game and we're going to be hopping into the dynamic aspect of our game how the player can interact with the environment and in this first tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys how you can cause damage to the environment and how the environment can realize that it's taking damage and respond to it in a certain way however you want to do so before I happen to that let me just mention that i'm using the map that we use before however I cleared everything out of it basically so now all we have is just plain old static meshes this wall this podium this wall right here in a control panel and remember we had a trigger right in front here I deleted that and I also had a bunch of stuff in kismet I went and deleted that so basically we have a blank map so don't think you know I set everything up beforehand because I did it so now let me go ahead and the very first thing I want to teach you guys is how you can shoot this control panel right here and how it can realize that you shot it and you know respond in a certain way maybe send some enemies out to you or you know do whatever it wants to do so now let me go ahead and select this control panel right here and I'm going to go ahead and hop in kismet and actually before I even continue I want to mention this I'm going to be moving a little bit faster from now on because now that we know the interface of the UDK and we kind of know how everything is pieced together generally when making the game I'm gonna be taking things up a little bit faster because I think it's time that you know like I said we start to move a little bit faster but I'm definitely not going to be leaving you guys behind I just want to mention that I think it's time we move a little bit quicker and if you guys get lost in you have any questions don't forget to ask me I'm when I form the new boston.com / forum and I'll be glad to answer them for you then but like I said it's time to kind of step away from the beginner putting the pieces together and we in to the more advanced stuff so go ahead and select this control panel right here and open kismet and I first want to introduce you guys to a new type of event so before the only event we knew was the trigger event so now with your control panel selected go ahead and right click and hit new event using static static mesh actor and I'm going to hit take damage and now we see we now have a take damage event in your saying all right what the heck is a take damage event well you can apply these take damage effects to the stack meshes and now what's going to happen is in your game this static mesh right here it's going to be waiting for you to do damage to it either shooting it with a gun or running up and kicking it with your foot or hitting it with a sword anytime you do damage to it it's going to output a signal so again aside from just flicking a trigger on and off you can also have these static mesh damages where whenever this object right here takes damage and we're going to be shooting it with our gun it's going to output the signal but say you're making a game in you have the player able to damage in a bunch of different ways you give them you know maybe if they bump into the object that does one damage maybe if they punch it does five damage if they shoot it with a gun it does 60 damage or if they shoot it with you know a cannon it does like 500 damage well we don't want this to go off with you know just a little bump or anything like that so we're going to want to go ahead and set this damage threshold down to you know something like five or ten or something like that because if we set it too high like 500 then we're never going to be able to set the signal off because we're going to need you know a nuclear bomb but if we set it something to you know point five or you know one then anytime we bump into it it's going to go off so set it equal to something like five and then whenever we shoot it with a gun is going to respond so basically whenever we do damage to this and we're going to be shooting it with a gun it's going to output something and something is going to happen so just for the sake of this story just going to make a real quick announcement play so I'm going to go ahead and hit new action um I'll just write a regular in the house when I guess play announcement so now whenever I do damage to it a gay issue with a gun and announcement is going to play so now let me change the properties of the announcement and the text is going to be like WTF Bucky don't shoot me with an explanation point so now let me go ahead and X out of this and I might as well x out of this and hop over into right there and check it out you need to rightclick this because if you left click it it's not going to work so go ahead and right click with your mouse and look what happens it says WTF lucky don't shoot me and again if we do it more than once it isn't going to go off again so it's only going to go off one time and the reason for that is if you're wondering what's going on in this take damage event that happens you're going to have a property let me find this is max trigger count and it says how many times can this event be activated 0 for infinite well we only want it to be activated one time because we're just going to look at it this way once we shoot at one time then it's ruined we can't use it anymore so again you can go ahead and set to zero and this will make it so every time you shoot it it'll say what did we put WTF lucky you don't shoot me but I'm going to go ahead and you usually want to set them to 1 because usually when you destroy something you know it gives you a signal or it locks the door or you know turns on the light and that's it you shoot at one time and is over so I just want to explain it to you guys because in these tutorials I'm going to be keeping it one but if you want to change it for your game that's how you change it so for now I just want to you know give you a little piece of this tutorial because in the next tutorial we're going to be adding some more static meshes and I'm going to be showing you guys a really cool feature but for now that's how you guys get so thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys next time
