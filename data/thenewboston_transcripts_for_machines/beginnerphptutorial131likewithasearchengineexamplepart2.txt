of each field value so you can see that MySQL returned an empty result set so now let's go ahead and search for um Billy for example so Billy on the left hand side and then a wild card for the rest of the content oh sorry I didn't mean to uh do that uh click on go and you can see it returns Billy Garrett so you can see how we can chop and change this wild card around in order to um produce specific results from specific places um and uh use well basically using the wild card so now let's um take this example of um this now let's search for G and uh our wild card is on either side so G can be contained anywhere in our um in our uh field name so let's click go you can see it's returned Alex Garrett Dale Garrett and Billy Garrett but it hasn't returned Alex Malcolm because Alex Malcolm doesn't contain a g anywhere in it so if you were to create say a search feature in PHP which we'll be doing a bit later on in the tutorial and you were to be um you were to be searching for um a name you would probably use the wild card on either side because if the user was to search for Alex for example and they were to click go you could see that they're produced with all results that the first name is Alex or Alex is found anywhere in this string now if they were to um search for say Alex Garett on its own then they'll automatically be be returned with the value that equals Alex Garrett because the wild card is on either side leaving the middle content as the result found so now we can also do um we can also say where it were not like so we're not like uh G um as we explain as I explained before the only result the with a wild card on either side and G that wasn't returned was Alex Malcolm so this essentially reverses our condition so if we click go we're uh we're given the result Alex Malcolm okay so that's uh using the not key word uh with the like or the not operator with the like condition what we can also do is we can say like and we can specify an underscore so like I said before we could say where um like equals Alex and then we could say G underscore a r r e t TT sorry no uh there so wherever um like is this and then we fill in somewhere with the G uh so let's click go and click go copy and paste this in first the clipboard and you can see we've returned Alex Garett so we can see that we can either search using a wild card on either side or we can use the underscore uh to specify exactly the character uh or the amount of characters so we could we can double up this uh we can double or triple up this uh um underscore so we could say that as well let's click go you can see that that's also returned Alex Garett so you can use um an underscore to search for a specific character um as well so now let's put this into practice we want to uh inside PHP create a small uh search engine if you like that is going to search these names so what our user is going to do is they're going to be um presented with a a text area or a text box rather an input field where they can input a name and then they can uh then they can be returned the results based on what they've typed in so let's go ahead and connect to our database first of all we have this connect. in.php which we've used in previous examples so let's go ahead and require that into our code okay so let's double check that everything's working by refreshing we've connected to our database successfully now let's come down and uh before we actually start on the PHP code we'll create the form so form action equals and Method equals something so the method is post and the action we're going back to index.php so it's basic form submission if you don't already know how to do this then there are tutorials on it uh for myself and other people so we want a name and then we're specify we're giving the user an area to type in a name so the text uh the input typ ex text and the name we're going to say um search uncore name uh let's also give them a submit button that they can press when they when they're finished so uh value equals and uh we could say search in this case I guess okay so uh now what we need to do is pick this uh value up from PHP so let's just double check that everything works we've got our name we've got a text area here where we can type a name to search we can click search and that submits straight back to index.php so let's go ahead and check if the form has been submitted first of all then we're going to check whether the search name field is empty or not and then after that we're going to actually process our query uh inside of our database
