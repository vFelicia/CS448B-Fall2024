so we're going to talk about two triangle inequality and first I'm going to give you the um property of triangle inequality and then I'm going to show you what it means because it is kind of confusing so given that two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of a second triangle and the included angle of the first triangle is smaller than the included angle of the second triangle then the third side of the first triangle is smaller than the third side of the second triangle so now that you have that definition I'm going to show you what it means with this picture right here so we know that this side is congruent to this side and this side is congruent to this side so first thing I have to have is is two sides congruent which I do right here's one pair here's another pair second thing I need to know is that this included angle is smaller than this included angle so the included angle is just this angle right here which is caught in between the two congruent sides so right now we're going to be talking about angle K and for this one we're going to be talking about angle J so since we know we need to know that one of these is smaller than the other so I know that the measure of angle K is less than the measure of angle J because 80° is less than 110° so since I have that I can therefore say that a is less than b because this angle is less than this angle so this side is less than this side that's all that that property tells us so now that we know what it is we're going to do an example that we're going to do an example to make sure you completely understand what we're doing so for these two triangles I know that this side is congruent to this side and this side is congruent to this side and I know that this angle is equal to 110° de so I need to find out what the measure of this angle right here is so we're going to go back and use those um that property of the interior angles of triangles to find out what the measure of angle X is so we're going to add them up and set it equal to 180° and we're going to subtract this over and we know that x equal 90° so that means that X is a right angle so we're going to mark that with one of these symbols right here and we know that just means 90° well since the measure of angle X is equal to 90° and 90 is less than 110 that means that this angle is less than this angle so using our two triangle inequalities we can say that a this side opposite this angle is less than b which is this side opposite this included angle we're going to do one more example we have these two side by side triangles we know this side is congruent to this side and since they share this side right here we can say that that it is congruent with itself and I once again I need to find out what this angle equals so we're going to set each one of the interior angles we're going to add them together and set it equal to 180 so X = 110° this angle is 110° so since this included angle is 110° the other included angle is 60° since 110 is greater than 60° we can say that this side a which is opposite the 110° is greater than this side B which is opposite the 60° so now that you understand two triangle inequality be sure to come back and watch our next video which is going to deal with square roots and how we can use those to solve triangle problems
