what's going on guys welcome to your 38th you to eat wait a minute what is this right here oh this is just my new youtube channel that you guys should definitely subscribe to the new boston TV didn't even realize I had that up there so sorry about that X out of that and all right guys like I said welcome to your 38th udk tutorial and and this is where I'm gonna be going over all the terrain tools so if you X out of this and open your terrain editing mode you get this new terrain window that pops up and the tools are on the left hand side so before I go over all of them I want to say this a lot of these tools you're probably never going to use and some of them the UDK is like in the process of getting rid of so I just gonna go over the basic ones that we're gonna be using the most so I guess I might as well starting top left and work my way down bottom to right kind of like I'm reading so the very first tool is the add and remove sectors tool now what this does is when you click it it basically adds and removes portions of your map so let me go ahead and get a good angle so I'm gonna show you guys if you go ahead and hold down ctrl and drag outward you can see that we're kind of adding sectors to the map kind of adding you know map so if I let go you see we have more map now in order to delete that go ahead and hold ctrl and right click and drag inward and you can delete it so left click ads right click delete portion in your map so if you're creating a map and you realize that you're running out of space this is how you add new space to it basically now aside from this let's see we don't go over that one this paint one is the next one and you guys already know from last tutorials what paint does paint vertex that's one that we're gonna be using sometimes now let me go ahead and adjust my brush a little bit add some radius to that and I guess I might as well scrolling and scroll down alright what paint vertex does is if you hold down control in left click it adds vertex is what it's doing is it's gonna select all the vertexes of your map in the area that you paint now if you go ahead and hold ctrl and rightclick it takes it and it deletes the vertex as you selected ever saying all right why in the world what I want to add in deselect vertex as well if you want to create like a plateau or something if you hold down ctrl + alt while you have your vertex selected you can go ahead and pull those up with the left mouse button so go ahead and just pull those up right there and you can also push them down if you go ahead and right drag so pull that up and now you can see if I click away we got a nice little plateau so actually let me go ahead and use my strength boost that up to pull it up even more maybe that's uh maybe you can see that better so if you want to add a plateau or anything you might want to select the vertexes again I usually just use paint because I think it's a more natural way but I just want to show you guys that you can indeed select vertexes if you want to so there you go and the next tool that we're gonna be going across is let me see we won't be doing that flatten right here now flatten tool works a little bit different than you guys might expect let me go ahead and demonstrate this right here so you guys are probably thinking if I boost my radius a little bit and I fall off just a little bit that whenever I click this mountain right here then it's gonna flatten it down the this size right here but let me go ahead and hold down control and paint and you're saying whoa what the heck is going on well let me go ahead and pull my radius down a little bit actually a lot of it and you saying all right this isn't flattening my map at all what the heck is going on well how flatten works is this it's gonna take the location of where you first click on your mouse for example if I first click on this top of the mountain it's gonna bring all the pixels up or I don't want to say pixels it's gonna bring all the terrain up to that level if I go ahead and I start clicking on the ground level right here it's gonna bring all the pixels down to that ground level so depending on where you first click on your mouse that's where it's going to bring all the pixels to the level so flatten isn't really the best word it's more like bringing pixel to this level so that's why it does that so the next tool I want to go over with that in mind is I won't go over that one this one right here called smooth now smooth works exactly exactly how you think would work it basically takes something and it smooths it out so you're saying all right we just made that it's a little bit bumpy and other side as well a little bit bumpy as well just go ahead and smooth that out right there now if you go ahead and hold ctrl and right click it basically does the exact same thing unsmooth is it or Ruffins it up gives it more edges but you usually you just want to use the smooth whenever you're and you actually use it with the one of the tools that I'm going to be covering in the future so basically smooth smooth things out if you want more hilly texture unless you know peaking mountains so anyways enough of that so the next one I want to go over is this little tool with the % above it and that's average so what average does is it takes the location of it pretty much takes your height map and averages out whatever distance you know both low and high serious and all right this kind of looks like a useless tool we'll check this out averaging is incredibly good whenever you want to make paths along like a mountainside so let me go ahead and bring down my radius and also my falloff and say alright I want to make a path so the user can travel along this mountainside so I'm just gonna head and bring that my radius a little bit more and hold ctrl and check it out actually boost my strength up boost my strength up a lot now check it out what happens when I paint along here what it's doing is its averaging this height right here with this height right here and of course the average of that is just a flat plane so the height between this and this is a nice flat path that the user can now walk along so how awesome is that that's probably the most common way you're gonna be using your average tool whether you have a mountain that you want the user to climb you can go ahead and build them a nice path that they can walk along that again if you were just to do this in the paint tool or another tool it's gonna take you forever but with this average tool you're gonna be able to do it real quick now with the noise tool which is the next we're gonna be going over what this does is basically let me go ahead and boost all this crap right here what this does is basically add random bumps to your map so go ahead and hold ctrl and you can see whenever I start to paint it's basically just gonna add randomize the bumps to my map so this is useful whenever you know you first make a terrain and it's all flat and boring then you want to add some you know naturallooking bumps you can do this but as you can see this is kind of an unnatural looking terrain right here you know what kind of terrain looks like that none so you usually use this in conjunction with a smooth tool where you add some natural bumpy areas and then you want to go ahead and bring the strength down and smooth it out and now you might guys not be able to tell but if you go ahead and bump that up and then smooth it out you get a nice naturallooking ground where it's not perfectly flat like a sheet of paper but I had some you know nice natural bumps like you forego and walk on a field or something so that's what noise does basically the bump maker now the last tool I want to be going over is the visibility tool again these tools right here like texture pane and you know merge and split you really don't use those that often and if I ever use it then I'll be going over it then but I'm not gonna waste your time because you're only going to use it once in a blue moon so the last tool that you're going to be using a lot is this a visibility tool so let me go ahead and bring my radius and basically all the way down and I'll show you guys with this visibility be told us if I go ahead and on the backside of my mountain let me go ahead and make sure I don't take out anything I don't want to and hold control and just hit click what the visibility tool does is it takes away a portion of my map and you're saying uh okay that's interesting and all but why the heck would you just want to take away random portions of your map again what the heck game just has random blotches on their terrain taken well well check this out if you ever wanted to add an underground bunker or maybe a cave in your map this is how you would do it you would take away a portion of your terrain and then you would import a static mesh of a cave or a bunker or maybe just an underground room and then you would place that right here so again if we were to play it right now it would be kind of useless because you'd go up to the empty spot in your terrain you know shoot through you never use it just like this however if you ever add an underground bunker or something you go find the underground bunker and run in and you know ah destroy some enemies or whatever you need to do so that's how you do that that's the basic use of the visibility tool again it's not just to take away your random portions of your map it's more of adding static meshes so anyways with that being said that's all I'm gonna cover in terms of tools the rest of the tools like I said we're not going to be using that often and if we are we'll be going over them then but those are your basic tools that's how you use them so
