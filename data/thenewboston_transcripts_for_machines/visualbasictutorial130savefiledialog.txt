hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to learn about saving files with the save file dialog so let's go ahead and create a new project and we will call it save files now just like the Open File dialog save file dialogues are built in the Visual Basic and they're very easy to use and they keep you focused on what your application is doing and instead of having to work on coding the dialogues yourself so let's go ahead and come over here to our toolbox we will add a text box we'll make it multiline make it a little bit bigger and let's add a button called save so we'll just type save file we'll set the name to button save now what we need to do is come over here to our toolbox and double click on save file dialog now this will create an object of save file dot say file dialog that we can use in our program so let's go ahead and double click on save file to open up the event handler for that now what you guys also need to know is that you don't have to come into your form one designer to add say file dialogues you can also create instances of them just like object so dim my file save as new save file dialogue so you can create object create objects with them inside of your code so that's just another way of doing it and this is what the designer does for you when you add subs to the toolbox it just makes objects of it in your code but it's saved in a different file so let's go ahead and delete this here so what we want to do is let's use a simple if statement so if text box one dot text dot length is greater than zero then we'll go ahead and show that because we can't write nothing to a file so we'll type say final dialog one dot show dialog and now what we want to do is we want to save the file to whatever they named it so we'll just type system dot IO dot file dot write all text and for our path we're just going to use the path that they gave us from save file dialog one so a save file dialog one dot file name so this gets the path and the filename after that and the contents of it is going to be text box one dot txt so you can see that right here I use system dot o system dot IO dot file dot right I'll text now this can be used for anything you want what we usually do is we import it but sometimes you don't want to import it you can just use the long version of it and it will still work exactly the same way so let's go ahead and run this and see what kind of results we get so let's go ahead and write coding in Visual Basic is fun so when we click save file that we would click save file it opens up this save file dialog the default title is save as so let's go ahead and go to the desktop and we will save it as corn dot txt now you can also set filters so they can so that they can only save it as certain data types and we'll be going over that in later tutorials so it's going to be saved as corn dot Tex we'll go ahead and click Save and you can see here well you can't see it but I haven't filed on my desktop I'm it's dragging in right there so you can see it and let's go ahead and open that and you can see that says coding in Visual Basic is fun so what we did is we just created a savefile dialogue and if they have actually typed something in here this is going to go ahead and show that dialogue and it's going to write all the text of that into the file that they specified and from use the text from text box one so go ahead and practice a little bit with save file dialogues you can also change the attributes of them just like you could with the Open File dialogues and then once you've got those down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
