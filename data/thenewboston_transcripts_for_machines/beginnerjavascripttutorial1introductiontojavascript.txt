what is going on guys my name is bucky roberts and welcome to your very first javascript tutorial now for those of you who have no idea what javascript is javascript is basically a scripting language used to make web pages more interactive so for example if you have a web page and you maybe want to add a calculator to it or maybe you want to put a quiz on it or maybe you just want to have a navigation bar with some cool rollover buttons well in order to do this you need to use a special language called javascript and that's what i'm going to be teaching you guys but before i begin and we start typing javascript you guys need a couple things first the first thing you need is a text editor now any text editor will work fine but i'm going to use one called notepad plus plus now if you don't have this you can go ahead google and download it it's actually free and it's actually the one i recommend it's the best it's awesome again notepad plus plus go ahead type that into google and you'll be good to go another thing that you guys are going to need is a knowledge of xhtml and that's what this is right here if you guys don't know how to create a basic web page in xhtml then you need to watch that series first i made a xhtml and css tutorial series before this so if you don't know how to create a basic webpage go ahead and watch that it's on my youtube channel as well as on my website thenewboston.com so anyways once you have those two things then welcome to the world of javascript so let's go ahead and for all you guys let's begin me take a deep breath and get ready and let's go so like i said javascript is something that you add to web pages in order to make it more interactive so just like everything else in xhtml you need to add javascript through the use of tags now the tag for javascript is called script script now let me mention this in the internet there are a lot of different scripts that you can add to web pages there's javascript actually there's like 50 different types of scripting languages javascript is just one of them so when our browser comes across this code we need to tell explicitly that we're going to be working with javascript so in order to tell our browser that we need to give it an attribute called type and we set this equal to text slash javascript go ahead and end that and go ahead and add an ending script tag and in between these tags is where you're going to be typing all of your javascript code so that is javascript code it's not really but you know that's my example and in between here like i said all of our coding is going to be done so let's go ahead and actually let's write a real simple program right now um go ahead and copy me document dot right and inside parentheses with a semicolon at the end add quotation marks and write like hey now brown cow now i know you guys don't understand what this document right why we had parentheses or why we even have a semicolon at the end but for now i just want to make sure that javascript is set up in your browser and you're able to run it so let's go ahead and save this and go ahead and you can press run launch in chrome launching ie launch in whatever browser you want so let me go ahead and move this back and check out what we got hey now brown cow so as you can see javascript is working in my browser if anything like that pops up in your browser that means that well you're probably at school and they tried to block youtube or you know something so they probably took javascript off your browsers but anyways um make sure that you have javascript set up so if you see this that means you're good to go if you get an error message or don't see this at all that means that it's not working in your browser and you need to fix that so with that being said let me mention one more thing a lot of the older browsers like you know when they first started making the internet and web pages a lot of the browsers didn't understand javascript their main job was just to understand a basic html web page so whenever they try to read a program like this it's just going to come across and be like whoa what the heck is this i don't know so i'm just going to go ahead and type out what's ever in there and we want hey now brown cow to type out on our webpage we don't want this whole long string of text right here so if it's you know typing out something weird or something other than hey now brown cow that may be the issue is that you have an older browser and it doesn't understand what javascript is so anyways if you know that you're going to be making a webpage using javascript and a lot of people with older computers are going to be looking at it or if you know that your viewers have older browsers you might want to add a little safety check in order to protect against older browsers from trying to read this javascript go ahead and put the greater than sign or is that the less than sign i think that's a less than sign explanation point minus minus and when you're done with your javascript go ahead and press forward forward slash minus minus greater than sign now whenever older browsers come across this it's going to think that this is just a comment and it's just going to ignore it basically so go ahead and save this and refresh and see what we get you can see that since this is a new browser it's going to know not to ignore and it's going to be smart enough to know that this is indeed javascript but if i had an old browser it wouldn't type anything at all so that's a nice little safety check that you can use against older browsers it's going to work with or without it but for the sake of this tutorial since i know that i'm going to be using a new browser i'm going to go ahead and delete them because i mean we only have so much space here and that's just taking up space but anyways it's common practice or it's good practice to include those whenever you're typing javascript so i'm not but you might want to personal preference so anyways well that's probably all i need to teach you guys for this tutorial in the next tutorial we're probably going to be talking about comments and variables so anyways go ahead and uh you know just get javascript set up go ahead and include these tags and make sure that you uh you know try to test out this line of code and trust me i know you guys don't understand what's going on right now but now that you're set up you're ready to move on to the next tutorial so anyways thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to subscribe to my videos and i will see you guys well in the next tutorial
