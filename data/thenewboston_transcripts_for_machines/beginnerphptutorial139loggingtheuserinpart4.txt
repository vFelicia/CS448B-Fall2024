so let's insert some data so we'll say Billy uh password we'll just use as the same thing so pass one 2 three first name Billy last name Garrett let's click go and insert that data now you can see that um everything's done everything's worked we've got IDE of one for Alex and two for Billy so let's try logging each user in and we should return now we should return this user ID so Alex pass1 2 3 click login and it's returned a value of one now let's try Billy um pass 1 2 3 click login and it's returned a value of two so now we're logging the user in and we're also returning the user ID now why do we need this user ID the reason we need it is because we need to store it in a session in some session data so we can now then well we can then tell that the user has logged in and we can also use this ID to get any information we need from this table for example we can select the first name or the surname or both from say if we've stored one inside a session uh that would mean that Alex is logged in then we can get any data we need so these are the fundamentals of a user login system storing something that allows us to access data about our user which can change so one day I could log in as Alex and one day I could log in as Billy or another user could log in as Billy okay so let's um let's put this into a session now before we before we do that we need to define something in our core. in.php remember this is included at the very top of our index page core. in.php we need to say session start remember we need to do that for all sessions to be able to use them on pages so as long as we include this core. in.php on every file which we will be doing um at the very top then we're going to be able to log users in we also want OB start before that because what we're going to be doing is using header headers the header function to re redirect our user back to the index page when they've logged in correctly so we need OB start session start and now in here what we can do is we can say dollar uncore session um user ID equals user uncore ID so we've grabbed the user ID from the user that has correctly entered their username and password now we're storing it inside a session called session or called user ID okay now what we want to do is say header location and we want to go back to the index.php page we're already on that but this will just refresh it it will perform the checks to say is this user logged in and it will give us some data out so um okay so we're pretty much done there let's just um go back to our index.php P page um and we will create an if statement now let's assume um create statement else and then down here let's assume uh we'll ignore this for now let's assume that a a a a session called user ID has been set and it isn't empty now this means that the user has logged in because it means that we've gone through the process process of setting this to the user ID of the correct user that's logged in or the user that's correctly enter their details so all we need to do is say if is set dollor session user ID and not empty dollor session user ID so for any reason that a session called user ID has been set and it's not empty then um we still run this code well we we say is it not empty because we need it to be we need contain a value in that case we can say Echo you your logged in let's just Escape that single quotation mark otherwise we want to present present the user with the login form so let's just go through before I test this whole login process because we've pretty much logged a user in now so let's let me just test this or go through this in my head or not in my head but with you guys so um uh we'll start from this bit here we grab the user ID from the result of where we've already echoed this out so you know what it does we we've got one for Alex and two for Billy we set the session here so this session will now equal one if I login as Alex then we relocate to index.php so we're already on index.php cuz we've included this um we can even refresh now just to just to show you that we're still logged in so we're still not logged in now as soon as I type in Alex here and I type in pass one two3 here and I click login we're going to process everything that we've already talked about then we're going to locate back to index.php so I'm going to refresh the page essentially then this then this check is going to happen again but this time we have set session with the user ID uh key and it's not empty so we're going to say you're logged in so let's test that clicking login and now it says you're logged in no matter how many times we refresh this page the session is still set therefore we're still logged in so now you've essentially learned how to log a user in and that's basically it for logging a user in what you can now do is on any other page that you work with say you had a page called um I don't know um tutorials. PHP and you needed the user to be logged in you could use this line what you could do to make things easier and quicker is get rid of this inside here and create a function that allows you to quickly check if the user's logged in so let's go back to core. in.php and we're going to create a function called logged in and what we're going to do inside this function is we're going to say if we're going to do exactly the same as what we've done what we've just that we've just removed from uh index.php here but we're going to put it in a function so all we need to do is call this so if um if is Set uh everything set and it's not empty return true um and otherwise up here we can say return oh no probably not a good way to do it and we could say here else return false so if we are logged in we're going to return true otherwise we're going to return false so if you know about functions and if you've correctly learned about functions you'll know I can just put if logged in then it will say we're logged in because this will return true so this block will run if we return false we're going to include the login form so uh let's go back to the page and see if that works yep it still tells us that we are logged in
