hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this series of tutorials we're going to be creating a user login and registration system or rather a user registration and login system we're going to create the login process first then create the register system the registration system the reason you should do it this way is because you want to make sure your login is processed correctly before you start to register your users it just works out generally a lot better this way and obviously just a few notes before we begin I'm going to be creating the login and register system with just two fields and that is the username and the password in fact no will include the first name in the last name as well the reason I'm not going to include things like email address address or whatever you whatever else you're planning to store for your users is because if we spend a lot of time creating extra fields in the tutorial we're going to be wasting valuable learning time whereas once you've completed the tutorial and you understand how fields are created and how we can register users then you can obviously go ahead and input your own unique field form fields so the first thing we need to do we're not going to be writing any code in this tutorial we're going to be coming over to PHP myadmin I'm going to be setting up our table that we're going to store user data and then what we're going to do is pop a few sort of piece of dummy data in there if you like so we're going to register a couple of users manually using phpMyAdmin so the first thing i've done is i've already created my database in PHP myadmin you should know how to do this so I've created my database now I need to create a table I'm going to call this table just simply users now we need to determine how many fields we need to store so the first field I'm going to store is let's just blank this so we can write some notes I'm going to feel the first field I'm going to store is the ID this is obviously going to be the unique field this is going to be primarykey and it's going to be autoincrement as well we also need to start obviously the username the password it's popped over the first name and we'll say Serling so these are the four fields or five fields that we need to include in our program we can also include things like register day registration date but we're not going to do that for now like I said the purpose of the tutorial is to show you how to include everything and put everything together so let's go ahead and create these fields let's delete that first of all remember is five fields so we type five in there and click go okay so now to set up each field so ID is obviously going to be an integer because it's going to be an auto incrementing value so let's go ahead we that's int by default and go ahead and we're going to set the index to primary because it's a unique field in our table and also a I which stands for Auto increment so for every value that's created for every row that's created this will increment by one giving each user a unique number starting from one okay so the next one is username then we have password then we have firstname and also we have surname and so for the username and password we're going to pick a varchar' datatype the same with the first name in the last name so we can do these well while we're selecting the others okay so the username and password I'm going to give a limit of both 30 characters the first name and the surname I'm going to say 40 now obviously you can change these limits yourself you can change them to whatever you want I'm just doing this for sort of ease of use and teaching but I generally I'd say that a username or password shouldn't be more than 30 characters and a first name and surname should be more than 40 characters just in case we have an extra long name so we don't need to set any other properties for these we can go ahead and click Save down here and we'll just examine our structure of our table just to make sure everything's correct so we've got ID it's underlined to be no it's a primary key we've got auto increment on this under the extra and int is 11 characters that's up that you find this could be a small or medium int but we'll keep it this just in case we need to register lots and lots and lots of users username and password of both variable character variable characters and their length of 30 and first name and surname also variable characters and their length of 40 okay so with a set up our table let's go ahead and put some data inside of here now there's one thing to bear in mind we're going to be storing our password as an md5 hash that reminds me actually let's go back to our structure and let's change the password field here so let's click check that and then click the edit button let's change this to 32 now the reason we're changing this to 32 is we're storing the password as an md5 hash therefore an md5 hash will always or more or less always most of the time equal with the length of 32 so whatever sort of length that passed but it is our md5 hash will typically be 32 characters so we're storing a 32 character password in here because that will be the md5 hash and if you don't know what an md5 hashes or you don't know how to create one with PHP and take a look at my other tutorial on md5 hashes and that will sort of walk you through what how we relate that to passwords okay so let's go ahead and insert some data now there's a couple of things we need to do with the password we can't just enter a normal password in here we need to an input an md5 hash and you'll see later on when we register our users we're going to convert the password that they've entered in a text field to an md5 hash before we insert it into the database but for now I'm going to create a PHP script too quickly and convert a password that I want to manually put into here so my username is going to be Alex we'll leave the password blank for now I'm going put my first and surname in and the password is going to be equal to the value password so my password is going to read password in fact we'll we'll do pass pass one two three that's a lot better so we don't get confused between field name and the actual password so I'm going to echo out md5 and in here I'm going to put pass one two three and this is going to return the md5 hash okay so I can just copy that and paste that into my database so obviously you won't have to do this when you're registering your users and I'm going to click go okay so there let's click browse to make sure the data is in there okay so we've got ID of one that's automatically updated that for us that's an ID of one use name is Alex password is this hash which is equivalent to pass one two three or the hash of pass one two three firstname Alex and surname Garret okay so now that we've registered or manually register the user we are pretty much done setting up our database setting up our table rather and inserting this value so in the next part what we're going to be doing is logging this user on
