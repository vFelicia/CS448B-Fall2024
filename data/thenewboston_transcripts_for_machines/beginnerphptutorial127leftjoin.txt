hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dork and this is another video tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be looking at the left join inside of SQL statements that we've already looked at basically taking data from our database however what happens when we have say a table called people we've got a column called ID and we've got a column called name here or a field called idea in a field called name and each person is assigned an ID so this is an auto increment in primary key field we've got one representing Alex and two representing Dale and we've also got a table called pets now inside pets we have three fields and the first one's ID which just corresponds to an auto incrementing primary key so each each Val each record is unique we've also got people underscore ID now people on the squat ID corresponds to each person in the people database so rather than having a name in here we're using the unique the unique identifier of each person so one is Alex and two is Dales let's go over to pets and interpret this what we're essentially saying in this table is that alex has a pet cat and alex has a pet fish because we've got people ID one and one and we're also saying Dale has a dog okay so we've got one representing Alex and two representing Dale and we've got an entry called catfish and dog we're cat belongs to Alex fish belongs to Alex and dog belongs to Dale ok so ignore this ID here for now in this column all we need to focus on is people ID pet obviously explicit what we're going to be echoing out or retrieving rather and also in the people table we've got an idea of one for Alex an idea of two Fidel so hopefully this makes sense if it doesn't rewind the video and have another look now what are we going to be doing so it's fair enough we've got all this data but what we want to do is we want to join results so we can echo out who has what pet at the moment they're stored in separate tables let me just talk to you about why they're stored in the tables when you're working in in PHP you're going to most likely want to reference someone's name with it's their ID so therefore by storing it as an ID here we can use an inner join statement or sorry a left join in this case to identify values that exist in this table here in this people table we're going to say 1 + 2 is going to match this here so we're going to echo out essentially we're going to echo out in the end Alex twice with the cat and fish and dog so Alex is going to be replaced by 1 1 + 2 is going to be replaced by Dale so let's have a look at the SQL query in how we might do this so we'll run through this and then we'll have a look at the results now it's slightly different so when we're accessing different tables data when we're doing our Select query so we're going to say select but this time what we're going to do something dot something and we do this because we can reference it from a particular table so you might say select people dot name let's just open up this in a new tab so we can see what's going on so we want to say people so the table is called people and dot name so is people dot name so it's from the people table and the field name and we also want to select from the pets table let's just open this up we want to select pet pet so essentially what we want to be displaying will be written here so we want to display the people from the people table we want to display the name and from the pets table we want to display pet which is the name of the pet now we want to say from people so we want to inner joy out we want to left join so we want to join this pet table onto this where the left column exists or the the left day exists in the right so we want to say where this ID here is equal to to this people ID here so we do this in a slightly odd way so we say from people we say left join and the table we want to join so pets we want to join pets so select from people left join pets and then we want to say on and this is the condition that it's on so the condition is that the ID here ID one or two matches people ID so we can come back and we can say on people dot ID is equal to pets dot people ID so we're saying on the condition that people do ID which is here is equal to pets people ID so inside the pet table people ID so let's go ahead and copy and paste this just in case we lose I'll copy this rather to the clipboard and we'll click go now you can see that what it's done is it's returned the name column or field if you like and the pet and what we've actually got here is Alex owns a cat alex owns of fish and downloads a dog so we've taken data from two different tables and joined it but by only using one SQL statement now why would we want to do this why we could in PHP we could say loop through and then within a loop we could do another query looking for this ID and then represent that data the reason we don't do this is it slows everything down by just using one query as opposed to two queries you will already have the processing time of them queries as a whole so it's obviously a lot better to only use one query rather than using two different queries and we don't just have left join we have right join and inner join as well so we can use these in different ways and I'll be display explaining that in other tutorials but for now this is the left join in how we're going to use it so if you have app data in another table that's represented by say an ID from another table then you now know to use left join to basically join two tables
