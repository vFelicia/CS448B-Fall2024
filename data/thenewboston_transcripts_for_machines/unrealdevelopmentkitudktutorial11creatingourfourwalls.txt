all right guys welcome to your 11th udk tutorial and in this tutorial now that we got our floor built it's time to start putting up some walls so what I'm going to do is first of all I'm going to Envision that we're building a little house here and instead of putting up four walls that cover the entire length and the entire width of this house I'm going to leave some space in front for you know a front deck or front porch whatever you want to call it so I'm not going to be just enclosing this totally I'm going to be leaving some space for a porch I think that'll make things a little more interesting so let's go ahead and the first thing I want to do is let's go ahead and build these short walls right here as you know we got a short length and a long length or AKA width and length so I'm going to be taking care of those shorter walls first so go ahead and we first want to make sure that we first want to check the properties of our floor to make sure the dimensions on what we should build are short wall so we already know the width of this is 1024 and that's this right here the X so we can go ahead and leave that right there we already know that the length of it is let's see what it is 1280 and check it out since we're building a short wall we only want to have the length be like 32 so let's go ahead and change this to 32 and now for z z is the height now we can pick anything we want for height I'm going to make my walls let's just say 576 tall so let's go ahead and if we build this an X out of it we can see that this is a pretty good height so we could go ahead and position this wall in this perspective view right here but as you can see it's kind of confusing so it would probably be better to do this go ahead and in your front view go ahead and drag this up until your wall sits exactly on the base of your floor that's probably the easiest either using this side view in the top left or front view where you can position your wall another thing you want want to do is you want to slide it all the way back to your very back corner and probably if we scroll in here let me just drag up a little bit we can position this wall exactly on the very back Edge so that way you can see that these graph views as I like to come them they aren't totally useless I know they don't look really pretty but whenever we're doing Precision movement they actually come in handy so with that being said my wall looks good in all my angles let me verify this top view front view side view and perspective view it looks pretty good so I'm going to go ahead and hit CSG add and add my wall right there now let me go ahead and show you guys a little trick in order to build another wall let me go ahead and actually maybe I'll change the angle of this a little bit right there might look good in order to build another wall we basically need an exact duplicate of this so what we can do is we can take this red Builder brush and we can can move it and we can build it again but I want to teach you guys a little trick in order to make an exact copy of a shape you already have go ahead and select that shape and now if you go ahead and hold alt on your keyboard and go ahead and drag it forward we can get an exact copy of that shape so let me go ahead and hit release there and that actually looks pretty good right there I actually want to drag it back just a bit let's see I probably want to drag it back I don't know maybe right there and actually I hit all again so let's go ahead and drag that back right there and I think it looks pretty good right there I want to get it lined up perfectly so this gives us enough space for a porch right here and also gives us a nice space for the inside right here so you're saying all right Bucky so what you did is you dragg that wall but we're not having a duplicate wall so the reason behind that is because remember in a couple tutorials ago I told you guys anytime you update your geometry you have to rebuild it so go ahead and build geometry for Visible level and close that and whenever we do that we see we indeed get a wall pretty cool huh so now let me tell you guys another little trick so before what we needed to do is we needed to calculate how big how tall we pretty much needed to calculate the size of the wall well now what we need to do is we we need to figure out the length between this wall right here and this wall right here so what we could do is you know maybe we want to go to the grid and count yada yada y yada maybe this grid will be easier to count but I want to show you guys a nice little shortcut in order to measure two distances on your grid what you need to do is you need to go ahead and select a point on your grid and then hold the middle Mouse button and this middle Mouse button is kind of like a tape measure go ahead and click it and hold it and drag it it and now once you start dragging it you can see that all right the distance between these two walls is 896 so that's how long I need to make my third wall again one more time anytime you want to measure the point between two points or the distance between two points rather hold your middle Mouse button and drag and it's kind of like a virtual tape measure 8.96 that's how big I need to make it and just to verify 896 divided by 32 that divides evenly so makes sense so now let's go ahead and select our red Builder brush and go ahead and rightclick it and now let's go ahead and change this so the length x remember if we scroll down here we can see that the length or X is going to be pretty much the width of the wall so we want to change that to 32 and now the y That's the length we calculated that's the 896 and also that that Z the Z shouldn't change because remember Z is height and again if you get confused look down here in in the bottom left hand corner and that's going to give you idea of what x z and y means so it's 32 thickness the length is 896 and the height just like the other wall is 576 so go ahead and hit build what did I say build well not uh not the funniest thing to say but all right so we can like I said position this in the perspective view right here but I'm going to go ahead and position mine in the top view so go ahead and move this over to the top view scroll in make sure it's positioned nicely and another thing I want to do is in my side view check it out it's not exactly hitting the ground so go ahead and move this down in our side view and if we look in all our views right now we can see that this wall is perfectly lined up on the side on the front on the top and it looks pretty dang good in our perspective view too so go ahead and hit CSG ad and it's going to add that geometry pretty cool huh so now let's go ahead and get our red build brush out of the way and what I want to do is go ahead and highlight this in our side view and I'm going to use that copy shortcut again so actually is this the best VI you to do so well let's go ahead and do this let's move our red Builder brush out of the way right here and probably the top view would be the easiest although you could do it in the side view again like I said anytime you want to copy this wall exactly highlight the wall make sure you don't have your red Builder brush selected make sure you have your wall selected in the outline will be blue hold down alt on your keyboard and go ahead and drag it until it ends up where you want to copy it and go ahead and let go so if we go ahead and scroll in we can verify that actually I messed up a little bit let's go ahead and drag that to it matches up and make sure you verify in all of your angles the front view the side view and the top view and also might as well just verify in the perspective view that looks good and once it does you're ready to move on so the last thing you probably want to do is build this so go ahead and build your geometry and indeed we get a nice looking house with four walls again what I'm going to be doing in the upcoming tutorials is I'm going to be adding a door in front and you know maybe add him some pillars for the porch and of course we need a roof as well or else it's going to rain on us so we have a basic shape of a house done a couple things you need to take away from this tutorial is make sure if you ever get confused you don't know what length width height is go ahead and just look in the bottom left and that's going to give you the idea of what X Y and Z is and also anytime you want to copy make sure to hold all on your keyboard and drag the shape that you want to copy and you're not going to see it at first until you rebuild your geometry so make sure your geometry is rebuilt so there we have the beginning of our nice little house it kind of looks like a Super Mario Brothers Top Hat you know how his Hat's like kind of Square anyways I'm just talking to myself though so thank you guys for watching and uh yeah I'll see you guys in the next video
