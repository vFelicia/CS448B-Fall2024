okay so we're going to talk about perimeter and ratios and we kind of already did this when we did similar triangles but this time we're just going to talk about similar figures in general so in similar figures the ratio of the perimeters is equal to the ratio of any pair of sides so just like a triangle we're going to pair corresponding sides to find the ratio so we're going to take one the little side of this square or one side of this little square and two one side of this bigger square and that's our ratio so that means the perimeter is also going to have a onehalf ratio so we're going to do two things we're going to find the perimeter of this which is one plus one plus one plus one so the perimeter of the little triangle is four and then we're going to put an x on here to find out what the perimeter of the big square is going to be so if we cross multiply we get 8 is equal to X so the perimeter of this bigger square has to be eight so we're going to check that by actually finding the perimeter so 2 plus 2 is 4. plus 2 is 6 plus 2 is 8. so yes this is right and we could have done it the other way and found the perimeter of the big Square first and then solved through the little square so now we're going to do some examples okay find the missing perimeter so they tell us that the ratio of the sides is three to four so we're going to do two different things and you can solve it either way so if they have a three to four ratio and this side is 3 and this is the smaller triangle or sorry Square that means this side which corresponds to this side on this triangle or sorry Square has to be 4. so knowing that I can find the perimeter of this one by finding the perimeter of this one so we're going to take 3 4 which is the ratio of their sides and their perimeters and we're going to set it equal to the perimeter of this one over the unknown perimeter of this Square so first we have to find the perimeter of this Square so three plus three is six plus three is nine plus three is twelve so 12. so then we're going to cross multiply I get 48 X so then you get X is equal to 16. so the perimeter of this big one is 16. Now find the perimeter knowing that they have a two to one ratio so the first number is this big triangle because this is this triangle is has a two to one ratio to this one meaning this is two times as big to one which is this triangle now you might say that looks funny because this is a four and this is a two and not a 2 to a one but if you put the big triangle over the little triangle and you simplified by dividing by two you get two to one so we want to find the perimeter of this little triangle so we're going to find the perimeter of this big triangle first and these are all similar figures so that means that they're all they've they fit all the requirements so we can do this kind of problem so we're gonna set two over one is equal to four plus four which is eight plus four which is twelve twelve over X if we cross multiply we get 2x is equal to 12 divide by 2 you get X is equal to 6. well that's all we're gonna do for today but make sure you come back because in the next unit we're gonna start talking about parts of a square and that's going to help us so we can do area of shapes
