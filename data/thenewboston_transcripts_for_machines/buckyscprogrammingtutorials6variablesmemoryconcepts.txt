what's going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your sixth C++ tutorial and in this tutorial I want to go over some concepts with variables that are definitely going to help you it later on so the first thing I want to go over is this you remember in the last tutorial where I told you guys that there basically two different ways to create variables the first way is to create a variable called tuna or something and set it equal to a value like 43 all on one line simple enough easy to understand well what I also told you guys you can do is you can declare AKA create it on one line and set it equal to a value on another line such as that they're both perfectly acceptable ways to do things the one thing I wanted to stress is that whenever you do this way declare it on one line instead of equal to value on another line you don't need to write what type of variable it is again once you give C++ the information of what type of data you're working with you don't need to list it every time you're working with a variable C++ will remember that information and you know it'll keep it so whenever you're working with tuna later on you don't need to explicitly write int and actually you can't or else it'll give you error message so just make sure that you know just remember that don't write int twice on the same variable so aside from that let me show you guys this in tuna equals 99 so later on and I didn't tell you guys this but what you can do is if you set tuna equal to something else notes like 76 whenever your computer creates a variable it sets aside a piece of memory to store that value in this case 99 well whenever you create or excuse me whenever you use that variable again and set it equal to a new value what your computer is going to do is it's going to wipe out the old value in order to make room for the new value so now you said all right we have a variable called tuna and that's equal to 99 well now we have a variable called tuna and we want to set this equal to 76 well all right so we're going to try to print out tuna and our computer is going to say all right should I print out 99 or 76 well since we created one originally that was 99 and then we over wrote it to make it 76 it's going to print out 76 so let's go ahead and build and run this and see what we get 76 so basically whenever you have a value it's placed in a memory location and then whenever you give that variable a new value it's going to overrate the old value and put it in the same location so I just want to tell you guys that this is how you can overwrite variables so if you're expecting 99 and you got 76 this is why so that's actually all I have for you guys for this tutorial again the two things I want to stress is whenever you're creating a variable you only write the type once you don't need to write it every single time and then whenever you need to reassign a value you just go ahead and write the variable name and not the type again and also whenever you're overwriting a variable you use the variable and it's going to be equal to the latest value so whenever you you know set this equal to 76 it's going to wipe out the 99 and use the 76 so I just wanted to stress those you know a couple memory Concepts So then whenever we're building programs later on you might have a better understanding of how it works so for now that's all I have for you guys in the next tutorial you know how I said that we're going to be going over arithmetic like how to add two numbers together well there's actually a bunch of different arithmetic operators that we need to learn and that's what we're going to be covering in the next tutorial but for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you the next video
