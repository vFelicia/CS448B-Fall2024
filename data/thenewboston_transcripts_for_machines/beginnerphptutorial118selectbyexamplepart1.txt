hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another video for the new Boston now we've already looked at selecting data from our database and we did this using the code here if you haven't already looked at the previous tutorial that explains this code and you're not comfortable looking at this code and understanding what it does I suggest you go back and view that tutorial as well as if you haven't looked at the general tutorial on queries and using MySQL then I recommend you view them as well now what we've done here is we've selected a specific field names from this table called food where unhealthy equals u and calories equals zip r700 so we've been quite specific and in this case we've only retrieved one value that's the icecream value here with the ID of four now what we want to do is be able to take user input in order to return specific values so let's say I want the user to be able to specify if they want a list of unhealthy food or healthy food or maybe if they want to specify a maximum or minimum calorie amount but for now we're just going to go for the unhealthy healthy food option and then the rest of that will be self explanatory for your own purposes so we're going to keep the code we've already got here let's just tidy this up a bit so it's a bit more combined if I will separate it just so it's easier to view okay so what we now want to do is take user input so we want to come down here or in fact up to the top we could do let's just cut off this require here and reopen a tag there for the rest of the PHP and we can put our HTML in here now I'm going to create a form and that's going to have an action of the page that we're going the world at the moment and the method is going to be get just so we can see what's going on in the URL bar at the top because eventually what we're going to be aiming for is something like Ronnie index dot PHP I want to aim for something like you H equals you for unhealthy or H for healthy so we're using this get variable here to specify a value so what we want to do is we want to create a field and I'm going to say I'm going to create a select field and this is going to be called an you H and and inside we're going to have our option so we need option we're going to have a first option and we're going to have a second option and these options are unhealthy or healthy I can spell it correctly so option value equals we'll just say you and option value equals H so now let's create a submit button we'll go down a couple of lines and say input type equals submit and the value of that can just be a submit so that's what's being displayed to the user and we'll add something that's a bit more userfriendly so choose a food type I guess that would be fine okay so let's um let's first of all okay we'll leave that for now so let's press f5 and choose a food type and unhealthy or healthy now ignore this for now because in the PHP code we've got a static a quit a static query which we which we predefined so ignore this for now but eventually what our form will do is it will produce a list of foods depending on what the user selects here so now what we're doing is as well as creating our query we're allowing the user to specify things that they want to return this is really useful in today applications so I'm going to click on unhealthy and click submit and you can see that up here we've got you h equals u and here we can say healthy click Submit u H equals H so it was we're processing get data through to the URL and then we can process that in our query so how do we do this well the first thing we need to do is inside our PHP here we need to check if these values have been submitted so I'm going to say if is set dollar underscore get u H then proceed with all of this code here and then what we can do is indent everything we've already got inside just so it looks a lot nicer so in them that so if is set get you H and not empty dollar underscore get you H now what we can do is we can say you H equals dollar underscore get you H now let's um let's kill the script there and echo this out so we know we can we're basically testing for this being submitted so we'll refresh the page back to index.php okay so we've got nothing there now as we've killed the page choose a food type unhealthy or healthy so let's select unhealthy first and we should be submitted and a you here for unhealthy and now healthy submit and we've got an H there okay so now what we can do is we can insert this value that's selected into our query to allow the query to become more dynamic and select the food type either whether unhealthy or healthy depending on the users input now before we start this there is a problem that we do have here and we have a potential for SQL injection and I have a video on SQL injection in this new book for this series for the new Boston so have a look at that video before you run anything like this on a live web server because you'll tend to find that queries can be modified using data so for example if I was submitting this this H value here is eventually going to go into a query so I could change this to something it wouldn't be select star but just for example I could change that so we can input different things into our query that doesn't make sense now it will do in a moment so input equals H that's a good point actually let's also make this our STR all know maybe this STR to lower so it always converting this to lowercase in case people try to modify the URL and anything like that
