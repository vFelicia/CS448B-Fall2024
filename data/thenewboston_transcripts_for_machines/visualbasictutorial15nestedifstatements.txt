hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at nested if statements now in the last tutorial we covered else if statements and else and now if you don't know what an if statement is I would suggest you move on back to one of my earlier earlier tutorials and learn from that note and once you know what an if statement is then go ahead and move on to this tutorial so basically what a nested if statement is is that you take one if statement and then you put another if statement inside of this and what that does is it makes it to where both values have to be true for the condition for the program inside of the inner loop to run so let's go ahead and create a little example of this so we're going to go ahead and declare a variable and this variable is going to be their age so dim age as integer and we'll set it equal to nothing so just in case they don't type anything we won't get an error when we try to print out their age now we're going to create insurance so we're going to dim has insurance as boo lien and we're going to go ahead and set that equal to nothing too so now what we're going to do is we're going to ask them what their age is so we'll do console dot write line what is your age now we're just going to set the variable age to whatever they type in so H equals console dot readline now we're going to ask them if they have insurance so we'll do console dot write line do you have insurance true or false and will do has insurance equals console dot read line now this will not work if they type anything other than true or false your program will get an error and it will crash but this is just for the second visit of a tutorial so now we're going to create our if statement so if age equals 16 then we want to do whatever is inside of this if statement so now we're going to create an if statement side of this which is called the nested if statement so if has insurance equals true then we want to do the code inside of this will just type console dot write line you can drive legally now what we're going to do is we're going to cover the case of them not having surance so we're just going to go ahead and type else so if age is equal to 16 and has insurance is equal to false because the only other option we have for has insurance is false we're going to type console.writeline you can drive but don't get pulled over or you are screwed ok so now if we run this it's going to go ahead and say what is your age so we'll type in 16 and I'll say do you have insurance true or false so if I say true it's going to say you can drive but don't it'll say it'll say you can drive legally now you can see that it closed out right after we did that so we'll just console dot readline so it gives us time to read that before we can close the program and I'll say what is your age so I'll say 16 and I do have insurance so it'll say you can drive legally now if I type in 16 for age and false for do you have insurance it'll say you can drive but don't get pulled over or you are screwed and now if my age is not equal to 16 let's say 12 then I'll say do you have insurance true or false I say false it's not going to say anything because the first value is not true so it won't move on to the next stuff inside of the nested loop so what we're going to do is we're going to add a simple else right here so if H is equal to 16 then do the stuff in here and else console dot write line you cannot drive so if we type in 12 here and then type in false it'll say you cannot drive now there is a better way to do this by using what's called conditional operators and logical operators but I wanted to you guys I wanted to teach you guys how to make nested if statements in the next couple tutorials we will be learning conditional operators and the use for this is that age has to be equal to 16 and if they are any older than 16 then it won't work so if I say 21 they can legally drive but it says you cannot drive so the way to get around this is to use conditional operators so make some nested if statements get used to them and once you've got those nailed down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
