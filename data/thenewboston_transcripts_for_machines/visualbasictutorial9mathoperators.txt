hello YouTube Sam from youtube.com slash on live gamer here for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at simple math operators so let's go ahead and get started we're going to come up here into our code and we're going to start off by declaring a variable now we're going to want to make an integer so I'll do num1 as integer then we'll go ahead and set that equal to 5 or here let's not that set that equal to anything yet so the number 1 equals 5 plus 5 so now if we come down here and print out num1 on the console it's going to give us the output of 10 what we can also do is use the parameters of writeline to add numbers to num1 so what I mean by this is let's say we have num1 we want to print out num1 plus 5 so when we run this we should get 15 now if we come up here we can also subtract 5 so num 1 equals 5 minus 5 that's going to give us the value of 0 and now if we print that out let's go ahead and take this out if we print that out here we get 0 we can also do division so 2 divided in Visual Basic and this is the same throughout mostly all languages you're going to use the forward slash so if we divide 5 by 5 we're going to get the value 1 and to multiply you just use the asterisk so 5 times 5 is equal to 25 right there and now we can also do the power so 5 to the power of 2 is going to equal 25 and if we do 5 to the power of 3 we're going to get what is it 125 so here we go 125 right there now what we can also do is what's called modulus now this is a little tricky for some people to understand but I'll try to explain it the best I can what modulus does is it will divide two integers for you and then give you the remainder so if we knew 5 mod 2 so so what happens when you divide 5 by 2 you're going to get 2 with a remainder of 1 and since we're using integers we can't get decimals so we're going to get a remainder so now if we run this you can see that it prints out 1 we can also add variables to each other so if we declare num1 as an integer and we set it equal to 4 we can declare a second variable let's call this 1 num2 and we'll create an integer and we'll set it equal to 8 and now if we print out num1 plus num2 it's going to give us the value of 12 this also works for all of the other operators that we've seen we can multiply them together which will give us the value of 32 and what we can do is we can create a third variable here let's just do that create a third variable and we'll call it answer and we'll make it an integer and we'll set it equal to or first off we'll set it equal to nothing now basically what nothing is is if you've learned any other languages it's equivalent to no so answer instead of not assigning answer a value we're just going to set it equal to nothing and you can see that it won't give us a warning here so if we take this out we get a warning but since we assign it to nothing which is equivalent to no we don't get a warning here and that will prevent errors from possibly happening in the future so then down here we'll just type answer equals num1 divided by now in our case in this program we didn't have to set this equal to nothing but I just wanted to throw that in there so you guys would know what it is and be able to use it later on in your programs so answer equals num1 divided by num2 so if we write out answer we are going to get zero so if you do 4 divided by 8 you get a decimal number and since integers can't can't they can't implicitly convert themselves to decimals it's just going to give you zero so let's go ahead and change this to multiply and we're going to get 32 now since before we got zero by dividing them by each other we're going to show you how to fix this what we're going to do is instead of making them integers we're going to make them doubles over here we don't have to make those doubles we can make the answer a double so now since our answer can have decimal numbers if we divide num1 by num2 we will get 0.5 so take a look at some of these math operators play around with them with doubles integers you can use a byte you can use a long you can use anything just play around with these math operators get used to them and then once you've got that down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching don't forget to comment like and subscribe
