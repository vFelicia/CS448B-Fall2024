and then in that case we can display the appropriate error in here so we're going to take a look at the error event and apply this to the Ajax options option so we're going to specify Ajax options options and this is going to be again in curly braces so I'm gonna supply the error option and this is going to be a function or the error event sorry within our Ajax options and this function is going to take in xhr index status and anchor now we don't require xhr index status but we do require anchor unfortunately we have to supply these parameters as well in order to be able to use this anchor so if we do return an error what do we want to do well we want to go ahead and place an error inside of our area so essentially what we want to do is place at the error inside of here so we need to reference anchor hash and then we can apply some HTML or some text into there and the text I'm going to apply in is could not load page so let's go ahead and just break this up a little bit just so it looks a bit neater let's bring this down here and then let's go ahead and bring this down here just so it doesn't look as messy let's check here and come down there and this error function here can go ahead and come down as well so it's important that you lay everything out correctly so we you know have it looking nice and then our additional options for tabs can then be supplied after this so they will be supplied here so we can again come and bring this down after you're done so now what's kind of happen is we've set Ajax options and we've called the error status or the error yeah I guess before that status the terminology doesn't really matter and then we're taking the the specific area that we're placing this into so the anchor that's applied to it and then we're just putting could not load page into there let's go ahead and refresh all the rest work when I click loop it says could not load page because we're trying to load that loop dot PHP file that I put into the link earlier here so now that we go and now we're going to go ahead and actually create this loop page so I'm inside the PHP folder I'm gonna store this as loop PHP now inside here I'm just going to create a just a simple loop that's going to run through numbers 1 to 10 so we're going to say 4x equals 1 while X is greater than or equal to 10 add 1 to X and then we're going to echo out X and as well as that a line break just use a comma here so this essentially doesn't really matter if you don't know what this code does or how it works but it loops through numbers 1 to 10 echoes out 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 with a break on the end of that so now when we actually click on a loop you'll see that the PHP file has been executed in into this content area so we're using an ajax call to actually grab the contents of loop PHP so it's extremely easy to load external files just by putting them in the href as opposed to using a hash selector and selecting the particular div that you want to show so that's an interesting part about this as well obviously more Ajax options can be defined there I do have an ajax tutorial in this series so you can go ahead and check that out but yeah apart from that we're just gonna be using error I guess that's appropriate in here okay so let's go ahead and take a look at some more options that we can give this the first one we're going to be looking at is event now by default we need to actually click on tabs to have them loaded what about if we want to roll over the tabs and they load automatically as we roll over well with the event option we can go ahead and supply something like mouse over and now when we refresh when we actually hover our cursor over these tabs the content displays so depending on sort of like how you want everything to work and how accessible you want each option to be you can go ahead and implement this option it's quite a nice idea just depending on and you know how you want your user to view things and if you want them to be able to click on them or hover over so let's go ahead and get rid of that for now while we go on to the next option and I'm going to choose this next option which is collapsible collapse Dibble and I'm going to set this option to true okay so let's go ahead and refresh the page you'll see that now each option is collapsible if we double click on it so we can select tabs as usual and display content as we normally would however we can go ahead and collapse the content as well if we click on the same tab that's currently open so I can collapse that content and it's no longer in view so this would be more useful for example something that a user wants to you well let's just take the example let's say you had a few of these under each other for example particular settings for a user if the user no longer wants to see this they could just click that and they could work on the rest of the page obviously this takes up quite a bit of space in terms of if you wanted to keep your page nice and short so the collapsible option is quite a good idea in that case so the next thing we're going to look at is making these tabs sortable so for this we're not supplying an option but to the end of here where we're binding on some a couple of functions that are going to allow us to be source of all so the end of this tabs just here we want to go ahead and make these sortable now usually we would go ahead and say sortable we've already looked at sortable lists etc and we can supply it with the option access X because we only want to be able to sort along the x axis now if we take a look at this you'll see that essentially what we want to do is be able to say put loupe at the start of all these and the rest shuffle along however if you take a look at just using sortable and axes Eck's you'll notice that when we pick this up it moves the entire row of tabs so it looks a bit messy and it's you know so not really working very well it looks a bit uh you know messy there's no real functionality to it it wouldn't allow you to really do much
