hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we are taking the example of scroll top and we're using this to allow us to disable a check box in this case I have a text area here with just some fake Latin terms and conditions in the I've sort of seen this effect listed on a few websites where you have to scroll to the bottom of a text area in order for a particular check box to be enabled to actually agree to these terms and conditions at the moment this check box is disabled and I'm clicking on it at the moment and I can't actually check it so essentially what I have to do is scroll all the way to the bottom for this check box to become enabled then I can say you know continue with registration or however this works in this case this is obviously just an example so what I'm going to do is go ahead and scroll all the way to the bottom and you'll see that when I do reach the bottom this check box now becomes available and I can go ahead and click on it now we're going to be using the scroll top function in jQuery to do this but we're going to need to you know make some additional calculations because it's not as easy as it appears because we've styled this particular a text area a certain height we can't just return the height a new scroll top to actually calculate this we're going to need to do some additional calculation so we'll go back to our text editor or go over to our text editor and start writing this out okay so we're over 12 text editor we are in index dot PHP which just literally has this text area here with the text inside and then underneath we've got a check box with the ID of agree the textarea ID is terms so we can use these two both reference each one and yeah that's it really we've just got a check box we've also got an ext J's file it's just it is essentially an external javascript file we've also included style dot CSS to style this text area let's just take a look at Starks CSS all I've done is giving it height here and a width here so that just makes it look like you you saw when I showed you the example and obviously yeah like I said we have expects TDOT J s which is our external javascript file so inside our external javascript file we want to go ahead and initially disable the check the text the checkbox sorry first of all if we go over to our browser you can see that at the moment it's enabled by default and nothing's really happening here in terms of functionality so the first thing we want to go ahead and do is actually disable this I'm gonna do this after the document is ready so I'm going to use document dot ready and inside create the function of the code that I'm going to run once the dom is available so the first thing we want to do is set an attribute to this agree agree checkbox to disable it so what we do is we say reference this with hash and agree so we're using a ID selector and we just want to set an attribute of this and that attribute is disabled and the value of that is disabled so when we go return to our browser and refresh this check box has been automatically disabled and we can't do anything and obviously still we don't have any functionality here okay so now what we want to go ahead and do is create an event handler for when this text area has a scroll event ie when we pull the scrollbar down or back up again so when we do scroll we want to then you know make some calculations get some heights and everything and then obviously perform an if statement to remove the attribute disabled if it's at the correct height so let's go ahead and select terms which is our text area obviously over here our idea of terms and we want to go ahead and append the scroll event handler to this now inside here we create a another function and all the code inside of here will be that that is run when we actually perform a scroll so when we scroll up or down so let's go ahead and create some variables and set some values to this then then like I'll explain about a bit about how it works so the first one is the text area height and this is equal to the obviously our terms or we could just say this because we've already selected the terms here so this will be this and then afterwards array key 0 and then dot scroll height now let's go ahead and alert this to the user in fact no that's probably not a good idea let's go ahead and create a temporary div just down here just so we can get some information fed back to us so I'm just going to call this I did feedback so we want to say selecting feedback apply the text to this as text area underscore height so we'll be constantly feeding back this value so when we scroll down you can see that it is just literally given us a height which is 7 to 4 now this obviously doesn't match the value that we have in style dot CSS but this is the height of the entire inside so the scrollable area essentially but this it still is inaccurate because we need to go ahead and remove or minus the inner height and that essentially means that it will match up to the correct value
