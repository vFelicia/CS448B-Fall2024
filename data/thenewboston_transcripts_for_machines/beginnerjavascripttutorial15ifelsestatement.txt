all right guys it's Bucky and welcome to your 15th JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial like I said we're going to be going over a kind of more complex if statement so in the last tutorial I showed you guys how to make a basic if statement and we pretty much gave it a test and if that test was true it ran a bit of code but if that test was false then it didn't do anything well now are we're going to be doing it is telling it if it's false instead of not doing anything give it another op option so if it's true do this if it's false do that so before we said if it's true do this if it's false do nothing and now we're saying if it's true do this if it's false do that so pretty simple we're pretty much making it do something no matter what so let's go ahead and make well let me show you guys the basic syntax of this in order to make an if else statement and that's what this is called if else we go ahead and read if statement and we're going to give it a test right here if that test is true we're going to run this bit of code right here let's say we have document write um and just write like I love Hot Pockets good enough so now if this test is true we run this bit of code just like we did before this is exactly identical but now let's stick another piece onto this we're going to go ahead and write the word else now go ahead and add brackets for this and instead of doing nothing if to test this false it's going to do this this bit of code right here so document right um I love nah let's give it something like I love strawberry so this is an unhealthy and this is healthy so you know we got kind of a contrast going on there so now let's go ahead and give it a really simple test let's just go ahead and test two numbers can't be easier than that so if 2 equals 2 and remember we can't use one equal sign we have to use two because we only use one equal sign whenever we're setting a variable equal to a value whenever we're just testing two values to make sure they equal each other we use two equal signs so right now we're saying all right if 2 equals 2 do this if two doesn't equal two do this so let's go ahead and save it and refresh it and see what it says I love Hot Pockets so that's why the first one got executed but what if they didn't equal each other what if saying all right if 2 equals 65 well we know that 2 does not equal 65 just doesn't make sense so I was going to say all right if 2 equal 65 do this well it doesn't so I'm not going to do that so I guess I have to do this I love strawberries so let's go ahead and save this and see what we get I love strawberries just as we thought so aside from having just two values equal each other we can have two variables equal each other for example if we had um VAR uh blue equal 43 and VAR red equal 76 then we can go ahead and we can test if blue is equal to Red which they aren't so it's going to say I love strawberries right here check it out I love strawberries but if they are equal to each other 43 and 43 who I have 743 check it out I love Hot Pockets so again this is more common to compare two variables against each other you can also take a variable and compare it to a number at 43 = 43 just like that I love Hot Pockets so aside from this what you can do is you can use all your other comparison operators too if 43 is not equal to 43 then let's see what happens it says I love strawberries so you're saying all right if 43 is different than 43 do this well I'm not going to do that because they're the same so if they're the same go ahead and do this and that's why I pr now I love strawberries now let's go ahead and uh test are greater than letin and 587 and 43 so if blue is greater than 43 or let's go ahead and type red right there so if 58 7 is greater than red go ahead and do this if 507 587 is not greater than red go ahead and do this so since it is greater than red and 587 is more than 43 it's going to go ahead and print out I love Hot Pockets if I go ahead and save that right there I love Hot Pockets and of course we can do less than less than or equal to greater than or equal to double equals not equals and all those good stuff but anyways that's the point I'm trying to make an IFL statement is basically this let me go ahead and cut this an if statement pretty much takes a test and if it's true it runs a bit of code if it's not true it doesn't do anything what an if El statement does is it pretty much gives you that second option if it's not true instead of not doing anything run this bit of code instead so either way your computer is going to get stuck doing something where as before if it wasn't true it could Escape take the easy way out and do nothing so there you have it a basic IFL statement and why they are useful and what they do so don't forget to go over your comparison operators make sure you understand all of those and make sure you understand the basics of an if else statement you pretty much are giving your computer a decision you're either going to do this or do this based on a test so now that you understand that you're ready to move on to the next topic and that is things might get confusing but it's actually nesting so things might get a little rough but trust me you need to understand the next topic it's going to be extremely helpful to you so thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
