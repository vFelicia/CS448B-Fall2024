hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about initializing a raise with values now if you remember from the previous tutorials we created an array called string classes and then when we went through and we assigned a value to each one of those we assigned a ya value to each one of the indexes in that array now this could take a lot of time and there's an easier way to do this by adding those values to the array when you initialize the array so we'll go ahead and open up our arrays project I'm go ahead and zoom in some and we will find string classes right here okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to come down here and find form one load and you can see under form one load it takes all of our indexes and string classes and it sets a value to them now we don't need this we can go ahead and assign it so that when the program is built it's automatically that all of the strings in the indexes of string classes I already have a value and they aren't set at for one load they are just there so we'll go ahead and to assign values you set you declare your array as string or int or whatever you want and then you add two curly braces and now you're going to have to since we're using a string we'll go ahead and type web design for the first index which is going to be zero and now to set the value for the second index what you're going to do is you're going to add a comma so then we'll type Spanish chemistry English history and calculus so now we have all six of the items in string classes set to a value now when we set the values for this we're no longer going to need the number under string classes which is it's going to give us an error so if we take out five it's going to see that we assign this and when we assign it it's going to say we're going to use zero one two three four five which is six items and it's going to automatically know that instead of having to look at what we specify right there so if we run this we should get the same results as last time we can do whatever we want and it'll still work now we can also do this with integers so we'll just go ahead and type private string or int let's just do my numbers as integer and we'll go ahead and assign each value in there so we'll just do one two three four five and six so instead of using string classes in here we can go ahead and type my numbers so this should make it a little bit easier if you guys to see what's going on and looks like we're getting an error here so instead of string for our add items to list let's go ahead and make another add items and we will use coercion so private sub add items to list and we're going to use our Garre as integer so instead of string we will just do integer and we will copy this right here so now we have two copies of add items to list and we can pass an array as a string or an array as an integer and it will still work so we'll go ahead and minimize that and if you don't know what coercion is then you might want to go back and view that in one of my earlier tutorials so let's go ahead and do my numbers right there my numbers and we'll go up here and get this one that we missed and we'll go ahead and delete all this right here because we don't need it and now let's go ahead and run our program so you can see here that we can go ahead and click add array elements and we get one two three four five six and now if we click sort it right it's not going to change anything and if we click reverse array we get six five four three two one and if we click sort array what it's going to do is since this is of type integer it's going to sort it in numerical order now when we use string or character it's going to sort it in alphabetical order so we can reverse that and click sort and it will set it back in numerical order so go ahead and you can create this program that we've just made and add the step that I added here's a look at our add items to list you can pause it right there if you don't know what's in there and then go ahead and make some arrays initialize them with value is already make them of other types besides string and integer so you so you can get some more practice with them and once you got that down and you're not going to forget it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
