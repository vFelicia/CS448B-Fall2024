hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another video for the new Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be looking at incrementing a value in a database by grabbing the value and updating it and we're going to do this in the way of a hit counter and it's going to be a unique hit counter we're also going to have another table despite the one where we're counting a single value we're incrementing a single value we're going to have a table that's going to store the IP address of the users that are visited it's a very sort of loose way to do it it's just going to give you an idea of updating and and everything like that but we're going to keep a track of the users that visited so if the user has visited we're not going to increment the value so it's basically a unique hit counter but using what we've already learned with with SQL and SQL statements or queries rather so we've already got this food table but we're going to ignore that for now because that was from the last tutorial what we want to now do is create a new table and I'm going to call this hits count hits underscore count now this is going to be a single field table gonna have one field on it and this is going to just be an integer starting from zero and we're going to work our way up as we refresh the page as long as our IP address doesn't exist in another table which is what we incur in a minute so if we click go the field we're specifying is going to be called count is an integer we're going to set it as the primary key because technically is a unique value however we don't need an auto increment because we're going to be specifying this value anyway we could put Auto increment that would be a lot easier but it would avoid the point of teaching you perhaps how this can work another way so the quick and easy way would be to click Auto increment but what we're going to do is we're going to grab the current value and then add one to it and then increment so we're going the long way around things but it's going to allow you to practice a lot more okay so we need to save this let's just go down and save that so we created this table with this count value here if we browse the table at the moment we've got nothing in so what we're going to do is initially we're going to need to set this value to zero by clicking insert entering zero and clicking go you can now see that when we browse we've got count equal to zero now within PHP we're not going to do anything else in MySQL with regards to this in PHP we're going to grab this value add one and then reinsert it into here or update it rather so we need another table now and that's going to be called hits IP and this is going to be a list of the IP addresses that have accessed the site so again we just need one field and this is going to be IP we don't need to set this to a primary key this is going to be a VAR char now if you think about an IP address let's just go to here we've got a possibility of this and this amount of characters in an IP address so we've got three here and six nine twelve in length add the three dot is thirteen fourteen and fifteen so we need it to be fifteen characters or less and we're not going to sell it to primary it will give us a warning that we haven't set it to primary but that doesn't matter so now index defined here but that's okay so IP address is going to be stored in here in a long list and it counts are going to be stored in here now there are other ways to do this obviously we could just have a method to store the IP addresses and then count the amount of IP addresses or unique IP addresses that were present using the MySQL num rows function and that's going to work in exactly the same way so there's loads of possibilities to create this but like I said I'm just going the long way around things so we learn a bit better so back to PHP we're not really going to do much more in my PHP myadmin now I'm going to first of all include or require this connect file that we've created earlier on in the tutorials if you haven't already seen that I suggest you do so if you don't know how to connect to a database so we've connected to our database I'm requiring this within our page so if it's not there we're not going to run the page simple enough the next thing we need to do is grab the user IP and I'm going to put this into a variable called user IP so remember we're using dollar underscore server and then we need to remote address in there with the dress shortened there's another tutorial on this as well if you haven't already learn how to do this so we've created a variable called user IP let's just echo that out this is just to check the we're getting a value back correctly okay so don't seem to be getting a value back oh it's because we haven't saved the file so that would help let's refresh okay so I've got my local IP address being returned to me we can test it just with this so what's going to happen is I'm going to refresh the page the hit counter is going to go up my IP address is going to be stored then the next time i refresh we're going to check for my IP if my IP does exist in the database or in the table rather we're not going to update account but if it doesn't again we are so it's essentially like a file based account like we've already discussed in some of the other tutorials if you haven't seen that and you want to look at that then you can go back and view them but now we're using databases instead okay so we're going to be using two functions within our program I'm going to predefined these functions out going to write a skeleton if you like of these functions and then we're going to fill them in at later date so the first function is going to be called an IP exists and the argument we're going to give this is IP so we're going to be specifying the IP address into this function so it's going to look something like like this and obviously this variable here is going to be user IP so that's our first function our next function is going to be let's just say update count and this is going to take no arguments because all we're doing is incrementing the value by one that's simple enough now because we've declared this user IP outside of our functions we need to create a global of these inside so it's an global user IP that's going to allow us to use this IP address outside there and sorry we don't need to do that in this function but we do in this function because we need to get the IP and we need to compare it to the user's IP and that's been specified so let's just echo out user IP and check that that works within that function so IP exists and let's just give this a value of 1 and we can refresh now you can see that's still being echoed out however if I was to remove this global keyword and just try and echo out user IP you can see it doesn't work so we need to make this globally usable inside of our function
