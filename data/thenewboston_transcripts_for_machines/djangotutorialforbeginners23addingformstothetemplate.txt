alright guys so now what we need to do is first things first actually make the form so the user has you know something to click on so in my detailed view I'm actually just going to go ahead and get rid of all this because I'm not going to make this a list item anymore I'm actually going to make them form inputs so I'll keep this all the same all this red Taylor Swift and then the logo I think that'll be you know pretty cool to have so so before we even have the form section what you should always do is you should include a section for an error message so an error message is going to pop up whenever the user tries to do something that isn't valid like maybe you were having them sign up for your webpage and they forgot to input a username or maybe they tried to make a password that was only two characters long so you would want to put a little prompt at the top of the form Beck hey you need to actually you know make a password that's at least like eight characters or something so it's actually really simple to do go ahead and make an if and you can actually name this variable anything you want but I'm just going to say if error message because later on whenever you're handling this form usually we're just going to want to say okay do something to that base redirect them to this page no problem but if something bad does happen then we can redirect in to this page and then we're going to actually store an error message in here in this variable and we'll set it equal to like hey use a longer password or you know whatever we want to tell them so just make a conditional right in there and you can style this however you want I'm just going to make something bold real quick so strong and I'll just say error message so hopefully this will not exist there won't be any error messages and this will not even appear but if it does then they're going to have a little bold message at the top says hey you did something wrong alright so now we want to end if all right so that's all we need to do and later on whenever I set this you guys are going to easily see what I'm talking about let me clean this some like being able to scroll for some reason you feel so free alright so now we just need to go ahead and make a form and all right let's build this step by step so what is the action of the form the action is what URL you want to send this data to and of course we just want to send it to this right here but remember instead of just hard coding this we have that cool shortcut so back in here all right let me just copy this because I'm too lazy to type it out and all right so the action for this is music favorite so that's the URL pattern we can go ahead and pass in the album ID as well because we also need to pass in the song ID but for the song ID we're going to be getting it from these inputs so there you go now another thing another attribute that we want to add is the method so the method of this is going to be post most of your forms of course are going to be post I assume that you guys already know about getting posts so there you go now one other thing that's kind of weird with Django is it always is a good idea to have a CSRF token and I'm going to talk to you guys about um security and the best security practices with Django in a whole nother tutorial but if you guys just want to look at it a little bit look up crosssite request forgery and it's pretty cool topic so CSRF token and usually whenever you're making websites this is a pain in the butt to add but the thing about Django is whenever you want to use it in Django you just add that in Django takes care of everything behind the scenes pretty cool all right so we have a form right there so now what we on do is we want to list through this album and just loop through every song and make that choice and we already do that before so remember that was for song and album dot song set dot all you let me just go ahead and end my four and four alright so we're going to loop through all of the songs and for each one what we want to do when we need two things an input button and that's going to be the radio button that they click and also a label and label is just going to be the title of each song so the user knows what the heck option you're selecting so let's go ahead and do our input first so again I'm just using a radio button you can use a checkbox if you want but whatever so of course the type of this equals radio now the ID is pretty much just for your HTML so for the first one it's just going to be song one and then song and then song three so we really don't use it in code but whenever we have labels we pretty much give it the same ID so that way it knows that this input or this radio button is for that label so you guys are going to see later on whenever we run the final site but there you go so I'm just going to write song and then for loop counter so again this is going to get Auto incremented each time it prints out a song so 1 2 3 4 5 and that's already built in we don't have to do anything weird with that now after this just set name equal to song and value equal to song ID so let me scroll so you guys can see so again later on whenever we actually pass this data all of the form data to the views function so we can actually handle it this is going to be the name or just the variables name and then this is going to be the song ID so will pretty much say get the ID of whatever song they selected let's say that this one was 20 and then it's going to look through the debt base and then do its thing alright holy crap what's going on here I have my font way bumped up for you know just so I can so just so it looks better on YouTube and it's kind of hard whenever I'm program and I never program with my font this big so that's why it's that kind of freaking me out all right so now let's just go ahead and make a nice little pretty label for the user so for the label the first thing you write is this four and this attribute is the exact same is this so for song one song to yadda yadda whatever so again this is mostly just for display and what do we want to display in the label well let me just go ahead and display the song title I really don't care about the file type I don't think the user is going to care about that either so I'll just write song dot song title now another thing that I'm going to do is this how does the user know that their song is favorited well I'm going to go ahead and find some star icon online and we'll say that if a particular song is favorited then right where this is on the righthand side just go ahead and plot that star logo so whatever favorites they have it's going to have a nice yellow star right next to it so how do we add that logic well it's pretty simple actually you can go ahead and copy this alright so delete this and instead of checking for if error message we can say if song is favorite so if the song is the favorite then what do we want to happen let me just pause the video and find some image all right so I actually just made one real quick alright so if this song is their favorite then what we're going to do is we're just going to plop up this image and I'll show you guys what this is know if you guys can even see that oh it's only a little star so that's why it looks all fuzzy sixteen by sixteen but this is gonna appear right next to the song looking good all right may looking sweet and actually after this label I'm going to add a line break in that way every song is going to appear on a new line so they do right now because there are list items and they do that by default but to ensure that it does that with form labels just going to add that line break now the last thing that we need to do is we actually need to add a submit button because if we just run it right now then it's just going to be a bunch of radio button options in the user can select one but they can't submit it so I'll just say input they bump this in so input the type equals submit and the value and the value is just what text you want to appear on the button I'll just say favorite that has no effect on your program whatsoever so there you go
