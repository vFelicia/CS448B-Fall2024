so um we've completed our form validation essentially um and if our form isn't filled we keep in the values anyway in case uh well so users don't have to reenter every bit of data now what we want to do is we want to compare the two passwords so down here after we've validated the form we need to say or partly validated we need to say if password does doesn't equal password again do something otherwise complete the rest of the registration so in here if it doesn't equal we need to say um passwords do not match okay otherwise now we say Okay so let's um click register. PHP right so I can type my username in there um let's go down and do our first name and surname first so I'm going to typee pass one two3 and in this one I'm going to type pass one two so this is one less character than this therefore they don't match so let's click register and we get the uh error message passwords do not match so let's try again password oh no pass one two 3 pass one two 3 click register it's okay they match so now that we're okay here we need to start the registration process but what we need to do is we need to check if the username already exists in the database so how do we do this now we need to create a query let's just pull this down so we can uh have a bit of space the query is going to be select um and we're going to select username from so let's just pop this in postes select username from users so remember we're selecting let's just go back to here we select username from users where oh remember the uh there so where username equals and now what we can do is substitute in the username that the user has supplied here so we can say username now if this returns um a a row what's going to happen is it means that the username already exists cuz we're returning um a row which means we've successfully selected something where the username exists already so now let's run the query let's quick put that into a new variable so query run equals MySQL Query query and what we need to do now is we need to count the amount of rows so we say if MySQL num rows for query run so remember the query running is equal equal to one or is greater than or equal to one in in in the in the sense of this login and registration system it will never be two or three or any any higher so we can leave this equal to one because uh remember this process the whole point of it is to Not Duplicate the username so if the username equals one do something otherwise do something else in the case that it does equal one we need to say um the username concatenate on username that the username supplied already exists okay so otherwise we're saying okay so at the last part of our validation where we're validating where now not the form but whether the username exists so let's go back to our um register page blank that let's type in a username Alex password pass1 23 pass one two 3 first name Alex surname Garrett now when my register button we're going to do all the checks that we've already spoken about but now we're going to check if the username exists so let's check if that works we'll click register oh it says Okay Okay so let's double check everything select uh running that query if MySQL Query num equals 1 else okay um okay so let's test our query because it doesn't seem to be working as of yet let's pop that into um our SQL tab up here to see what happens okay so let's paste that in and click go um returned an empty result set so oh no sorry that's going to be equal to Alex click go okay so we are returning that value and let's think why we're not um getting any results okay so let's Echo out the usern name here just to uh go along with the uh process as we do it so let's go back to our page here and type in our password again AL okay so obviously there's a problem with our query somewhere cuz that username should be fed in properly now let's try to I mean it might be something simple that I'm completely missing uh let's try and Echo out MySQL num rows of our query that we've run see what that produces okay we're not getting anything from that so that means that no rows are being returned ah okay um yeah right okay okay so um what I've stupidly done is um perhaps you should learn from my mistake is we have this lovely file up here called connect. in.php which I haven't actually included so all of this is absolutely um well just the query is useless so let's go up and I'm going to require connect. in.php so I can connect to the database and therefore perform these uh operations correctly so let's go back here and we'll rype in uh pass one two 3 pass one two3 click register the username Alex already exists
