hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at comparing strings so let's go ahead and get started we're going to come down here under our main sub and we're going to create a couple variables we're going to start off by creating a string so we'll just call it user string as string and we'll set it equal to nothing and then we'll declare another string computer string as string and we'll set that one equal to on live gamer so now what we're going to do is we're going to prompt the user to enter in a string so console dot write line please enter a string so then we're just going to get what they type in so now that we have what they typed in we're going to use the string dot compare function so we're going to console dot write line and we're just going to type string dot compare and we're going to we're going to compare user string to computer string so that is our two arguments for our string compare the first one is the string that we're going to come that we're going to compare to the first string so here if you don't understand what that means I'll go ahead and show you so then we'll do console dot read line so now if we run this you can see that if I type on live gamer and then add an S it's going to give me the value of 1 because it is comparing this string to the second string now if we replace these and put it backwards we're going to get the value of negative one you can see right there that it gives us negative one because instead of comparing the string that they gave us to the first string we're comparing the first string to the string that they gave us so that might be a little confusing but you can mess around with that if you want and now we can also make this case insensitive so even if they make the whole thing in capital letters comparing it to this right here is going to give us a value of zero so I'll show you how to do this we're just going to type user string and we're going to compare that to computer string and then for our third argument it's got ignore case as boolean right here and we're just going to type true so now they can type it any way they want they can type it all caps all lowercase they can switch off between caps and lowercase whatever they want to do and it'll still give us a correct value so if I type if I type it like this it's going to give us a value of zero because it compares the caseinsensitive and it just checks to see if these are the same as on live gamer so that was a pretty simple tutorial you can use this for a bunch of different things in your programs go ahead and play around with it I get used to it and once you're done with that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
