all right guys welcome to your 10th udk tutorial and now that we know the basics of brushes we can go ahead and start putting our skills to use and build a very simple level so in this tutorial i'm only probably going to be creating a floor for our player or character to run around on but throughout these tutorials i'm going to be creating a full i don't actually don't know maybe a house maybe a map maybe some kind of building but anyways in this tutorial i just want to get a floor a foundation built and we're going to be testing it out so the very first thing we want to do is we want to change the size and shape of this red builder brush because well it's going to be a kind of weird looking floor if it's just a square so go ahead and right click this red builder brush and we bring up the options so x is pretty much how wide do you want it and i'm going to go ahead and change this to 10 24 again look at your grid and make sure whatever numbers you have are divisible by whatever grid size so i'm gonna make sure all my numbers are divisible by eight that way it snaps nicely to the grid whenever i'm trying to line things up so 10 24 is divisible by eight let's think of a length for it um 1280 whoa hey oh 1280 and for z z is the height of the floor now we really could give us something like two but we want to add some depth to it so give it something like 32 and now whenever we hit build we see the basic shape so that's a pretty good size i think good enough for now so now if you go ahead and we want to add mass go ahead and hit csg add and now you can see we have some mass on the floor pretty cool huh so actually believe it or not this is a very basic level we could play this if we wanted to so in order to test out your geometry actually let me do this first anytime you're making a map and you want to test it out go ahead and rightclick anywhere on the map and hit play from here and whenever you do it's going to pretty much throw your character in your map and first of all you guys are probably saying this what the heck bucky how the heck did i make you know a radar and a gun and a character with ammo and health i mean i thought we just made a four i didn't think i was that good yeah well by default before you know start making any characters and you just want to test something out the udk automatically gives you a test character basically to run around now so don't think that we created this by accident we didn't so with that being said you're probably going to notice one thing first of all if we shoot we can see that our floor is indeed there but i mean the lighting doesn't really resemble what we were seeing right here and the reason behind that is because whenever we're working in the udk by default we get unlit mode and that's pretty much the designer's view it lights up everything with a consistent light but it isn't what the gamer would see the gamer would see this a lit mode just like that so as you can see whenever we enter lit mode or game mode everything kind of turns to black so in order to get in order to uh you know have the character play the level successfully we need to add a light to this map now i know i'm not going to cover lights in this tutorial but for now just follow along with me go ahead and hold down l on your keyboard and click with your left mouse and once you do you get a light on your map now go ahead and with your move tool aka the translation mode go ahead and pull that light up and as you can see it automatically switches to lit mode again lit mode is kind of what the character would see unlimp mode is what the designer sees it just makes it easier to work with but go ahead and switch to lit mode and as you can see this is what the character would see so now the character has a nice light however if we go ahead and hit right click play from here check it out we're getting a bunch of error messages that say lighting needs to be rebuilt and pass need to be rebuilt and it didn't light up our level the reason behind that is because just like any time you make an update you need to update geometry aka build geometry anytime you add new lights you need to build all so go ahead and hit build all and as you can see a bunch of little boxes are going to pop open and our lights are going to start to build it's basically going to put our level together for us and we have a bunch of these uh errors right now but don't worry about those right now and now that everything is built our light our geometry go ahead and right click it and hit play from here and now check it out how awesome is that by the way uh for for the unreal tournament if you never played the game how you move around is the wasd just like that how you can turn is with your mouse and how you can shoot is either clicking the left button or the right mouse button so check it out we have an awesome amazing level we can go ahead and you know shoot the ground i guess that might be kind of fun or if we hold the right mouse button we can go ahead and build a spaceship pretty cool huh so with that being said that's all i'm going to cover in this tutorial again the couple things i want to mention is in order to change the shape for your brush go ahead and right click it and you can choose the shape choose something big enough where we can work with later on if you want to copy my numbers they're 10 24 1280 and 32 in order to add a light go ahead and hold l on your keyboard and hit left click with mouse again i know i didn't cover lights in this tutorial but i just want to give us the light so we can test out our map and aside from that make sure you hit build all and that's this little button up here and that's going to put everything together for you so that being said i'm going to go ahead and save my map go ahead and press file save as and i actually want to make a new folder so new folder and i'm just going to name this like uh youtube and then go ahead and save it as like uh damn uh gotta think of a good name this is obviously really stressful for me so i was named my bucky's map and by the way this dm make sure whatever you save your map is make sure it's dm minus because this means deathmatch mode and that's what gives you your character in your radar and allows you to test out the map a whole lot easier than if you didn't have it so go ahead and save it make sure before your map name you have the prefix dm and that's going to give you that character and gun so for now that's all i want to cover in this tutorial hopefully you have also created a very simple floor and now that you have we're ready to mount the next tutorial so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
