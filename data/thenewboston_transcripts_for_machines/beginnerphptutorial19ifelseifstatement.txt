hello this is Alex from PHP academy.org creating this P PHP tutorial for the New Boston now we've already looked at an if else statement which looks something like this um as this stands it evaluates to true so we're echoing out uh the text true now if I was to start a completely new if statement let's say I wanted to evaluate a few more things down the line now let's create a number um number one and that's going to be equal to 10 now we can create a number two and I'm going to create that also equal to 10 um no we'll just keep number one so we'll we'll just keep number itself so I want to create an if statement to gradually um make a few comparisons um with this variable so if I was to say if number equals equals 10 so this is is equal to 10 Echo equal to 10 so as it stands the number the variable number is equal to 10 therefore this comparison is going to be true so we're going to be echoing out this text so let's just test that in our browser quickly okay equal to 10 now what if I want to say but hold on a minute otherwise I want to make another check so you've seen in my previous examples I've said else Echo and we could could for example say not equal to 10 and if I was to change this value here to 11 you'll be displayed with the text not equal to 10 because the variable does not equal 10 um but let's scrap this idea of of just going straight to else and I want to say else if so I'm basically com combining if and else to make else if and then I just do exact the same structure and I do another block underneath that so else if and here what we can do is before just jumping to else and saying No this doesn't equal and this is evaluated to false we can make another comparison and we can do another evaluation so else if number equals equals 11 and we can now say equal to 11 oh if I can spell it so equal to 11 then what we can do is we can say else not equal for example so now what we're doing is we're saying is the number equal to 10 if it is Echo out this text equal to 10 otherwise is this text equal to 11 and if so we Echo out the text equal to 11 now remember before when I changed this to 11 it said not equal but now I've changed it to 11 this will be evaluated to true or this here in particular will be evaluated to True therefore this is going to be executed so let's refresh the page equal to 11 again we can change this up here back to 10 so it's performing this check here and we refresh equal to 10 but if we were to go um as high as 12 we haven't got a check here to be for it to be equal to 12 therefore not equal so this is basically in a nutshell IFL statements and they're useful for just making a few more checks before you want to completely say nope nothing's equal else and give uh the last alternative block to execute
