what up what up welcome back everyone to another tutorial series and in this one we are going to be learning how to create discord bots now just as a heads up you are going to have to have a basic knowledge of python and also some kind of familiarity with discord and by that i just mean if you ever use discord before then you're going to be good you just can't be coming into it you know emptyhanded but in terms of python if you ever set up a basic project before and you know what variables and functions are you're going to be good now another thing that i want to mention before we get started is that if you have any questions throughout the tutorial series then what you can do is you can sign up for the new boston discord and there's a link in the youtube description below so go ahead and click that to join and then if you go to the tech discord bot in here it's empty right now because i just created it but if anyone has any questions suggestions even feedback feel free to leave it in here and with that said let's go ahead and get started so the very first thing that we're actually going to do is we are going to create a new server and this discord server is going to be the testing grounds for our bot development somewhere we can play around with and uh you know like i said just test everything out so click the button right here this plus button and i'm just going to hit create my own server now you can actually skip all these questions if you want and for the server's name let's just do something like a tnb tnb tutorials all right looks good enough so go ahead and hit create and there you go so really in these tutorials it's probably only going to be me and my button here so as you can see now it's empty that's fine for now next thing we're going to have to do is go ahead and set up our bot and we're going to do this through the discord developer portal so go ahead and open browser and the url at this point in time i don't know if they're going to change it in the future but it's just discord.com developers slash applications and it may ask you to log in just log in with your regular discord username and then you're going to be taken to a page that looks like this but the first thing that we're going to be doing in this discord developer portal is just creating a new application now just to give you guys a quick overview of what we're about to do so we are about to create an application and then once we have our application we can add a bot to it and then after the bot permissions are set up we are just going to link it to our server basically to include our bot in the server so the first thing we want to do is give it a name and i'm just going to name this application tutorials bot so that looks good go ahead and hit create and all right looking beautiful so the next thing i'm actually going to want to do once i have this created is hop down to where it says bought on the left and we're just going to go ahead and add a bot so adding about yayada looks good let's do it a wild bot appeared sounds like a pokemon very cool all right so now we have our bot added to our application and before we move ahead i do want to go ahead and have you guys scroll down to this privilege gateway intent section now we don't actually need this for the first few tutorials however i'm just going to go ahead and have you guys toggle both of these on right now and that is presence intense and server member intent so go ahead and toggle those both on save those changes and to give you guys a quick overview again i don't want to get too into this right now but just to explain what we just did now if we click this link called gateway intents and this is actually something that just changed recently but it pretty much sums it up right here where in discord intents are groups of events that's it that's all you have to remember a discord intent is a group of events now what does this mean so the messages intents are like whenever you create update and delete messages so these are the events and they're just grouped together in something called an intent now something else like reactions whenever you thumbs up or thumbs down or add a smiley face to something adding those removing those removing all of them yada yada all of these events are grouped together into something called an intent now some of these intents are privileged which means that they just have some sensitive data related to it so discord just treats those a little bit special so that's why in here we're saying yes since this is a tutorial and we pretty much want all the privileges then we're just going to toggle those on right now so again not really important for just getting set up but just wanna you know give you guys the information of what we're doing so anyways back to this setup process once we have these two toggled on and saved let's go to oauth2 and then if we scroll down what we want to do is in this oauth 2 section under scopes is we want to select bot so what this is saying is what functionality do we want this application to have and since this is of course a discord bot tutorial it's pretty easy to guess that we want to give it bot functionality and another thing you guys probably couldn't see it because i'm a little bit zoomed in here but once we select bot right here the section below is going to appear called bot permissions and what we are going to do under bot permissions is just select admin now what this is saying i'm sure you guys can guess this as well is that we want our bot to be able to do anything a discord admin can do now just a heads up you typically do not want to choose administrator right here you typically want to limit your bot to whatever you actually need it to do whatever permissions you need to give it and no more however in this tutorial series since we're going to be touching a lot of different areas i'm just going to go ahead and give it admin permission so we don't have to come back and keep tweaking it so on and so forth but anyways that is what we are going to do to set it up so again scopes bought bot permissions admin and now the well i guess one of the last steps is if you copy this url right here then you can go ahead and open up a new tab in your browser and just paste this in so i'm going to go ahead and hit enter and this is saying that okay you told me that you wanted to create a bot now what server do you want to hook it up to and of course ours is just tmb tutorials the one that we just created a couple minutes ago go ahead and hit continue yep everything looks good and i have to make sure i am not a robot and all right looking good you may know now close this window or tab so i will do that now i'm going to pop open discord again and check it out so when you pop open discord you now are going to see your bot that is offline and that is really all we need to do for this initial setup going to your developer portal creating an application creating a bot and then linking your bot to your discord server and if all goes well you should see that you now have your bot offline again if you get lost in any of that or something didn't work out or something has changed from the time i made this tutorial too and you're watching it then always feel free to go in our the new boston discord and this discord bot section anyone will be able to help you out there's people online all the time so for now thank you guys for watching and in the next video we're going to be getting our hands dirty setting up the python source code and actually writing some code it's going to be awesome i'll see you guys then
