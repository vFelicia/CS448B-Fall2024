hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this tutorial we're going to look at an animation or effect in jQuery called delay now what this doesn't do is actually produce a specific effect but it actually delays in inbetween animations so what we're going to look at is appending animations onto each other and putting delay in the middle to create a pause between them so as an example I'm going to create a button at the top of my page just to know I've already included jQuery and effects in here and effect is the file we're going to be working in the first paragraph is just going to be a button so I'm gonna give this a type of button and I'm gonna give this a value just saying go for example and I'm going to give this an ID as well so we can use an event handler to see when this has been clicked I'm gonna click I'm gonna choose the name go so in the second paragraph this is just simply going to be some text so I'm going to this here I don't think it's yeah okay so disappear but I'm going to vanish would be better and then what we're going to do is delay this for three seconds once it has and then come back again so we'll just write something like I'll be back did you miss me okay so now let's go ahead and preview this on our page you can see the text here that we've written when we click go this is going to vanish completely it's going to fade out we're going to be using the fadeout function it's gonna delay for a specific amount of seconds and then fade back in again so you can use delay between different functions to create a pause in between their execution okay so inside e effects is all first of all we need to give an ID to this paragraph and I'm just going to call it power inside of effects we need to create a event handler for this button first of all so we reference the button which is called go and when the button has been clicked we need to carry out another function so the code between this parenthesis here will be run when we click the Go button okay so now what we want to do is reference this paragraph which I've called power inside of here hash power we want to fade out so let's go ahead and test that in the browser and see if it's working when I click go that should fade and it has now what we want to do is delay the execution for 3 seconds for example and then we want to fade back in so instead of coming down here and re referencing this for example peridot fade in which would work if we go back to the page and click go so it fades out and back in again instead of doing that we can append these onto each other so after the parentheses are of the fadeout function we can use another dot and then we can say fade in and let's go ahead and test that in the browser click go it fades out and then straight back in again now what happens if we want to delay this effect for a specific amount of seconds well embedded in between these two and again appending this function on we can use the delay function and this takes a parameter with the number of seconds you want to delay for in milliseconds so we could say 3000 which would equal 3 seconds so by doing this we're running the fadeout function which is set in the opacity of the element gradually to 0 delay then holds this animation for 3 seconds and then it will fade back in back up to a hundred percent opacity so let's go ahead and refresh click go you'll see we wait about one two three seconds and then it will fade back in again so like I said this delay function can be used with a variety of other functions and effect and essentially just pauses in between animation effects in jQuery so it's extremely useful when you want to perhaps delay the the execution whilst some more text or some additional text goes into a paragraph for example if you were retrieving data from a database table and you wanted to fade the the paragraph or a div or a span out then put more than say additional data into this paragraph or span or div and then fade back in you might want to do you might want to use delay because the the process of retrieving data from a database might be time consuming so you want to delay the animation while you perform background operations so that's the delay effect in jQuery although it's not effect it does work with animation
