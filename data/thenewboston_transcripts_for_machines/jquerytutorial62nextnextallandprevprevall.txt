hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're gonna be taking a look at the last and first parts of traversing in jQuery now obviously when we talk about traversing we talked about running over particular elements however this is part of a filter where we can select the first and last now much like we would do in for example selectors now I'm going to go ahead and create an unordered list with four names in and we'll go ahead and see the options that we have and how useful this can be so let's go ahead and create an unordered list and inside will create four Li elements of Li Li and once more and inside here let's go ahead and just put some values in so Alex Billy Dale and Ashley okay so let's go ahead and preview this now browser you can see we've just got a basic unordered list blah blah blah nothing really special let's go ahead and give this an ID of names now she'll give it a class of names more appropriate so nothing's changed we just now have a reference point for this unordered list and the it belongs to the class names so inside of ext ojs we have our document ready and we just go ahead and type this out again for those of you that don't quite understand we're selecting our document we're appending the ready event handle on the end and saibra craying a function so once our Dom has been loaded and you know we can just go ahead and work now this isn't a requirement but good practice to get into so the first thing we want to do is I'm going to go ahead and demonstrate the selector and then we're going to be taking a look at the the the actual function type call of it so let's go ahead and select ul or no sorry name two names and then Li and at first now this would be a this would allow us to sort of append on let's say first so we are selecting the class names which is here then we're selecting Li and the first Li so we're using a colon and first to append on first so let's refresh and you can see that we've just popped first onto the start of there now we could go ahead and let's say we'll copy this or we'll just retype it out so again we're saying dot names alive but well this time we're saying last and we're going to append on we're gonna append on the same pretty much the same thing but just last when we were afresh now you can see that that's been added on to the last now we have an alternative way of doing this and there are reasons for this and we're going to be using the find feature function as well as this first and last so I'm going to go ahead and demonstrate how we would do that as well so let's just say let's just go back to the start we want to find out the first li inside of this unordered list so let's go ahead and select first of all dot names which is our class this time I'm going to use find and we're going to be using that in conjunction with first and last and we want to choose what we want to find so Li for example now what we can go ahead and do is say dot first and now we can go ahead and append on some text so we can go ahead and append first and it's literally done the same job now one of the reasons I tend to do you know use this method is so I can actually use things like next as well I mean I know you can do this using normal selectors but find is a useful thing to use and get into the habit of using so you select the oh you know so the overall parent element and then you go ahead and find the Li and the first part of that and then append on first so we're doing the same thing so let's just run over again I mean by all means you can go over to the jQuery documentation and it has you know some more information on find and first/last and things like that but for now I'm going to go ahead and find the Li last and I'm gonna append on you know the same thing as I did before which is just last and when we refresh we have this so what I can also do is for example I could go on and say now I'm doing it sort of a longwinded way but you know never mind so I could say names dot find and then I could say Ally and then I could say dot first but then dot next and then dot end so I can sort of use so second well I'll just say after first for example or second it could be second make sense and when we refresh we have this second here so what I've done is I've combined find I'm looking for the Li first so the first element I'm picking out and then I'm going for the second element after the first element which is the second element so you know it will be element after the first element and that is second so I'm sort of combining things like this to pick out different values now there's a variety of reasons you might want to do this in in jQuery and that might be for example selecting either a predefined or we might want to go ahead and add a class onto the first and the last element or just on to the first element for example you might be menu building and you might want the first element in a in a list to be bold for example so we'll go ahead and just do that now just to demonstrate it let's just call this class here menu instead and I'm gonna school the fet while I'm going to say that the first element is ID now say user and the first is going to be settings and this one is going to be log out and this one is going to be delete account so Evans essentially now just got a you know an an unordered list of menu items I'm just gonna go ahead and open up style dot CSS and inside how I'm gonna style this ul so I'm gonna say dot menu and I'm gonna say liststylenone and this will just get rid of them bullet points and I'm then going to go ahead and set the margin to zero and that will get rid of the spacing there and then I'm gonna go ahead and step padding to zero as well and that will go ahead and get rid of that so we've still got a ul of menu items now now what we could go ahead and do is we could use next all and this takes into account everything after after the third or the element has been selected
