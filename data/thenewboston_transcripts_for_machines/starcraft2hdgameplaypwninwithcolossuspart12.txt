what's going on guys welcome is bucky of course and like i said welcome to my very first starcraft 2 gameplay video and if you guys think that this is going to be the most impressive gameplay video you have ever seen you are wrong i've only been playing starcraft 2 for like two months i'm not that great but a bunch of you guys were requesting to see my gameplay and uh just to see me play starcraft 2 at least one time so here's a nice video for you guys so on my team i'm going be playing with dom flying panda who's gonna be playing zerg and on my ramp right here we're gonna be playing with jester who's gonna be playing taran and of course the greatest player of all time right here there's me the new boston i'm gonna be green throwing up a quick pylon and getting all those pros out trying to get resources early so i can tech up and uh let's take a look at our enemies right here s gonzo who is gonna be looking like he's gonna wall off early and there's my trademark oh my god wtf barbecue that i saved before every match i don't know why there's really no reason for it and after that you see pretty much the whole entire map gets involved talking about barbecue for about a minute but anyways back to the game looks like both of our enemies are going to be walling off with some barracks and supply depots and this protoss up here is throwing up two really quick gateways which is one of the worst strategies i've ever seen he really should be concentrating on his probes but anyways that might bite him in the butt later on so here's dom throwing up a quick forge he might be going for a cannon rush or he might just be using that throw some early cannons for defense against any marines that might be heading his way there are three things that have known dom to do a he can rush his lot b he gets the dark templars and tries to go in for early kills before they can get any detectors and c he builds massive voyagers a lot so we'll keep an eye on dom see what he's doing this match but anyways looks like they are going to successfully wall off both of their bases and i have my first gateway being built and also my two assimilators i like to pretty much cue up my nexus with a bunch of probes and take care of my pros first and once i have a nice resource collection right that's when i like to throw my sim layers i probably get my simulators earlier than most people but i do that for a couple of reasons one i hardly ever build any zealots i usually just go straight to stalkers so that's why i really have to concentrate on getting gas early and um two because i tech up faster than a lot of people instead of building first tier in so that's why i need gas as well but anyways we'll see how that works out so yes it does indeed look like dom's gonna use those cannons to protect his own base very smart move since they did wall off and uh they do look like they're gonna have some early marines so it also looks like dom's gonna leave a little space there between his cannons and his gateway so if any marines do decide to try and rush them they aren't going to see a wall that they can't get through turn around and run away to me they're actually probably going to try to run through those cannons be picked off so that's a strategy he uses a lot is a very good one instead of just deterring the marines he kind of baits him in as he picks him off with the cannon so here's my teammate as he promised that um deciding not to wall off her base instead he's going to throw up a bunch of barracks close to his uh command center and pump out some early marines so i mean it looks like those marines are going to be protecting our base so unless they make a huge push we should be good so here is flying panda as promised that early zergling rush and he should be pushing out soon because we have some marines coming our way there might be a early confrontation here so here are those marines they see those cannons right there and here is the confrontation oh wait a minute it looks like those zerglings are going straight for their base and those marines are going to stick make an early push towards dom's base and that's what i was talking about right here look at those cannons just slaughter those marines right there and yeah they are in rough shape they had about six marines now they have two actually one and a half looks like this probe is going to have to take business into his own hands and now looks like dom's going to mass probably rush him and here comes er who's just about to destroy all these marines right here look at all these blood oh that is just amazing so now it's going to try to pick off that high line try to slow down their supply and you see a bunch of stalkers being pushed in so those zerglings are also probably going to kill off above those stalkers although stalkers are probably the best thing that you can use for early uh zergling rush so let's go ahead and oh my god just look at this those zerglings are just eating those pros those probes did not stand a chance so there goes his entire workforce maybe he shouldn't spend so much time doing stupid gateways and uh buildings and those more forces so his teammates are gonna have to come in and save them and he's gonna have to totally rebuild his entire economy so looks like my teammate jester had to go in and save dom so uh looks like we are in pretty good shape right now and here is me sending my first group of stalkers probably the worst thing i could possibly do i have no idea why i did this um i really don't have a good reason but these suckers that i'm sending in are just going to get suicided right now um i don't know if i was trying to extract them or just pick up these early marines for you know i didn't want to rush or something but not a good strategy on my behalf but i promise this game gets better so as you can see they're just continuing to pump out massive marines and they're probably just gonna sit on the high ground and pick off my stalkers while my teammate let's see what he's doing he's just walking around with this bunch of uh marines and marauders and looks like dom has some void rays in the oven right there gonna be pumping out some voters soon and there's those marauders and marines just patrolling around just uh you know minding their own business but anyways it looks like our opponents have a bunch of stalkers to bone up which is good for me because i am taking up to immortals and as you know immortals pwn stalker so if it's his stalkers against my mortals i'm gonna win nine times out of ten so this is looking up uh very good for me but we're actually running out of time in this video i didn't want to put in a one long video so the massive battles are going to be coming in the next video or the next two videos i haven't decided yet however many it takes but yeah it looks like uh both teams are just working on their armies right now huge battles are sure to ensue soon so things are looking good for us so uh there's another zergling rush coming but as you see that's the end this video but thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to subscribe and yeah don't forget to check out the next video it's going to be pretty effing sweet
