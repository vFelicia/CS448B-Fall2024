alrighty guys welcome back and in this video we're gonna be learning how to remove and also inspect containers sounds pretty exciting i know i know so let's go ahead and just view all the containers that we have so far so i'm gonna do docker container lsa and okay i mean a lot of these we just we just don't need anymore it's in fact kind of embarrassing how many containers i have on my computer right now so i want to start getting rid of some of them so this one ping google.com definitely not going to be using this again so let's figure out how to remove it now the first thing i'm going to want to do is copy this container id right there and a very simple command to remove any container you can do docker container rm and then you can paste in the container id all right it looks like it was removed now just to confirm yes all of them are still there instead of this individual one cb71 which was just removed now another thing that i want to point out and it's probably not going to happen in this example but removing a container is sometimes going to fail and this happens whenever you have some processes that are running inside your container remember that weird edge case that we saw last time either way the point i'm trying to make is if you ever need to force removal of a container and let's say docker container rm and then the container id itself and by the way this is this container id i'm using for this little example if this command ever bugs out and fails and you need to force removal right after this rm you can do dash f and this is just gonna force removal so again if you ever get any errors then you can force it and it'll clean it up remove it from your computer nice little tip now another cool command is inspect now the inspectmen allows you to view more detailed information and i mean a lot of information about a container a lot more that's just on one of these lines now to demonstrate that let me just grab any random container id and that is docker container inspect and then you can just paste in the container id now what this is going to return is actually a list and it this is formatted json so lots of information about your container not only the id the creation date the image yada yada you guys can um go through this if you want and see all of the different fields but just want to show you guys what inspect does it returns json so this might be useful if you're let's say creating a digital currency network and you need to simulate an entire peertopeer network on your own computer and you want to view information about each node but like who would do that that's just a crazy example no one's going to make this entire digital currency network now last but not least and i know i mentioned this in a previous video but i just want to reiterate since i have a feeling it's going to be a pretty common command especially if you're just getting started learning docker that is how to delete all containers from your system and that is docker system prune and if you do hyphen hyphen all this is going to wipe everything including the cache so you can run this and just verify yes and another thing to note is whenever you run this it is going to have to redownload from docker hub any containers that you had before so that's fine cleaned up some space and now just to verify if i list out all my current containers i have nothing a nice clean system so i thought i was gonna have time to talk about exec in this video but there's a lot to that so i'll actually break it up into the next video but for now thank you guys for watching and i will see you next time
