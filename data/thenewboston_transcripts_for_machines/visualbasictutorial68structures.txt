hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be looking at structures now let's say you have you want to have one value but you want that value to store several different values so let's say you have a customer and you want it to store their name their email and their let's say first name and last name so the whole name first name last name and email well you could make a bunch of a raise or a bunch of single variables but that would be really frustrating and it will take a long time so what you can do instead of that is create what's called a structure now a structure is similar to class and and what I mean by that is that it can have methods constructors nested types and other stuff but one difference is that it it's missing some of the other stuff that classes and it's light it's very lightweight it doesn't take up much resources but so let's go ahead and create an application for this so we'll go to file new project make sure you select windows forms application and we will call this structures ok so now what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and just build a little interface right here so we'll go ahead and open up the toolbox we will add four text boxes so what's at one copy that two three four okay so let's get these in order here okay so now we'll just select all of these you can do this by using your mouse and dragging over them and we'll stretch them out some to cover most of this and we'll make this a little bit smaller so we can add labels so we'll add four more labels so we'll just copy and paste that so we have label one label two label three and label four okay so now let's just we'll leave the names for the labels the same but we'll just change the text value so we will set this one equal to name we'll set this one equal to first name we will set this one equal to lastname and we'll set the last one equal to email okay so now I'll just add a button and we will set the name of that button to I will set the text to list customer and if you haven't already guessed we're going to be dealing with some fake customers in this program so we'll set this to text name we'll set this one to text first name we'll set this one to text last name and finally the last one to text email okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to ahead and close out of our tool box and we will double click on form one to bring it up to open up the code now we'll go ahead and zoom in here and we're going to go ahead and create a structure so we do this by using if you haven't already guessed the either the private or the public keyword now we want this Junction to only be available to form one the class form one so we'll use the keyword private and then we will type structure to tell the compiler that we want to make a structure and now what we do is we set a name for that so we'll just call it customer and exhuming when we press ENTER we get instructure instructure now if you haven't already noticed that you do not have to define a default datatype for a customer it can be equal it can you can store different data types and you can store strings doubles integers as many as you want so let's go ahead and create some public variables so we'll go ahead and type public firstname as string will create a last name as string and we will create an email as string and now you probably notice that we didn't make a full name variable we don't need to do this we can just take first name and last name and combine them okay so now what we're going to do is we are going to create a structure so let's go ahead and create one of these structures now whenever you create one it exists on its own and it has nothing to do with this right here so you can make as many as you want and it's pretty much your own data type so we will type private because we only want to available to class form one and we'll call it object customer as customer okay so in this tutorial we created the GUI for our little program that will list customers using structures we created a structure and we made an instance of that structure that we can use throughout our whole class now we can make as many of these as we want but we just have to have different names for them so on go ahead and put this code in if you haven't you can play around with what you can do with structures if you want to go ahead and use intellisense to see what you can do and learn on your own and if not go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and do it anyway even if you do mess around to the structures move on to the next tutorial and we will be working more on this program so thanks for watching guys
