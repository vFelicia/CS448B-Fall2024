all right guys let me just uh finish watching this Michelle Fan video real quick and okay let me just get rid of that kind of embarrassing but do you guys ever do that you just see a hawkero in the video and you just click it even though you know it's a dumb makeup tutorial I can't resist I'm a guy so you know blame me but anyways welcome back to your fourth udk tutorial and in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about this thing right here the viewport toolbar uh we're probably not going to be covering everything in this tutorial but we're gonna knock a couple things out so basically I want to stress you guys that every single viewport has a toolbar and what this toolbar allows you to do is allows you kind of the customize your view to depending on how you're working with your 3D models what you're doing it allows you to set it up exactly how you want so this uh you know red block is nice and all but I'm gonna go ahead and open a map that's a little bit more interesting so go ahead and hit file open and go ahead and open vctf actually just open your favorite map it doesn't really matter what it is again this is a lot better than you know that red block so the very first thing I want to talk to you guys about is this the viewport options drop down menu now believe it or not all of these things oh I don't want to say all of these things about 80 of these options in here are just an alternative to these buttons so you can either they have these buttons or you can choose them in a drop down menu so it's not like totally new set of options they just give you different way you can choose it a couple things in this menu however are not options in our toolbar menu so we need to cover those the first thing I want to cover is the show menu right here I know you guys don't know what half this stuff is right now or probably all of it right now but whenever we're working in our viewport we notice all these little designer light bulbs and wireframes and lines and stuff whenever we learn what these things are and we said all right I want to see something but it isn't displaying in my viewport chances are that's because you don't have it selected in your show menu now again I know you guys don't know any of these things are so once recovering them I'm going to be covering them again in the upcoming tutorials but for now just remember in the future videos whenever you think you should see something and it's not displaying go here that's probably what the problem is now another thing again like I said I'm not going to be covering all this stuff like show volumes Sprites because that's a whole separate tutorial we're nowhere near learning that yet but one thing I do want to cover is this remember in the last tutorial I taught you guys about the different viewport types well that's just how it is set up by default the top left is the side the top right is the front top over here and this is the perspective but you can change that if you want and you can change it by choosing this the drop down menu viewport type you can change this to the Top If you want or you can go ahead and change it to the front by default this is perspective so that's how I'm going to leave it I just want to show you guys if you want to set up your viewports in a different way you have the option to move in that you're not locked in this default view right here so that being said that's all I really want to cover in this drop down menu again all of these things right here they're buttons that we're going to be going over in the upcoming tutorials and this other these other options right here like volumes layers Sprites and you know culling and occlusion and unlimit movement we're not even anywhere near that so going over it would just confuse you guys probably confuse me too well I do want to go over is this real time again this p is just the viewport type we already covered that the next thing is this realtime option now what this realtime option and by the way I have no idea why the icon is a stamp if anyone knows then please let me know because I think it's a stamp it might be something else but it just confuses me so I have no idea why it's a stamp but basically the realtime option is this anytime you're working in a viewport and you have either an animation or an effect it doesn't play that animation or effect by default let me go over and actually uh let me find an animation or effect I think there's a water fall somewhere around here here we go so let's go ahead and look at this waterfall let me go ahead and zoom out and check it out whenever we're working in this viewport the waterfall looks like it's freezing it's not moving at all even though if we were to play the game the waterfall would appear to be moving water that's because whenever we're just working in the viewport we don't really need to see that effect we don't need it to eat up our computer's memory it will take extra resources from our computer that we don't have to spare right now however we do have the option of watching this waterfall move and that's by clicking this realtime button so go ahead and click this real time button and now even though we're working in the viewport and we're not playing the game we can see these effects in animations begin to play so that's how we can you know kind of see effects and animation start to play I usually switch this off because like I said it does take some extra memory from your computer and we want to save all the memory we can when we're actually working with models another thing concerning this real time is this whenever we're working with objects so I know I'm not talking to you guys about uh these different views like wireframes but go ahead and switch a wireframe and actually just follow along for this tutorial whenever you have an object selected like this say you have this object selected well whenever you select it and hit home every viewport is going to snap to that object now check it out if I were to go ahead and move this object look at this and by the way I know you guys don't know how to move objects but I just want to talk to you guys about real time for a second whenever you go ahead and you move this object in one viewport notice all the other viewports notice this one up here and this one and this one the object isn't moving even though we're actually moving the object in our you know in our udk so you're saying all right even though I'm moving it y isn't it moving up here well again like I said it's the save memory but if you want to see it like maybe you're trying to position it in a certain type of way what you can do is you can go ahead and check these real time options right here and whenever you check these realtime options check it out whenever we move it now the object is indeed moving in those viewports so again in the future whenever we learn how to move models around how to rotate them and stuff like that if we want to move it in one viewport and see the actual difference as is happening in other viewports that's the option that we need to check that realtime option so again those are the two important aspects concerning real time one whenever we have real time selected all of our animations and effects we can see in real time and also whenever we're moving objects in one viewport they move also in real time in other viewports so again anytime you want to switch those off just go ahead and switch them off off and off and by the way the benefit of switching them off rather than leaving them on all the time is just to help save some of your computer's resources so that's all the time I have in this tutorial I know there are a lot of more buttons that we need to cover but for the sake of this tutorial I actually I have more time but I want to go watch some of Michelle Fan videos so that's the truth I'm going to watch some more makeup tutorials and you guys watch this video over and over until you're Pro with real time and viewports so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video
