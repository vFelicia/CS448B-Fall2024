what's going on guys welcome to your 57th udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be teaching you guys about something called mattina now mattina is basically the udk's animation program now I'm going to be doing things a little bit unorthodox for me I usually show you guys the program and you know give you guys the pieces of it and tell you guys how it works but I'm going to be doing something a little bit different like I said I'm going to be building a simple program using Mata and demonstrating how MAA works and then once you guys get a good idea of what exactly mattina is and how it can be used I'm going to be going through the pieces so it's definitely a better way of learning mattina so let me go ahead and do that right now so what I'm going to be doing is I already have this map open remember this is the map I taught you guys how to use static meshes on and what I'm going to be doing is adding a door right in front of here now whenever our user walks over the bridge it's going to open that door and I don't know maybe close it later on I haven't decided yet I really don't plan on my tutorials so let me go ahead and open my content browser and I'm going to go ahead and clear everything out and look for static meshes I'm just going to go ahead and look for a door and find kind of a square one I guess I'll use this one right here so go ahead and rightclick and make sure it's fully loaded just like me which it is and go ahead and select it right there and we're going to want to be bringing this in as an interp actor so go ahead and right click and hit add interp actor right there so it looks pretty good I just want to position actually the first thing I want to do is grow this so maybe 1.5 not quite big enough so 1.65 all right that looks pretty good so all right so that blocks our players sufficiently so now all I want to do is Center this back bad boy right here and that looks centered and also maybe bring it out just a hair so let me go ahead and push this forward oops grabbed the wrong thing there hos let me go ahead and push that forward okay so that looks pretty good right there that door positioning So eventually like I said what I want to be doing is having our user walk over this bridge and once they hit a checkpoint on this bridge I'm going to be sliding this door down just like that however I'm not going to be doing it right here in my perspective view I'm actually going to be doing it in a program called Matt name so let me go ahead and do that right now let me position my camera a little better and O that's some good position and you can see the statue in the background and everything so the very first thing we need to do is add a trigger on this bridge so whenever our user clicks this trigger it knows to send a m message to this door so in case you guys forgot how to add triggers you go ahead and right click where you want to add it and we want to add an actor and add a trigger so right now the radius is a little bit small so I'm going to go ahead and move that to the center and if I hit F4 I bring up my properties for this and under Collision under Collision radius just go ahead and change this to like 100 or something like that and now you can see I have a huge huge Collision radius and actually my Collision height might as well change that to 100 to just so you know they can't hop over the trigger or anything so now check it out whenever my user walks across this bit Bridge they're going to hit this trigger and then that's going to send a message to this gate eventually saying hey gate you need to do something so now let's go ahead and start programming this shiz in kismat so we can go ahead and X out of this and select your trigger right here and open kismat and what we want to do is with our trigger selected make sure it's selected right there go ahead and right click and hit new event using trigger and we can just make a touch so whenever they bump into that trigger in any kind of way it's going to send a message out through here this touch but what exactly is the message that we want to send well what we want to do is we want to create an animation of this gate sliding down and remember I said anim is basically called a MAA in the udk so go ahead and you're going to want to select new mattina this pretty much is like a little movie that's going to play so the first thing I want to do is actually position this right there and I want to say all right whenever I touch my trigger I want to play my animation or play my Mata so it says all right so Bucky you made this game it's awesome game whenever they touch this trigger on the bridge you want to play movie but what the heck am I supposed to play am I supposed to move this light up and down am I supposed to rotate this bridge am I supposed to you know flip this panel upside down I don't know what movie you want me to play so in order to give that information what we need to do is this go ahead and double click matina and then we got this huge Beast that opens up so again like I said I'm not going to be talking guys through the pieces in this tutorial I'm just going to be giving you guys a real quick demonstration of how Mata works and actually I think I'm going to be doing that in the next tutorial so my video file doesn't get too big so in the next tutorial that's what you have to look forward to so for now thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys then
