hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be looking more at the car program and we're gonna add some methods and functions and we're gonna start building the user interface now the user interface it's going to change throughout the making of the program as we progress through the certain stuff that we can do with cars and whatever else we add to the program so let's come over here to form one dot VB and we'll go ahead and we will add a button and we will add a another button okay so the first button we're just going to set it to the value we're just going to set the text value to name and we'll set the button name to button set name and we'll do the color for the second one so button set color in the name field and they will do button set name in the next field already in the text field or not button set named Rose let's just put color okay so we got name and color right here and then we'll add a another button that we will we will be removing this button later on but for now we're gonna use it so let's go ahead and set the text to show info and we'll set the name to button show car info okay so now let's access the button set name click event so whenever they want to set the name for it let's just go ahead and use the default car for that so we need we're gonna need a name member inside of our car class so we'll just type public car name as string so now that we have our car name let's go ahead and set the name so we'll type input box the prompt will be please enter the name of your car and for the name we'll just use like car types like a Mustang or a Camaro or something like that we will set the title to name the default response to nothing and then leave the rest the same and so now we're going to need to store that inside of a variable but we could skip over the process of storing it inside a variable and just directly access the car name from our default car so we'll type default car dot car name equals whatever is sent back from that inbox by the input box so come back here and we'll do that again for the color so we'll type default car dot color equals input box and we will ask them to enter the color okay so now let's just access the show info button click so whenever they want to show the info let's just type default car or we'll type message box so the text will be default card to string and then title will be info okay so now we need to come in here to our car class and we need to overwrite the function to string so let's go ahead and type overwrite to string so we'll type public overrides to string a string and so instead of returning a value converted to a string let's go ahead and return let's return the color the name and the speed so we'll type card name and then we will add the name of the car then we'll go ahead and add a new line by typing environment dot new line we'll go ahead and add the color so car color and then we'll go ahead and add color and then we'll add the speed so let's add a new line here environment dot new line and we'll type car speed and then we'll go ahead and add int speed okay so now whatever the two string function is called it's going to show us all the information we need to know about the car so let's go ahead and run this it's going to show us red which we left over from our last tutorial so the default color is red let's go ahead and set the name of the car so let's just call it Mustang gt500 we'll go ahead and click OK we will set the color of the car we'll set it to say yellow and black then we'll go ahead and click OK now let's show the info and see what we get we get the car name which is Mustang gt500 the car color is yellow and black and our car speed is zero because we haven't told it to accelerate so we'll go ahead and close out of that so if you haven't put this code in go ahead and do that you can comment it if you want and then if you understand it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial thanks for watching
