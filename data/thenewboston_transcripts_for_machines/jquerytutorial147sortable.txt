hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston in this tutorial we're going to be looking at the sortable interaction in jQuery so we're going to be creating a list much like we did when we looked at the droppable tutorial or the droppable interaction in jQuery and we're going to allow this list to be sorted so we've included the jQuery UI a UI library as well as the original jQuery library and they also have a stylesheet here because I'm going to be styling my list that I'm going to be creating in just a moment now inside you ijs is where our jQuery code is going to go to actually make this particular list suitable so the first thing we want to do is create an unordered list so I'm going to create some ul tags and inside here give this a few options so we're going to have for example three elements of this here and I'm just going to type in a few names okay so now I need to give this UL a particular ID and this is going to be names now the reason I'm giving this a particular ID such as this and not list because we're going to be creating another list in a moment and allowing each list to interact with each other so being able to drag items from one list into another list so let's go ahead and preview this in our browser you can see whether we've got some indentation here with the bullet points I'm actually going to remove these so I'm going to go over to style dot CSS and I'm just going to style ul I'm going to set the padding to zero pixels I'm going to set the list style to none and I'm also going to go ahead and set the width of this just up here to 200 pixels because currently a list takes up the whole document so now it looks a bit like this and we want to go ahead and make it draggable straight away so I'll sort of all rather so each element will become draggable and the list will automatically be sortable so fundamentally we would go into our external javascript file which is you ijs and we need to use a selector to select this list which i've called names we then want to do a dot as we usually would and we need to make this sortable now this alone will make this list suitable however we're going to specify some options in a moment which allow us to create some better interaction and also connect it with our other list and we're also going to be looking at one event as well there are quite a few events for sortable but we're going to take a look at the update event a bit later so now we have the list it looks as normal however we can actually now sort the elements inside the list so just by appending on this sortable interaction we're now able to actually sort the list so let's go ahead and create some curly brackets and start to look at some of the options available in the source will interact interaction now containment is probably one of the most important if for example you had one list and you wanted the containment to be just within that particular list at the moment you can see I can drag elements across the rest of the page and we have no containment in place or the default containment in place so this is not really a problem but you often don't want elements to be dragged away from this list we want them to be just be dragged up and down so I'm going to go ahead and specify the containment option and I'm going to make this equal to parent and what this will do is it will only allow items to be sorted within this parent which is ul so let's go ahead and test this you can see that I can't actually drag them away and they are all a lot they're all aligned along the y axis so now that they're sorted you can see that we've got this problem here of when I pull this up it overlaps this and doesn't automatically sort the Billy Billy name below Ashley it can be a bit funny and you know not work very well in this case so we have another option which makes selection or sort ability a lot more natural and this is the tolerance so we specify the option tolerance and the most natural is pointer and what this will do is it will sort as soon as the pointer reaches the other element so now you can see that as soon as this just about overlaps here so as soon as my pointer reaches the other element it will automatically go ahead and sort it so it feels a lot more natural and if you try if you're trying this out for yourself you'll probably agree okay so let's go ahead and look at some other options some more aesthetic options the first one being cursor and this is just the cursor that's displayed when we're actually dragging a particular element now at the moment is just set to the default selection icon or cursor I'm going to go ahead and set this to pointer there are obviously a few other options but I prefer pointer because it gives us gives us this nice hand icon which sort of simulates actually moving something around so now that we've created it up to make it a look a bit better and we've added this pointer in we may want the list elements to revert once we've actually dropped them you can see at the moment if I don't quite drop this it snaps back to its original position if we were to change at the revert option to true this will actually allow it to sort of slide back to its original position you can see there now this works as well if you were to have the containment set to say document and if we were allowed to move these elements across the page for example over here you'll see it will revert back to its position so it won't revert back to its original position but it will revert back to the position associated with the drag and the the sort so for example if I move Billy over here and then pulled it down slightly you can see that there's a gap there and that would fit nicely in the gap and revert back to that position so revert works in that way in the sense that will revert it back to either its original position if it hasn't been moved or the position that's been moved to if it's not within that particular element or within the particular container okay so now we want to go ahead and look at the opacity option let me just pull these down so we can view them a bit better okay so the opacity option just specifies an opacity if you've seen the tutorial on dragging you'll know that we can also specify an opacity with dragging and I'm going to set this to naught point six zero and that's at sixty percent opacity so when I move it you can see it's changed now to a sixty percent opacity
