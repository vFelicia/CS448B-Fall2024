what is going on guys it's Bucky and welcome to your 13th C++ tutorial and in this story I'm going to be teaching guys how to use variables in classes but it's a little different than you guys might expect so just stick with me and I'm going to show you guys the wrong way and then we're going to show you guys the proper way to use variables in your classes so before I even get started this tutorial I want to include the string class as one of our files because we're going to be working with strings in this tutorial and if you can't remember a string is just basically another word for text so whenever we were outputting things like hey now brown cow this text is just another word for a string so that's what a string is to give you guys a quick little background on that so go ahead and include the string class right under your iostream right above your namespace and now like I said before I show you guys the proper way to use variables I want to show you guys the wrong way because this is a common mistake that a lot of beginners do so you go ahead and you added your access modifier public and say you wanted to make a name variable low name is of course a string so go ahead and make a variable called name and set equal to the type string this is good to go I mean so now we have a variable in our Bucky class called name so again if you remember from les Sorel in order to use the things in that class you first need to create an object so in order to create an object you type the class name and then the name of your object I'm going to name mine Bo which does not stand for body odor stands for Bucky's object so then we have an object named Bo and with that Bo object we can access variables by using the dot separator and just the name of your variable so then once we have this variable name from the Bucky's class we can go ahead and see it equal to any name we want like Bucky roberts and then this variable right here is equal to Bucky Roberts so then whenever we try to print it out Bo dot name it just goes ahead and it prints out Bucky Roberts on the screen so you're saying all right Bucky that seemed to work pretty darn good to me so why did you say that that was an proper way to do stuff well I don't want to get into too much detail but basically I want to stress this making class variables public is generally not good programming practice I don't want to get into like software engineering but basically whenever you make your variables public it makes your programs really easy to mess up so typically what people like to do is make their variables private and again there are some exceptions but typically you want to make all your variables in your class private so you're saying all right I remember from less storia you told me that whenever I make variables private I can't access in them in main so whenever you try to run this program right here we get an error saying all right this is just going to cause me a bunch of headaches what am I supposed to do well if we remember what I said I said nothing outside your class can access these variables so we need to build a public function inside your class to have access to those variables so that is what we need to do so let's go ahead and delete all this and we already made our variable private so now let's go ahead and make public functions to access them because remember if we make a public function to access that variable we can use those public functions outside our class in our main so in order to do that just go ahead and write public and now everything you type under here is going to be public so we want to add two functions the first one is just going to be first of all we're going to want to do two things to this variable name we want to be able to change it and then that means set it like set equal to Bucky set equal to Tom set equal to Jessica so we want to be able to set the name and our second function is just going to get the name we want to return the value Bucky we want to return the value Tom just go whatever so we have two functions one to set the variable and want to get the variable so in order to set the variable just go ahead and set equal to void because it's not returning anything we're just changing the variable and what people typically do is write set and then your variable name after that and after this we're going to go ahead and use this string and we're going to call X because we're going to be passing in a string such as Bucky Roberts Jessica Thompson Tommy and that variable is going to be equal to the value X so whenever we set a name we want to change it all we need to do is set equal to the variable X and then it sets equal to whatever value we pass in for example if we say set named Bucky it's going to treat Bucky is X and now our named variable is going to be equal Bucky simple enough so that is called our setter method or excuse me setter function a method is actually if I say method and I actually mean to say function just remember that I uh I've been teaching like 80 different computer programming languages and in some languages they call method a function and vice versa so I might get it mixed up but trust me a method and function is just the same thing so anyways with that little background I now want to say this we already built our setter function how to change that name variable well now we want Bo to a function to access it and remember since we want that name in return we go ahead and type string because the name is of course a string a bunch of text so what people typically do here is instead of set they write get because they just want to get the name so go ahead and write get name it's not going to take any parameters and in the body this is probably the easiest thing you're ever going to do all you do is return the variable so check it out we don't have direct access to this variable so we have to go through functions in order to change this variable we go ahead and we use this function in order just to get the value of the variable we go ahead and we use this function so now instead of directly accessing this variable we can do it through public functions so again like I said the only thing that have the only thing that has access to these private variables are other things inside this class so if we make those functions public then we can access that variable kind of like cheating you know so in order to do this again in order to use those functions we again need an object so Bucky's class make another Bo object and now under this if I scroll up we can go ahead and Bo we can use the functions from that class by using the object name and then the dot separator and then we'll just go ahead and the first thing we want to do is set a value to that so go ahead and let me just copy this paste it right here and we'll set the name equal to something stupid like arm sir Bucky Wallis if you guys know where the name Sir William Wallace comes from then leave me a comment below congratulations so now this name variable is equal to the name sir Bucky Wallis so instead of accessing it directly you can see that we went through a function that was public to do so so now what we can do is we can just you know print it out or something stupid so see out and in order to print it out we just can't go ahead and write Bo dot name because we don't have access to that variable what we need to do is we need to go through the function get name just like that and now what this function does is it returns the name it's basically a way to make a private a public simple as that so now when we go ahead and print it out building around this as long as I don't have any errors and I don't check it out sir Bucky Wallis so let me guys let me talk you through this one more time what we did is we wanted to access this private name variable well we couldn't access it directly or else it will give us an error so what we need to do is we needed to build public functions one to change the name and one to get the name so then later on in our program whenever we wanted to use those function we went ahead and we created an object and then remember whenever you want to use anything inside your class right the object dot separator function object separator function and then we ran our program and it worked pretty darn good so that is the bad way to use variables and also the proper way to use variables again you can put these variables is public but it's just bad programming practice and bad software engineering you're never going to get a job as computer engineer if you make your variables public so thank you guys for watching this tutorial if you have any questions check out my website the new bus and comm it's pretty sweet website I definitely want to check it out so I am going to go get a drink because I've cottonmouth now and you guys study this story and I'll see in the next video
