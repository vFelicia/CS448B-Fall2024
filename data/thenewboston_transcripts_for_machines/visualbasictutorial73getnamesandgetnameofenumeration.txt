hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be talking about the get names method or function in system in the system namespace and the enum class now if you remember from the last tutorial we used get values in this tutorial we're using get names now it's not necessary that you know what we did in the last tutorial but it'll probably help you so other than get values there's get names and get name so we'll go ahead and just create a little demo for this now you can see that we have list enum names and we created that in the last tutorial for a purpose so we're going to list the names of the items in our enumeration so we're just going to use a for each loop for this so for each item as and since we're using the name we're going to go ahead and use string instead of integer because the items are a string so in and now we're going to use the system namespace dot enum dot get names now you can see there's get names and get name we're going to be using get names and we will talking about get names at I mean get name after this so now what we're going to do is we are going to get the type of sports so get type and sports and we'll go ahead and press enter and now what we're going to do is we're going to type list enum names items dot add and we'll add item and we don't need to convert that to a string because it already is a string so let's go ahead and run this and see what kind of results we get so let's go ahead and select sport we'll select a football and I'll say your sport is football we get the values which is 0 1 & 2 and the names which is baseball basketball and football and you can see that these match up to the corresponding values if we go ahead and grow up to the enumeration here and so the application you can see baseball is zero basketball is one and football is two now we can do this with any other value and it's going to give us the same results now you can see that it continues to add it to the list so we can go ahead and do make a simple fix for this so we'll come down here below combo sports and we'll type private sub clear lists clear list okay and inside this will just type list enum names dot items dot clear and lists in them values items dot clear so this is just going to clear the items and we need to call that each time button analyze this click and that needs to be the first thing so it doesn't clear it after the this stuff has been added so let's go ahead and run this and you can see that we can pick any sport let's do basketball this time analyze the sport it gives us the everything right here the names of the enumeration and the values inside of it and we can do football click analyze sport and we get the same things so now we can use what's called get name now what this does is instead of just getting all of the names of the enumeration we can get a single one so to do this we're going to use everything the same as we used for get names but instead of just having one argument we're going to need two so we're going to have the enum type and we're going to use get type of sport so it'll get the type for us and we need the value and the value would be either 0 1 or 2 so we can go ahead and let's say it will put the value 2 in so it's going to get the name of the value 2 in enumeration sports so if we run this we're going to go ahead and click football and we'll analyze sport and we get football right here now you can see that it prints out every single letter and now the reason it does this is because the name of it is split up into different parts now what we can do is we can declare a variable right here let's do well will declare a variable outside is so dim named as string and we'll just go ahead and do name plus equals item and now we'll we'll take this out here and do it after the for loop and we'll just add name instead of item and we'll just set this equal to nothing so it will quit complaining to us so now if we run this we can go ahead and analyze a sport so select one analyze sport and we get football so I'm go ahead work a little bit with get names and get name and once you got that down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
