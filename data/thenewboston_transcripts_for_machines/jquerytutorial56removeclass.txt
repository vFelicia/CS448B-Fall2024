hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org with a video tutorial for the new bustin in this tutorial we're going to be looking at the remove class attribute in jQuery now in the last video we looked at the add class attribute however in this example we're going to create something slightly different and a bit more fun to demonstrate the remove class now add class and remove class can take an unlimited amount of classes to be removed or added so for example in the last part we looked at adding a class using add class and then we specified a class name for example bold if you had another class for example underlined you could also supply this as well now when you're using remove class you can do exactly the same thing now we're not going to be demonstrating multiple classes in this tutorial however what we are going to be doing is creating something a bit more dynamic and we're going to do that using the event the event handler toggle so let's go ahead and create a span and I'm gonna give this an ID of some text and I'm just gonna write this is some text okay so now if we go over to our browser you can see that we've got this is some text what I want to happen is when we click on this I want the text to be highlighted or underlined it doesn't really matter what we do but when we click on it I want a class to be added to it okay so let's go over to class j/s where we have our code in fact no let's first of all go over to style dot CSS and create this class so I'm going to create the cut of the class highlight and inside I'm gonna say background yellow so what this will do is once I apply this class to the text here it'll essentially highlight it let's just demonstrate that now and when we go over to our browser you can see that the text has been highlighted so we're going to use the add class and the remove class attributes in sequence using the toggle event handler once we click on this span and then that's going to highlight and then unhighlight so some practical use there as well as just being an example okay so we've got our highlight class in style dot CSS now let's go ahead and create our toggle event handler so we need to reference the some text span so I'm just going to write some text and then say dr. toggle now inside of here we can specify two different functions to be used in sequence with each other so we can either create these inside of this inside of these parentheses or we can create functions outside and in reference these inside for now just to get the hang of things we'll create them inside so I've created the function outline or the define the function and I have my block here the second parameter we are creating another function and we're just gonna pull these down so we can work a bit easier okay so the first thing I want to do is it for it to actually highlight the text so we're going to use an example as we used in the previous tutorial but with bold but we're actually going to apply the highlight class to some text so dot add class once we've referenced the text here and inside of that we specify the class itself so which is highlight we've named the class highlight in our CSS file now what I'm going to do is do exactly the same thing again I'm going to reference some text but this time I'm going to remove the class and in there specify the class I want to remove which is highlight and like I said before you can specify to add or remove multiple classes so you could go ahead and specify a bold or and underlined in here or any class that you've created so now what's going to happen is when we click on the text it's going to toggle using the toggle event handler and we're gonna first of all going to add the class highlight which will add this back round yellow to that text as I showed you earlier in the browser what we're then gonna do is next time you press it we're gonna actually remove this class so we're essentially just selecting something or highlighting something on a page so we'll go ahead and refresh the page when I click on this now you can see that it highlights when I click on it again you can see that the highlight disappears now let's go ahead and add some additional classes so I'm going to say bold and in here I'm going to choose fontweightbold so now what I can do is when I click on it I might want to also add boldness to it so when i refresh when I click on it you can see that it's been highlighted and now it's bold now what's going to happen here is because we're only removing the highlight class we are keeping the bold class added to this text so when we click here you can see that the text remains bold but the highlight disappears so now we're stuck with bold text so you can supply additional classes that you want to add or remove we can go ahead and remove bold as well so now it will go bold and highlighted and then back to normal so add class and remove class take an unlimited amount of classes that you can add or remove to them and can obviously be used for a large number of HTML elements
