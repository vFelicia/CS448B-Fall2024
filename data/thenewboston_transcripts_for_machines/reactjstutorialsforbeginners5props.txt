our rit mofos welcome back and in this video I am going to show you how to use properties in react now properties allow you to basically customize your components so say that you're making this application kind of like Netflix any application where you want it to display movies well of course you didn't want to make a component to display movie and then when you want it to display another movie you had to make a whole different component that had a different title and maybe like the main image for it you would basically want to make the blueprint or a template for one component and customize it in a bunch of different ways so that's what properties allow you to do so let's actually go ahead and do that example so I'm going to make it called a movie and remember anytime you make a component you just write react crate class make sure you get your semicolons in the right place and all right so we'll keep things real simple all I'm going to do for this component is I'm just going to display a heading 1 and heading 2 and we'll say that the heading 1 is the main title of the movie and the heading 2 can be like the genre or a description of the movie or something so render function and remember all this does all components do is they essentially just return some HTML so inside here since we're going to want a heading 1 and heading 2 then I'm going to need to wrap those and then div and now just put heading 1 and I'll say movie name and again this is what we're going to want to replace this is going to be equal to something like Avatar Good Will Hunting it's going to be different every time we use this component but right now I just hit that as a placeholder and why are you not copying all right so for heading 2 will just write the genre and just so we make sure that everything is working up to this point let me just go ahead and render one of these components right here so if I go ahead and refresh this alright our component is looking good but of course we don't just want this in here we want custom properties so instead of just using your component like this you can actually add attributes to it just like you have attributes right here and they're equal to some value you can do that in your own custom components as well so in this movie component let me just say title and for the title I can set this equal to anything I want so for this first one I'll just say avatar so this is what's going to display right here now after this let me just go ahead and give it a genre so again these properties can be named anything you want title genre favorite food pudding whatever so um I'll say what is Avatar an action movie alright there you go so now what we did is we made this component and we passed in two properties a title property and genre property so now how do we say where to display them well you display them by writing it curly braces now any of your properties you can access through this dot props so if we want to access the title we write this dot props dot title whenever we want to access the genre great for this dot props dot genre just like that now if i refresh this check it out now it says avatar action so this is the coolest part about properties and I'll show you guys this right here actually it might be easier if I do this put it on a new line all right so say that we want to display three different movies we want it to display avatar and what's another movement the notebook and the genre of the notebook is romance and what's another room Captain America then what we can do is we can render three different components and each of these components have different properties so check this out every time I render one instead of just having some static text in here it actually gets the title of whatever the component is in the genre right here so again a property is essentially an HTML attribute that we can pass in to customize our components in different kinds of ways pretty awesome a nice I'll see you guys next time
