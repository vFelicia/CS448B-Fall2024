all righty hoses welcome back and before we create any more pages before we can create any albums or add any songs what we need to do is we need to set up our database so how the heck do we do that well we need to kind of learn a few things first a couple Core Concepts of D Jango now whenever you set up your project to use D Jango it came with a few things that may not be kind of apparent at first but they're kind of going on behind the scenes the first thing I want to mention is it came with a default database and that database is SQL light or sq light whatever you want to call it and we can verify that by looking at this file and if you guys don't see this file then trust me it's there or it's set up to use it and if you actually go to website settings and scroll down to around line 77 or maybe different depending on if they changed it around you're going to see that by default the databases is set equal to SQL light 3 engine so Jango can use basically any database it can use uh post or MySQL and those kinds of databases are probably something that you want to use in production but just for testing it's really awesome that it came ready to use this right there because you know we don't got to worry about all the hard stuff of setting it up and tweaking the settings or anything like that so we know that this is good go however the way it's set up right now we basically have all of our code all of our apps and then separately we have this database so they're not connected at all we still need to configure it to work with our code so before I go on I want to show you guys something else all right so you know up to this point what we did is we made one really really simple boring app the music app and I said our website is going to have bunch of apps it's going to have like a videos app it might have a profile app I might even put like a photo viewer app in there I don't know maybe we're going to get crazy and make a whole bunch now even though we can make however many apps we want for our website what happened is whenever we set up Jango it already came with a bunch of default apps so admin authentication session messages and we'll get into exactly what these are later but basically behind the scenes jeno is already ready to work with a bunch of apps so these apps right here some of them actually need to access a database they need to set up tables in order to work so if you ever run your server and by the way I'm going to switch over to this instead of my command line just because I think it's easier to teach that way but go ahead and start your server and check out what you see all right so the server runs fine and we can look at the website just as always but if we take a minute and read this little word right here it says you have unapplied migrations your app may not be working or not work properly until they are applied whenever you see this message right here what it means is your source code your app and all your code it's not in sync with your database all right well that's not good so let's go ahead and get it in sync so go ahead and open up your command prompt or terminal and in order to do that go ahead and type python let me move my cursor out of the way manage.py migrate now go ahead and hit enter and what this is going to do is it's going to sync up your code with your database now I say sync it up but it's kind of more technical than that exactly what's happening is whenever you write migrate it's going to go in your website settings and it's going to scoll scroll down and it's going to look for installed apps right here now for each one what it's going to do is it's going to go in that apps directory and it's going to look for what tables are needed to pretty much work with this app so each app has its own uh tables that it requires and for example whenever we're working on our music app later we're going to need a table for albums and we're going to need another table for songs so on and so forth and I know all of that sounds really confusing right now like all right so you have these apps and they have like databases and they need to like migrate somewhere what the heck I promise as soon as we Define one model and we'll just make a really simple one and do everything manually and it's going to take like 5 minutes then you guys are going to be like oh yeah that makes a lot of sense I promise so check this out for right now let me go ahead and stop my server clear out of there and look what it said this time we don't have any issues no warnings and that is because after wean this command where are you right here python migrate it synced up all of our code with our database so we are now good to go
