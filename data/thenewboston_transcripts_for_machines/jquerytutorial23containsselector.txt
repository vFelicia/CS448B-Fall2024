hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we are going to be looking at the contains selector in jQuery and we're going to be producing a small little application somewhat similar to this now essentially what we have here is an unordered list with four names in now when we type into this box we have we're going to have a key up event which is going to return the elements of this unordered list that contain the value that I type so for example if I was to type G you can see that all of these values are highlighted because they all contain G if I was to type a you can see that two of these contain a capital A if I type a small a all of them contain a small a so it is case sensitive as well if I was to type a capital B the second only contains capital B and I continue to type that as well the same with something like D if I was to type al e Dale Garrett here contains a le so essentially it's just using the contains selector in a more dynamic way than if we were to just highlight something statically so it's a good example of how you might you know maybe order things around depending on what someone types or like in this case pointing out where things are so you could have a small search script I guess let's go ahead and go over to our text editor let's start creating our list and creating our box and then the jQuery code behind it so we the first thing we want to go ahead and do is create our unordered list if we go ahead and just refreshed it blank the page will go ahead and create this list it's essentially just going to be an unordered list with an ID so the idea of this going to be names and inside each element we are going to create obviously a name inside so we'll have four of these and we'll go ahead and play some data inside of each one so Alex Guerra and then we'll say that Billy Guerra Dale Garrett and Ashley okay okay so now that we've done this we know that the idea of this is names and it looks something like this we're going to go ahead and inside style.css we're going to style this so it just looks a bit nicer first of all not really relevant but we might as well so we want the this style to be none and that will just get rid of the circles the bullet points and we want to set the padding and the margin both to zero so set the margin here to zero and that just pulls that in a bit so now let's go ahead and create the so now we can go ahead and grab the or create rather the input field where we're going to be typing the names that are going to match the values so let's go ahead and just create a paragraph here and inside create an input field with obviously the type text and we'll go ahead and give that an ID as well so I'm just going to call this search underscore name so we now have an input field just up here we can begin to type values into here which will then use the contain selector to search the relevant li or the list element okay so let's go over to ext dot j s now inside here we obviously want to wait for the document to be ready so we use document ready and inside of here we create a function that we run once the Dom has been loaded so the first thing we want to do is set an event handler to this search name input field here and what that will do is it will wait we're going to be using the key up event handler so what's going to happen is every time a key comes up we'll be able to retrieve the value contained within this text field and obviously perform the search so we use a hash ID selector to select a search name that's search underscore name and then we bind the key up if then handle to this inside we create a function which will be the code that runs when every time our key is up inside of this field and the first thing we want to do inside of this event is actually grab the name
