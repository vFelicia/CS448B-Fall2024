are already houses welcome back and in this video I'm going to show you how to sort custom objects by any attribute that you want so let's go ahead and say that you were working on the social network and you had a bunch of users signed up and they all had like first names last names birthdays maybe a user ID they also listed their favorite colors and I don't know like how much money was in their bank account for whatever reason many ways these users had a bunch of different attributes and you were having a tough time figuring out how to make an algorithm or function to sort by each one so let's say you want to sort by favorite colors or birthdays you can do that so check this out what we're going to do is just like before we're going to use operator module and we're going to import attribute getter so now item getter by attribute getter so now let me go ahead and make a real quick class and I think you need two spaces Pepe all right so class user and let me just make dunder init and we'll say that whenever you make a new user object we'll say that they need a name and user ID so we'll just say x and y all right so self name equals x and so I'll just name it a user ID equals y so whenever we initialize object we'll just say like Bucky ten or whatever so something like that all right looking good now actually another thing that I want to do I'll show you guys a cool it's not really a trick but dunder init of course that means whenever you initialize there's another one called ar e PR so this is a string representation of this object so that means let's say that you just wanted to print out let's say that you had um an instance of this user class that was Bucky so the info was just the name Bucky and my user ID which was ten but then later on in your code you just said print out Bucky well then Python would be like what exactly do you want me to print out a about him his name or his user ID or his name and his user ID or do you want to print out where that object is in memory I mean what the heck am I supposed to know what Bucky is what you want well that's what this is for right here so what we can do is we can basically just return whatever representation we want to make and we can make this however we want so I'll say whenever I just say print out Bucky then it's going to print out that object's name and then I'll print out his ID and I'll separate them by like I don't know semicolons or whatever so plus and again this user ID it's actually going to be um an int so we need to make sure to convert that to a string sofie's your ID and the name of course is already a string so that's why we don't need to do that but again whenever we say print out an instance or a user object then this is what it's going to give us so just save us a little bit of time from formatting everyone later on all right so now let me go ahead and make a bunch of users paste that in so you guys don't have to watch me do it all so now I have a list of user objects I have Bucky Sally tuna Brian who's name is tuna that's weird but actually that would be a pretty cool name I'm gonna name my kid tuna all right and they all have user IDs nothing special however what we want to do is we pretty much just want to sort all of these users so let's see what order they're sorted in by default so for user in users just go ahead and print user so run that and check it out and again it prints it and maybe if I add a space right there might be a little bit easier to see but again it prints it in the specified order so by default and see what's going on here prints out Bucky Sally tuna Brian re so it prints it out in whatever order we initialize objects in however we want to you know make special functions to sort them by name and also the our ID since whenever like you're looking for a friend you just don't want to look through all of them randomly randomly wouldn't be very efficient so check this out let me add that little separator so they don't cut it all jumbled together and we'll do this for user just name it user still in sorted and again what do you want to sort users nothing new there but what we're going to do is we just don't want to sort it in the default order what we want to do is we want to sort it by we'll say sort them by name first so get an attribute and in this case we'll just type name and this is how we can specify how to sort so just like before we'll print user and check this out so again what this does is it just doesn't print them out in default order it sorts them by their name and then this is a lot more efficient and again if you want to do by ID then what I just name it user ID then we'll just say sort this iterable by this attribute so now we can go ahead and run this and check it out so this is default this one sorted by name and this of course is sorted by their user ID two five nine forty three sixty one and 77 so how awesome is that again a lot easier than you may have been doing it before oh yeah there you go in six minutes you learn not only about representations about how to sort custom objects I mean this is absolutely fantastic so think as watching I will smell you next time
