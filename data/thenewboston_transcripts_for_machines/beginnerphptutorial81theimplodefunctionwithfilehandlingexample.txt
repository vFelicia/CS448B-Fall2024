hi this is Alex from PHP Academy and this is another tutorial for the New Boston now in this example I'm going to be showing you uh something we did in the previous tutorial we exploded data so we took data uh from this file just here names.txt that was comma delimited so we had commas in the middle of each piece of data and we um read it in and took away the commas and displayed it line by line uh rendering it basically so we can do anything with each name now suppose I have an array like this one and I've got three names in my array and I want to add commas in between um this data so as it stands it's in Array format we um can access uh each element of the array by saying um names array and putting in the uh key of the array so here what would happen was we' we' uh output Alex now I'm going to do completely what I did with completely opposites what I did with the explode and I'm going to use implode so I'm going to create a string and I'm going to call this uh variable string and I'm going to say implode and give it the same um comma that I did before and in fact a space then what I'm going to do is I'm going to give it the value names array now what we've actually done here straight away is we've we've taken away the array we've taken away the array and we've created a string so now if I just Echo out string you can see that um we've created um a string from this so if I was reading in that data with the commas and I wanted to then say maybe output some updated data I need some way of taking that array putting commas back into it so I can pop it back into the file so now what we can do is after this uh do our usual file open business uh just down here open up the file write to the file um or appen to the file so we can we can you can use the previous tutorials to achieve this so it's simply achieved by the implode and obviously you're not limited to what you can put in here you could implode using let's say hyphens so if we come down here uh we'll get rid of this and we could Echo out string for example now if I was to refresh you can see that hyphens have been put in between the data so this isn't just used for file handling it can be used for a variety different uses if you're trying to get an array and you want to create some string data out of that and you want to use a little delimiter in here um such as a comma or a forward slash maybe even tabs or spaces you can pop them in there and that will implode that few so if you think about exploding and imploding it's the complete opposite
