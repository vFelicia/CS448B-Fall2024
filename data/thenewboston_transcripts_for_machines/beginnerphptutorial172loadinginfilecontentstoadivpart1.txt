hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a video tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be looking at opening up a another file using Ajax so I've got my file over here called including PHP and this contains PHP code because we're talking about Ajax relative to PHP we have created this one I've created this PHP document called include Inc PHP which has PHP code inside it so eventually as we progress through the Ajax series what we're going to look at is opening a file that's going to say maybe grab some values from a database or something like that and eventually we'll learn how to produce dynamic content so when a user say moves the mouse button we update em say index dot PHP page with relevant data or when we type something we update with it with relevant data from a database but before we do this what we need to think about is how we're actually going to open a file without refreshing the page so as you know in PHP we can use things like include and then we can include a specific a specific fast which will include Inc dot PHP but this is useless to us because it's only including the contents of the file we're not triggering anything what we could do is we could create a form under here or a button under here which would take us to the page so we could say input type equals submit and then we could say on click and then we can incorporate some JavaScript in here so we could say window dot location equals index dot PHP show equals include for example and then what we could do is we could come down and we can say if is set dollar underscore get because we're passing a get variable called show the get variable show could go in there then we could say include oh sorry it's a combination of including echo the include dollar underscore get so so what we can do is we can well we can pass that including geography there so we're passing a variable through when we click on a button including pH P is then going to be checked to see if something anything exists and then it's going to include the relevant file so here what we can do is if we go back to our page we can click on submit and that'll include our file however we want to do that without refreshing the page you notice if we go back and we click on submit you see that we refresh the page and we've come up with we've would Betty gone on to index dot PHP again but with this show variable here so what we want to do is we want to achieve a similar effect to this however we don't want to refresh the page and we're going to be dealing with divs as well so we're going to have a div and this is going to be filled with some content from including dot PHP so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a standard outline from HTML document so I'm going to create some head tags and body tags here and obviously our route HTML tags at the end inside head we're going to be putting all the JavaScript inside body we're going to insert the button and the div itself so we're not actually writing any PHP in this file but the point of the tutorial is to show you how we can use Ajax to UM load in this include file which is a PHP document and has PHP code inside of it so the first thing we want to do is create what we want to show on the website on the page rather so I'm going to put another input button and that's going to be submit like we just like I've just shown you in the previous example however this time I'm going to say on click equals load and this is going to call a function that we're going to write up here in a minute in our head in inside some script tags so we're going to declare that we want to write some JavaScript code and then we're going to call this function when we when we click the button so we'll test this out in just a moment but for now as well I want to put an ID and I'm going to give it the div sorry I'm going to give it the ID a and then we're going to close it there we're not going to write any content in here okay so we're not writing any content in here we're going to rely on us clicking this button load function up here loading content into this div and we're going to do that without refreshing the page at all so you may have gone onto a website where it says maybe click here or there's a column of options and you click it and it instantly gives you the content on to the right of it this is a very similar thing that we're doing here but we're loading in this include ink dot PHP into this div again without refreshing the page so let's come up here and create our script tag so script type equals and that's text forward slash JavaScript so we can tell our browser that we've got JavaScript code in here now let's give this a test so I want to test when we click on this button here that we execute or call a function called load let's just set up our load function here so we've got function load here we're not giving it any parameters but what we are going to do is just alert work so we know that everything works so when we click on this button we've got this on click event here then we're going to call the function load we're going to come up here call this function and we're going to create an alert so let's go back to our index dot PHP page okay so we've got our submit button we click it and we get a message saying works so we know that everything works now what we can do is get on with creating our Ajax code now we need to do a variety of checks this is pretty standard code and I'm not going to explain exactly how it works and what each function does and but follow along the example and you'll generally get an idea of what's happening I will explain most elements as much as I can possibly explain in the video without confusing myself and we'll go along and we'll write this out
