so this function here is grabbing the data as an associative array and we're putting it inside query row therefore inside our while statement what we call while loop we can echo out the specific data so we can echo out query remember we're using an eraser we've square brackets here now this corresponds to the row the field name that you want to show so I will just want to show the name so I'm just going to type name into here we're going to append a line break on the end just to keep things nice and neat and tidy and what we can do is if it is greater than 1 we can echo up here say results found and what we can also do is we can we can echo out the number of results found so where let's take this well I'll demonstrate the the way the program is working at the moment and then we can make that slight modification so let's go and refresh the page okay so I'm going to type in Alex and click search you can see that results found Alex Garrett and Alex Malcolm now let's search for Garrett and click search you can see that we've found everyone with the surname Gera now let's just type in Dale click search we can see we've found one result let's type grr again everyone with that let's type in a and you see we've received all results because every result has an A in it or every record has an A in it now we can protect against this you could you could for example say if the query string is smaller than a length of four which is what most applications do do they don't allow you to search for data that's under say our four characters because you'll return too many results so let's just go ahead and and do that so we're if m empty search name so inside here we're going to say if str len search name is greater than or smaller than opa we can say is greater than or equal to five or four we'll say grace the negative or then execute all this code and let's find where the one two closing so we'll put that there and then we're going to indent all of this so essentially what I've just done is I've added in another if statement saying if the string length of search name so we're using the string length function of search name is greater than or equal to four then we can run all this code then otherwise we echo your keyword must be five characters or more so now if we try to say Alex this is going to work because it is greater than or equal to if we would say I now and click search your keyword must be five characters or more so we're now coming into more of a search engine based tutorial I guess and there's a couple of more things we need to address or one more thing that we need to address and that is how many results that are found so I'm going to go ahead and take out this here and I'm going to put it into a new variable called query num rows so now what I can do is I can substitute this in here query num rows and we can also echo out here query num rows dot space and results found so this is going to say a number and this is the same number as well so we're using this variable that's why I took it out and popped it into this variable here and we're appending on a space and the results found so let's go ahead and type in Alex click search two results found this displaying two results now let's go ahead and type in Garret and you can see that three results are found in this display so this is the like condition in in PHP like I said you can use this with underscores to represent specific characters so we're filling in the blanks for specific characters and also we can use our wildcards on the left right hand side or on either side of our of our value that we're trying to match to so we've created a little program that search for names you can use this to search for absolutely any data you just need to take into account why I've said and represent the field names with the names that you want to search with
