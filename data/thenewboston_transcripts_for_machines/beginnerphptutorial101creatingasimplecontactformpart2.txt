okay so the last field that we need to check for is um the content itself so this is oh sorry this is no different so what we just need to do is say dollar unor poost and we need to specify our contactor text now my text editor online here seems to have gone a bit funny so I'm just going to save this file and I'm going to close that and I'm going to reopen it in our plain text editor so we're going to have to deal with plain text for now but that doesn't really matter okay so now what we need to do is we've checked if we've set the contact name we've checked if we've set the contact email and we've checked if we've set the contact text this doesn't mean that the value actually equals anything so the next thing we need to do is we need to check whether these uh fields are empty considering they're all required we need them all to equal at least one value so um we are first of all going to set them into their own variable so can use them a lot easier inside of our um inside of our if statement so what we're going I'm going to do is create an individual variable for each one so contactor name this can obviously be anything you like um and then we say equals dollcore poost and then we say contact name so what we're doing is we're just taking this variable here and we're putting it into a contact name now you might be asking why aren't we doing this outside of our if statement and the reason we're not doing this outside of our if statement is is because this post might not be Set uh and we're going to get what's called an undefined index or an undefined variable error because we're we're um assuming this value exists before we've checked that they're set so remember to always declare your variables inside after you've checked for them being set so now I'm going to say contact email equals doore poost contact email so we're doing exactly the same thing for each uh value uh that we're submitting uh contactor text equal dollcore poost contact uncore Text Okay so we've now got all uh three variables from our form let's just go ahead and Echo these out we can put an echo in front of here and what this is going to do is just going to Echo out each value so if we click save changes and we come into here let's go ahead and click send you can see that the form has been submitted but nothing's happened with regards to PHP because we've checked using this is set language construct so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to type Alex my name um uh I'm going to type um let's say my email address in here and uh then I can just type a small message in here so hi for example now let's click Send and see what happens okay so you can see that the first uh variable has been picked up here which is the in the name field and then here we've picked up the email address and then here we've picked up the message so let's go back to um our editor and let's get rid of this Echo Parts here CU we don't actually want to Echo them out to the user now after this we can check for their existence so we can check if they equal nothing so let's go if not empty contact name and so we're using this and operator again not empty contact email so empty um is basically checking if this value is equal to null and not is saying we don't want it to be empty so we we we're we're making sure this is equal to True by saying we don't want it to be empty so we're saying and not empty contactor text so uh let's go down now and uh we inside here we need to do something if these do exist or these do equal something so for now I'm just going to Echo our okay okay so let's go and uh try and submit the form without any data okay now let's put say A B and C in here click Send and that's okay so that's worked um what we can actually do is specify an error message uh if this if these are are or if one of them are empty well in fact no these are going to be or because uh what we're doing is we're checking if um if uh either of them or if if one out of the three of them is empty so we need to use this or uh instead of and so I'm going to Echo here if else I'm going to say um all fields are oh required okay so let's click save changes and see what happens here so let's click Send all fields are required uh now we can type a b or c or and c and uh click okay so if we were just Just typ In A and B here and we click Send um oh we're still getting oh no sorry sorry uh my mistake uh completely these should be and now the reason I got confused there is because we what we would do is if this if this if statement was if empty if empty empty empty we would say if empty contact name or empty contact email but we're saying not empty and we don't want any of them to be empty so many apologies for that okay so if they are not empty what do we want to do well that's easy we want to send an email to ourselves
