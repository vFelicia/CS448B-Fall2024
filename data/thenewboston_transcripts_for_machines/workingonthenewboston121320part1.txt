all right all right just getting everything set up let's get the youtube chat up in here as well all right looking good on twitch might check my check okay i guess um all right looking good on youtube let me get some comments you guys all right what up yo all right so today yeah nothing too exciting i just want to go through some pr's actually let me do this all right what's up bro all right so this is what we got planned for today again nothing uh too exciting just need to review a bunch of open pr's mainly from website and then yeah i'll go through what we're working on yeah i need to write some tickets up pretty boring stuff and then going to be writing a release plan and then have product meeting later on and then after that just gonna record some videos also got my chat over here so all right so pr review time and also let me shift this over so i can read your guys comments as well has he been streaming or did i just start streaming i started streaming last night so all right apparently a lot of people thought i was dead so it's interesting man i'm gonna get easily distracted with all these so let's hop on over to github all right reviewed this one earlier mac instructions we got here okay so yes this pr looks to be for this let me show you guys so on the download page whenever you download for mac that there's additional step in here for some security or verified app okay so this is pretty old since it uh was here since november 9th i'm not sure if it's issues still where's the hat uh no hat today although i probably should put one on i like wearing a winter hat with uh my headset because it flakes and it kind of gets all over me but it's a little warm in here right now so i don't know hat or no hat what do you think we got ball cap or winter hat or just straight up my head all right there's one vote for winner him okay let's check this out apple cannot check for malicious software when you're downloading this and this is interesting too because we are uh certified pirate hat nice big head okay i guess you like my uh straight up head mmhmm yeah this should be uh tutorial on unity i need a mod as well for this to prevent against these spammers so this is just a stream and i'm just going to be working on the digital currency network nothing special nothing planned just figure out if anyone wants to kind of tag along okay so so in order for this app to open without coming from the app store and without needing to do any special interactions which we do now we essentially right click and hit open you need to get the app notarized to developer process an automated process so i thought that this is what we did uh it always happens apps not download from the app store okay yeah since i did go through uh like apple's developer program and bought license to get notarized whatever it was okay so it seems like this is the correct solution so uh this this is okay let's add it in and okay since there's no related issue is this related could you say uh yeah maybe it is all right so this fixes issue number hmm is this related so this issue is apple cannot check for malicious software but it doesn't really describe the fix since it's still not checking but they are related so 431 actually i just paste this oh wait this is the account manager so this is different repo all together so let me just create an issue for this since it should be linked uh let's see special instructions all right let me submit this and also what was this original issue look like none upgrading my laptop to big sur as well can't see the letters this and that okay of this too big and it's hard for me to read so thank you for the tutorials you're welcome glad they could help all right so we have this newly created issue 114 and i'll just say this fixes 114 which it should pick up but it didn't so i can just do this beautiful now i just want to check this out to make sure it's all prettier than everything so i'm going to go my website repo pull it down and if you guys don't know how to do this on a web store whenever you are working on an open source project as the maintainer and someone submits a pr you can go to vcs get and then you can do volt view pull request and then if you don't have it already it gives you this little tab my laptop's updating right now by the way in its fan it's pretty loud but anyways let's get back to here so this uh poor request is from zeus lawyer dl mac instructions so we can probably just find that zeus lawyer mac instructions then you click this and then you can check out branch and then you can check out a tracking branch and create and now this should be good so npm install let me see what's up with that and let me also all right is that big enough for you guys i can't really do anything about this text yo yo what up what up hey everyone okay a couple people joining now all right so i can't do anything about the text on the side but it looks like these dependencies are just old and let me go to this file and what was this for so source containers download index all right so let me run this actually so that bad boy's booting up can get rid of this and another thing that i like to do is if you do npm run prettier then we have a npm script that essentially goes through all these files and just uh formats them correctly for some reason it keeps formatting ts config this is actually interesting if any of you guys know what's going on with this let me show you if you do get enroll back this is the fastest way i compare is that whenever i run prettier it changes jsx react to react hyphen jsx and i'm not sure why because this is a ts config i don't know why prettier keeps writing that or maybe it's my ide and it just happens while i'm running for it here wait you guys can't see the code can you guys see this man this is kind of annoying i have to scroll on each one can't stick around but bucky you're the reason i have six for your job right now thank you for that you are welcome josh the code isn't clear on 720p okay let's bump this up let's bump it way up let me actually okay the quality needs to be better not bigger text uh is this not 1080p all right let's take a little break and uh just make the stream all right so akrom says no it's not 1080 okay so so this is my second time streaming so how would i you look like an egg interesting all right no it's not 1080 so i probably have to restart my stream and make it 1080a heist is 720 all right so i'll be back in a second with uh an hd stream you
