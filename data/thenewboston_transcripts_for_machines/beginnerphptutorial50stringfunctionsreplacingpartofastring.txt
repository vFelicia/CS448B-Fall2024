this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and in this video creative for the New Boston I'm going to be talking to you about substring replace now substring replace looks like this this is how we call the function in PHP now substring replace takes up to four arguments the first argument that we take is the string that we want to look at the second argument is the string that we want to replace the third argument is where we want to start and the fourth argument is where we want to end how many characters or how many I guess length if you like the length of the replacement now let's have a look at what this white basically does first substring replace like I said is a combination of substring and STR replace so we have substring and PHP which will return a specific part of a string so we could specify in a string let's say if we had a string Alex if I wanted to start at zero one and go to characters we were we would return e x so that's substring STR replace will find a string within a string and it will replace it with a specified string so substring replace is really a combination of these two functions so why would we need this we need this because we're searching for something but what we're then doing is we're we're replacing we're replacing the string with a specified amount of data so for example if you wanted to cut a string in half this would be a function to use if you wanted to say in fact no sorry if you wanted to cut a string in half you could use substring but with substring replace it will search for a string but only within a specified portion of a string so let's create a string now that we can work with to show this example off I'm going to choose this part don't search let's just put a slash there this part search now what's the idea of this example I'm going to not include this part of the string I don't want this part of the string to be searched in however I want this part of the string to be searched in and what I want to do is I want to replace part with another word so let's create a new variable called string underscore new and this is going to be equal to calling substring replace now we can start putting the arguments in it to start putting this into practice so the first argument is easy we just need to supply the string that we want to look in the second is and we need to put in the string that we want to replace so I want to replace part this word here with something else so let's just say part No we'll just say yeah mmm Alex I can't think of any better examples so the next argument we need to give is where to start looking so or where we start want to replace so if we count up the characters we're going to say 1 2 and B 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 I'm not sure if that's counted 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 so this will either be 29 or 30 I think and then how many characters or will the length of where we want to search that's 4 because we've got 4 characters in part so let's have a look now at string new and see what's happened it's quite hard to come up with an example with something for this but when you do need it you'll say oh that would be useful so yeah okay so this is worked I counted correctly so now we're saying this part don't search this Alex search so we haven't actually searched but we've rather specified where we want to replace within the string now why would this be useful and where would this be use for in a reallife example let's say we had a forum where a user could like in a word processing like on a word processor you can search and replace we've already covered searching within a string so if we were to search within this string and look for part we could then find out that part is located at point 29 at location 29 we could then say well we've searched for part the word part is four characters long so then you can take in user input and specify what you'd like to replace so in this particular tutorial I won't be demonstrating that however there is another tutorial where we create the exact program that I've just talked about all the scripts that I've just talked about so these are the fundamentals of STL substring replace but in the other tutorial we're going to look at how we can put this into practice and how it might be useful
