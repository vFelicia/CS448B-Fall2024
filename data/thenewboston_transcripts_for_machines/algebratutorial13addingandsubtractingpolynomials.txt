okay so today we're gonna talk about adding and subtracting polynomials and a polynomial is this expression right here and it's an expression that contains variables with different sorts of powers so this is not a polynomial it's anything with a degree higher or equal to two so when we add or subtract polynomials what we're going to use is our knowledge of combining like terms because you can't combine unlike terms and these parenthesis when we add and subtract them they don't really matter I know that sounds kind of crazy cuz when we learn an order of operations parentheses matter a lot but when we're just talking about adding and subtracting polynomials it doesn't because these are just expressions they're not equations that we're trying to find an answer to so what we're gonna do is first we're gonna rewrite this and what we're gonna do is we're gonna distribute this positive one to each one of these terms and we're gonna drop the parentheses on both polynomials so this is X cubed plus 2x squared plus 8x that part stays the same and this is plus 2x and positive times negative stays negative 3x squared this also stays negative 3x cubed and now what we're gonna do is you can do two different things and it just depends on what you prefer better you can write it in descending order so you have your highest power and then we're gonna bring this one over and then your next highest power if you want to rewrite it before you combine your like terms that's fine you don't have to I personally don't but it really doesn't matter what you do so X cubed minus X cubed is zero so those are gonna go away 2x squared minus 3x squared is gonna give us a negative x squared + 8 X + 2 X is gonna give us a positive 10x so that's all you have to do it's really just distribution and combining like terms so we're gonna do some examples now okay so this time we have a negative so it's really really important that we distribute that negative because if you forget you're gonna end up maybe adding some things that you're not supposed to or subtracting some things that you're not supposed to so we're gonna copy the first part that stays the same and when we take negative one because remember there's an understood one right there times X we're gonna get negative x and negative one times negative one is gonna give us a positive one so then we're gonna combine our like terms 4x plus a negative x is going to give us 3x + 2 + 1 is gonna give us 3 now if you remember when I introduced these I said that there in expression and an expression is just what we call something that doesn't have an equal sign because if it if this said equals 9 then that would be an equation but when it doesn't have an equals it's called an expression just in case you see that on homework or any other kind of worksheets that you do at home I want I want you to know that that's all it means so we're gonna do the same thing down here distribute this negative and that's really the most important part is that if you have a negative or even if say you had like a 2 right here you'd have to multiply it all out so that you don't add or subtract incorrectly so negative 2 y squared plus 8 and a twos not supposed to be there negative 1 times 3 y squares can give us negative 3 y squared negative times negative is gonna give us positive 4y and the negative times a negative is gonna give us a positive 6 now we're gonna combine our terms negative 2y squared minus 3y squared is gonna give us a negative 5y squared and then we have a plus for Y because this there's nothing else with a Y in it and then we have 8 plus 6 so plus 14 so if you notice right here there this is 8 minus and there's a positive over here and you might not understand why I added 6 instead of subtracting 6 but remember when we did some basic algebra and we said that this is the same thing as adding a negative well that negative stays on that 3 it doesn't go with the 6 so you that's you really have to make sure that you pay attention to your signs because that'll mess up what you get is a final answer we have one more so we have this part is gonna stay the same we're going to distribute that negative negative 6x plus 8y minus 11 now this time we have more than one variable but that really doesn't change anything because we're still gonna combine like terms like we would normally would so 7y plus 8y is 15 y plus 4x minus 6x is negative 2x and 9 minus 11 is negative 2 so that's all we're gonna do with pollen wheels today but make sure you come back and watch our next lesson where we're gonna talk about multiplying a polynomial by a monomial
