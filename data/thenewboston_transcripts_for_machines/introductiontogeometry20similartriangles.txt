so when we say we have similar triangles it means that their corresponding angles are congruent and their corresponding sides are proportional so if triangle ABC is similar to Triangle D EF angle a is congruent to angle D angle B is congruent to angle e angle C is congruent to angle F and their sides are proportional so a over D is equal to B over e is equal to C over s f so we know that triangle AB C is similar to Triangle DF if we we know that side a = 5 C = 9 and F equal 18 we want to find out what side D equals so since they're similar that means that their sides are proportional so a which is right here five over D which is what we're trying to find out out is equal to C over F because they're similar in proportional triangles so just like we would solve a normal proportion we're going to cross multiply and we're going to get 9 B is equal to 5 * 18 so 9 D = 90 divide both sides by 9 you get D = 10 so if e is equal to 24 find B so e is equal to 24 and we want to find side B so B over 24 is equal to we're going to set it equal to 9 over 18 so then we're going to cross multiply we get 18 B is equal 9 * 24 18 B = 26 divide both sides by 18 and we get b equal 12 okay so the thing to remember when we're setting up these proportions to find the lengths of these sides we want to keep the proportions consistent so in the first one I started with five which is this side of this big triangle so I'm going to put that over this side of the Little Triangle and I'm going to go back to the big triangle and put this side over this side of the Little Triangle now we could do the opposite and have the little triangle over the big triangle it doesn't matter as long as we keep it consistent so we still have these two triangles but now we know that the measure of angle a is 35 the measure of angle C is 65 and we have to find the measure of all the other angles so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to find the measure of angle B and we can do that using our rules of the interior angles of triangles so 35 + 65 + x is equal to 180 because all the angles in a triangle always add up to 180 so 35 + 65 is equal to 100 + x is equal to 180 so X is equal if we subtract 100 over X is equal to 80 so that means B is equal to 80 so now in order to find out the angles of the Little Triangle we need to remember what similar triangles have in common since we know that these two triangles are similar that means that they're corresponding angles are congruent so the measure of angle D has to equal the measure of angle a since angle a is 35 measure of angle D is also 35 same thing goes for the measure of angle F this angle corresponds to angle C so since angle C is 65째 the measure of angle f is also 65째 and last the measure of angle e is congruent to the measure of angle B since we find found the measure of angle B to be 80째 we know that the measure of angle e also has to be 80째 so now that we know what similar triangles are in our next lesson we're going to talk about how we can identify similar triangles so make sure you come back and watch
