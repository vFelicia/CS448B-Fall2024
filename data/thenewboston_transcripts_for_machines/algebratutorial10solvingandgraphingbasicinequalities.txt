we're going to start with a little review of inequalities and then we're going to learn how to solve and graph inequalities so I don't know how many of you have ever seen an inequality before but the chances are you have so this symbol right here is the less than symbol and it's saying that whatever that's this is both of these signs are like equals but instead of saying that this is equal to this they're going to say that either this is less than blank or this is greater than blank so when your little point is facing that way it means that this is less than this and that this is greater than this so now that we know that I'm going to show you what a basic inequality looks like where s is greater than six and we always look at this inequality symbol from the variabl perspective because we could write this as this which means that 6 is less than S but it means that s is greater than six so s is is greater than 6 or we could say that t is less than 7 and those are what basic inequalities look like so when we solve our inequalities we're going to graph them and you always graph the solution to an inequality on a number line so when you have an inequality that has less than or equal I'm sorry if you have an inequality that's less than or greater than when you graph it you're going to use an open circle and that's not going to really make sense to you right now but it will in a minute when we go on to graphing but if you have less than or equal to or greater than or equal to it's going to be a closed Circle and the most important thing to remember when Sol in inequalities is that if you divide or multiply your inequality by a negative you must flip your inequality so if I had X is less than 2 when I divide by the ne1 I'm going to get X is greater than 2 that inequality sign has to flip otherwise you're going to get the wrong answer so now let's do an example 9 is less than 3 * the quantity of 1 minus s and this is an S if you couldn't tell sorry kind of looks like a weird five so first thing we're do we're going to do is distribute that three over 9 is less than 3 3 S I'm going to subtract ract three from both sides and I get 6 is less than 3 s I'm going to divide by3 and 3 and when you solve this this is what you want to think if you divide by a negative if you divide by a negative then you flip your sign so 2 and we're going to flip it is greater than S so that means s is less than 2 either way is correct so when I said when we graph it on a number line we we we're going to graph it on a number line that looks like this so we're going to find 2 on the number line which it will be right here and we're going to put a circle over 2 now remember if it's just less than or greater than it's going to have an open circle and if it's less than or equal to or greater than or equal to we're going to have a closed Circle so since it's only less than we're going to have a open circle and we're going to shade the direction of the inequality so there's two ways you can remember this you can remember that this inequality points to the left so I'm going to shade to the left or you can think of it more ma more mathematically and we're going to put an arrow right here because remember lines go on forever or you could plug in a number that's on the left of your circle which would be like 4 well is 4 less than 2 yes because remember as we go as we get more negative we're decreasing in value and then you would pick a number to your right to make sure that it doesn't work to your right well is two less than 2 no it's greater than 2 so that's how you know that you were supposed to shade it this way so we have one more example that we're going to do so 3 * the quantity of 2 m 8 is less than or equal to 2 quanti time the quantity of n + 2 so first thing we're going to do is distribute on both sides of the equation so we have 6 m + 24 less than or equal to 2 m + 28 now some of you might say that well didn't we didn't we multiply by a negative yes we did but we don't flip the sign yet because we only multiplied one side by a negative it only affects your inequality when you have to multiply both sides or divide both sides by a negative so then I'm going to move the 2 m this way and this is going to be I'm going to subtract 2 m from both sides so this becomes 8 m + 24 less than or equal 28 I'm going to subtract 24 from both sides and I get 8 m is less than or equal to 4 so I'm I'm going to divide by8 and divide by8 so since I divided both sides by a negative number I'm going to flip my inequality and if I reduce this this becomes one2 so we're going to find one2 on our number line which is going to be about right there and we're going to put a circle on it okay so if you remember remember your rules for graphing since this is greater than or equal to 12 we're going to close this circle and fill it in because if you think about it one2 is less than or equal to one2 yes that's true so we can fill that in and so you can think of it two ways you can say oh look my inequality is pointing that way so I'm going to shade in this way and we can check it mathematically by saying that plugging in a number to the left and to the right well if I plugged in 2 is 2 greater than or equal 2 no is three greater than or equal to 2 yes so I know I shaded it the right way so that's all we're going to do with inequalities today but make sure you come back and watch your next lesson where we're going to talk about compound inequalities that have more than one answer
