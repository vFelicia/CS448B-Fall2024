so today we're just gonna work some more with proofs and expanding what we are able to prove so our first proof we're going to do is a triangle inequality proof so given that the measure of angle abd abd right here is greater than the measure of angle DBC so this is greater than this proved that ad is greater than B D ok so first we're going to write down our given information and then is given to us okay so what we're trying to do is get this to be greater than this so you want to think back a little bit and remember the deal with triangle inequality if we can prove that the measure that the measure of the angle opposite this so this angle right here is greater than the angle opposite this then this the first side is greater than the second side so that's what we're going to try and do so our next step we're going to we can say that DBC so this little the smaller angle right here is greater than D a B which is right here or sorry not da yeah DC DBC is greater than this angle right here because if you remember that property that says this angle is equal to the sum of this angle in this angle well there's another little theorem that says the exterior angles are greater than either remote interior angle which is these which are these two angles right here so then we can say look see how this is greater than this and this is greater than this well if the measure of angle abd is greater than the measure of DBC doesn't that mean it's also greater than da be because it's greater than D bc which is greater than da be so we're going to use our transitive property to say that the measure of angle abd is greater than the measure of angle D a B and all we're doing is we're sliding this onto the end is greater than that which is greater than that and that's transitive property where if a equals B & B equals C a equals C okay now we have one last step so remember how I said that the bigger side is opposite the bigger angle well since we know that this angle right here is bigger than da b that means that the angle the side opposite b which is a d is greater than the side opposite a which is DB so therefore ad is greater than B D if a triangle in touch to in a triangle if two angles are not congruent not congruent then the bigger side lies across the bigger angle and we're done you always want your last statement to match the prove statement you're given in the problem okay given B 0 is congruent given bo is congruent to H n and O H is congruent to n BN prove that this angle o is congruent to this angle n okay so we're going to render give in pairs be hos congruent to h + + o H congruent to be and given okay now if we want to be able to say that this is congruent there's something we can do if we prove that the triangles are congruent first we can then say that their corresponding parts are congruent so so far we have one angle or one side is equal to one side two sides is equal to two sides and then they share this side right here be h so we can say that B H is congruent to be H reflexive property and then we can say that these triangle can these triangles are congruent by sidesideside because we have three pairs of congruent sides so triangle be 0 H is congruent to triangle h + b by sidesideside and then we can say that angle is congruent to angle and because you remember when we have congruent triangles their corresponding parts are also congruent so if two congruent triangles corresponding parts are also congruent and that's all we have to do for that one so that's all we're going to do with proofs today but um in our next lesson we're going to do some some new kind of proofs
