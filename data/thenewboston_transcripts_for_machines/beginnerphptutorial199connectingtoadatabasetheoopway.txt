hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is a PHP video tutorial for the new Boston now in this tutorial we're going to be connecting to our database but we're going to be using a class to do this and we're also going to be using a constructor to initiate some variables first of all when we initiate this class when we create a new instance of this class so what we're doing is we're taking a few things that we've learnt already and we're applying them into a reallife situation or reallife application rather so the first thing I want to do is obvious I'm going to create a new class so this class is going to be called database connect so let's open that up into our block so we can start writing what we need inside of it now the first thing we need is a constructor and what this is going to do is it's going to take the host name the username and the password and it's going to apply this to a method inside of our class so we're only working with one class here but we're using a constructor first of all to take in some variables and then what we're doing is we're using a method inside of our class to actually connect to the database now if the database connect successfully we're going to return true and then in the constructor we're going to rotate this value we're going to return either true or false from the method and in the constructor we're going to pick up on either this true or false value and then echo if we've successfully connected or if we have them so it's a bit of a long way round of things however what we're actually doing is practicing that's the main thing we're practicing okay so the first thing we need to do is create our constructor so I've got here I'm going to say public function two underscores and Constructicons strucked okay so remember the parentheses at the end we're going to put our arguments in there in a moment and then our block here remember that as well so if you don't remember what a construct does let me just demonstrate let's just echo out hello now let's come down here and create a new instance of our class by saying connection equals new database connect now what this does is is as soon as we initiate this class as soon as we create a new instance of it this code inside this block will be run that's basically what we're looking at when we see this constructor here so you can see that we've run the text hello however if this was to be a normal function or normal method we wouldn't automatically echo anything out so let's get rid of that and let's get rid of that then we need to think about what parameters we need to pass through into our into our class as it's created so we need the DB host which is the database host and you can name these anything I'm just calling them disks up this is what I'm used to DB username and DB password okay so let's give this a test so let's echo out the DB user the DB host sorry and append a break onto that and the DB username append another break onto that and the DB password so we're basically now testing when we create the new instance of our class our database connects class we're testing that the parameters are being sent through correctly so let's say connection equals new database Connect now in here we need to submit a supply some parameters if we don't you'll see that we'll get an error says here blah blah blah missing argument one two and three and then we've got an undefined variable in here as well because we haven't supplied the arguments these are all undefined variables and the argument error came from here which you could see missing argument so let's supply it with the arguments that requires we've got one two and three the first one I'm just going to say localhost I'm going to say rue and I'm going to say password so let's go and refresh and you can see that that's simply taken the constructor and it's echoed out the arguments that we've passed into it so we know that that works now get rid of this now what we're essentially going to be doing here is performing a check to see if another method returns a true or false value let's go ahead and create that method now so we know exactly what we're doing now the method is going to be called connect and inside this method we're going to be making use of the MySQL connect function so what we're essentially doing is we're saying if and we're saying MySQL connect and then we're supplying it with a few arguments in here which are going to be gained from inside here so it's getting quite complicated and multilevel now but hopefully by the end of this you'll understand what's going on if this MySQL Connect is true then we're going to return the true value which is going to be picked up by our constructor so we've created the skeleton outline for our connect method now let's go let's apply these parameters so it's DB host DB username and DB password so what this will do is this will allow us to feed in some parameters or arguments into this connect method and we're going to do that inside our block code here so what we're going to do is we're going to say if this and inside this connect then we sang DB host DB username DB password if this is true do something otherwise do something else so in here I'm going to say if not if this doesn't return a true value so if the Kinect doesn't return a true value it's safe to say that the connection has failed so we're going to put connection failed otherwise they're going to echo connected to and then we're just going to display the data base house that were connected to
