welcome back everyone it's Sarah and in this video I'm going to be talking about the TCA citric acid slcb cycle they're all the same things I don't know why it has so many different names probably just to confuse people but anyways this is a process that's going to take place in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells takes place in the cytoplasm cellular membranes of procaryotic cells and it is an aerobic process in which pyate is combined with some other molecules and carbon dioxide is released two molecules of ATP are formed and it's also going to form a bunch of other intermediat that are used in other biochemical Pathways so this is a very very important pathway in cells you can create fatty acids and amino acids and a bunch of other things from the intermediates you get from this cycle so before you actually enter this cycle you have to take pyrovate from glycolysis and you have to break it down into a molecule called acetel coenzyme a this is done by the enzyme pyate DC carboxy so you've got your pyate right here a three carbon molecule you're going to have your coenzyme a come in and also some NAD the oxidized form pyrovate decarbox La is going to chop off this carbon dioxide group right here it's going to attach the coenzyme a to the acetal group that's formed acetate group that's formed and in the process is going to reduce NAD to nadh so now when you actually enter the cycle you've got your acetal coenzyme a and a molecule of what is called oxyacetate These are going to combine together to form the six carbon molecule citrus or citric acid whatever you want to call it the enzyme that does this is called citrate synthes it's going to combine a molecule of water and acetal coenzyme and oxy acetate it's going to kick off that coenzyme a attach everything together and then you've got citrate and the reason this is called the TCA cycle means TR carboxilic acid cycle is because citrate has three carboxilic acid groups you got one right here one right there and then one right there the next step is a twopart process in which citrate is reconfigured moved like some of the stuff is moved around and you get this molecule called ISO citrate this is called an isomerization reaction it is done by the enzyme aconitase first off citrate has a water removed you've got the hydroxy here on car carbon 3 one of the hydrogen's from carbon 5 coming off it's going to form a double bond between carbon 3 and carbon 5 and then this water is going to be put back on except for instead of the H hydroxy group being on the third carbon the hydrogen being on the fifth carbon it's going to be the other way around so you've got the hydroxy group here on the fifth carbon the hydrogen here on the third carbon to form isocitrate the next step is also a twopart process in which isoc citr is decarbox and oxidized into alphaet glutarate this is all done by the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase so the first thing that's going to happen is isocitrate is going to be oxidized into oxy oxinate NAD is going to reduced to nadh so basically you're converting this alcohol into a ketone or a carbonal group rather right here and then the next step this carbon dioxide or this carboxilic acid group right here is going to be kicked off in the form of carbon dioxide so you're going from a six carbon molecule to a five carbon molecule H with the oxidized alcohol group right here on carbon 4 alphaet glutarate is going to be oxidized into a molecule called sual coenzyme a it's also going to kick off a another carbon dioxide in the process this is done by the enzyme alag glutarate dehydrogenase so you're going to have this carboxilic acid group right here kicked off it's going to attach the coenzyme A and in the process it's going to reduce NAD to nadh in The Next Step sual coenzyme a is going to be broken down to coenzyme a and succinate this is an exergonic reaction mean which means it's going to release energy and this is going to drive the synthesis of at ADP to ATP actually first it forms molecule called GTP and then GTP transfers its phosphorate group to ATP blah blah blah but all you need to know is that during this step ATP is formed the molecule that does this is called suil coenzyme synthetase so you got your suil coenzyme a to succinate really all it's going to do is kick off this coenzyme a and form the carboxilic acid here succinate is then going to be oxidized to make what is called ferate during the process it's going to reduce a molecule called q k it also known as quinol or coenzyme Q it's going to reduce that to Q2 succinate dehydrogenase is just going to chop DRP off two of these hydrogens right here to make a trans double bond forming the molecule fumerate the enzyme ferase is going to combine water with fumerate to form the molecule melate the hydroxy group from water is going to attach to the second carbon the hydrogen from water is going to attach to the third carbon you see you got rid of that double bond there as well and the last step is when melite is oxidized to form oxaloacetate again it's going to reduce inad to nadh by converting this alcohol or hydroxy group whatever you want to call it into a carbonal group here on the second carbon so you've got melate to form oxaloacetate and then the cycle gets to start all over again so the overall procedure of the cycle produces three molecules of nadh one molecule of fadh2 one ATP and two carbon dioxides but since you get two molecules of pyate after every Cy or every cycle of glycolysis both of these things are going to go through so you get a total of six nadh 2 fadh2s two atps and four carbon dioxides from every molecule of glucose but that is all I have for the citric acid cycle
