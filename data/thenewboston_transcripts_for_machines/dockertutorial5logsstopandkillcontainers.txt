alrighty guys welcome back to another video and in this one we're going to be covering how to view logs how to stop and how to kill containers not as violent as it sounds but that's what we have to look forward to but for now let's just go ahead and jump into how to view logs so typically these are going to be like server logs errors you're going to be looking at but we don't have any of those fancy server schmervers set up right now so we'll just make some fake logs real quick and we will do that using docker container and we're going to create a very simple busy box container and we'll just run ls is the default command so we're going to be listing out the contents of a directory again these will just simulate fake logs for right now just so we have something in the view on the screen so what we want to do is copy this container id and then we can run docker container start and ra now before i hit enter and it actually starts this container i wanna point out one thing in the last video what i did is whenever i wanted to start it i included that little dash a flag right in between these little keywords right here the start and the id now i did that because i said that dash a flag attaches the output of this container which is going to be the contents displayed from this ls command right in the terminal but now when i exclude that dash a and i run this command anyways we just get back the id in okay even though ls was the default command we didn't see that output again like i said because i excluded that dash a so this is going to simulate the logs now what if we actually want to go back and view the output well the first thing you need is the id of your container which you're trying to view the logs for and very simple docker container i want to view the logs for this container id very simple command hit enter and there you go so again like i said these logs are typically going to be error files warnings something more informational but for now to learn the logs command it's a fine example now the next concept i want to go over is how to stop and how to kill a container and the slight difference between either one now in order to understand this concept we actually need a container that runs a little bit longer than we have seen our previous containers run and that is because of this we know whenever we create container that just does something simple like list out the contents of a directory it basically starts right up it prints something on the screen and then it just exits right away well that's uh cool for those examples but whenever i'm teaching you guys how to stop and kill a container we need something longer to run in the background so it kind of emulates an actual server so instead of just listing stuff out on the screen since that's just gonna exit right away we'll do something longer and actually let me show you guys what's going on we're gonna stick a process called ping in there and we can put ping google.com and what happens here is it just starts um going to google.com server and saying are you online are you online are you online and it's just a process that's a little bit longer running so we can keep our container living for a longer amount of time so i can demonstrate these examples so in order to do that i'm just going to create a container we can use busybox as our image and for the default command instead of ls since that's just going to terminate right away we can throw something called ping google in there and then whenever we start it that container is going to be running until we learn how to stop or kill it which is the entire point of this little section right here so i'm going to create it and remember it's not actually hitting google server right now not until we start it so let's go ahead and start it right now by copying the id and do docker container start and okay so right now it's started and in the background it's hitting google just like we saw are you online are you online are you online and we can actually verify that by running docker container lsa and seeing okay yes indeed the status was created 50 seconds ago and it is up which means it's currently running right now okay so what i want to do is i want to stop this process like okay we uh hit google enough let's just go ahead and stop it by running docker container stop and put the id in now what i want you to do is listen to my keyboard whenever i hit the enter or return button so check it out all right i just hit it and seems to be taken a little bit longer than anticipated all right that's interesting it seemed it took around 10 seconds now in fact that command took exactly 10 seconds now why is that well the ping command and this is a fun fact is that it's one of the programs that actually ignores these stop commands now typically what happens is that whenever docker issues a stop command to this container that container does some cleanup now if you wrote any applications and you did any cleanup functionality it just gives a chance for the application to run any processes that are necessary before it just shuts down immediately since that may mess up a few things now i say this because since this pink man just ignores these stop commands by docker what docker does is whenever a process is ignoring these commands whenever you're trying to stop the container is it gives it 10 seconds to clean up max and if it's still not stopped after that 10 seconds docker is just gonna kill it immediately so you can think of it like stop is a command that docker issues to say please can you stop i'm asking you nicely and i'm going to give you 10 seconds all right so why do i say that well if we go ahead and do docker container start and start that same container and we can see docker container all right so now that same ping one is running status up there you go now instead of just stop what i'm gonna do this time is kill it with docker now killing a container docker docker isn't gonna be so polite in this case instead of saying will you please shut down i'm going to give you 10 seconds to kind of prepare do all that nice stuff docker kill is a little bit more cut throughout where whenever i run this it's just going to kill it right away it doesn't really care about ping shutdown process whatever it's like yo you need to go boom bullet in the head if containers had heads that is of course but anyways that's the difference between stop and kill and also why whenever you run the stop command you may see some containers hang for up to 10 seconds so again a lot of information but that's the basics of how to view logs the difference between stopping and killing a container whenever you want to bring it down so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next video
