all right guys welcome to your fourth physics tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about subtraction in scientific notation I'm going to be working with two positive exponents and then two negative exponents and then finally to wrap things up I'm going to be subtracting a negative exponent from a positive exponent now to be honest if you watch my last tutorial and you understand completely addition in sci scientific notation then this is going to be really easy for you however if you want to go through a couple more examples and see a few subtraction examples then stick around because you definitely need to understand this before we go on to the next storyals which is multiplication and division so the very first thing we need to do in this tutorial is we need to convert these scientific notation numbers to standard notation now 8.91 * 10 4 is 89,00 now 3.4 * 10 3 is 3,000 400 now 89100 minus 3,400 equals 85,000 700 now what this converted into scientific notation is is right now the decimal point is right there and we want to move it right here so let's count the spaces 1 2 3 4 so our final answer equals = 8.57 time of course 10 to 4th so that's our final answer right there so now let's go ahead and move on to an example where we see a negative subtracted from a negative so the very first thing we need to do of course is convert this to standard notation in 6.26 * 10 2 is point yeah I'm going to do that in like every tutorial I'm about to drop KCK my computer but 0 626 minus 5.9 * 10 3 in standard notation is 0.00 59 so 0.626 minus 0.59 equals 05 6 seven and of course what we need to do is we need to move this one two decimal points to the right so the final answer for this would be 5.67 * 10 to 2 so there's our final answer right there now to wrap things up let's go ahead and take a look at this right here now what we're doing is we basically have a really big number 1.45 * 10 6 minus a really small number so 2.67 * 10 to 2 so we're taking a really small amount away from a really big number so we're going to end up with a really big number we already know that so let's go ahead and walk well I guess I'll go ahead and walk you guys through this so 1.45 * 10 6 is 1,450,000 and that's it I'm make sure I got that right four zeros Yep looks pretty good 2.67 * 10 2 is 0267 so 1 and a half million minus this really small number right here gives us 1 4 4 and let me see how many five NES 73 and our decimal point is right there so to be honest I don't even know how to read this number let me throw my commas in okay 1, 14499 199 and 973 as a your you know your fraction whatever the heck you want to call it so then we got to convert this whole dang thing in scientific notation so let's see how many decimal points we have to move it 1 2 3 4 five 6 so 1.44 9999 73 times 10 to the 6 right there so there is our whoa definitely messed that up let's see if I can get this there is our answer right there so 1.45 * 10 6 minus 2.67 * 10 the 2 equals this massive number right there and that would probably be like your mom's weight in tons of course because she's huge burn and uh yeah so there you go there is subtraction again a lot like a however in the next tutor we're going to be covering multiplication and that's where things get tricky so I don't even know if you guys want to even watch that Toro because your brain might explode but if you are up for it then I'll see you there
