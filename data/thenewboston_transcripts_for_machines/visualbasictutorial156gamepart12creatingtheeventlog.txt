hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial what we're gonna do is add a an event log for our game so whenever something happens in the game we're going to go ahead and log that to a list box in our case now you could incorporate a a module into your program but a list box was working fine it works just as well and it's easier to work with so we're just gonna go ahead and use that so let's go ahead we'll shrink this down a little bit first okay so now that we got rid of some of that space there let's go ahead come over to our game jewel GUI we will add a new form so we'll just select a Windows form and instead of form to VB will just call it event log dot VB go ahead and click add okay so here is our event log now we can make it any size we want but let's go ahead and make it the same width as our form one you'll see why we're gonna do this later on so we'll go ahead come over here to size make this a little bit bigger so it's four hundred and fifty seven for the width so we'll come over here to event log and we will set the width to 457 and this looks like a good size so what we're gonna do is we'll come over here to our tool box and we will add a list box now we'll set the name to list events and instead of dragging it out and trying to make it fit inside of the form what we can do is just use the dock so for dock we will select the middle which will fill up the entire form with our list now let's come over here and let's change some stuff about it so we don't want them to be able to minimize the box we also don't want them to be able to maximize the box so all they can do is close out of it so let's go ahead and double click on this and whenever it loads let's just go ahead and type list events dot items dot add and we'll just say event logger has successfully loaded and then we'll just add some spaces after it so listen events dot items dyad or let's not add spaces let's add just a separator so that they can see where their events start ok so it's gonna load up and it's gonna add this and now what we want to do is let's just go ahead and create a sub that will allow somebody controlling an object to this class to add something to the list box you can see here that we call the event log VB again I don't know why I do that but let's just go ahead and make this public so they can be accessed outside of the class itself so public or let's make it yeah a sub add event and we will just do by Val event as string so they will pass an event to this now event is a keyword so let's just go ahead and we'll call it string event and we need to add an in sub there so whenever somebody calls at event and passes a string to it we just want to add that event to the list event so list of in stock items to add and string event so let's go ahead and we will come back into form one dot VB you can see here that I made our event log look a little bit cooler I made the background the back color a black you see right there and then I made the four color a lime just so it wouldn't look more like a a sort of a command line log so come back here and let's find for m1 dot VB okay so whenever an attack has been has happened what we want to do is add that to the log so after the hero attacks what we want to do is we want to create that event event and then add it so let's go ahead and we will create a private sub create event and then when you just need to buy Val name or string name as string so this can be used to create events for either the enemy or Popeye based on the string so that we don't have to create two different subs for this so whenever Popeye attacks we want to create an event so we'll just type create event and for the string will do hero dot name go ahead and put that in there now we just need to make it pop by dot name because we are accessing a constant that's one of the things that I always forget to do so whenever we create the event what we want to do is type let's say or we'll make it a function because we need to return an event that has happened so as a string so when that event is created what we'll do is we will return and then we will add we will do a string name and then we will add some stuff to it so out of space has used that what we want to do is get the attack that they have used so we'll do hero dot and let's come over here and we'll go into popeye so we want to access this attacks right here at the index of let's see here attack num so we need to make attack nonpublic so that we can see it so we'll just do that so whenever attack is called it's going to be different so come up here and we will say public attack num as integer okay so now that we have attacked num there let's go ahead come over here into form one so we'll type hero dot attacks at what what index do we want to use so we're accessing the array right now and we want to add at the index of let's see here what was that called attack num so at the index of attack num and let's just close that inside some brackets so so here we can see exactly the attack that they used and then we'll add four and then let's do how much damage for a blank damage so once again we will close that in some brackets and now what we need to do is we need to get the damage so in order to do that what we need to do is create an array inside of our popeye class
