hey welcome back everyone this is Ian bringing you another video in this AI series with the New Boston in today's video I'm going to show you how to use open AI image generation with Dolly 2 and Dolly 3 it's really simple only a couple lines of code really powerful I'm going to show you the basics but I'm also going to tell you about some other things that it can do in case you want to take the extra time to go through the documentation and explore some of those things we're working from the 09 image generation folder inside of the open AI directory inside of our AI playground repository if you don't have it already it's included in the description of this video as a link we'll go ahead and minimize that over there and focus on the code all right so at the very top simple we just bring in open AI from open aai and then we create a new client by default it's going to look for the open aore aior key environment variable which will have set equal to our openai API key as an environment variable in our system once you have that set up then you're ready to go making these requests simple as that the first line here with the actual code to make the API call is going to be on line four essentially we're going to have a response variable setting it equal to the client then do images. generate this takes a set of arguments let's walk through those the first one is the model the options here are either doll E3 or doll E2 so doll E2 is going to have some slight differences doy 3 is obviously more powerful but there are some limitations we'll talk about that when we get to the bottom here with the in argument the next thing is the prompts this is really important because we're going to pass in a text prompt and then we're going to get an image generated from that there are other options you can actually pass in images if you want to get variations of those images or if you want to edit those images that's not something we're going to cover in this video but it is a possibility so be sure and check out the documentation for image generation if you're interested in some of those additional features so with the prompt we're going to include whatever text describing the image that we once generated then we're going to set the size there's a few different sizes the one we're going to go with is a square so just 1,24 pixels by 1024 pixels there's a couple more options if you want some different ratios for your size of the image you can check those out in the documentation we'll have that Linked In the description below the quality here is standard the other one is H D standard is going to generate more quickly still going to be really great looking you'll see that here in a second but if you want something a little more higher definition then you can use HD instead of standard now the last argument here in is very important it's set to one with Dolly 3 and that's the only thing it can be set to however if you use Dolly 2 you can set it all the way up to 10 and what that means is you can send 10 image requests simultaneously now with Dolly 3 what you can do is you can send these requests in parallels if you want to get 10 images you just send 10 different requests but if you want to send one request that gets you 10 images you have to switch back to the dolly 2 model and you simply do that by changing the model name to Dolly 2 instead of Dolly 3 because we're using Dolly 3 here we're going to stick with the N equals 1 argument and then down here we get from the response that we're getting back from that request we're going to derive the image URL so image URL the variable is set equal to response. data now data is a list and with this specific request because we have n equals 1 it's only going to have one object inside of there we're going to pull that object out with the zeroth index and then we're going to access its URL with the URL if you have Dolly 2 and you're doing anything more than n equals 1 if you're doing Nal 2 through 10 then you would do data bracket 1 to get the second image data bracket 2 to get the third image all the way up to data bracket 9 to get the 10th image and so you can see here I have an example that I'll uncomment here in a minute and show you how we can get multiple images with Dolly 2 but first let's send this request with Dolly 3 and just show you what it gives us back once we get it back we derive the image URL from the response then we're going to actually print that out once we print it we're going to see it in our console and we can click on it and that'll open up our browser and let us see the image the URL that it gives us for the image is only temporary it's available for an hour so make sure that you download that image and if you want to use it on your webite it make sure you host it somewhere else okay so let's head over to our terminal here run this program and wait for it to print out the URL all right so here's our picture just know that the generation of the images takes a little bit longer than what we're used to with our text generation and you can imagine why with how much work is being done behind the scenes so we get this image URL back from here I can just control click or if you're on a Mac you can command click and it'll take you directly out to your browser and sure enough here we are with our image of a farmhouse with some mountains in the background we got a tree we got a creek really beautiful if we ran this a number of times we would get a bunch of different variations of this again this only lasts for an hour this particular URL so you want to make sure you right click and save the image and then you can upload it to some other server I'm going to get out of here and head back over here and what I want to show you is how we can use Dolly 2 to send multiple requests we're going to go up to the model we're going to change it to Dolly 2 and for the N equals 1 we're just going to change it to two so then we're going to scroll down a little bit and uncomment these lines here so we have image URL 2 is going to be accessed through the response. DAT again data is a list so we want the oneth value from that list which is an object so we use one here for the index and then we pull the URL out of that object then we can print an empty space here after the first image URL and then print our second image URL we're going to open up our terminal and run the python main.py and we'll be right back whenever it prints out our image URLs okay here we are with our two image URLs so we can click the first one open go back click the second one open you can see we have multiple tabs here so this one gave us a painting style and if we close that we can see this other one again the style of a painting and I think I still have the original open so this is a little more realistic Dolly 3 is the one that gave us the more detailed and realistic image and Dolly 2 is the one that gave us the painting style images The Prompt is going to be the same the size is going to be the same the quality is going to be the same but the in value when you're using Dolly 2 can be anything between 1 and 10 if you switch it back to Dolly 3 just make sure that you switch it back to n equals 1 if you don't then it's going to throw an error and then of course we're not going to get back multiple images here so we'd want to com it back out any code that we're not using and that's it thanks lot for watching this video can't wait to see you all on the next one and until next time peace
