hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video for the New Boston in this video we're going to be looking at the jQuery ID selector and selecting elements by their ID so let's go ahead and first of all create an element on our page I've already got selectors j/s attached to my page or included in my page and we're going to be writing some code in here to return a value from from a particular element by its ID so let's go ahead and create for example an input field and this is going to be type of text and we're going to give this an ID of name okay so now that we have this we want to reference this by name we've given it the ID of name therefore we can uniquely reference this as an ID so inside selectors we're going to want to well let's just first of all put in here a value of hello so when we refresh our page you can see that we've just got hello inside of a text area field okay so now inside selectors or j/s if we want to reference or refer to this field we can refer to it by its unique name we could go and refer to it by an input field however because we've specified an ID we can use a hash and then the name of the particular element to actually grab a value from it so inside selectors we just want to create a variable and this is going to be called name now we're going to use the selector here so this is a selector inside here we're going to select name but we don't want to just put name inside here we want to use a hash because we've used an ID so this is saying grab the element with the ID of name and then we want to return the value inside of that so Val just is going to return this value inside of here so that's not really important for now but we're just taking a look at concentrating on how we've selected this ID okay so now we want to go ahead and alert that out so we want alert name remember now now contains the value of the name field so when we refresh this we should be greeted by hello because essentially what's happened is we've taken this value from this field here by its ID and then we've just had alerted this out to the user so now that we've selected by an ID in a field what else can we do well almost any element in HTML can be have an ID attached for example paragraphing we could give an ID to a paragraph so text for example and some text we could then go to selectors j/s and just simply change this around so this could be text this could be text and then we'll change this variable as well accordingly so now we've got the tÃªte the value of text let's go ahead and refresh the page oh no sorry we also need to change this here we need to grab the text from this so this essentially takes text from inside the paragraph and we're referencing the paragraph as hash text because we've called it text just here let's go ahead and refresh you can see that we've got some text in an alert field so with regards to the ID selector you can give an ID to almost every element in HTML you can give an ID to images fields paragraph spans divs absolutely anything so if you're writing code inside this file inside any file in an external javascript file you can use this to reference each element so this is shown more commonly in an example such as an input button so let's go ahead and create a button again or for the first time so we created a text field before and I'm going to give this a value of click me I'm also going to give this an ID of click underscore me so now this is our reference point here and inside selectors we can actually use this to a to carry out a specific action when this particular button named click me has been clicked let's go to our browser and refresh just so we can see we've got the button here and when we click it for example we want to create an alert box for the user so we reference it by click me so inside of our code we can say hash click me dot click we're creating an event handler here so handling the event when it click me is has been clicked don't worry if you're not too sure about this just for now we then go ahead and create a function here with the parentheses the curly parentheses as well bring this down and then after here we can just write alert and hello so we've referenced this click Me button using a hash and then the click me it should be click underscore me text and then when we click we run this line here so we've referenced this button and we've added an event to it you'll notice that this automatically I eradicate the need for inline JavaScript as well we've created everything externally by attaching this event to this button here by referencing it let's go ahead and click that button and we get the hello dialogue box appear on our screen so that's essentially how we would reference we would use our jQuery selector to select an field or an element sorry by its ID
