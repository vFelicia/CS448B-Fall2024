hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to continue working on our paint program now if this is it this isn't familiar to you you may want to move back to the beginning of these tutorials and once again this program is from the book beginning Microsoft Visual Basic 2008 by fear on Willis and Brian Newsome post by rocks it's a great book but there are better books out there it's still good for a beginning so beginners to learn and it takes you through making a whole bunch of programs so let's go ahead and continue what we were doing so here is our paint canvas class we've got our enumerations the graphic sizes and the graphics tools so we'll go ahead and put those two together now let's go ahead and create some public variables so public variables and let's make an ArrayList so public graphics items as new ArrayList and we're going to create a graphics tool so public graphic tool as graphics tools and we're going to set that equal to graphics tools dot circle pin because that is our only option and now will cute we will create the graphic sighs so public graphics size as graphic sizes and then we're going to set it equal to graphic sizes dot medium so we'll just make the brush mediumsized right now and now we're going to need one more variable so public graphics color as colored and we'll set it equal to color dot black let's go ahead and add an S right there so these are all matched up so here we have our graphics item ArrayList and this is going to hold a whole bunch of graphics items object now it can also hold graphics circle objects because the graphic circles inherit from the graphics items they are treated as a graphics items object even though that an ArrayList can hold any data type we're gonna be filling it with types even graphics items or graphics circles and then we have our graphics tool which is the circle pin which is what we're going to be drawing on the paint canvas with and say circle pin we've got our graphic size which is set to medium which will be 10 and just kind of a little bit of spoiler 10 is gonna be the side of the square so it's gonna be a 10 by 10 square it's going to create a circle out of that so it's gonna have a circle with a diameter of 10 pixels and then we have our color our graphics color which is going to be equal to black that's pretty selfexplanatory okay so now we need to make some private methods so we'll just call this one private and we'll make it a sub because it doesn't return anything and it will call it do Mouse paint and what we're gonna need for a do Mouse paint is a some arguments so we're just gonna need 1 arguments and we're gonna by Val E as Mouse event args so E is gonna be the arguments and what its gonna let us do is it's gonna let us get the x position and the y position of where the mouse is on the screen so what we've used Mouse event arts before in the program that animated asquared so under doodoo mouse paint what we're gonna do is create a new object so we'll call it object graphics item as graphics item so now we have a graphics items item object you can see that's got a little green line under it because we haven't used it yet so now we're gonna select which tool we are using so we'll use a select case here but because we are only using one there's only one possible thing for this we're gonna only need one select case here now the reason we're doing select case is in case we want to add more to our program later on we can just add some items to our select case and add some items to our numeration and our programs gonna work on the same way it did but we're gonna have some more options now this is a good thing to do when you're making programs is to make it so that you can expand your program and so it's easier to add more stuff in the future so we'll just add case graphics tool or graphics tools dot circle pin so if circle pin is selected what do we want to do we want to create a new object of graphics circle so we'll just declare it so object graphics circle and we're gonna make a new graphics circle object so you can see we have it right here which is what we created and it doesn't take any arguments so now that we've created our object of graphics circle which is going to draw a circle on the screen what we want to do is we want to set the point for that so object graphics circle dot set point it's gonna take our X position our y position our size color and is filled so to get our x position what we want to do is type e dot X so for our mouse event args and a dot X is going to hold the x position position of the mouse and then we're gonna do a dot Y for the y coordinates and if we come over here to graphic circle or graphics item I mean we have set points it's gonna take the eggs and to subtract graphics size divided by 2 from it which basically just sets wherever your mouse in the middle of your mouse is to the center of the circle instead of the topleft corner so come back over here to paint canvas dot B B and then we're gonna need to fill in the rest of the arguments so for the third argument we're just gonna do graphics size so and then we're gonna need graphic color so let's find the name up here this gets a little confusing graphics color and then we're going to need the graphics is filled so for this we're just gonna use true because we do want to fill our circle now you can play with this and set that equal to false if you want and see what happens later on so now what we need to do is we need to store this item so that we can add it to our ArrayList so object graphics item equals object graphics circle now we have objects graphics items which is a type graphics items so this variable right here is of type graphics item but because object graphics circle which is a graphic circle inherits from graphics items we can use polymorphism to set this equal to a subclass of itself so we're gonna add more to this sub when we get back it's just I'm running out of time in this tutorial so if you have any questions leave them in the comments and if not go ahead and move forward
