hey welcome back everyone this is Ian bringing you another AI video with the New Boston so if you have been following along with our previous videos and you've tried to run your code and you've experienced an error like the one that we're looking at here where it says attribute error module open AI has no attribute chat completion then this video is going to show you how to fix that so the issue the reason why we're getting this airor is because previously we were using an older version of the open AI Library these things are changing very quickly it's getting upgraded really fast and so now the newer version has some breaking changes so with those breaking changes you wouldn't be able to run some of these syntax from our previous videos the solution in the short term would just be to use the version that we used whenever we recorded the video and that would be like 0.28 or something like that however you want to use the latest and greatest so I'm going to show you how to migrate your code to use the newer version of the library and its syntax all right so basically the first thing want to do is upgrade now you probably already upgraded if you're you know whether or not you know it you may have installed the newest version but if you are using an older version and you see that inside of your virtual environment that you have like 0.28 or something like that or 0.279 then what you can do is an easy pip uninstall open AI make sure that your virtual environment is activated you want to uninstall this from your local virtual environment for this project so we'll go ahead and that command and when it's done running it's going to actually prompt us here whether or not we want to do it at least it does this on windows so I say y for yes and it finishes all right so you can see that I had the latest version at least at the time of this recording 1.1.2 uh yours may be a different version now let's get the latest version so once you've uninstalled it all you have to do is PIP install open Ai and this will give you the current version so maybe 1.1.2 or who knows they may have updated it again by the time we get this video released all right so with this version 1.1.2 there are some changes to the syntax so if you were to run your code you would get the error that we showed at the uh beginning of the video all right so I'm going to go back to the very first tutorial 01 basic main.py we import OS we import openai so what we're going to do now is we actually don't have to import the OS uh you can if you want to put something in other than open AI API key but that's what it's going to look for by default so as long as you export your environment variable for your API key with this name then you won't need to use OS here so with that said what we can do is we can say something like from open AI import and then I think it's open AI like this with a capital O and then a capital Ai and then what we do here on the next line is we say something like client is equal to and then we can say open AI open close parenthesis and so this will create a new open AI client for us from this open AI class and then we can use this client for all of our requests however the syntax has changed slightly so let's go down and modify that as well so if we go down here we can see where we have open Ai and we no longer have that variable so I'm getting some red underscores here uh letting me know hey you know this is not a valid variable so I'm going to change it to client so that'll fix that problem and now we no longer have chat completion Capital C and chat Capital C and completion what we have is lowercase chat Dot and then I think it's completions plural so let me get rid of the old great so it's client. chat. completions all lowercase is going to replace the open ai. Capital C chat Capital C completion. create so what we end up with is client. chat. completion. create and everything else stays the same okay so now when we run this we should be able to print the response I'm not going to print this part of the response I'm really most interested in the content down here just so that we know that this is working so let's go ahead and run this python main.py of course your virtual environment is activated you're inside of the open AI examples in fact I'm inside the wrong folder so let me go ahead and fix that so I'm going to CD into 01 basic and then I'm going to run main. Pi here so this will take a second and we should get some text back here in a moment the NHL team that plays in Pittsburgh is the Pittsburgh Penguins so that's it for upgrading you're just going to uninstall open AI with your virtual environment activated you're going to reinstall it using pip and then you're going to update that syntax like we just did that's it for this video thanks for tuning in and we'll catch you in the next one peace
