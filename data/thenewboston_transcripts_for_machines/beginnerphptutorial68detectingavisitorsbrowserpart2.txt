hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and we're back with a second part of this tutorial for New Boston in detecting the users browser now in the last part if you haven't watched it already go back and watch otherwise you probably won't understand what's going on in the last part of the tutorial we use the get browser function and we updated a specific file in a in our PHP dot ini file we we reference the file it's going to allow us to use this properly properly so we've used print R to print out every element of this or every key in this array in each value now if we look through this we can see that we might not be able to make sense out of much of the information I'm using Google Chrome at the moment and things like Mozilla are appearing here so you might be wondering why that is well if you look through if you look through the each key you can see that we've got this key here called browser and that is equal to the value of Chrome so then we've got platform when Wester after that blah blah blah so chrome seems to be the only correct and sort of direct piece of information that we've got we've just got Chrome there we've got nothing else so therefore this is a really really great key where we can extract the value and use this information to detect the user's browser so by the end of this tutorial I'm going to created a program that's going to echo out to the user what their browser is or we could probably modify it and say you need to use Google Chrome for example if they're not using a browser which is Chrome ok so we've got this information here so we know that the key is browser this is obviously an associative array so what we can do is we can come in here and we can echo out browser remember for arrays we use our square brackets and we can just echo out the key browser so now let's preview this in in Chrome and see what happens you can see it's just extracted that information and this is all the information that we're going to need let's go and test this in other browsers so I'm going to test it in Firefox and I'm going to test it in Internet Explorer so we I'm going to copy the URL and come into Firefox first and I'm just going to paste that in there okay so now we've got the value firefox so it's successfully detected this browser as firefox let's go ahead and open internet explorer and do the same and you can see that it's IE which is obviously short for internet explorer okay so let's take these away and bro mac chrome right so what we want to do now is we've grabbed this information now what we want to do is we want to detect the user's browser in terms of telling them that if they're not using chrome they should do so I'm going to put this browser equal to browser browser so this might look a bit confusing but what I'm in fact doing is creating it is replacing this variable but taking the value of this from this we're not going to need any more information from this so what we're doing is we're restoring the information in here so we can still come down an aircraft browser will do exactly the same thing there we go so back to our text editor and we're going to create an if statement now I'm going to say if browser doesn't equal chrome then do something now the problem with this is is we're using a capital C usually but what we want to do is we want to ensure that we put everything to lowercase so I'm going to say STR to lower so we've converted Chrome to lowercase let's just kill the page there and we can echo browser because you have now converted this from chrome to Chrome lowercase so now we can perform an appropriate check on this and so it's if browser doesn't equal chrome echo you're not using google chrome please do so let's just escape this character so I'm using at an inverted common air or rather a yes single quotation mark let's go back now and refresh now nothing's happened why is this because we're using Chrome what happens now if we go back into Firefox and refresh we're going to get this message you're not using Google Chrome please do and what about Internet Explorer let's go back and refresh and see what happens you're not using Google Chrome please do so you can see how this is a really simple but effective way to detect the user's browser first of all and I'm going to leave it up to you guys to play around with this and do whatever you want with it basically you can either tell the user what browser they're using or you could create maybe a switch statement to do this it'd be a lot easier you could do exactly what I've done and said you're not using Google Chrome please do there's a variety of uses you can get out of detecting the user's browser this is just one but now that you know how to do it you can experiment them for yourself
