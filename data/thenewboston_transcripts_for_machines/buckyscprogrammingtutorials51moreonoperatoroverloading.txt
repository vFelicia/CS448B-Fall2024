plus another sali objects number value so basically we're going to have to Sally objects already we're going to have a Sally object that say has a number of 20 and another Sally object that has a number of 30 and whenever we create the brand new number it's going to have a value of 50 so that's where we're going to be returning the brandnew Sally object so in order to do that all you do is this return brandnew just like that and what this is going to is return the brandnew Sally object so basically we're going to be calling this on a Sally object that already exists and what it's going to do is this line is going to create a brand new Sally object right here we give a number value to the brand new Sally object and right here we're just returning that brand new Sally object simple enough so let's go ahead and well I guess now we can hop over to main and I can actually you know show you guys what's going on so the first thing we need is two already existing Sally objects with the number property that we can add together so Sally well we call this object a and we'll give it a value of like 34 now we need another one Sally B and we'll give this value 21 now we need a blank one because whenever we call this value remember it doesn't have a number property yet so that's what we're going to be giving it so let's go ahead and create a blank Sally object with a C and now all we need to do is this you might be thinking are a whenever I wanted to before like give a number property to the C value I would do something like C equals a dot add and then you would add B to that and I mean what that would do is whenever you wanted to add a number property to see it would take a and add B get some integer and add it to the property of C right there well with this overloaded operator you don't have to do that anymore here's we need to do C equals a plus B in that way whenever we use the plus sign C++ already knows that we have a special meaning for it right here so whenever it sees the plus sign call it on one of these objects it's going to know to run this function right here so let's go ahead and run this in now that we use that plus sign the C object has a number operty so let's go ahead and see out um c dot num and then let's go ahead and end that line and let me go ahead and run this real quick and I'll show you guys that it says 55 so what it did is basically this it took this number value 34 added this number value 21 it gave us 55 and through the use of our overloaded operator that's where we got the Sally num so let me talk you guys through one last time what's going on maybe this will clear things up for you in our very first line of code we created a Sally object and then um had a value of 34 so we know whenever we created a Sally object and we passed in an integer then assign that integer to the property of num so we have a Sally object in a Sally object is num 34b Sally object is num 21 and then we created a see Sally object and remember whenever we created a Sally object that we didn't pass in a parameter it just created a blank Sally object right here so we said all right with our blank Sally object we want to use a plus B so set all right I know this plus since you're trying to do something weird I know that you're trying to use this overloaded operator so it said RAC goes a plus B that means you're trying to use the Sallee object with this function right now so what it did is it took the current object which was a right there and this B was treated as the parameter another Sallee object so what it did it was it took the current object's number which was 34 it added another Sallee objects number which was 21 and it returned a brand new sally object with 55 is as its number so as its returned value we said equal to C so C now equals a brand new sally object with 55 as its number so that way whenever we printed out our brand new sally object with its new number that's why you printed out 55 on the screen right there so again like I said operator overloading is a little weird because it basically takes your plus sign and you know you don't have to use a function name anymore so instead of this it pretty much changes that all into a plus sign so I know it's kind of a weird syntax at first and to be honest I don't use it a whole lot in my programming so if that gives you confidence that you're probably not going to be seeing this a whole lot then you know you can relax but I just want to give you guys the idea of what operator operator overloading is because you know whenever you're at a job and people are talking about it you don't get lost or whatever so that's what it is but you won't be seeing it all too much in my programs so now that you guys understand the concept of it thank you guys for watching don't forget subscribing you're probably going to have to rewatch this video a couple times and do some examples of your own and if you have any questions don't forget to check out my form the New Boston comm slash for them and hopefully I can answer for you so anyways one last time thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
