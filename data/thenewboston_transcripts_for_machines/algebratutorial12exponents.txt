okay so today we're going to talk about exponents and we've already talked about them a little bit when we talked about order of operations but today we're going to learn how to write multiplication as exponents and we're going to learn some basic exponent rules it's going to help you solve some equations so you remember an exponent is written like x squared or Y cubed so this number right here tells us how many times X is going to multiply by itself so 4x squared when you if you remember talking about squares in geometry it's x times X or Y cubed is y times y times y so we're going to write this expression as an exponent there's only 14 so we can write it for to the one which you know if it's just to the 1 power you don't have to write it because it's assumed that anything that doesn't have an exponent is just to the 1 power so we have 1 2 3 4 4 X's multiplied so we have X to the fourth and we have 1 2 3 y's so we have Y to the third so if it's written like this and then asked for the cube of c a well here's some things you'll have to just kind of memorize cube means to the third power square which you already know means to the second power and then anything after three you're just going to say to the fourth power to the fifth power or they're just going to write it out like this and have you write it so the cube of C minus a is C minus a remember because this is we want this first remember our order of operations and then we just put a cube on the outside of the parentheses so now we're going to talk about are some basic exponent rules so the only way you can combine exponents are if they have the same base and the base is this number right here or if it's a letter it has to be the same letter or if it's like 4 squared times 4 squared you can combine those so now when we have something with an exponent times the same base with an exponent we're going to add our powers so for this we take two plus two is four and this becomes a to the fourth because if you look this is a times a and then this is times a times a so we have 4 a's so a to the fourth when we're adding exponents with the same base this becomes 2 a squared because this is a times a plus a times a so this is a squared this is a squared since we have two of them we can combine them like that you cannot and I repeat cannot combine exponents over addition by multiplying them and for this last one we have a number with an exponent raised to another exponent so what you're going to do is you're going to multiply your powers so this becomes a to the sixth this is the only time you actually multiply your powers because up here it looks like you multiply them but you added them you add up here and when it's a power to another power you multiply so here is this little note you have to remember you cannot distribute an exponent so this and we're not going to talk that much into it because this deals with um some more advanced concepts I just want you to know that you cannot say that this is equal to this because this is not true and we'll figure out why a little bit later on but you just if they give you an expression like this and they don't give you numbers to plug in there's nothing you can do this is the only way you can write it so now we're going to do some work with exponents so when it says evaluate it means plug in these numbers and find out what it equals so we're going to plug in 2 for X so we have 2 squared times 3 cubed times 4 so 2 times two is four so sig 1 for 3 times 3 is 9 times 3 is 27 times 4 i'm going to put that in the calculator because that's going to be a kind of big number 4 x 4 x 27 432 exponents get really big really fast so this time each one we're going to go on to number three 2q squared three squared 4 squared so 2 squared is 4 times 3 squared which is nine times 4 squared which is 16 and again I'm going to pull out my calculator 576 when doing problems with exponents it's really beneficial to use a calculator just because the numbers get so big I mean you can do them by hand it's just easier so 4 cubed times 3 4 times 4 is 16 times 4 is 64 64 x 3 is equal to 192 and then we have three squared times two now this one isn't going to be that big three squared is 9 times 2 is 18 so that's all the work we're going to do with exponents today but make sure you come back and we're going to learn about polynomial expressions
