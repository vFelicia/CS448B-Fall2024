hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a PHP video tutorial for the new Boston now in this user login and registration system we've already determined how to use a log as a logger user in so what we've done is we've credit index dot PHP page with our if statement and we've used a login function which is located in core we've also create our login form and we've been able to process this inside this and then that's used as an include so we're keeping that index dot PHP page as clean as possible now let's go over to our browser and see that we're logged in at the moment and there's no way we can actually get out of this at the moment what we need to do is create a page that's going to kill all our session variables that we've used you can kill specific ones but probably better just use session destroy' which we have already covered in previous tutorials so if you're not comfortable with this then go back and have a look at that so I'm going to create a new page and this is going to be called logout dot PHP okay so we're going to include a link in our login form in fact know in index dot PHP we're going to say you're logged in and then we're going to give the user the option to logout so we're going to create a link and it's going to say logout and this is to logout dot PHP so let's just go to our browser and refresh you can see we've got our logout bus a link come up if we click that we go to logout dot PHP now we need to create some code inside logout dot PHP to actually log our user out the first thing I'm going to do is think about if the user logs out on a specific page remember we're including these so we could actually for example we could show our login form at the in a header file in our page we could have a template system with a header which never changes so we could be on one or many page we could be one of many pages when we click logout so in core I want a variable called referrer with HTTP referer and this is using again we define server environmental variables and it's just HTTP underscore four and what this is going to do is this is going to tell us the page that we've come from so let's let's try this out first of all in in log out so therefore we need to require Cordillera quarter inc dot PHP now there's a reason we need to require this anyway remember encoding dot PHP we've got session start to logout to kill a session or destroy a session we need to start the session use beforehand so required up require Corder Inc dot PHP and we're going to echo out this HTTP referer variable to see if it works so HTTP referer okay so we're coming from index dot PHP when we click this button so hopefully when we land on login logout dot PHP it's going to tell us where we came from so if we click logout we've now got the full URL of where we came from which is localhost forward slash series for such users from for such index dot PHP so after we've processed the logout we can refer ourselves back to this page using that and a combination of that and the header header function so let's go ahead and program in everything in logout dot PHP the first thing we need to do or we've already done is include this file require this file and we've started our session in here so now all we need to do is say session underscore destroy so this is going to kill all sessions that we've already created we've only got one session and that goes by the name of user ID and we've set this here so we'll just we'll just use the session destroy' let's go to logout dot PHP new session destroy that we'll just make sure everything we've already set in the session is destroyed so now what we need to do is we need to refer the user back to the page that they came from so we're going to be using the header function here and just to point out this point we already we're already a processing data hit we're giving output before this point so that's why we've used OB start there's a tutorial on that as well if you haven't already understood why we've put that in so we need header and we're going to say location code on space and then we're going to append on the HTTP referer that we echoed out earlier to demonstrate so HTTP referer and we're good to go now so if we come into our index dot PHP page remember our index dot PHP page if we're not logged in so presumably when we click the logout dot PHP sessions are going to be destroyed we're going to be referred back to this page we're not going to be logged in so now we're going to include the login form and display the login form to the user so let's have a look at that let's click logout and see what happens ok so we've been referred back to index dot PHP very quickly see how quickly it processes ready for us to log in again if we want to so let me just try it again click login you're logged in so we can click logout again and it refers us back here so now we've successfully created our logout button we can log ourselves out while we're testing this and we can eventually log a user out if they were to use this system
