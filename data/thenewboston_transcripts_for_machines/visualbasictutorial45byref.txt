hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at by riff now if you remember from the previous tutorial we took a look at by Val which is passing a variable to a sub or a function so that it can use that value inside of the sub or function but that value is not changed outside of the sub so with bar F what you can do is reference a variable that is outside of you outside of your sub or function and change it so that it will change anywhere else in your program from where you call the sub or function now this may be this may be a little confusing to you so let's go ahead and create a demo application we'll go ahead and select new project we will call it by ref select windows forms application and click OK so we'll wait for that to load and now let's go ahead and come over here to our toolbox we'll add a label and we will set the label to no value entered and then we'll set the name of the label to label variable ok so so let's go ahead and double click on form 1 to open up our code and we'll zoom in here ok so now what we're going to do is we are going to create a variable inside of our form one load sub sodimm num1 as integer and we will set it equal to zero now let's go ahead and show that in the message box message box dot show num 1.2 string now I haven't used to string in a while but it's always good to use that whenever you're putting numbers on labels or message boxes or anywhere that uses a string as the argument now what we're going to do is we are going to make a sub that will increment number so we'll start off by using the keyword private sub and then we'll call this increment variable now inside of the arguments for increment variable we're going to use by ref and then we'll just do num1 as integer so what this is going to do is it's going to let us reference a variable now we don't have to use the value we don't have to use the name num1 it can be anything so we can just do X and whatever we put in the argument is going to be referenced and inside of this sub it's going to be called whatever variable is right here which is X so we can go ahead and do X plus equals 5 or not 1 5 now if we come up here and we just call increment variable and pass num1 to that what it's going to do is it's going to add 5 to this num1 right here because we're referencing it and not sending a copy of it to this sub so we can do message box dot show num 1 dot 2 string let's go ahead and change our label accordingly so we'll do label variable dot text equals num 1 dot 2 string and we'll go ahead and do that one more time after this dot text equals num 1 dot 2 string okay so let's go ahead and run our program and see what happens so you can see that we get the value 0 right here and then if we click OK we're going to get the value 5 because we used increment variable and it referenced num1 right here and if we go ahead and click OK you can see that will load the form and it sets the label to 5 now all of this was done before the form unloaded so you don't actually see it set the value of 0 to the to the label so thanks for watching guys go ahead and make a couple subs or functions or whatever you want that use by ref so that you can reference other variables that are inside of other subs you can also combine by ref and by Val in arguments so you could have by RF XS integer and then by Val Y as integer and you can mix and match these any way you want so go ahead practice some of that and once you you're familiar with that and you're not going to forget it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
