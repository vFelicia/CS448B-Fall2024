so like I said today we're going to be going over special products formed by multiplying two special kinds of binomials so I have an example right here and we're going to um foil this out and then we're going to draw some conclusions about it so you're going to first Outside Inside last 2 * 2x * 2x 4x^ 2 so that was first now we're going to go outside 2x * 5 10 X inside 5 * 2x positive 10 x and 5 * 5 25 so if we combine these like terms they're going to go away because a 1 plus positive 10 is G going to give us zero so 4x^2 25 so that's what this note down here is whenever you have two binomials multiplied that come in the form a + b * a minus B these middle two terms are going to cancel out and all you're going to be left with is a^2 b ^ 2 because you're going to get from doing the outsides you're going to get a doing the insides you're going to get positive ab and those are always going to cancel to zero but remember you can only use this shortcut when you have a + b * a minus B if these two terms have the same sign the middle terms aren't going to cancel out so now that we know that let's do some examples so since I have x + 3 * x 3 I know that the middle terms are going to cancel out so I can just Square the first term and square the second term 3 * 3 is 9 same thing with this one I have 3x 7 y 3x + 7 y it doesn't matter that I have two different variables because no matter what these two middle terms are still going to cancel so when I square 3x^ 2ar and 7 y^ 2 remember you have to square the three and the X so this becomes 9 x^2 minus 49 y^ 2 you can't just Square the Y you have to square both terms so that's all um our lesson today is g to deal with make sure you come back and we're going to talk about squaring binomials and then after that we're going to go into solving equations using these polom so make sure you come back and check that out
