so I've logged into my email and I'm using my email client here which is squirrel mail now what I can do is I can save changes on this page um and our file has been saved successfully now what we can do is we can come in here and just refresh and we've got an unexpected T variable on line four so let's go check this eror out before we proceed so let's go down to line four that's the reason is because I have um on line three I didn't incorporate a semicolon at the end of my line so let's save changes again and let's refresh Okay so we've got a uh confirmation message email has been sent to Alex PHP academy.org let's go over to my email client and click back onto my inbox okay so you can see that in bold a new email has popped up and this is from someone PHP academy.org now the subjects is this is a test email which does correspond to what we specified um in our variable here this is a test email so if we click on it and go in further we can see that it says this is a test email um NN hope you got it okay so my mistake this has not correctly processed and the reason being I can already tell you the reason being is because we haven't specified this in double quotation marks and it hasn't processed these because we're not using double quotation marks so what we could do is we could append on double quotation marks and then back to normal again uh there there okay um or you can just enclose this completely in quotation marks it's entirely up to you okay so let's save the changes again and resend the email let's refresh okay email has been sent again we get the same confirmation message let's go back to our inbox okay we've got that again let's click on it and you can see that now we've Incorporated the new line break okay so what happens if we want to specify a name by um this as you can see that things like Twitter and people per hour have already sent um their email address through with a name attached so um we want to change this to be more user friendly we oh no we don't need to do that that was my test notes from earlier we need to come into this page and we simply need to say PHP Academy there and um in fact no we don't we need to say from PHP Academy and then in uh a less than and then a greater than sign we put the email address so let's save the changes there let's go back and refresh our page so we resend the email back to squirrel M email client and you can now see oh we need to log in again okay so I've logged back in and you can see that the email is from PHP Academy this time with the same subject and then the um the uh content of the email now you probably noticed that we've got a bit of extra white space just before our message and this is because when we no not don't need that again um when we are are editing this it's automatically going to take into account I think um I'm not too sure this is um correct of me but we're automatically going to take into account the space before this so if we put this on a new line and we save I think what that will do is it will get rid of that space before let's just double check I'm not entirely sure it might just be this email client okay yeah it is so if you find things like um if you find things like um too many spaces down or or anything like that this body string is going to be taken literally um so I could say uh this is a test email um and then hope you got it um if I was to go down I am actually creating myself a new space but it's always better to use these uh back sln um line braks okay so that is the very basics of sending an email with PHP like I said if you're having trouble using your local server like if you have an xamp installation then try to upload a PHP file or create a PHP file as I have on a text editor on an actual paid um hosting service and a server that has um the uh send mail uh activated then you'll be able to use the mail function within PHP
