hi this is Alex from PHP academy' org and this is a PHP video tutorial for the new Boston now in this video I'm simply going to talk to you about what PHP is and why you should use it and a little bit of information about what websites do use it so the first thing about PHP is what it stands for PHP stands for hypertext preprocessor in fact the first P is P so it's PHP hypertext preprocessor that's what it stands for so we've gotten a recursive acronym because we have an acronym inside and inside another acronym because of rigidly PHP stood for personal homepage so it's now been changed to stand for PHP hypertext preprocessor with the PHP inside of that still it's standing for personal home page so what is PHP and why should we use it well PHP is a serverside scripting language now when you open up a PHP file and you type in the code it's not available to view by the user of the website they cannot rightclick and see your code so it's not like HTML with HTML being a markup language it's interpreted by the browser now PHP and the code inside of it is interpreted by the web server and compiled serverside and then the output of the of the application if you like is displayed in HTML if we choose to do so so it's basically used to create dynamic content on websites so we're not we're essentially creating a program within a website so we'll bring it being able to do a variety of different things now let's head over to the PHP official website which is PHP net so if you need any more information I'm just giving you a bright brief in overview here go over to PHP net and you can read some information about PHP as well as news etc cetera etc so we've got a little description about here about what is PHP and we've got an introduction introductory tutorial now the great thing about PHP is while you're developing it has a really extensive documentation to it and this is called the manual so we've got a link here to the manual and basically we've got an online manual for lots of different languages and you can also download the doc download the documentation as well and what the manual will do is we can search in here for say function list for example we might search for F open in the functions list and we see now it returns a some information about our function so we can now go down and look at the different parameters of the arguments it takes and we can also look at some examples down here so it's a really really extensive list you can see of usersubmitted examples as well so you can get a really great feel of different functions and not just functions but everything inside PHP from this PHP manual so what kind of websites use PHP and why do they use it well Facebook for example use PHP what we're doing is with with Facebook is a social networking website that's storing lots of data in a database so what we can do with PHP is we combine PHP with a database system and we typically do this with MySQL and inserting them in the tutorials I create I use MySQL because MySQL is one of the widely used and powerful and fastest databases around so MySQL is great to use with PHP for storing data so Facebook is one of the social networking websites that takes advantage of PHP as a whole as it's a really really nice language to work with a lot of the syntax and structure similar to C and it's actually interpreted by C serverside as well I think it's C or C yeah probably C but you can obviously prove me wrong on that if you'd like a home I may be wrong but yeah this is a brief overview overview of PHP so if you're thinking about getting started in it follow the tutorials that I've created and you can begin to start creating dynamic websites and you'll actually start to realize how easy PHP is the fundamentals of it anyway we can start going in to solve the objectoriented programming side of PHP which is slightly more difficult because some people struggle with objectoriented programming so we do have the objectoriented programming functionality within PHP and this was added from PHP version 5 I believe in about 2004 so we can use objectoriented programming inside PHP as well as recursive sorry not recursive procedural programming as well as so procedural structure to our code so that's a brief overview overview of PHP it's a really really great language to learn and it's really really widely used on the web today so it's definitely worth it
