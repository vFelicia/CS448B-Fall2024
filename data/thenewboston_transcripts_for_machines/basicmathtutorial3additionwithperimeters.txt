right here we have addition with parameters right here we have two squares and a rectangle by definition of a square all four sides are exactly the same so right here this side says that it is 10 units long let's say the units are inches if this is 10 in long so is this side so is this side and so is this side same here if this is 2 units long this is 2 units long this is 2 units long this is two units long but a rectangle not all all four sides are exactly the same where only two sides are exactly the same to one another so these two sides are 12 and these two sides are four units long to find the perimeter of the square you have to add all four sides together the perimeter is the distance along the outside so in order to do let's change colors in order to do the perimeter of a square You' have to add 10 + 10 + 10 + 10 to make this more simple we add 10 and 10 is 20 10 and 10 is 20 and 20 and 20 is 40 so the perimeter of the square square is 40 in always put your unit for the square on the middle it's 2 units long so we do 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 2 and 2 is 4 + 2 and 2 is 4 four and four is8 8 in for the rectangle you'd have to add these two sides and these two sides so 12 and 12 + 4 and 4 12 and 12 2 and 2 is 4 1 and 1 is 2 4 and 4 is 8 8 + 4 8 9 10 11 12 put down the two carry over the 1 2 and 1 is three is 32 units and that is how you find the perimeter of a square and a rectangle
