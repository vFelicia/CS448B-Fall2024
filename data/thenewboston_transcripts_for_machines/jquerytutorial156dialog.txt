hi this is IX from PHP academy' org with a video tutorial for the new bustin in this tutorial we're going to be creating a dialog widget in the jQuery UI so what I mean by a JRA dialog widget is when we click a button or carry out another event this doesn't have to be an on click of a button it can be absolutely anything so it can appear perhaps in the background whilst something's happening and perhaps an error might occur or it might just be a randomly appearing dialog box but for this purpose I've created somewhat of a scenario where a user would click a button to say update settings that were listed in a form on the page so when I go ahead and click Save the first thing you see is that this dialog button is caught with a specific title and also some text inside I've then created an OK button which actually closes the dialog off so when we actually when we actually click on the button this dialog is activated now the only thing we're creating is a specific div and then we're going to add attributes to it so we're going back to sort of jQuery routes where we will set attributes of a particular div so we're going to set this manually and we're going to set this manually as well then we're going to change around a few properties because by default the dialogues in the jQuery UI are a little different to what you see here you can see that we've got this wiped out background here and we can't actually click on anything on the page as it's been disabled so let's go ahead and start writing out the code so I've opened up my text editor as usual I have the jQuery UI javascript library and the jQuery original JavaScript library and I've also included this CSS file from this theme here so this is all downloadable with the jQuery UI package and you should be set up if you followed some of my other tutorials in this series we've also got you ijs which is going to handle the dialogue and the changing of the title and the text and everything and style dot CSS CSS as well which we're going to make one simple change just now before we start and that is to set the badi TECA font color a font size sorry so I'm going to set the font size of the body to 10 pixels to ensure that the dialogue box is displayed exactly how we want it so the first thing I'm going to go ahead and do is create a div with an ID and that's all we need we're not going to enter any text into here and we're not going to give this div a title now by default jQuery UI gives a tight well we'll accept a title and the contents within this div area so for example saved and your settings have been saved now let's just go ahead and say save dialogue now this would automatically pick up the title and the text in between and apply it to the dialogue however this is going to mean that you are constantly going to be creating these for different purposes so for example error and then an error has occurred so you'd have to then go ahead and show each dialogue depending what I'm going to do is create a generic div which is going to allow us to change the title and also the content as well so we can leave the title out of this and we can just create a div with a particular ID in this case I've called it saved dialog however we can just call this dialog okay so we're going to need to create a button to actually activate this because obviously at the moment we have nothing on our page this div on its own is absolutely meaningless until we apply the widget to it so I'm going to go ahead and create a button and I'm going to give this a value of save and I'm also going to give this an ID because we're going to need to use an event handler to see when the button is clicked so I'm just going to call this save so now we have a button on our page that we're going to click that's going to activate this div here now don't worry about the positioning of this dialogue it could go absolutely anywhere on the page jQuery will handle how and where this dialogue is displayed so let's go over to UI J s and let's start to create an event handler for our Save button so I'm selecting the Save button and I'm going to create a click event for this and then a function just within this now within the function contents is when we want to display the dialogue so this is where we're displaying the dialogue here so we need to go ahead and set this div to be an actual dialogue I'm going to go ahead and do it by default and you'll see that we won't get the title and the description inside the dialogue box however this demonstrates the basic functionality we have so let's go ahead and reference the dialogue and we're going to say dot dialogue and it's as simple as that we haven't supplied any options or any additional parameters we've just created a dialogue from this div so what that will do now is when we click Save you'll see that we've got this dialogue window open now we can drag this around and we can resize it and we're going to fix that in just a moment we're going to through each stage of the tutorial create this as you saw at the start of the tutorial so at the moment we can close the close the div off we haven't got any additional buttons and most importantly we don't have a title or a dialogue description or text that will be in our dialogue so we need to go ahead and fix that so inside UI J s what I'm going to do is because I've clicked the Save button I can then start to set attributes to this dialogue div and then actually display it so I'm just going to temporarily get rid of dialogue and the first thing I'm going to do is set an attribute so attribute is going to take two parameters the first of which is the attribute you want to change but in this case its title remember this attribute here corresponds to the value that we would usually put here so when because we're not including that because we want to make it a generic dialogue we're going to go ahead and define a title ourselves and I'm going to just define this as saved so this is the text that will now be associated with this dialogue
