so today we're gonna review ratios and proportions and they're gonna help us later on compare triangles so we can talk about them in regards to one another so ratios and proportions are just relationships between two quantities so first we're going to talk about ratios so a ratio is when you have a number over a total and we're talking about the ratio of that number compared to the total of what we're talking about so if we have five out of seven children we have 5 over 7 because 7 is the most 7 is the total amount of children that we can have so 15 to 20 we put this smaller number over the bigger total and when we write ratios we don't want to write them in simplest form so to simplify we're gonna divide the top by 5 and the bottom by 5 so 15 divided divided by 5 is 3 and 20 divided by 4 or divided by 5 is 4 so we have a ratio of 3/4 now there are several ways to write a ratio we can leave it as a fraction or more commonly you'll see 3 to 4 or 3 semicolon for now these all just mean that there's a three to four ratio of whatever you're talking about like maybe there's three boys for every four girls or there's three boys out of four children those are all ratios so we're going to do some more examples we have two to six so we put two over six and we're going to divide the top and the bottom by 2 so 2 divided by 2 is 1 6 divided by 2 is 3 so we have a 1 2 3 ratio 1 2 3 or 1 out of 3 12 out of 30 we have 12 over 30 we can divide both of these by 6 12 divided by 6 is 2 30 divided by 6 is 5 so we have a twofifths ratio so those are ratios now we're gonna go into proportions and a proportion is always going to be set up like this you have a number over and um their number equal to a number over another number when we solve proportions we're trying to find out what value of x makes this proportion true so to solve this we we're gonna cross multiply so we multiply 9 by 4 and 3 by X so we have 3 X is equal to 9 times 4 3 X and 9 times 4 is 36 so then to solve for X we're going to divide both sides by 3 and 36 divided by 3 is 12 so 3/4 is equal to 9 12 and if you were divide this by 3 and this by 3 you would see that those are indeed true so we're going to do the same thing for this one we're gonna do one time with 7 equals 2 times y so 2y is equal to 1 times 7 is just 7 we divide both we get Y is equal to 7 halves so if we plug this back in we get 1/2 is equal to 7 halves divided by 7 so if you remember our rules for dividing fractions we keep the top change the sign to multiplication and flip the fraction so so we take seven halves multiply it by one over seven the sevens cancel and one half in indeed equals one half so for this one it's a little different because these are written as ratios so in order to get this to a equation that we can solve we're gonna do what we would do for a ratio so we put three over eight 27 over X and then we're going to solve it the same way we would solve a proportion so three X is equal to eight times twentyseven so we get 3 X is equal to 216 we divide both sides by 3 we get X is equal to 72 so this one is a normal proportion we're going to cross multiply 7 X is equal to 3 times 5 7 X is equal to 15 divide both sides by X we get 15 sevenths so that's our lesson on ratio and proportions now this is gonna help us for our next lesson where we talk about similar triangles and we compare them to one another
