hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at nested loops now if you remember back a couple tutorials we learned about if statements and that how you can nest if statements inside of each other so we're in the if statement case both of the values have to be true for it to run now it's a little different for for loops but the concept is still the same so let's go ahead and make a demo project for it so we'll go to new project and we will call this nested loops now we can also nest do until loops we can nest dowhile loops there's a lot of stuff in Visual Basic that you can nest inside of each other so let's go ahead and zoom in here so let's go ahead and create a for loop so for number one equals one two let's just go ten then go ahead and do the code that is inside of this for loop so let's come down here and after our next we'll go ahead and add console dot readline okay so now inside of our for loop we're going to add another for loop so for num2 num2 equals one to ten go ahead and console dot write line and we'll just write line num2 so what this is what this is going to do is the first time this for loop runs it's going to print out one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and then it's going to go back to the top it's going to print it out again so what I mean by this is if we run this we get one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and it does this ten times so we have 100 integer values here printed out on our screen now let's go ahead and organize this a little bit better so instead of using console dot write line let's just go ahead and use console dot write and you can see here that it will print one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and it goes through this now this isn't very nicelooking either so there's one more thing that we can do to kind of clean this up and make a grid out of the numbers that we have so inside of our first for loop will just do console dot write line so I'll go ahead and run this and then explain to you how this code works so you can see that it's got one two three four five six seven eight nine ten it goes down to the line below it and this is a 10 by 10 grid so there's 100 integer values on this grid okay so now basically what happens when we create this for loop is we have for number 1 equals 1 to 10 and every time this is this for loop is iterated it iterates this for loop right here so starting off num1 is equal to 1 it's going to do 1 to 10 it's going to console dot right and it's going to have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then after this outside of this for loop which is all by itself it's going to do console dot write line inside of this for loop so it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and then down the line and it goes back up to the top and it does that again and it's going to do that ten times to give us a grid now we can also do this with like I said do Wiles and do 1 2 loops on so I'm going to leave it up to you guys to figure out how to do that with your do loops and once you practice that a bit go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
