hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the new boston now we've already looked at an introduction to jQuery plugins we're going to go ahead and install this particular plugin called show password now what this does looking at the description I've already tested this plugging and it's working perfectly is it adds a customizable show password checkbox so a checkbox next to the input field password and it allows your you or the users to view their password as they're typing it so you can check this button and your password will can move will be converted or shown as opposed to the original asterisks is or or circles that are shown in most browsers so I've come over to plugins jQuery comm slash project slash show password so if you want to follow along this tutorial of installing this plugin then go ahead to that address now and follow along the links like click now there's no reserve there's no releases actually uploaded onto the onto this jQuery page but we have a resources section here when we where we can go over to the home page of this or the author the plugin of this author or the author of this plugin rather so when we go down we get some more description about it we can view a demo and also download this as well so let's go ahead and first of all view a demo that's quite important so we know how it functions and how it should function you can see that we've been giving a usage snippet just here and just further down this some more options that we can give it we're good we're just going to be focusing on installing the plugin and the best ways to do this so let's say I was to go ahead and type a password just in here the show password checkbox I can now click and the text will be shown inside of here when I click this again the text will be converted back to a secret password so more and more nowadays these these are cropping up to show you the password as you're typing it particularly for example if you're entering a web key or a connecting to a Rooter wireless network they usually have some kind of show password option so perhaps if you're entering some kind of long but secret data you might want to just show this so you can see a you know as long as no one's around you and that might be useful when actually typing it in depending on how complicated it is so let's go back to the author's homepage and let's go ahead and just click download and receive this zip file as a download so we've got this zip file here which we can open and inside we've got three files now index dot PHP automatically shows me that this could be a demo file and it is in fact a demo file so most plugins are going to come with these files where they have a page setup ready for you to use we've also got a jQuery password is and jQuery show password minge is and the majority of plugins will have the jQuery notation on the front of them and then there's the plugin name and then obviously it'll be a JavaScript file now the one that we want to go for is the minified version as with jQuery a lot of plugins do come with minified and uncompressed versions you can see the size difference just here this one's 1.7 megabytes and this one's to this week kilobyte yeah sorry this is kilobytes and then 2.1 so we're looking at a much smaller package if you wanted to go ahead and modify a plugin for any reason and the author has provided you with an uncompressed version you can go ahead and use this one but it's always best to or use a minified version of of a plugin or jQuery just to keep page load time down or to a minimum so at the moment on my page I just have a stylesheet included which isn't relevant in this case but the main thing to look out for is we have this jQuery is so we have jQuery included jQuery plugins require jQuery so you're going to need to make sure you've included jQuery before you include the plugin files now what I'm going to do is I'm just going to open up my directory my directory and go over to the JavaScript folder I'm then essentially going to either copy this over to this JavaScript folder JavaScript folders just where I keep all my plugins or my jQuery just to keep them neat but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna cancel that and I'm gonna double click on this to open it up in my text editor so I'm gonna go ahead and copy this entirely select it all and copy it entirely I'm gonna close this off and I'm gonna open up a new document and I'm gonna go ahead and save this as jQuery show password is now the reason I tend to do this rather than just copying files is so I can give them my own names I like to keep filenames neat and tidy and to a certain structure so I've used jQuery show password is the same as jQuery UI here I've named jQuery UI so we've now saving out this file ensuring that it is a JavaScript extension now that we've saved that out it's ready to use so we can go ahead and close that now what we want to do is the footer of our page we want to go ahead and include this as well as jQuery so I'm gonna type script type equals and then just end the script there and the type is obviously text forward slash JavaScript and the source we're going to go ahead and supply so that's J s forward slash jQuery show password is so now that I've saved that out if we come over to my page here and refresh that should now be included as long as I've spelt this right and the file actually exists it'll be included in the page now as with all jQuery or JavaScript we'll want to keep all of our code in an external file so I'm going to go ahead and create a new file and save this in the J's folder as well and this is just going to be called password is
