hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog back with another video for the new Boston in this video we're going to be looking at the Select distinct statement inside SQL so we've already looked at selecting data from a database for example the table sorry that I have set up here it's a basic table we've got a column ID which is just an auto increment and an integer and it's our primary key now the data we're going to focus on is this first name in this surname field we've got two columns here we've got firstname we've got a variety of first names and we've got a variety of surnames now what we have in here is we have first of all we have duplicate data so we've got Dale Garrett and Dale Garrett here we've got first the second record we've got Dale Garrett and for the fourth record we've got Dale Garrett as well we also have some duplicate surname so we've got Garrett Garrett and Garrett and gara here too Malcolm's and one instance of Smith so we have some duplicate data in our database now you'll probably find that when you're storing things inside your database whether it be names like I have now for any reason say you had a comment system I don't know it could be absolutely any table holding any amount of data however what you might want to do is you might only want to select say the first name and surname but you might want to only show the records that exist in themselves so for example we might just want to say well the surnames that we have in this database consists of Garrett Malcolm and Smith you might just want to say yeah okay so we have three different surnames in our in our surnames field and that is Garrett Malcolm and Smith so how do we go about doing this well we use the Select distinct keyword so obviously distinct we're selecting distinct values from our from a specific column in our database if you like so let's go ahead first of all and select select the surname from the database and I'll show you how adding this distinct keyword and changes everything so let's say select surname from so it's selecting the field name here from names and that's about it that's all I want to do I want to select surname from name so we're just selecting all surnames from this names table here let's go ahead and click go ok so you can see that we've just literally been returned with a list of the surnames that exist in our in our database for every record in here but you can see that we're still getting four instances of Garrett to instance as if Malcolm and then just the one instance of Smith so what we want to do is we want to display this as Garrett Malcolm and Smith because the idea of the distinct is we're not duplicating our results but we're showing the results we're basically saying well there are four instances of Garrett but there is an instance of Garrett so let's just show Garrett so that's what we're doing without a select distinct keyword so let's go ahead and paste in what we what we just did before now let's have the distinct after this so the selecting distinct is a keyword in itself so we're selecting distinct values surname from name so this is the distinct value that we're selecting I'm going to go ahead and show you in a minute what we're going to do if we're selecting the surname and the first name from names if we use indistinct let's go ahead and click go here I'll just copy and paste this into my clipboard I'll copy this into my clipboard so we can use it in a moment now you can see that what it's done is it selected the surnames that actually exist but it hasn't shown the duplicate records that exist for this set the surname in this example so just by adding this select distinct statement we have distinctly selected values from our database so it all adds up to the fact that it's called select distinct okay so now remember we had a duplicate data for Dale Garrett the record Dale Garrett here we've got Dale Garrett and we've got Dale Garrett here so what happens if we come into our SQL tab and we don't just select distinct surname but we just we select distinct first name as well so select distinct surname first name from names as click going to what happens okay so you can see that we've been just will we're displaying all of the data that exists into the database but there's obviously one change in here and you'll see that what we've actually done is we've gotten rid of the duplicate name inside of our database so what we can do is we can select distinct values and by specifying two fields so that two fields are selected distinctly so we've got the surname of first name are being selected distinctly now Alex and Garrett a different data Dale and Garrett a different data however if we have down gap Dale Garrett duplicate that's not going to be displayed because we're selecting distinct from the first name and the surname joined so that's the select distinct statement inside SQL now let's talk about the kind of uses you might you might have for it okay so let's say you had a table which stored users comments inside let's say you had a guestbook application that store the name of the user or the email address of the user who was posting the comment and the comment itself now what you might want to do is you might want to say produce a list of all the email addresses that have ever written any comment you might want not want to produce a list of your every single email address because you're not going to be able to see how many users have been posting so if we had say a list of a hundred email addresses but 60 of them were unique so we had 60 of the of the same email address in there but you know half of them or just over half of them might have posted posted twice or three times if it was a less of a percentage so you might want to select distinct to see how many actual people have made a post in somewhere or you know I'm sure you can make up your uses for it there's lots of different uses you can get out of that this select distinct but next time you want to select distinct values from your database just use the Select sting select distinct key statement and you're going to be returning distinct values from fields that are specified
