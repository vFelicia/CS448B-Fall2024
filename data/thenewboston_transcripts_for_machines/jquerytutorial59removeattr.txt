and essentially what this means is that when we have it checked the value of this is on then we check it again the value is nothing so we don't have a value we the value attribute is is defined but we don't actually have a value so what we can do now is we can go ahead and check that this state is on or off now halfway through the tutorial I've completely changed my mind and I thought to myself and I've sort of thoughts myself well when we check this we just want to enable this and when we uncheck it we want to disable it again so we'll go with that it's probably a bit more practical for those of you that want to go ahead and use this so I'm going to create an if statement and the condition is if if state is on so if the state is on that means that we agree and we can go ahead and enable the button otherwise if the state is equal to nothing we want to go ahead and disable the button once again so we'll focus on disabling the button again well sorry we'll focus on enabling enabling the button first and with this we're using remove attribute which is what the whole tutorial the point of the tutorial is about so we want to reference this obviously again our currently selected object and we want to use remove attribute and we're gonna do we're gonna know it's of you know tell this function if you like which attribute we want to remove and the attribute we want to remove completely as the disabled attribute so this will literally just get rid of this like that so that's all we're doing with this button here and OH in actual fact sorry now it's not this it's hash continue because we're referencing the button itself sorry we're not referencing the checkbox so we're removing the attribute disabled let's just go ahead and check that out so when I click on it we go into it obviously change will grab the state if the state is equal to on ie if it's checked like we saw earlier when we alerted out we're going to go ahead and remove the attribute from this continue button here so when we click it you can see that that's enabled and obviously when we uncheck it we still have a state change but now we're stuck with the enabled button if for example I click on agree and then I don't agree my own check I won't want to continue or I won't want my users to continue if I was to you know have this on on my website so if the state is equal to 0 equal to nothing when we or we could say null here which would be better if the state is equal to null when we have changed the checkbox I has it been unchecked we want to go ahead and reduce able the continue button so we want to add the attribute disabled and the value of this is disabled much like we did before this here let's just bring it down is the equivalent to disabled equals disabled like that so that's how that looks inside of jQuery however when we apply it to the element it will you know create the attribute so once again when we click it we enable the button but now when we uncheck it an actual fact I think that's probably that's probably because it doesn't equal null is just a blank value yeah okay so now when we click on it click it the value or the state of this from the value is equal to on otherwise if the state is equal to nothing which is when we uncheck it then we go ahead and add this attribute disabled to the button again so we're sort of like toggling between states if you like so you could go ahead and you could sort of apply this to a form and then at the end of the form you could have this agree button and then continue you know you might have this here wrapped around the form like this and then you might have some agreement here and then they would read the agreement and either agree and then continue to submit the form or or they could uncheck and then they wouldn't be able to click just bear in mind that this is a button type so to have it actually submit the form you would have it as a submit type and obviously because we're referencing by the ID this doesn't make a difference and it still works so we can click continue and we can submit the form you see we've just got a little question mark here but obviously if you had an action it would submit so that's how we've toggled between this using remove that tribute was the focus of this tutorial however you know it's boring just to talk about one attribute without it's practical application so I've popped it into this small little piece of functionality that goes ahead goes ahead and toggles this based on a checkbox value
