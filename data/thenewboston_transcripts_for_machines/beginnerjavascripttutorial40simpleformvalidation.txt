what is going on guys is Bucky and welcome to your fortieth tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to show you guys probably the most simple example I've ever showed you and that is basic form validation now what this program is going to do is we're going to have a really simple form it's probably going to be one check box and whenever we click the submit button it's going to check whether or not that check box is checked so you're saying all right this is how you do validation with check boxes but I want to do validation with username and passwords well once you understand the basics behind form validation you can apply this to every single element so you don't have to learn a bunch of different ways you have to understand this one tutorial and then you understand the basics of foreign validation so like I said let's go ahead and start out with a basic form and I'm going to name mine arm buckey's form and let's go ahead and end it right now and like I said we can have a bunch of different elements in here but for the sake of this tutorial I'm just going to add one check box so input type equals check box and might as well give it a name it will make it easier just name it the box this is the Box tonton done and now we need some kind of submit button because whenever we're calling our function later on and we needed some way to submit the form that's basically a lemn sign so input type equals button and might as well give it a value of something like press me that's the text that's going to appear on the button and now let's go ahead and use our on click attribute and remember whatever code we type in here like validator this is the JavaScript function that's going to be called whenever we click our bun so let's go ahead and save this and run and launch and Chrome what we got now so whenever we click our button nothing happens because we didn't type any JavaScript yet but whenever we create our validator function we're going to create our Valerie function to check whether or not this checkbox is checked so right now it doesn't do anything but we're going to change that right now so I'm going to go ahead and since this is just a function I'm going to go ahead and add in the head of my website why not I like that all my functions there so again this is named validator so that's what we need to call our function function and actually might as well just copy that to ensure that we don't have any typos and it's going to take no parameters and check it out whenever we call our function we need to check whether or not our check box is checked or not and we can do that with a basic if else statement so if and the condition we want to test is is this check box check so first we need access to that check box in order to do that document dot the name of your form which is Bucky's form and let me just double click that make sure whoa not Bucky's forum buckey's form there we go that's why I double click it make sure they both float up so Bucky's form and now we need to access the element the check box and we gave it a name the box so we can easily access it and the property to see if it's checked or not is checked now this is going to be true if it's checked and false if it's not checked so let me go ahead and launch in Chrome see right now it would be true since it's checked and right now it would be false since it's not checked so if it is checked what bit of code do we want to run well let's just go ahead and make an alert box pop up on the screen that says you know something stupid like yep it's checked with explanation boy and now if it's not checked it's going to be false so under our else let's just go ahead and alert on something even dumber like you better check that Hoss and I like that because they both start with y and that's just right no it's not checked explanation point so save this in let me run this and then I'll talk you guys through it one more time launching Chrome so let's go ahead and check it and press it and it says yes it's checked cool enough now let's go ahead and uncheck it press it again and it says no it's not checked okay pretty cool it's working perfectly so basically here is what we did we went ahead and we created a forum called Bucky's forum and we added a checkbox to it and whenever we click the button we told JavaScript to call this validator function well then we went ahead and we made the validator function and all this function did is it said all right whenever you click this button I'm going to check if the checkbox is checked if it is I'm going to run this bit of code if it's not I'm going to run this bit of code so that's why whenever you ran it and it was checked it says yes it's checked and whenever it was unchecked it said no it's not checked pretty cool huh so that is the basics of form validation again we only have one other element besides the button on this form but what people typically do is they make a function to validate all their data and again like you see we validated one piece of data right here but then you might have another piece of code that says validate another checkbox or validate a text box or a password field so with that being said this is how we use a bunch of different excuse me this is the basics of form validation and how to create a function to validate all the data in your form so that's all I have for you guys in this story again pretty clear and simple the basics of form validation you pretty much make your form use a function to validate the data by accessing each element in the form simple enough so now that I covered that I don't know what I'm covering in the next tutorial but trust me is going to be amazing so thank you guys for watching don't forget to I don't know don't forget to brush your teeth I'll see in the next story
