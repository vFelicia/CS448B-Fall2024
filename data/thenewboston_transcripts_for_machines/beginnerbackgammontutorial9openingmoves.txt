what's up guys it's funky and welcome to another backhand with sorrow now in this tutorial I want to talk to you guys about opening moves now there are a lot of different opening moves that you can do whenever you win the role first and again another thing I want to point out I'm going to cover all the opening moves but if you can tell I'm not discussing doubles because that's impossible if you roll a number and they roll a number in they're the same then you roll again so that's why I'm not going to be discussing 3 3 or 5 5 or anything like that because you can't have doubles on your opening roll so let's go ahead and get started with the best opening roll hands down and that's a 1 3 whenever you're old 1 3 you always want to play 6 2 5 and 8 5 this gives you your new 5 point which is such a crucial point in the game and also starts you off for a nice four point prime later on now with your 2 4 what I always like to do is like I said before build your four point using a 2 right here in your 4 right there and again this is a nice start as well now whenever you roll a 3/5 like I said any time you roll and the dice are separated by 2 you can go ahead and make a new point so whenever your roll 1 2 3 and your 5 you can go ahead and make a new point on your 3 point right there not a bad play now whenever you roll a 61 here's what I like to do I like to go ahead and move my 1 from 8 to 7 and I like to play my 6 13 to 7 right there now this is the only opening roll you can get where you can make an immediate 3 point prime so you can clearly see why this is such a powerful move this early on in the game now whenever you roll a 6 5 here's how I like to play that now what I like to do is called running my checker now since these checkers have the longest way to go you usually want to start those out early so they don't get trapped in so in my 6 5 what I like to do is take this checker and move all the way on my 13 point right here not only protects it but again we want to get these checkers out early before they have a chance to book Prime now whenever I roll a 2 1 here's like to do I like to go ahead and move my 13 my 11 with my 2 and also my 6 to my 5 in my 1 what this does is a couple things first of all it gives this one protection because they're going to be hard to hit from their 24 point and also whenever I move the 6th of the 5 it sets up your 5 point for an extra roll since look how many options you have of hitting your 5 point on the next row and owning this point such a powerful movement and again one of the most important points in the game to own early on is your 5 point now whenever I roll a 41 I play it a lot like the last time I roll 6 to 5 and you're 13 and 9 for all the same reasons I discussed last time now whenever I roll a 1 5 here say I like to put this I like to go ahead and move my 6 to 5 start building my 5 point and I also like to move 13 8 now typically whenever you see a 5 on your opening a roll this isn't the greatest thing you want to see since there's not a lot of useful stuff you can do with a 5 but anyways we're not really building anything new here but hey we'll take what they give us now on number I roll it to 6 I would play my to 13 and 11 and I like to play my 6 24 to 18 and here's what I like to do this first of all we can either a start advancing this checker out or be set up building a pointer right here never see an RA this is crazy because this is a very vulnerable to be hit well first of all if they hit us this early in the game check this out they leave this checker right here open being hint which one ever rolls 6 with this I'm going to go ahead and hit this and also you don't really have to worry too much about being hit early on in the game I mean this checker was already right here to begin with and first of all early on in the game your board is way open it's going to be really easy to reenter they don't have any Prime's built right here or anything so you can take more chances early on in the game when your boards open rather than later on when they have a nice prime set up and it's going to be hard to reenter now I go ahead and play three six almost identical took two six I go ahead and play my 13 to 10 and also my 24 to 18 for all the same reasons as last time now when you have a 4 6 this is going to give you the most options and all of these options are good the first thing you can do is play your 13 924 18 not a bad play or what you can do is you can use your four six vote a new two point which you either play or four right there and your six right there this isn't the most useful point but it definitely helps voting a prime later on in the game or what you can do whenever you roll a two four you can go ahead and set a run around from 24 to 14 now whenever you roll a two three there isn't really a really great way to play this but there's one thing that I want to tell you guys to avoid you can do anything any play is good just don't move your 13 to your 8 this is the most worthless play it doesn't set up anything it doesn't really help you know building any strategy whatsoever so whenever you see your opponent roll a 2 3 2 open and then move the 13 to their 8 you can say all right pretty much chalk it up as a win because you're playing with the newb now whenever you roll a 3 4 here's how I like to play this one 313 tier 10 in your 24 to 20 now this chip is going to be relatively protected from getting hit from their ships on their 24 point and also you're setting up owning their 5 point which hopefully you can build on the next roll so don't forget to look for this on the next roll now whenever you roll a to 5 this is a pretty terrible roll it's probably the worst roll you can start out as but anyways whenever you get a 2 5 here so I like to play this I like to move my 13th to my 8 which again isn't really useful but hey we'll take it and I also like to move 13 to 11 this is a really defensive strategy but it's really the best player play this role now whenever you roll a 4 5 here's how I like to play this again not the best rowboat or take it what I like to do is play this one right here and also with my for my 24 their 20 so what this does right here is we want to set up owning their 5 points since this is probably the second most important point owned in the game so look on the next roll when you get it forward to move your 24 to 20 and then we can on there point
