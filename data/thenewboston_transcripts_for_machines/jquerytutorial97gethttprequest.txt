hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dog with a video tutorial for the New Boston okay so in this tutorial we're going to take a look at jQuery get HTTP requests now this sounds a bit complicated but essentially all it does is all we're doing here is we are passing a value to a PHP file or another script file and then we're taking the contents and then showing it to the user so what we're doing is were performing in essence an ajax request or an ajax type request without having to refresh the page so this is generally what jquery is used in with a great deal for because it creates an really easy way to perform ajax like operations on a page so i'm going to give you a slight idea of what we're going to be creating we're going to be creating a form in which we in which we enter say a name or a piece of text we're then going to click the you know like a submit button and this value is going to be reversed so we're going to reverse a string we're just going to be using a simple function inside PHP to reverse a string when then going to return this data to the user but without having to refresh the page so usually in PHP you would think about if you were to think about this you would perhaps create a form you would create say form action equals and you'd create a file called something like reverse PHP you'd send the method as say get and you would then go ahead and inside the form create an input type with say text and you would give that a name and you'd call this string and you'd then create a button or a submit button and you'd give that a value so go for example so what this would do is it would take this value here and it would use it would use get so it would store it in a get variable which PHP can then pick up in this reverse dot PHP file now instead of actually submitting the form we use jQuery to submit the data for us and we specify which file we want to submit it to so if you're comfortable with jQuery even if you just started learning out you should be comfortable with taking the value of this text area so let's go ahead and refresh you should be comfortable with when we click this go button it will tell you should be comfortable with storing the value of this text area this text field now when we store the value of text field we can then pass it to a PHP file and return the result in a div just underneath so let's go ahead and get rid of this form because it's not required in this case we're using Ajax to handle our events so we're handling the clicking of this button we can also change this to a type button so we have exactly the same form when we refresh but all we've done is we've just got rid of the form outline of where we send the send the data to so now what we need to do is we need to go over to our ajax JS file and take a look at how we sort of create this event when we click click the button and then also getting the value of this string so we know the name of this is string and we know the name of this button is nothing at the moment so I'm going to give it an ID of so button and let me just get rid of name here and give this an ID of string so we're looking out for the pressing of the button which is called button and then we're getting the value of the string which is called string so let's go into your Ajax j/s and create our event handler okay so we are choosing to take this button and we're going to append an event on the end of it so button click so when this button has been clicked we create a function inside of this and then once we've done that we need to look at getting the value of this text area or this text field so I'm going to create a new variable and that's going to be called string and that's going to be equal to again we're going to use the hash selector to select the ID so the ID for this input field is string so we've used that selector and now we want to say dot Val so we're taking the value of this string text field and applying it or putting it into this variable in JavaScript called string okay so now what we can do is we can go ahead and just alert this out to test that it has worked properly so let's go over to the browser I'm going to go ahead and type in my name and I'm going to click go you'll see that we've got the value Alex that's been returned which matches what's in here so we now know that the value string holds the field contents essentially okay so now onto the interesting part we're going to use the get HTTP request to send this string to a particular file now we haven't created a PHP file yet we need to create that and then we can specify where we want to send it so I'm going to go ahead and create a new file I'm going to create a new folder and call this PHP and I'm going to save this file inside this directory and I'm going to call this reverse PHP just so we know what the file does okay so now we've got reverse dot PHP we can leave that alone for a moment and we can start to work on our HTTP requests so we're going to use a dollar sign but we're not obviously using a selector but we're using dot get now we create brackets for this and inside of here we're typically giving this three parameters so I'll just create the parent parameter in fact no I'll talk about them as we go the first parameter is the page that you want to send a particular set of data to so in this case it's PHP forward slash reverse PHP the second parameter is the list of variables you want to send and these will be accessible by reversed PHP by using dollar underscore get and then the variable name here
