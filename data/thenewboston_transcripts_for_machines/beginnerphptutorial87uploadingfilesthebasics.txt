hi this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and this is another tutorial for the new Boston in this lesson we're going to be talking about file uploads now this is really really popular topic because lots of websites now tend to deal with file uploads in one way or another it may be for example uploading an image or uploading a document or even uploading something that needs to be processed at some point so how do we handle file uploads in PHP now it's relatively easy to handle file uploads in PHP and for the purpose of this tutorial if we just open up my browser you can see that I've created an uploads folder here the script that we're currently working with is upload dot PHP and we have a different another directory inside this directory called uploads now the purpose of this tutorial is not to talk about security and file uploads it's just simply how we take a file allow the user to select a file from the computer and then where and then send it to a specific directory as this tutorial stands the code in it it's not safe to use on a web server because in actual fact and the user will be able to upload any file at all for example they could upload a PHP file and they could mess around with with your server and pretty much any way they like as with Exe files things like that executive or files so in this tutorial can be learning how to upload but we're not actually going to be learning how to protect against it there is another tutorial I have in this same file upload series with the security discussion in there and how to secure against your form data so how do we start well we're going to start with a form first of all and we're going to create the form in exactly the same way as usually find so a form action we're going to be going back to upload dot PHP so we're going to be processing the file data inside our tags up here and the method is going to be post remember we're sending a large amount of data so on the method to be post now there is one additional attribute you need to supply in this form and what we need to do is we need to supply the ink type now this is the way that the the data in the form is encoded when it's sent and we need to specify this to be multipart multipart and it's for form and then and then data so this is basically going to allow us to process the form and enable file uploads and we're sending a large amount of data and this is the encoding type this just tells when we process it tells how we're going to encode the data so now we need to go on to allowing the user to upload a file now you may have come across this before but we use input type type and this is file so this is already created outfit our button our browse button if you like and I'm just going to call the name of this file so let's just break down and we'll create a submit button which is probably important so submit and name your value rather is submit ok so let's refresh our form and see our page and see what we've got ok so we've got an option to choose a file here and a submit button when you do click Submit we're going remember we're submitting back to the upload dot PHP page so if I come up and I click Choose file we're presented with the dial I'm an open file box where we can choose a file type now in this tutorial or in the next tutorial one we did with security we're only going to allow files with the jpg extension to be uploaded so in this case all these pictures here are jpeg files so if I was to click on a file for example the filenames display that's just how my browser displays things might look a little different in other browsers and then I can click Submit now at the moment nothing's happened because we don't have an area inside here or a function inside here that's going to process our fire file upload so we've submitted the file everything's worked but now we need to grab the name of the file the temper relocation of the file in case of comparing file sizes things like that and extensions and will for the extension we need the name but just as an example here I'm going to create a few variables and then show you how to grab the data of the file or different parts of data so we use in this case I'm calling this name this is going to be the file then the file name of the file is uploaded so it's dollar underscore files and then here we put the the name of the variable name so this in this case it's file because it corresponds to what we've put in the form here so that's file and then just like what we use associative arrays because this is stored as an associative array we use brackets next to here and in here we just type name now what this will do is this will show us the file name of the father we've uploaded so hopefully when we click Submit this is here is going to be picked up by this here and then we're going to grab the name which is the file name and then echo out I've just put an echo in front of there so let's give that a try we'll click Choose file I'm going to click this here so this is called words li underscore Nikola underscore one JPEG so if I click Submit above here we've echoed out the name of the file so in actual fact as this page stands at the moment we've gathered data about the file and it's still there for us to use so we can specify a few other as well so let's just delete that echo and another is size so this is going to echo out the the size of the file or store the size of the file so he's exactly the same structure and it's just size in here instead so it's named for name size for size we also have the type of file so we have type and that's dollar underscore files again and that's file because that's our the name of our form field and then we just have type now the temporary location or the temporary name of the file is a bit different and I explain what this is and why we need it basically and this is T TMP underscore name now the temporary now is slightly different to the other attributes in this case what we have here is when we do process the file upload each file is sent to a temporary location on your server so I've just uploaded this file here called Worsley underscore Nicola underscore one dot jpg this has been stored in a temporary location on this has been stored in a temporary location on my server ready for us to process it and put it somewhere relative to where we want it so at the moment we don't actually have anything in file in this uploads folder although we've processed and this file upload we haven't actually moved it yet so bear that in mind this is the temporary location we also have this error error that we can access here so that basically returns an error I think it returns zero if there's no error and but one if there's a there's been an error processing that but we're not really going to look at that and just yet
