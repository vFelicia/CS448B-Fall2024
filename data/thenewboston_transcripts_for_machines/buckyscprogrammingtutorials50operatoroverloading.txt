alright guys welcome back to your 50th C++ tutorial and I know in the last tutorial I told you guys I was going to be building a program using the this keyword but I was building it and I noticed that there was a lot of concepts I didn't teach you guys so we're going to have to come back that after I taught you guys a couple new concepts so we'll get back to that but for now I want to talk to you guys about something called operator overloading now operator overloading is a weird feature with C++ well operator overloading is is it allows you to use C++ operators like you know plus and multiply and it allows you to take these operators and change the way that they're used so for example maybe you have a class and you want to add two objects together well how the heck does C++ know how to add your two custom objects together well that way you can use operator overloading to specify what you want this operator to do so what I did already is I made a new class called Sally and I also include the Sally header in here and I included an IO Sriman namespace in here so now my dot CPP files look the same just to save this tutorial some time so now let's go ahead and get into the coding so let's go ahead in the sadi sally header file and notice that i took out both private and protected because we're just going to make everything in public it's going to make everything a whole lot easier so the Sally class is going to have a couple things in it the first thing it's going to have is a variable called num and this is the only variable it's going to have um it just needs a variable pretend this is like Sally's age or something I just named it num because it's easier to work with now let's go ahead and create two constructors the first constructor is pretty much just going to be empty constructor we're going to be building a sally object and whenever we don't pass any parameters to it it's just going to create a blank sally object and we're also going to be creating another constructor and whenever we create a Sally object and we pass an integer into it what I want to do is well let me go ahead I guess can code this right now whenever we create a Sally object and we pass an integer into it called like integer a or something what this is going to do is I like it right up there what this is going to do is take that number T and set it equal to a so we're going to create Sally objects in two ways a blank Sally object or a Sally object that already has a number simple enough so now let's get to the last thing in the Sally class and that is you know what I've been talking to you guys about this thing called operator overloading now again like I said operator overloading allows you to use C++ operators in a special way inside your classes so in order to use an overloaded operator you need to make a function and you need to give it a special name so whenever you build a function in C++ you need to first give it a return type now this function is actually going to return a sally object so go ahead and type a sally right there and now you have to name your function and you have to name it this whenever you're using an overloaded operator you have to start it with the named operator and then right after it you write what operator do you want to overload and this can be multiplied divided but we're going to be overloading the addition operator and what this is going to do is take two of these number properties and add them together so let's go ahead and write operator plus this is the name of our function now and this is also going to take a parameter what this function is going to do is it's going to take one Sally objects number and add another Sally objects number to it so we're going to need to pass it in another Sally object to add to it so let's go ahead and call it like um Sally well all we have to put is that Sally so now let's go ahead and build the function itself so let's go hop over to Sally dot CPP and let me make sure it I forget any semicolon looks good so now let's go ahead over to Sally about CPP and start building this function again the very first thing you write is their return type this is like void and well we're returning a Sally object so go ahead and write Sally right there and now we have to go ahead and write what class are we working with Sally what's the name of our function and remember that's operator plus since we're overloading the plus sign and what parameter does it takes well it takes a Sally parameter and just name this variable like ASO for another Sally object so now what we want to do is this we're going to be returning a brandnew Sally object so let's go ahead and make a new Sally object right now Sally and name this object brandnew simple enough so now let's go ahead and add the number property to this brandnew object because we created a brand new object but it doesn't have anything for its number property right here so let's go ahead and put brandnew dot num and what do we want to set this equal to well what we want to set equal to is the current objects number value plus another Sally objects number value
