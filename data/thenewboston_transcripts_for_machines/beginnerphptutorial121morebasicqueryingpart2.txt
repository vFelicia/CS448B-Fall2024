now what it's done is it's returned my first name in my surname because the username and password were both found and they both matched in the same row of data so this will be classed as a successful login so hopefully you understand the concept of this and how it could be used in PHP and we're going to move on to some more queries now let me just close this window let's browse for the data let's start start from the beginning so what happens if let's say my surname changes okay or let's say my first name changes it could be anything so let's assume that this user Alex with the password of password wants to change the name of the first name to Dale for example okay so what I'm going to do is I'm going to click SQL remember that the ID is 1 now within PHP you have stored this somewhere in a session if you've already looked at sessions that like things like login and you'll understand the idea of the user could be stored in a session so the current user so in PHP it's quite easy once a users logged in and we've said yet the user logged in is ID 1 we're referencing this user as ID 1 because it's a unique field we can change anything just by reference being back to this ID 1 and to do this we're going to say we're not going to select because we're not we're not returning any data we're just changing what we want to say is we want to say update users set and then we choose the data we want to set to different value so set firstname equals Dale where ID equals one so let's just go back to this browse away from that new tab so what we're doing here is we're updates are using the update keyword and by the way you don't have to do these in capitals but what happens is if you differentiate things like update and set and we're in capitals you can see that this is the difference between your structured query language and what you're actually dealing with so it's a lot easier to see so what we're doing is we're updating users so this is the users table here what we're doing is we're setting the first name equal to Dale so the first name here equal to Dale if you were to just say first name equals Dale this would update both surnames because we've not specified what ID or what unique field you want to set it by so set firstname equals Dale where the ID equals one so what this is going to do is it's going to select the ID with Row one it's going to come across and set the first name here to Dale so let's just click on that I'll click on go rather and you can see that one row affected so it's telling us how many rows have been affected and in this case one rows good because we're assuming that this is the row that we want to update so now if we come into browse let's just close that off you can see that so you can see that we've successfully updated this first name in the table so you can start to begin to see why this is useful for when we're dealing with PHP for example a user might want to change say their password or they might want to change their first name surname email address even anything to do with that and we can do that easily within our database obviously we're not going to be working inside PHP myadmin we're going to be doing everything from PHP which is slightly longer process but it uses exactly the same queries and as long as we've got this ID stored somewhere in a session or a cookie then we can work probably not gonna cook excited be unsafe to some extent but if it's stored somewhere then we would would be able to do this so now let's looking at now let's look at the in rows so let's say I want to delete this row here this art with IE 2 or even ID 1 it doesn't really matter so let's come into our SQL table again and what we need to do is we need to this time use the delete keyword we need to say delete from and we need to specify the table so users that's very important delete from users where and then all we need to do is specify the column the preferably the unique column so if we come back to here where ID equals a certain amount you could say where username equals Alex or where password it called something but obviously at the moment we're dealing with sort of a user login type table so we're going to delete we're you may use ID equals 1 so it's just Y ID equals 1 so this is going to delete from users where ID equals 1 so out just to mention beforehand we can use other comparison operators we can say things like greater than or equal to or each is equal to or just greater than or less than and things like that but obviously for now we're just inning a single row so we're ID was 1 if we click go do you really want to search giving us a confirmation message because it knows that we're deleting we can click OK it will say one row deleted you'll give us how query back now what we can do is we can just close this off click on browse and you can see that that row has been deleted so what happens now if we want to reinsert a whole new row of data we've already looked at inserting the data manually but from PHP we're going to want to say create a user account we want to insert the data and from scratch basically so how are we going to do this we click on insert only we don't we click on SQL because we're doing it manually so I want say insert into so it's pretty much English language's it's easy to follow because you can get it stuck inside your head easy exactly what you're doing so insert into obviously we're specifying the table we want to set insight into so insert into users then we use values and we have two brackets now inside here are the values we insert corresponding to the fields so let's just browse this now this is the shorthand way of doing it and this is what I'm going to be using you can do it properly and long and specify each field name as you go along but I'm just going to be saying insert into users and then I'm just going to put the values in here they are in there going to be in a single quotation marks separated by a comma so at the moment if we have a look we've got one two three four five different fields so we need to insert five different bits of data we've got 1 here 2 here 3 here 4 here and 5 here the other way round to start 1 2 etc so the comma separated values there we're using single quotation marks now ID can be left blank we know that because we this is auto increment the next value in set is going to have an ID of 3 because we're coming from the last value inserted 2 so we need to insert a username and password a first name and a surname so what we do is we insert say Alex password Alex and Gavin now if we don't specify say the last field here we're going to be returned with an error let's just have a look at that column count doesn't match value at count value count a right one now if you are ever trying to insert data from PHP and you are echoing out the sort of like results of your query if you know you may have an error and you get this this is basically what what you need to focus on you need to make sure that you're inserting the data required if you don't want to insert a surname for example you still need to specify with these inverted commas or rather single quotation marks however you just you can't leave it out so you have to insert you know can be blank so I'm just going to put Garrett in for now ok so that's basically our simple query to insert data so each of these we've comma separated code bond to our our column names our field names so we've got ideas the first one we've got user name as the second one which is Alex then we've got the password then we've got the first name and the surname okay so we've inserted them in order where they correspond so let's click on go you can see that one rows inserted inserted row ID at 3 so now let's go and click on browse and see what we've got you can see that we've now reinserted the value and/or the row with Alex password Alex and Garrett and this is now ID of 3 now what happens if I delete all of these just simply using this delete here and now what I want to do is insert a new piece of data so I'm going to go just insert anything okay so we've inserted some data and now you can see that it started ID 4 let's say we wanted to go back and we want to start at ID 1 again now let's just delete that you can use this tab called omit in operations and if you come down you can see auto increment we can change this back to zero if we click on go
