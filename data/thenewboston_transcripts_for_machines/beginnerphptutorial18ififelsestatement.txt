hello this is Alex from PHP academy' de org and in this video for the new Boston we are going to be looking at if statements within PHP now an if statement is a statement that lets us to compare or not compare or evaluate and something whether it's true or false and act on that for example in reallife situations you would say if I did this there would be an outcome or otherwise if I didn't do this there would be another outcome and we can demonstrate this I'm going to show you the syntax first of all and this is just simply if and then we have two brackets where our statement to be evaluated goes inside here here and then we start a curly bracket we come down a few lines and we end a curly bracket then what we do is we basically come in and Pat our statement in here so for now I'm going to say if one now true so the way this reads is if one echo true now one by itself is a statement within programming in general that will evaluate to true it's a it's there it's one equals one it's one is no other there's no comparison it just equals true otherwise we equal or we echo sorry folks okay so we're basically saying if one on its own if this is true we execute this block here this is called a block otherwise by using the else keyword execute this block here what's highlighted in blue at the moment is a block so this is how we write it out you might see it sometimes written like this this is a lot of an easier way to read it and if you're new to programming it doesn't matter how you write it but generally I write like this so this block here will be executed if one is true which it is and it always is and otherwise this block here will be executed so let's just run this in our browser and see what happens we have been displayed with the text true because this is true now what about if 0 now you can probably guess that 0 is an automatic false one is true and 0 is false so in this instance putting a 0 in we're evaluating 0 is 0 true or false it's false so we should be displayed with the text false the same as if we were to write true this would equal true and if we were to type in false this is equal to false now this is pretty boring we want to start making some comparisons inside so I'm just going to use an example of one of the comparison operators which is double equals and this means is equal to and it looks like this and either side of it you're going to do your values to compare so I want to say does 1 equal 1 now this reads as does 1 or is 1 equal to 1 and because 1 is equal to 1 we're going to be executing this block if one wasn't equal to 1 we'd be executing this block so let's just run that and that's true now I'm going to change this to does 1 it is 1 equal to 2 and obviously that is false so you can see how this block here this is called an if else statement because we're using the keywords if and we're using the keywords else you can have an if statement just on its own if if it doesn't happen to equal true we just in this case not going to output anything because there's no else to tell us what to do otherwise so now let's just return back to that now what we can do is we can start saying things like if and we can have a variable up here that's what it will say text equals let's say something so if text equals something echo true in this case we will be echoing out true to the screen because it is true otherwise echo false so now what I can do is change this to let's say something else it doesn't equal that so we're going to be displayed with false so that is the basic structure and the use of an if statement we have this is basically called an ifelse statement so we've got ifelse and depending on whether this statement here is evaluated to true or false we echo out the corresponding block
