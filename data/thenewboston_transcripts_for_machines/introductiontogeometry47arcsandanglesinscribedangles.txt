so staying with the topic of arcs and angles we're going to talk about a special kind of angle called an inscribed angle an inscribed angle has its vertex on the circle so this angles vertex is p and it's on the circle and its sides form chords of the circle so its other points have to form chords of the circle which this does so angle v p e intercepts v e this arc right here such that the measure of this angle is half the measure of this arc so if we know that the measure of angle vpe is 40 degrees the length of arc v e has to equal 80 degrees because this is twice the length of this or this is one half the length of this so now we're going to do an example so we know we have these three angles which form a triangle each one of these angles is an inscribed angle because its vertex is on the circle and its sides form chords of the circle so first they want the measure of arc j b j b okay so j b is captured by the angle g so that means that this angle is half the length of jb so 65 is equal to half the length we're just going to call this arc x so we're going to multiply both sides by 2 to find what x equals and x equals 130 degrees so the length that is 130 degrees now they want the measure of arc gb so gb is captured by this angle j so that means that this length we're going to call it y is twice the size of j or j which is 53 is equal to half the length of this which is y so you could set it up that way or you could say that or you could say that y is equal to times the measure of this angle which is 53 either way you have to multiply by 2 and you'll get 106 for the measure of y so gb has a measure of 106 degrees now finally they want the measure of g j g so j g is captured by this angle x but we don't know the measure of angle x so we're going to use our rules of in the interior angles of a triangle to solve for x so we know that the measures of it of the angles of on the inside of a triangle has to be 180 so we're going to take 53 plus sixtyfive plus x and set it equal to a hundred and eighty if you add these two up you get a hundred and eighteen is e plus plus x is equal to a hundred and eighty if you subtract 118 over you'll get x is equal to 62 degrees so now that we've finished that we're done for the day but make sure you come back and watch the next video where we talk is about arcs and chords and their relationship to one another
