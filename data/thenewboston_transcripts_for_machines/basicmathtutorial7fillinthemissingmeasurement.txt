all right here we have fill in the missing measurement over here you see that the perimeter is given for each shape notice that these two are rectangular and this one is a square I notice how on the rectangles there is one side that is given that is because they're going to be an infinite amount of numbers that can equal 22 for both sides to be different so you know that 8 on this side it has to be 8 on this side so we can go right ahead and fill that in if I can get a color go right ahead and fill that in 8 and if that's 9 that side has to be 9 so the way we're going to go about this is that we're going to add eight and eight together so 8 plus 8 equals 16 and that is one half of the perimeter so 22 minus 16 carry over the one is six and zero so you have six left so there's two sides left that you need to do so you divide this by 2 to find the opposite sides so 3 plus 3 equals 6 so those are the missing sides over here we have a perimeter of 28 so what number times 4 in equals 28 we can try guess and check we can try 6 plus 6 plus 6 plus 6 6 + 6 is 12 6 + 6 is 12 2 + 2 equals 4 1 1 is 224 not quite not quite 28 so let's go to 7 7 + 7 + 7 + 7 7 7 7 is 14 7 7 is 14 four and four is eight 1 + 1 is 2 28 then and since this is a square all sides are the same so the missing measurement is 7 so for here we have 28 as again but since this side has 9 and 9 it cannot be 7 so 9 plus 9 is 18 so 20 minus 18 is 10 so 10 divided by 2 that is two numbers or one number added itself so four and four or five and five or six and six you could have two equal to ten so we can try 4 + 4 equals 8 not quite 5 + 5 equals 10 bingo so know the missing side is 5 and that's how you find the missing measurement
