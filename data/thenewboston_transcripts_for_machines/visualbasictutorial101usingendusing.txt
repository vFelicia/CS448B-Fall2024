hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be taking another look at I dispose Abel and specifically we're gonna be learning about the using keyword now you learned in the last tutorial that you can create objects and dispose of them once you're finished with them by implementing I disposable inside of your class now what you can also do is use the using keyword so that the program will automatically dispose of that object once it's done doing what it needs to do so to create a little example of this let's go ahead and go and to do stuff and add a couple more subs so public sub let's see show more messages and we'll just type message box this is a message and we can go ahead and copy that a couple more times okay so now we'll come back into form one dot V B and we will delete all this code that we have right here and what we can do instead of creating a new object by using the dim keyword we can go ahead and type using and see that the description says a using block does three things it creates and initializes variables in the resource list it runs the code in the block and it disposes of the variables before exiting so it pretty much just does what it needs to do and then get rid of everything after it's done so let's go ahead and set a name for the object of do stuff that we want so let's just call this one my do stuff as and then we're gonna use the new keyword so we actually create an object in the using block so as new do stuff and now I'm going to do is we're gonna hit enter and you can see that adds the end using for us so we can type my do stuff dot show message and then we can go ahead and run this and you can see that one click show message it says this is a message and then once we click OK it'll tell you know the compiler will know or your program will know that it is done using my do stuff and it will get rid of it so we can also add more code in here so I do stuff dot so more messages so let's go ahead and run this and you see that once it's done showing more messages and then showing a message it's gonna go ahead and get rid of our object for us so we can Excel message it'll say this is a message and then this should be the last one and click OK and it gets rid of our object for us but if you notice that if we try to access access my do stuff outside of our using block we're gonna get an error now this is an example of scope and what scope is is if you remember from one of the previous tutorials is that wherever you define your variable that's the only place it can be used so if I define a variable inside here as string if I try to access that outside of this sub right here I'm gonna get an error because it is only allowed to be used inside of this sub right here and the same applies for the using block whatever you are using right here can only be accessed inside of the using block and then once it's done with it it gets rid of it and you cannot access it anymore so go ahead you can practice using the using keyword you can even maybe go back to some of the previous programs that we've made and find some places that you can sort of put that in there to make the code a little bit more efficient and then once you do that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and we will be learning more about eye disposable so thanks for watching
