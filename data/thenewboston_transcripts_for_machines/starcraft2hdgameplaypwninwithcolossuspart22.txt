what's going on guys welcome back to your second part of my Starcraft 2 gameplay video and right off the bat you can see that flying pan which was a Zerg player on our team has either been like booted or just decided to leave go get some coffee or something but anyways the worst possible timing cuz he is about to go in for a massive attack and now you can see that the AR other Army has scouted him saw that big yellow wave just rushing toward their uh teammates building so looks like they're not going to be able to get there in time bunch of Bings busting through that wall zerglings rushing in but you see that dark Templar our enemy's dark Templar just slicing through them looks like those zerong are going to be able to pick off a bunch of those Marines and also yeah there looks like he's going to be able to pick off that dark Templar and now Dom coming in trying to take out that Templar building but I don't know if he's going to be quite able to pick it off oh that would have been great if he was but he isn't there's just too many stalkers too many marines and also Marauders uh those voides in those zerglings really had no chance there but they did do a lot of damage did look like they busted up one of their Supply Depot in their Barracks so overall I'll would say that was quite the success so anyways now that their teammates are done being defended they're going to go back to their own base uh get ready for a push or maybe just go back for some defense but anyways here is me and the person that I'm going to be pushing out with jester he got a nice mix of Marines and Marauders and also looked like he had a medac and some Ravens or something I see one Raven metac and pretty much a nice mix of Marines and Marauders and I am have two Colossus right now some stalkers and Immortals so we are looking good we're going to be moving in soon but uh I just want to get everything queued up make sure I don't waste any resources right now pump out some more Colossus and I'll tell you why since they have a bunch of level one units whenever we go in they're usually going to be a clump together like you see they are right there so those Colossus now that they have that area attack is going to be really useful in picking all of them off in one fell sweep so those stalkers are also in trouble now that I have Immortals since Immortals pretty much are the best thing that you can have against stalkers so we are looking pretty good right now even though we lost those zerglings and a couple voies earlier on and now here's a sign to my teammate you want to push out and he says yes of course he wants to see some action so we are going to be uh ready soon making sure that my expansion has enough robes queued up to keep them busy for a while so let me group this Colossus and now you're about to see probably the biggest battle of the game so there is their forces ready to be destroyed and here's our forces moving in uh seeing what they got and now here is coming off of the ramp not the best idea probably want to stay on higher ground but anyways you you see my cles slicing through all them they are all grouped together which is just terrible for them you don't want to be grouped together whenever you face Colossus and now the the second wave comes in of the dark blue team and now again all grouped together just Marines Marauders those Colossus and morles are just destroying them and they really never even had a chance so there you go in about 10 seconds all of their armies just got wiped out just like that and you see that all of our armies are still very much attacked and now it's pretty much just destroy buildings they do however have some of those Siege things which are not that great against Immortals since um Immortals can't take any more than 10 damage usually but those Colossus are just they just our army is just the sheer size of it is too much for any Siege thing to handle so as you can see it's now pretty much destroy buildings and check this out while we were doing all that Dom was building a massive amount of void Ray so he's ready to go in and we're just keeping these people busy and slicing through all of their slide Depot slide Depot what the heck is a slide Depot so Supply Depot refineries pretty much taking out this entire base while Dom moves into top base with all his voas and now you see he built up a bunch of zerglings and banelings as well so he probably wants to move those in first to take out any of the uh ground units that might be harmful to void so let's see if Dom does that and oh my look at this they have five gateways two Stargates this guy had quite the base but it's about to get all wiped out right now so let's go ahead and see Doms is waiting there um maybe he's waiting for some more void Ray or waiting for a Zergling push but um looks like dark blue is trying to fly their Command Center over but oh it is not going to be enough uh let's see those bailing just going up the blow up all those TI One units in those buildings and those zerglings are just going to pick off pretty much all the ground forces right there in those buildings and Dom should move in his roider is from behind right now try to pick off that Nexus and here he comes as you can see these probes those probes never even stood a chance this Nexus is going to get destroyed those void rays are going to be all charged up and uh let's take a look at these voids as you see you got some Helens which can't even attack air and those stalkers but and he got one Thor which is good for him but these voides are fully charged and there's about 8,000 of them look how quick this uh Thor is going to disappear yeah in about 3 seconds so that uh just discourages them and as you can see they all leave the game they are depressed they're probably going to go up uh I don't even want to say but they're probably going to go cry themselves to sleep tonight so there you have it there is my first Starcraft thanks to Domin his avoid race and also my teammate with his massive Marauder so anyways there you guys have it I know I made a bunch of mistakes so if you guys can see anything that I can improve on please let me know and I'll try to improve and I'll try to also be posting more of those videos in future so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys later
