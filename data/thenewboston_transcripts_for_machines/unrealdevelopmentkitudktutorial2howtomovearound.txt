what is going on guys welcome to your second UDK tutorial and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about navigation how to move around our 3d world so before our unit started with that I want to mention this whenever you first open the UDK your computer screen may or may not look like my computer screen right now if it looks like this and you have one big window right here fine leave it like that but if your computer screen looks like this and you have four big boxes on your screen and this one is you know minimize to the bottom left we want to change that so for the sake of this tutorial I'm just going to teaching you guys how to maximize this view right here I'm not going to be talking about what all these menus and buttons mean I'm going to be covering all these buttons in the upcoming tutorials but for now for the sake of this story I'll just follow along with what I tell you to do in the top right corner you're going to see this little square right here go ahead and click that and by the way if you guys are just itching to know these big boxes right here are called viewports they're basically different views or different angles from which you can view your object so you know I know you guys are probably itching to know what those big boxes were so we're going to be working in this one right here so go ahead and click this button right here and this is going to maximize this view it's exactly like maximizing a window if you you know use windows so now that we have this view maximized we can begin learning how to navigate around our viewport so before I even get started with that you're going to mention you're going to see one thing first of all this view is pretty boring it's just a red cube and you know a bunch of black in blue lines not very exciting so let's go ahead and get something more exciting to work with now whenever you download it and install the UDK it came with a bunch of maps now these are maps that we didn't build these are maps that whoever made the UDK they build them so let's go ahead and use a map and then we can you know learn navigation in that instead of this huge black world with blue lines and you know a red box it's a lot more exciting so in order to open a map go ahead and go to file open and by default it's going to give you the list maps that come with the UDK it doesn't really matter what map you choose and you might not even have this map because depending on what version of the UDK you downloaded you may have different Maps but go ahead and open any map my favorite map is V CTF and necropolis so I'm going to go ahead and hit open to open that and as you can see we get this new coollooking map a lot better than you know that black world so again like I said I'm not going to be covering what any of these buttons do in this tutorial but I want you to click this one button right here with the G on it this means game mode so before you click that you probably notice that this mode right here has a bunch of lines in it and has a bunch of lights and this is kind of the designer view we don't need the designer view for the sake of this tutorial we're just learning how to move around so go ahead and hit this G button and as you can see we have now entered game mode this is what someone would see if they were playing the game so now that we have our view maximized in wearing game mode we can begin learning what I will finally want to teach you guys in this tutorial and that's a navigation how to move around the school map how to move around the 3d world so the first thing I want to teach you guys is the left mouse button what happens when you hold it what happens when you drag it go ahead and click your left mouse button and drag it up and drag it down and drag it to the left and drag it to the right as you can see what the left mouse button does whenever you click it and drag it it allows you to move around kind of in a flat plane kind of like if you're walking or driving the car or it basically allows you to move left right forward and back so that's what the left mouse button does whenever you hold it so now let's go ahead and venture over to the right mouse button whenever you hold down the right mouse button and start moving around with your mouse it's basically like this if you are standing in one place and your feet were glued to the ground and you're holding a camera you could turn that camera in any direction you just couldn't move you can't move forward backward you can't move left right up and down you can only stay in one place so it's basically like staying in one place and turning your head so again the left mouse button allows you to move forward back left and right and the right mouse button allows you to change the angle of the camera just like that so you're saying re that's nice and all but that leaves us with a couple things first of all how do I move up and down well I use my left mouse button in rice right mouse button I'm kind of running out of buttons here in order to move up and down what you need to do is you need to hold the left mouse button and the right mouse button at the exact same time and scroll up and scroll down so that's how you move up and down you hold the left and right mouse button at the exact same time and check it out we are now moving up and down so again left and right at the same time allow us to move up and down and if we move right and left we kind of pan left and right so what I think of whenever I'm using this mode is if my face is pressed against a glass window I can't go forward or backward I can only press it and I can move my head up down left and right I can't go through the glass or anything so that's kind of what I envision whenever I'm using this mode so with that being said that takes care of all the mouse buttons basically your left mouse button goes forward backward and turns left and right so it basically allows us to go anywhere on a flat plane the right mouse button allows us to change the angle both mouse buttons at the same time allow us to move up and down and also pan left and right so with those mouse buttons in those combination buttons we could basically move anywhere we want to move however if you guys have ever played the game Unreal Tournament or maybe you played let me think what other game world warcraft uses us to you may prefer an alternative style of navigation you may be familiar with the WASD navigation now this navigation allows you to use the WASD keys on your keyboard to move around but before you start clicking those keys remember this one thing anytime you want to use the WASD navigation you need to have your right mouse button held in and now let me go ahead and hold w we move forward if we hold s we move backward if we hold a move to the left and if we hold D we move to the right and again like I said this is all with my right mouse button held down right now I have my finger on my right mouse button I know you guys can't see it but trust me it's there so if you prefer this style of navigation is kind of like flying around or you know oh yeah that's it just flying around you can do that so again don't forget the whole direct mouse button on your mouse so with that being said you're saying all right what happens if I don't hold the right mouse button well let's go ahead and click W right now without holding the right mouse button check out what happens everything disappears so before you freak out and think that you messed up your graphics card in your computer or you know your computer's freaking out or something W is actually a hotkey for something called hide static meshes in it basically means hide 3d models that's all I'm going to tell you for net right now but just remember this w is a hotkey and it means something totally different in the UDK so make sure whenever you accidentally click W using this style navigation don't freak out it just means that you know you forgot to hold the right mouse button so again to recap one last time in order to move around our 3d world we can use the mouse buttons the left Mouse one goes forward and back left and right the right mouse button allows us to change the angle holding on both at the same time allows us to move up and down and pan left and right and if we hold the right mouse button we can use WASD to move around our 3d world just a different style of navigation so there you go there you have it that's all I'm going to cover with navigation there's a couple other tricks with navigation but I'm going to save those when we get into you know more advanced modeling so for now those are the basics that's how you move around so thank you guys for watching again go and practice that's the only way you can perfect this it's going to take some getting used to but trust me you'll get the hang of it so thank you guys for watching and don't forget subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
