alright guys welcome back to your 18th tutorial shh shh close your eyes everyone close your eyes and imagine that you're making a computer program and imagine that you're making a computer program where the user has to enter a name of a girl like Taylor or Natalie or Ashley or Rebecca and depending on what name they answer it gives them a custom response like who you love Natalie or Ashley likes you or something like that so let's go ahead and try to make this well the first thing we need is a variable named we'll just name it girl and we'll set it equal to said Natalie since natalie portman is my dream girl and now in order to make this program you might be thinking this with the tools we have so far we'll just go ahead and write if girl is equal to Natalie and then we can go ahead and do our thing and then light later we can write if girl is equal to Emily if girl is equal to Hannah if girl is equal to Reese and we can go ahead and list all the girls that they could enter and do it that way but a lot of if statements get kind of messy so there is a easier way to make kind of this same program type instead of using a bunch of if statements you can use a something called a switch statement a switch statement takes a one variable which is the girl in this case and it tests them for all the possible scenarios and it's you know it's basically the same as writing a bunch of statements but it's just a much more organized way so let's go ahead and let me show you the syntax for this is actually switch just like that and right after you write the name of the variable you only write the name of the variable nothing else you don't set it equal to anything just that now go ahead and make a body and give you some space and now for each case scenario we're gonna call it a case now for the first case you give it the value of what it can be equal to for example in the case of Natalie and go ahead and add a colon not a semicolon just go ahead and add a colon and now you write something like this if girl is equal to Natalie then go ahead and write whatever you want to do document.write you must like Garden State because that's my favorite movie when Natalie Portman believe it or not and then after every after you're done executing the code you go ahead and write the word break and I'll tell you why later so now we already have a case scenario for Natalie and this is basically the syntax of what we're gonna do for all the case scenarios so let's go ahead and copy that copy paste in the case of actually since I like Ashley green to be like ooh fan of Twila a day with a question mark and we keep doing that for each girl so I'm only gonna do two girls now but if you did a hundred a thousand a million it's gonna be the same syntax you write your switch in the variable that you want to test and in the body write case with a colon the code with a semicolon and break at the end now I guess I can do this the reason that you have break is this say you have a list of like 50 girls well it's going to test this one and then it's going to test this one and then it's going to text the next 48 and test them all until it gets to the answer well check this out since our girl is equal to Natalie right now what break means is this as soon as I get to this and I find an answer or find a value that that variable equals then there's no need to test the rest of these so I'm just going to break out of it right now and go to write to the end so if you have like Natalie Ashley Britney Emily as soon as it gets to Natalie it's gonna say alright I found my match I'm gonna break if you didn't have that break it's gonna go continue testing the rest of your stuff and it's just going to cause a mess why would you want to make your computer test the rest of your answers when you already found your answer it doesn't make sense so that's what that little break word means so you're saying all right let's go ahead and run this by default and see what we like you must like Garden State all right so as predicted this program worked perfectly but what if we have a name like Emily and we go ahead and save this and run and see what happens well nothing runs because we only had a choice for Natalie and Ashley well there are a lot of names that people can enter that probably aren't going to be in this list and probably you know names that are oneofakind no one ever heard of so if you want to give your switch a default statement that says all right I'm gonna first go through my list of all my options and if I can't find a match then I'm just gonna give you a default answer so in order to give a default answer here's what you do de fa you ot and notice that we don't write anything in here because there is no like answer or value for default it's the default it's basically if you got to this and it didn't work in this it didn't work and then I'm gonna go here it's default so if all of your pretty much your cases don't match then this is what you get so by default just go ahead and write something like umm yeah I'm definitely copying this default right something like this is the default so check it out in another thing you don't need a break at the end of your default since it's the last choice so remember I said a break is pretty much to save you time saying RA once you found your answer then just break out of it and go continue with the next thing don't go through all the rest of the cases well you can add a break the end a default but it would be worth in a sense what if you get to the default you are ready at the end and you already ran out of all your cases so what's the break out of it's not skipping over anything it's not going to help you any to break out of it now you're already at the end so anyways that's why you don't need one so let's go ahead and test this variable Emily right now we have the variable Emily so what's going to happen is this Java scripts gonna say alright does Emily equal Nathalie nope does Emily equal Ashley nope so I guess I'm just going to give you the default this is your default statement so go ahead and save this and as you can see this is default so now let's go ahead and give it like Ashley just like that and now go ahead and save it and it's gonna say all right does Natalie equal Ashley you know does Ashley equal actually well indeed it does so I'm gonna go ahead and print out this just like he told me and then I'm gonna go ahead go go go ahead and then I'm gonna go ahead and break so no need to even worry about this at all so let's go ahead and save it and check it out Fanta Twila day Ashley green not bad so that's the basics of a switch statement and how you can use a switch statement to save you from writing a whole bunch of ifs and this is actually a whole lot easier to maintain and you know you can just look through your code and you know it's just a whole lot easier whenever we build programs that actually do something other than you know me talking about the girls I have a crush on that's what it does so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see in the next video oh and natalie portman if you're watching call me
