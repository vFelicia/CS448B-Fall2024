so let's have a look down make sure everything there's okay yep let's just have another try of refreshing the page oh I think it actually did work yeah okay I think there was just a slight delay in loading the data in so I think yeah it did work so you can see now we've just retrieved this value and what's more important you've obviously noticed that by clicking submit the page hasn't refreshed itself at all so click Submit the page doesn't refresh yourself it just loads in the contents of the contents of including PHP okay so now what happens if we want to make this load function a bit more dynamic so for example I will might want to load in a specific file into a specific div so I need to specify some arguments in my load function so the first one I might want to specify is the div that I want to load the data into so this in this case it would be a div and then the second parameter or argument I want to give it is the file that I want to load into this div so that might be including dot PHP now this function would be a lot better because it means you could reuse it over and over again and it would be really really useful if you had a page where you wanted to insert some dynamic data into many different divs and wanted to do this using lots of different buttons or in actual fact when the mouse was moved or something like that so we are going to use this to our advantage and create a fully rounded function that's going to allow us to do this so we want to load into a diff this is the first argument and in and load this file into a div which is the second argument so let's go ahead and make the change first of all in this load part of the function if you're used to functions then this will be pretty straightforward but I'm going to go through it anyway just so we know what we're doing so the first one is the div and the second one is the file okay so we've got the div which we're loading it into and the file so all we need to now do is go down and make the changes so the div here is specified as a div but we want this to be dynamic depending on what we pass through this function so this is just going to be the div now let's go down this again needs this this file here needs to be dynamic so this is the file so it's really as simple as that now what we've done is we've created ourselves a dynamic function that's going to load any file into any div so let's go ahead and change the name of this div so another div for example we've just changed the name of it to demonstrate the use of this function so now let's change this to another div and we'll keep the include file as it is but we'll change the content so hello everyone okay so let's go ahead and come onto our page when we click Submit what this is going to do let's just go to our page source om chap translating it to English all right let's go to page source and go down so it's a loading into another day of and it's loading this file here into another div so let's go ahead and click Submit and you can see that hello every one has been loaded into the div another div let's go down and have a look there and we've got div ID equals another div now because of the nature of Ajax and the way it works you can see at the moment that there's nothing contained within this div even though in here we have the text hello everyone so there's no need to worry about this if you're looking at a source file thinking oh nothing's in there it won't actually modify the HTML because it's a synchronous and it does it without refreshing the page we're not going to be updating the HTML code as well so you won't find your text that you are putting into your div actually within your dear it's just going to be done on the page itself to the people that are viewing it so it's not actually going to be put into here so what we've done in this tutorial is we've looked at creating a function that loads in two arguments and this is on the click of a button but this could be on any HTML state so it could be when you start typing in a text field so we're going to look at tutorials later on that deal with more complex PHP that is going to put values onto our page depending on what we type or when we move the mouse etc etc so we've gone through and we've checked for certain things set this HTML XML HTTP variable we've checked for the state change and upon the state change we've modified the contents of the div and then here what we've done is we've specified the file that we want to open and we've used this send to send the data so that's basically simply opening a file using Ajax this is pure Ajax so we're not using anything like jQuery here and jQuery is easier however I do recommend you do learn this and learn how to do this because it's going to be really useful later on when you want to write in pure JavaScript and use Ajax as it should be as its as its intended to be so that's it for including a file using Ajax without refreshing the page
