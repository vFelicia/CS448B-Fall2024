already houses welcome back and in this video what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through each one of these directories and files and I'm going to give you guys a real brief overview of what they are in exactly what it does and then by the end of this video we're going to have a really solid understanding of what all the different pieces of angular 2 application are why they are important and just help us understand the basic overview of a simple application however before we get to that I want to mention one thing that may cause some confusion later on and that's this of course we're going to be working with angular 2 making cool web applications so of course we're going to be writing some HTML CSS and JavaScript however we're not going to be writing plain old boring JavaScript like you may be used to we are actually going to be writing a version of it called typescript so if you guys are like wait a minute you're telling me that all of my knowledge of JavaScript is just going to go out the window and I have to remember this whole new language just to work with angular 2 no it's only a little bit different than JavaScript however it does come with some really cool features that make it incredibly easy to write angular applications so as long as you guys are familiar with JavaScript or any programming language really you guys are going to be able to follow along really easy and as you follow along with these videos if there's ever anything different between typescript and normal JavaScript I'm going to point it out again it's going to be a piece of cake so don't worry so I say this because your browser and actually every browser in the world it doesn't understand typescript natively so your browser can only understand JavaScript so every time we write typescript what needs to happen is before we make our application life before we actually run it in a browser this typescript code needs to get converted to JavaScript so again we're going to be writing typescript we have to convert it to JavaScript and then this final JavaScript gets ran in the browser now usually people use programs like this one online they're actually called transpiler they're pretty much just translators but the way I set up our project and we're going to see in just a bit is I took care of this for you behind the scenes so we just need to worry about writing typescript and we can just write it normally in behind the scenes we're going to see that it actually gets converted to JavaScript and we really don't have to worry about it but I just mentioned this because we're going to have two folders and these files are going to be generated automatically and if you guys are like what the heck where did that come from that's kind of what's happening so again one last time we're going to be writing typescript behind the scenes the way I set it up is that automatically converts it all to JavaScript and the JavaScript files are what your browser is actually going to use so now that I said that we can hop back to our project and start going through all of these directories so this first one right here I'll just start from the top and work my way down about hop around a bit who knows but this app directory this is our main application that's what it stands for directory so 95 percent of time we're going to be working right in here in this file called TS so again this file is our type script file this is the code that we're going to be writing and behind the scenes there's actually a tool running that converts it to JavaScript so again never actually edit any of the files in here never mess with anything inside this directory these files get generated automatically so we can actually see we have a file called main TS which is may not typescript we actually look at it right now and it gets converted to this file main javascript and there's another file called epic component typescript that's what we're going to be writing it gets converted to epic component javascript alright simple enough but wait a minute what are these other files in here I mean we pretty much have a type script file it gets converted to JavaScript so what the heck are these map files well these map files are just extra files that basically help you debug your code so check this out we're going to be writing typescript it gets converted it's JavaScript that the browser is going to run so if there's ever error in here it's going to say um there's actually an error with line number 13 so we're going to look at our code we're gonna buy um yeah actually rewrote typescript and there isn't a line number 13 so uh can you help me out that's what those Matt files do so they basically help you debug so instead of telling you the error with a plain JavaScript file which is worthless to us we can map it back and it can say oh actually there is error with line number 4 or whatever alright moving on let me close these and minimize this alright so we already know what this directory is right here again never actually go in here and edit any of this code this is just all the modules that were downloaded by that npm tool so again don't even touch anything in here ever and this next one right here these typing's typing's are basically whenever we use new libraries normal JavaScript doesn't understand some of the syntax that we use by default so we use these Taipings file to pretty much say hey these definitions defined the new rules in that way our compiler or transpiler can convert other new JavaScript stuff to plain old JavaScript again inside here never even touch it but uh you know I just wanted to explain what it was real quick this get ignore file if you are unfamiliar with it then this is basically saying all right what files do you want to ignore whenever you you know are working with your repo so most of this code whenever I put it online for you guys of course I want you guys to have but some files like this like this is the settings file for my IDE and it says hey ignore the settings the people really don't care what font size or colors I use so again the non important files you can declare right there um index.html this is course the main index or home page for your website package Jason I'm sure you guys already know what this is basically um it's basic info about your project and also information about what libraries and dependencies that your project needs and again whenever you run npm install it actually looks through here and installs all of this and sticks it in your node modules pretty cool this readme MD this actually has nothing to do with angular this is just for whenever you go to the repo on github that I told you guys to go to in the first tutorial and you see the instructions at the bottom that's what this is so you can like I said delete it if you want all right so this TS config jason closed out of this one so these are pretty much details about how we want to convert typescript to javascript so a lot of these you just keep the default of but here i'll talk to you guys through one of these so you can kind of see what's going on so this out directory says alright whenever we are finished converting all this typescript to JavaScript where do you want me to put those final files and we just said well have out in the folder called app /j s so it looks the app makes a folder called j/s and puts all your final files right there if you didn't have this then what it would do is it would actually just put all of your JavaScript files in the same directory and then we would have all of our typescript files and JavaScript files mixed together so again just a bunch of basic information about how you want to translate typescript to JavaScript and this last follow right here typings jason this is of course what I was talking about earlier whenever we use new libraries then we need the rules on how plain old JavaScript is supposed to understand that new syntax so again we can define these rules so the compiler can translate that properly and this works hand in hand with this directory right here so there you go that's the basic overview of it but again like I said most of this stuff is just behind the scenes crap ninetyfive percent of time we're be working in here app /type script and making a whole bunch of type script files to make everything work and look beautiful so that's what we had to look forward to now that we got all the boring crap out of the way we can start getting into the fun stuff actually creating things so thank you guys for watching I'll see you guys next time
