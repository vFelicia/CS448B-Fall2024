hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be working more on the car program now I've got a lot lined up for this tutorial and it will probably end up be uh being split into more than one part for this one tutorial uh so I might switch back and forth between different points that I want to talk about so if you remember um the only type of car we've been working with is the car we have not been using sports cars or trucks um with new car or the name or the color or the doors uh Etc so what we want to do is be able to add trucks and sports cars to our um to our list right here and access the attributes of them so let's go over here to form one and now I showed you a way of using selected car uh to get the selected uh car that's at the index well now what we can do is instead of having that being limited to only being a car we can come down here to button set name and we can get the item uh at the index of the cars array list so we'll just type cars and then we'll do list cars. selected index so what this is going to do is it's going to get the car name of the car at the selected index of where they selected it so this can be a sports car or a truck or just a normal car and it will get the car name value of that so let's just go ahead and change some of these values so we'll type um cars and then that index of list cars. selected index now we could go through and um manually change each one of these but there's an easier way to do this we can just go ahead and press crlf and it will bring up the find and replace menu so what do we want to find we want to find selected car so you can see that it went ahead and found the next one for us we can go ahead and replace this with cars at index of list cars. selected length not length why did I say selected index so let's just go ahead and get this out of here and we'll replace all or we'll just go ahead and replace this one right here ah quit dropping in there so we'll replace replace and let's make this a little bit smaller we'll just keep replacing until we get back up up to the um first selected car which is right there okay so now that we've replaced all of these inside of our uh button event handlers let's go ahead and test it out and see if it works so we'll minimize these just to organize the code a little better and we'll run this so we'll select Mustang GT we'll set the name of it and you can see we get old name Mustang GT we can just name it the on live gamer GT click okay and it's going to update it for us so that way we can use objects of type other than selected cars so now what we can do is we can allow the user to build a different kind of car in their new car uh form right here so we can have them make a truck or a car or a sports car so to do this let's go ahead and come over to form 1.vob box right here now this isn't the best looking program but you guys can change it around uh to whatever you want to make it look a little bit better so here's our combo box and we want to go ahead and go to the collections in the property or the items so we'll add car truck and sports car and so now if we click okay the user has the option to choose either a car truck or sports car when they create a new car so just like that now let's go ahead and come over here to our new car. VB and what we're going to do is we are going to create a public variable called called vehicle type as uh let's say string so whenever the user selects something from the combo box and clicks new car we're going to get what they selected and use it in our new car form so instead of saying name of car it'll it might say name of truck or name of sports car so we'll come back over here to for.vp and whenever they click button create car it's going to call the create car method that we have so what we need to do is we need to come down here we have our add new car form it's a new car form and we show the dialogue so now what we need to do is use an if statement so if and we need to come back in here and rename our combo box to something uh that is easy to remember so we'll do combo card types go back to the code so if combo car types um dot selected index is equal to let's say zero which is car or at least I think it is yeah we got car truck and then sports car so if the index is zero then what do we want to do we want to run everything that is in here so we'll just come down here and then type end if once again so if the selected index is equal to zero we want to uh have it show the new car uh form and it's going to create a new car object but we want to go ahead and set the um the string from new car that is our vehicle type so we want to set um add new car we want to set the um vehicle type to the type that they have selected so we're going to go ahead and copy this so if it's equal to zero then we want to go ahead and set the appropriate values so add new car. vehicle type equals combo car types do selected and let's see is it item oh yeah let's do selected item that should give us sorry about that alarm but that should give us the text that is inside of the combo box so whatever the vehicle type is it's going to send that back to our new car object that we've created
