all right guys welcome back to your 70th tutorial and this tutorial really isn't a tutorial at all we're just going to be running the program that we built in the last two tutorials and I actually did check for errors in the last video and this program is built perfectly who would have guessed and so it's ready to run so let me go ahead and press this build and run and it show you guys how it works so the very first thing it does is pop up a menu and it gives us a choice press one to print out plain items two for helpful items press three to print out harmful items and whenever you want to creit the program press four so let's go ahead and print out one and this is going to print out the items that have no effect on our character so press one go ahead and hit enter and it's going to print out chair a shoe and a pencil all with Zero Effect on our character so now let's go ahead and let's skip down to you know three or something hit three enter and it's going to print out ninja meth and a dirty needle so now let's go ahead and print uh two and whenever we hit two to print out the helpful items it's going to print out fruit candy and soda and now let's go ahead and press four to quit the program and our program is going to end with execution time of 49 seconds how awesome is that so one thing that I want to do because it's just going to annoy me is I want to add a new line right there and right there so now whenever you run the program it's going to you know it just makes everything not bunched up into one line so if you go ahead and hit two you can see that you know it makes it a little bit better so again there's a lot of different formatting things that we can do but you know I just want to make sure it wasn't bunched together so two prints out all the helpful items um if I go ahead and you know hit three it'll print out all the harmful items yada yada yada so basically I want to just show you guys that this program does indeed work I wasn't bsing you and uh this is how you can build a program that works awesomely with a file in this case the object file or the objects. text file so let me guys let me talk you through how this program works one last time the very first thing I want to mention is whenever you're building a program that takes a bunch of different functions make sure to prototype your functions first and foremost if you don't prototype your functions like this and try to run it you're going to get an error message because it's going to come across this function and it's not going to understand what it means so that's why you need to prototype your function so once you have your functions prototype let me run this get that error message out of the way now that you have your function prototype I'll tell you guys how this program works the very first thing we wanted to do was display a menu to the user and we wanted them to enter a number 1 2 3 or 4 depending on their menu choice so what we did is we built a function to display that menu named get what they want and we took whatever they entered and we stored it in variable called choice and what this did function did is it returned that variable choice so it basically stored that uh number either 1 2 3 or 4 in the variable what they want because this number tells us what they want so after that we took that number and we first made sure it wasn't equal to four because remember four means they want to quit the program so whenever they entered four this wall Loop ended in the program quit so what this Wallop did is said all right if they enter any number besides four go ahead and run this code right here because that means that they want something if they enter one it means they want plain items two helpful items three harmful items so I said all right test this variable if they entered one two or three if they entered one called this function in display items with the parameter one if they enter two it means they want helpful items so we're going to call display helpful items and if they enter three we're going to pass in three on this display items function so you're saying all right so the display item function obviously displays the proper items to them so say we passed it the variable two well it calls the display items function with the parameter two it basically Scrolls down here and calls display items now remember display items it just prints out something on the screen it doesn't give us any integers or strings back so we made that void now whenever we passed in one two or three it treated that variable as is X so X was pretty much their choice 1 2 or three so the very first thing that we did in this function is we opened that file because I mean all the crap that we needed was inside this file so we opened that file and then we made two variables we made a name variable to store the name of the object and we made a power variable to store how much power that object had whether it's zero negative or positive we then tested what Cho choice they wanted remember if x which is now the choice is equal to one then it means they want to display the items with no power the plain items whenever they entered the number two it means they wanted to display the helpful items and helpful items just had a power greater than zero so that's why we printed out the objects with a power greater than zero whenever they entered the number three it means they wanted to display the harmful items the it that hurt our character so we're said all right we're going to test this power variable and any object with a power variable that's less than zero go ahead and print it out so that is how our program works and here's what I'm going to ask one of you guys to do um you guys probably want all the source code for this so actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and copy this and post it in my Forum under the C++ section so if you guys want just go ahead and um sign up actually you don't even need to sign up for my Forum but I would prefer you did sign up for my Forum go look in the C++ section and I'll post all the source code here so if you guys you know are getting an error in your program whenever you're working along you can just go ahead and copy my source code and uh it's all there for you guys so thank you guys for watching so much hopefully you understand how this program works if you don't understand then don't flip out all you need to do is go ahead look at the source code and once you see it all together um you guys can understand understand how it's all pieced together so again one last time this is how you build a program that works perfectly with a file just like this and with that being said um I want to say this a lot of well in this tutorial I showed you guys how to have the user you know input a number and print out all the helpful items or harmful items but in whenever you're developing a game instead of just printing it out on the screen you would want you know whenever your user comes across a helpful item to you know make them get that much energy or whenever your character comes across a harmful item have them you know take that much energy away from your character or whenever your character comes across an item like a building or a chair or a shoe it has no effect on the character so aside from printing it out we would do something different in this line of code right here but that's basically um your very first glance at how games in programs work at files in a useful program so I'm glad I could teach this tutorial finally make a program that's useful instead of teaching guys just the Core Concepts I know a lot of you guys were complaining that I was just teaching you the concepts and you guys never really got to see how a program was put together so hopefully here's a nice little uh look at how it works so thank you guys for watching One Last Time uh thank you guys so much for subscribing and I'm excited to move on to the next topic so hopefully we're done working with files at least for now so thank you guys for watching and I'll see you guys in the next video
