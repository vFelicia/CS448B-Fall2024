hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be working on taking in account the spinach multiplier now you may remember I um said something about this in one of the previous tutorials and we're just now getting around to um adding that in um I added the hooking the log to the form one and hiding and showing the log um in between that so now your program should look like this so if you notice if we attack it says poey has used punch for five damage well if we use spinach and attack it says poey has used punch for five damage it doesn't take in account the has spinage multiplier so there is an easy fix for that we can just go ahead and close out of this and what we can do is whenever we create an event let's see here private function create event so if string name equals popey then what do we want to do well we'll declare um damage as an integer and what we're going to do is we're going to use an if statement um we'll set damage equal to nothing so it'll quit crying about that so if hero dot has spinach then what do we want to do damage is going to be equal to and let's say for blank damage so hero. attack damage at index hero. attack num so hero. attack damage so we're accessing this array at the index of attack num which is the randomly generated number and so if he has Spinners then we want to multiply that by two um and so we could put an lse statement right here but instead I just thought of this we can go ahead and set it equal to um hero dot attack damage at the index of hero. attack none so it's going to start off by using the base damage as the variable damage but then if it has spinage it's going to set that equal um to the damage time two so instead of putting all this long code in right here we can just do damage times equals 2 so we'll come down over here and instead of having all of this um array accessing and the index values we can just go ahead and put damage in so for damage. TW string damage so let's go ahead and run this and you can see here that um here is our game loaded up you see the log is stuck to it so let's go ahead and hide the log we can attack you see it takes away 95 so we can assume that he punched um and then the dragon took away 10 damage and so we can show the log um and you can see that it's it goes it'll go ahead and add stuff to the log even if it's not shown because it doesn't actually close out of it it just hides it for the time being so let's go ahead and use a spinach multiplier so we go ahead and click attack says that he has used kicked for kick for 20 damage now the kick um has a base damage of 10 now um let's go ahead and we won't use spinage and you can see it gives us kick for 10 damage because we didn't use the spinach and we can use spinach again see used anchor throw for 30 and then I believe we should be able to use hit one more time looks like it so we can use a spinach and he used kick for 20 damage now you can't see that there sorry but it says anchor throw for 30 and then um Kick for 20 damage and we don't have any spinach left so we can't use that go ahead and click that and you say we get dragon has used claw for eight damage um then we use kick for 10 damage and if we tackle one more time says Popeye has one and you can see that poey has one uh down here and it spawned a another enemy for us so we go ahead and hide that log so go ahead um put this code in if you haven't already and then once you do that um this is actually the final tutorial for the um game now you can keep adding to it if you want um you can add graphics which we're going to be learning about soon um and if you guys have any completed projects you can go ahead and put uh a video response if you want that' be best in the in the uh reply to this video or you can just leave a comment saying that you finished it so if you have any questions leave them in the comments and if not go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
