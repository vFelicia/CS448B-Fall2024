what is up guys welcome to your eighth I think it's your eighth at least who's counting welcome to your eighth JavaScript tutorial and in this tutorial I'm adjusting right now probably should have done that before I started then again I probably should have found out what tutorial I'm doing too but anyways welcome to your eth tutorial in JavaScript and in this tutorial I'm going to be talking about how to use multiple parameters with your function so let's go ahead and make a function right now and I'm going to name mine Apples because I'm kind of in the mood for some applesauce right now and let's go ahead and give it two parameters in order to give it two parameters inside your parentheses instead of just writing the name of one variable you write the name of however many variables you need separated with the comma so if you have two variables you separate them with one comma so I have a variable I have a variable called one and I have a variable called two now inside the body of my function let's go ahead and use both of those variables um document right we'll just go ahead and write something like one is better than and actually need some spaces is better than add two so now you can see that this is where I taught you guys how to add strings to variables this is one instance where it would come in handy and another cool thing that I didn't teach you guys yet but anytime you add a string of a HTML tag or xhtml tag it actually will treat that not as text but actually treat that as the tag itself so whenever it comes across this right here it's actually going to break AKA movie to the next line so that's a neat little trick that you guys might want to remember so anyways we have a function called apples so now let's go ahead and actually call or use this function and in order to call a function you just go ahead and type the function name anywhere in your program and then you write what other information that it needs so this function we already know it needs two pieces of information so let's give it two pieces of in information um I'm going to give it my name is a variable and as the other variable needs I'm going to give it the name of my cousin Hobart so let's go ahead and save this and refresh and see what we get Bucky is better than Hobart so what it did is it said all right we have this function that takes two pieces of information so whenever we're running our program and we said that we want to use this information it's going to say all right what variable are you going to use as number one okay Bucky got it now what variable are you going to use is the variable two Hobart got it check so Bucky is better than Hobart makes sense you gave us both the pieces of information we need we're good to go so we can also call this function multiple times and it you know runs the same exact way so um let me think of sa B Counting Crows is better than I don't know Bieber and let's go ahead and write like uh strawberry is better than coconut by the way guys nice little piece of information I absolutely hate coconuts I can't stand the smell of it I can't stand the sight of it I can't even wash my hair with coconut shampoo it makes me gag so if I ever see you you know walking down the street and you have coconuts then uh you know don't be discouraged that I don't talk to you it's not you it's the Coconuts so let's go ahead and save this refresh it and see what we get Bucky is better than Hobart Counting Crows is better than Bieber should be are better strawberry is better than coconut which is true all of these things are true so anyways back to our program what it did is it substitute the first one for one and the second one for two and then inside our function it just substituted those variables for whatever we had out here and again these are called the parameters and whenever we're giving this information or substituting it it's called passing information into your parameters so again if you're watching these tutorials because you were taking a JavaScript class at school and you couldn't understand your teacher that's the questions that they're going to ask on the test and that's the information that you need to know parameters passing it in so there you go but if you're just watching this then uh don't even worry about it as long as your program works you're good to go so thank you guys for watching uh don't forget to subscribe don't forget to check out my website my other videos and don't forget to check me out if you see me on the street so uh yeah I guess I'll see you next tutorial
