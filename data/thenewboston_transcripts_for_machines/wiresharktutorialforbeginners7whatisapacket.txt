all right guys so in this video what I want to do is I want to give you guys a very and I emphasize very basic overview of a packet in the different parts that it's broken into and well just exactly what it is so for this example go ahead and open that file that you downloaded in the first video so HTTP and boom there you go so select packet number four and we can see already that this is a get request now I'm guessing that you guys are already a little bit familiar with get requests basically whenever you want a web page from you know some uh server like Facebook or something then you're going to send that server a G request and that server hopefully if everything works correctly it's going to send you back some HTML file and it doesn't have to be HTML file it could be like a picture whatever so we're just going to get something from a server now whenever you're trying to look at a packet to be honest the way I think about it is it's really easy to understand if you think of it just like a package like you're sending someone a package in the mail so whenever you send them a package then what you do is you know you just don't send them an empty box you need the address on it and you put your return address in you know you put some stuff inside the package unless you do want to send my empty box for some reason but that's basically how packets work with computers as well whenever you look at a packet what it basically is is it's a package of information information that you're going to send to another computer so this packet right here is just a package that we're sending to some other server and inside the package it's pretty much saying hey give me a file so we're going to start at the bottom right here and let me minimize this and maximize that and spread it all out all right so it all starts with HTTP and this is pretty much the protocol saying this is the type of data that you're going to be sending and this is how it's going to be formatted so whenever the server gets this and sees that it's HTTP that usually means okay so they're looking for some web file maybe a picture maybe um you know just HTML file whatever now there are rules that whenever we send an HTTP packet that it needs to be formatted in a specific kind of way so the server is going to look through things like request URI request method and it basically like I said these are the rules of how the data is formatted and what type of data it is now we also need to include basic TCP information now TCP this is the protocol and again like I said this is a really basic overview but these are the rules on how we are going to connect to that server now inside here there's some real basic information like the ports that we're going to be using and we're going to be taking a closer look at TCP specifically the handshake or the process of exactly how they're connected in probably the next tutorial but just remember this is what type of data it is and how it's formatted and these are the rules and on how we're going to be connected now we're also going to include ipv4 since we're using version 4 IP addresses and this is the destination and return address information so we'll see okay what is the IP address of the server we want to connect to and whenever it's sends information back we need to give them their IP so it can actually send it to the you know our back to our computer now this ethernet section right here whenever your message is all packaged up and ready to be sent you just don't send it directly to that server because you know you don't have a big ethernet cable connected to Facebook server so you need to send it to your router and then your router sends it to I don't know maybe another router and then through internet magic it it eventually gets there so whenever you send it to your router you need your router's Mac address now whenever it goes to Facebook and comes back it's going to go through your router so that way whenever the data gets to your router if a bunch of different computers are connected to it then your computer's be like hey over here that that's uh for me so basically this is the information to connect your computer to your router and it uses Mac addressing and frames this is basically uh the point where the software becomes real because this software that's on your computer right now you can't touch it you can't hold it in your hand it's just you know a program however what is eventually going to happen is the software all these ones and zeros that somehow magically become a pitcher they need to be converted into either you know like a uh if you're transferring it over ethernet a bit of electricity if you're transferring over fiber optics then little pulses of light if you're using WiFi then it's going to convert it into radio waves now these frames in this framing information is it includes a bunch of Hardware information like the Mac header and the trailer and it also includes ethernet info but basically this helps software become um real so data that can actually be transmitted now we can actually see that data so for example if we see this see this is bytes on a wire so whenever we transfer over a wire an Ethernet cable what's going to happen is it's going to send a pulse of electricity every time you see one and it's going to hold off or not send one whenever you see a zero so kind of like a weird Morse cat so again fiber optics you would use light WiFi these would be radio waves and WiFi protocol is you know a whole different Beast it's complex but that's the like I said real basic overview of how how you pretty much look up memes on the internet this is what's happening in behind the scenes now the cool thing is once this gets to the destination and once all these electrical signals get to like a server um I don't know like Instagram server then the first thing it's going to do is it's going to be accepting all of these electronic signals and then it's going to go through and says oh we got some data and then it's going to go backwards even more oh we got some HTTP data oh they requested this file and this is how I'm supposed to send it back so that's what we're going to do and we're going to package it up in this kind of way and whenever the server gets that package it's going to unwrap it bit by bit and eventually see the message inside and the message says hey yo I want this than meme send it back so so like I said it's a very basic overview of what happened so hopefully you guys understand these sections a little bit more clearly and uh you know a lot more to cover but there you go thank you guys for watching next video TCP handshake is going to be awesome
