all right hi there and welcome to this spring boot and caught in tutorial series now obviously i'm not bucky but just bear with me for a minute here my name's peter and i'm part of the new boston community so i contribute to the digital currency to the kotlin sdk and also i contribute as a youtube educator which gives me the chance to teach you something on this channel now when i don't do this i also work as a full stack developer and i work as online teacher on the side so i have courses on my own platform at codalong.tv on udemy and some other sites so hopefully i can give you a nice and gentle introduction to not only kotlin but also to spring boot in this tutorial series so without any further ado let's just get into it alright so here we are on the official spring website at spring.io on here let's go to projects and click on overview so here you can see that spring really is an entire ecosystem of different projects that are tailored to different use cases and the ones that we're really interested in for this tutorial series are spring boot and spring framework at some later point maybe i'll also cover spring security to handle authorization and authentication to your application but for now let's understand the spring framework and spring boot at least at a very rough level so the spring framework really comes with lots of infrastructure that you typically need for enterprise web applications in java so it provides things like dependency injection transaction management accessing different data sources and many many other things now this spring framework is really extensive so it can be hard to get started can be a bit overwhelming at first so i hope that this tutorial series is also kind of like a gentle introduction to the spring framework but also we're going to be focusing on spring boot and the whole purpose of spring boot is basically to allow you to get started building web applications using the spring framework more easily by providing an opinionated view of building these kinds of spring applications so this means there are lots of defaults defined for how you configure stuff and it really makes it a lot easier because it narrows down the solution path that you have for building your web application all right so with that out of the way what we're going to do in these tutorial series is um building a rest api little web application with a rest api for banks so in order to fit into the new boston community we're going to take digital currency as the domain for these examples so we're going to build a rest api that knows how to handle bank objects so you can fetch banks from the rest api you can create new banks update existing bank data delete banks and so on so let me show you what this will look like once we're done so over here in postman this is a tool that allows you to make different types of http requests so you can make get requests post put delete and quite a few others and we're going to talk about what these mean in the coming tutorials but for now you can see here we have a rest api with our service running on localhost on port 8080 and if we make a call here let's say to the bank's endpoint this will give us a list of all the banks that are currently known to the service so we have three banks that are set up these consist of an account numbers transaction fee and trust it's not so much about data you could add different types of data of course if you want to you can also fetch a single bank by appending the account number of the bank you're interested in and then you can see over here the rest api will respond with just the bank that you requested and similarly you can also create a post request in order to create a bank so with this over here you can give it the data it wants or or you want it to add to the available banks send it and then if we go back you can also see here the response is 201 created and now if you fetch all the banks you can see you now have those four banks over here you can use a put request in order to update an existing bank so over here what does it currently look like so this with the account number here has a transaction fee of 10 and 80 currently so now let's use a put request for this bank with this account number and change the transaction fee and the trust so if we send this over you can see it's acknowledged by the rest api by giving you the same thing back as the response and now if i go back and get all the banks again you can see the transaction fee is now three and the trust is now 85 and then lastly what you're also going to build is a delete endpoint so on this rest api you can delete a specific bank again using the account number as an id and that's going to give you two or four no content and if i go now back to creating or retrieving all the banks you can see it's now back to only three of them so all of this is what you're going to be building over these next few tutorials it's going to be a really nice introduction into building rest apis using spring boot and also how to test your applications using junit 5. so with this little overview done let's go to projects and down here click on spring initializer now this is a really useful tool to get started with a new spring based project by allowing you to say which kind of technologies you want to use which spring dependencies you want to include and then it's going to generate the base project for you now for these tutorials let's go ahead and create a gradle project and of course we're going to use kotlin so don't be afraid if you've never used it before that's also part of this tutorial series to just get your feet wet using kotlin and building your first application with it let's also go ahead and choose the latest snapshot over here of the spring boot 2 point something version we're only going to be using very basic functionalities of spring boot so i don't expect any major changes in any of the 2.x versions so feel free to use a newer version if you have one available as well then down here i'm going to go ahead and set my group id so here again the convention is to use your domain name for me that's kodalong.tv in reverse order and then let's say tutorials spring boot and then as the artifact id let's go ahead and say the new boston so this is a spring boot tutorial series for the new boston and then for packaging i'm going to use jar and i'm going to leave the java 11 which is the current long term support version so i'm going to leave that there and then we just want one dependency over here which is spring web so as you can see there are many different dependencies you can choose from and spring web is the one that allows you to create restful applications or rest api exactly what we want to build here and it's going to use tomcat as the default container so let's select the stream web dependency and then hit generate which is going to give you the base project as a zip file so let's just go ahead download this and then please just extract it into a folder wherever you want to have your project on your file system and with that you have your base project ready so in the next tutorial let's go ahead and finally write some code
