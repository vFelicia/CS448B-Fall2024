hi this is Alex from PHP academy' talked with a video tutorial for the new Boston in this video we're going to be using the remove attribute to undo say below reenable this button if you like and we're gonna be focusing in on this remove attribute surrounding this of method that we're creating and essentially what we're doing is we have a check box with the label I agree when we click on this the continue button is enabled and we can go ahead and click it we also disable this check box as well so you know not really well too much of a practical application but there are practical applications to this but I just wanted to create something more sort of a pliable to real life to demonstrate the remove attribute function so this is essentially what we're going to be creating let's go over to our text editor and start writing it okay so the first thing that I'm going to go ahead and do is inside of my body area I'm going to create the check box itself and then also the button as well so I'm going to make the button to be auto I'm going to create the button with the attribute disabled which will automatically disable this button so let's go ahead and first we'll create the button I'm going to obviously create an input with the type of button button I'm gonna set a value to this just continue and I'm gonna set a property disabled I will just show you first in the browser it looks like this we can click on this button if we go ahead and set the disabled attribute to disabled and we refresh you can see that the button is now disabled so that's in the state that we want it we're going to go ahead and give this button an ID of continue which means that in jQuery we the we can then reference this as continue obviously you can use a class or you can select a button you know as a whole but in this case we want for very specific uses it won't belong to part of a class it's just a single item with a single ID okay so now that we've done that we just have our disabled button on our page I'm gonna go ahead and just surround the checkbox in and paragraph tags so we're gonna say input type equals and check box and then next to this I just want to write I agree so now we have this checkbox here which we can check and uncheck again I'm going to give this an ID just so we can reference it and this is just gonna be called agree so what's gonna happen now we need to think of how we're gonna you know set about this process we're gonna click on the check box once the check box has been checked we want to in a we want to enable this button and disable this button so let's go ahead over to ext J's which I've included on my page as well as jQuery J s and in Jake in ext ojs we want to first of all wait for the document to be ready so we say document dot ready and inside we have our function so this is going to run when the document is ready we want to bind an event handler let's just pull this down a bit to make it a little bit better we're gonna want to a bind an event handler to this checkbox so when it changes we can check for the status on and then we can go ahead and enable this button by removing this disabled attribute so let's go ahead and select our agree checkbox agree checkbox and then we want to bind the event handler change to this and inside of here will be a function which we pull down and in here we can just test this by alerting out check for example so now when we refresh and I click this you see that we get this we get this button this alert dialog box just up here so now that we know that once we check it we can perform you know an initial operation and the first thing that I want to do is I want to go ahead and disable the current element so let's go ahead and well actually we'll grab the state first and we'll have a look so I'm going to say state is equal to this referring to the currently selected object or element and I'm going to say that and that will take the value from this that the state essentially in actual fact let's go ahead and say attribute value and I'm going to alert out the state so now when I click on it you see that we alert on when I click on it again you see that we are like nothing
