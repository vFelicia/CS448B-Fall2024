all right guys welcome back to your 58th udk tutorial and in this tutorial I'm just going to be finishing up our little animation so again we have Mata open and I'm not going to be talking you guys through all the buttons and Gadgets in this tutorial because I want to show you guys a real quick example of what MAA can do and then when I give you guys a nice demonstration and you guys understand what man is and what it can do then I can go through all these buttons and you guys will have a better understanding of what the heck I'm talking about so anyways for now just stick with me so I'm going to go ahead and select this gate because this gate or this door is the thing that I'm going to want to move so the very first thing I need to do is I need to add a new empty group and you do that by right clicking in this gray area and hit new empty Group by the way everything in Mae needs to be organized in a group so it's just one of the little rules of Mata just so so it helps you organize your animation better so I'm going to say door moving group looks pretty good so now I have a group and now inside that group I can animate things so again I know I'm going fast but hey I just want to give you guys a real quick demonstration I keep saying that but you know I kind of want to stress it so now with your group go ahead and rightclick this and this is where you add all your individual animations um um for this animation we just want to move this door so we're going to want to add a new movement track right there so now on this movement track we can move things so if you go ahead and in this area scroll out a little bit we can see that this entire movie is 5 Seconds long at the beginning of this movie this door is where it is right now however 3 seconds into this movie what I want to do is I want to add a new key frame so I'm gonna go ahead and hit this and by the way a key frame is basically this you know whenever well let me think let me say it this way you know back in the olden times Well I get I got a Even Better Way explaining things a movie isn't made up of fluid motion a movie basically and I'm talking like regular movies like Avatar Goodwill Hunting all they are is is individual pictures or frames pieced together so each individual frame is slightly different than the last one and whenever you play them all together it creates the illusion of motion so that's all movies are just a bunch of pictures that are a little bit different from each other play together and when you play them all together it creates the illusion of motion so that's what we're going to be doing in this we're going to be adding one point in time right here at the the beginning and that's where our door is and then 3 seconds later we're going to want to say all right move our door down here and whenever we do what it does is it automatically creates that movement from here to here so basically what we're doing is we're giving it keys or key frames that's what these little orange and red triangles are again a key frame or key is pretty much a checkpoint of point in time where you're telling all right movie at this point in time this is where I want you to be so at zero I want you to be up and at 3 seconds I want you to be down and what the MAA or what the udk is going to do is it's automatically going to know in between that time I'm supposed to fill in all the in between stuff to give you the illusion of motion so that's pretty much what we're doing however you're noticing all these these other triangles this green one and this red one I'll go over the green one a little bit later but if these two keys are the really big things we have to worry about then what the heck is this one this one to the right is the overall length of our movie so from zero to 3 seconds is where all the good stuff is happening and then for the rest of the two seconds it just kind of sits there it's like having an hourong movie but really your content is only like 20 minutes long so this is pretty much wasted space right here so we can go ahead and get rid of that so now our entire movie is 3 seconds long and our animation is 3 seconds long so you know it kind of makes more sense than having a 3se second long animation and having our entire movie 5 Seconds long that wouldn't make sense so now our animation is good to go so it's going to start up there and then whenever our user hits the trigger it's going to go ahead and slide that door down just like that and huh someone texted me I could restart this tutorial or I couldn't check this text but I'm definitely going to check this text it's from my mom and she says what is our wireless password how am I supposed to know I don't even live with I live in North Carolina my mom lives in New York and she's texting me saying what is my wireless password I don't know so Mom I'll get that later now she's calling me so anyways I'm going to go ahead and X out of that and I think everything is good to go as long as I didn't mess anything up so now let me go ahead and right click on the other side and hit Play From Here and Now check this out by default my gate is up and now when I hit that trigger it's going to slide that gate down and I can hop over it and shoot the statue okay that was just inappropriate I shouldn't have done that so anyways there you guys have a basic idea of what anime is or not anime what Mane is they're basically the same thing so now that you guys know what it is and you saw a demonstration of it I can begin teaching you guys with all those little buttons and gadgets means and how to make some really sweet animations you can actually make an entire 3D movie in here if you want to but we won't be doing that so anyways thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see you guys in the next video
