hi this is Alex from PHP academy.org with another video for the new Boston in this part of uh the user login registration tutorial um we're going to be looking at registering a user because obviously what we've done is we've created our database um here uh and we've created our table and we've given it this data we've got Alex and Billy we've got two records inside now we obviously want to let the user register for themselves uh and this is going to be a simple process we're not going to be talking about including uh emailing uh the user to tell them that that they're registered we're just going to be inserting the data through a form so let's create a new file and um let's save this as register.php now the first thing that we want to do is obviously require in the files that we need so we've got core. in.php which is important because what we're first of all doing is we are oh no sorry uh C don't think we need to include that yeah we do because we've got the logged in here yeah okay so um we've also got um no that's fine yeah so what we need to do is in register.php include this we need to say if not logged in we need to register the user otherwise if the user is logged in so El logged in you're already registered and logged in so we're essentially just creating a check let's just put an escape character there to get rid of that um to make sure this is process this uh single quotation mark um we need to first of all check if the user's not logged in before we register them so otherwise we can say uh register okay so let's uh go to our browser and test this we're already logged in as Billy so let's go to register.php and see what it says um right so if not oh sorry I forgot the uh parentheses on that there so let's refresh oh no okay oh I see we've got else if there okay so a couple of mistakes there on my part okay so let's refresh you're already registered and logged in so now what happens if we go back to index.php and we click on the log out button we've now logged out so presented back with our full our login form let's go again to register.php and we're given the option to register so let's um Escape out of PHP first of all to create our form we don't want to be echoing our whole registration form because that could get too much um data that we need to Echo out and it's going to start to look messy and it's going to slow our page down particularly if we've got a lot of HTML to Output so I'm just going to end PHP there and start up a tag again there so our if statement block here to here is still going to work even though we're escaping out and then back into PHP so let's just demonstrate that by writing register form just as an example uh let's refresh and you can see that even though we've escaped out of PHP um we can still process um HTML here so it's almost as if you were writing Echo so let's begin to build our form up um so we are creating the outline of our form then we'll fill in all the properties so the action we're going to be we're going to be going back to register. pH P so register.php and the method is going to be post because remember we're going to be sending quite a lot of data we don't want it to come up in the URL bar as get um posted information so let's um complete our form the necessary um files we U sorry fields we need to include so the first one will be username we can break down now say input type equals text in fact we'll keep this on one line just to keep things simple uh and name equals username okay break down a couple of times obviously you can use better HTML make it look a lot better uh maybe use some CSS to format the um the style of everything but for now I'm just keeping it very simple so we can focus on the PHP side of things so password we want to input type equals um password name equals password and we want to break down once again now what we need to do is we're going to duplicate this and we're going to say password let's just put our colon in there password again okay so we want to ask the user to enter a password again so I'm going to re I'm going to name this field password uncore again now what we want to do is um we want to ask for their first name and input type equals text name equals first name want to break down a couple more and we want to ask for their surname C on there so you can build the form how you like you don't need to do it like me and make it look you know messy or or anything like that um obviously the last element we need of this form is the input um or the submit button rather so submit um and we're going to say name or no not name value equals register Okay so we've got a registration button there so let's go and preview our page let's refresh the page Okay so we've got this basic form um separated down doesn't look very nice but we're going to make it do its job so we are going to require all Fields we've got username we've got password password again first name and surname now these are a few things that we need to do in this process we need to check if the username already exists in the database that's important because we don't want to register a user with the same username um we need to check the password Here against the password that's retyped to make sure it matches because obviously we can't see the password that we're typing in so if the user was to access you type say an extra character on the end they might not be able to immediately see that so they might not um remember their password or know what their password is and we've got first name and surname we click register this data is transferred and it goes into the database okay so that's what we need to do
