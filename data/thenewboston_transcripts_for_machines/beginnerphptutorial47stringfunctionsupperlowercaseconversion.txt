hi I'm Alex from PHP academy.org and in this video created for the New Boston we're going to be talking about um upper and lowercase conversion in PHP now let's first of all just take a look at um a simple string so I'm going to say I am um or I could be any case um okay so this string um could be user user Supply data it could be anything really um but in this case we're looking at a static string that we've just created now what happens if I want to create this string completely lowercase now we'll look at an example of how we can do this first the same with uppercase however we'll also then talk about why this might be useful in real life situations so string lower I've created a new variable and this is equal to St Str 2 lower and then in bracket kit we add the string that we want to convert with the correct dollar sign so essentially what we've done is created a new variable here we've used a function here called Str Str to lower so it's quite easy to uh remember and uh We've supplied it with the argument string so we're converting this string to lower case so now what we can do is underneath is we can Echo string lower so let's preview that in our browser and see if that's worked and you can see it um has in fact worked the I was Capital before as you can see here and it's not anymore so for example I could say I could be any case and if I refresh now you see that we get exactly the same result because whatever capital letters are there we're converting them back to lower case so now let's try the same but with uppercase so we're going to create a new variable underneath here called string upper and that's going to be equal to St str2 and you probably guessed it the upper and then we Supply it with the same data so string now let's just change this output so we're echoing the upper rather than the lower and we can refresh and see what happens oh um let's just have a look here I think I yeah too many P's in that one okay so let's refresh okay so now we can see that our string has been converted to completely uppercase so it's extremely simple to convert from lower case to uppercase from uppercase to lower case and from a user types text to any case as well now why would we want to use these functions uh inside of PHP now I'm just going to be focusing on the St Str to lower uh just for the moment and I'm going to create a short program that demonstrates this the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a form uh with an action and a method so we're going to post that as get or submit that as get and the action is going to be index.php end the form there and we just just going to take one line of user data so um let's say um name oh what am I doing I'm starting a link for no reason so input type is text um the name of this is just going to be user undor name and then we can break down and we'll add a submit button type equals submit and the value of that is going to be submit okay so let's just preview this in our browser to make sure everything's looking and working okay okay so the point of this example I'm going to show you is I want a user to enter their name and we want I want to perform an if statement on this user's name now if I was to type my name usually in here I might just type Alex in lowercase but me personally I'd usually use Alex with a capital a um as it should be written however how do you know how your user is going to enter a a specific value into a text field you don't they could type Alex they could type Alex they could even say Alex like that you you don't know how people are going to type their name in so if you're taking generic data such as a name and you just want to perform you know a comparison on it using a comparison operator you might want to convert it to lowercase so whatever the user types in you can always perform the check correctly so if it doesn't make sense we carry on and I'll show you an example so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to check for the data so I'm going to say is if is set dollcore get uh username and the reason I've used get is so we can keep an eye on it in the uh in the uh URL bar at the top so I'm going to say and not empty um dollor get username and if these two statements evaluate to true or this whole statement as a whole evaluates the true um we can reset the variable name here this is just to ensure we don't uh grab any errors outside of this because if we were to put this username equals dollar undor get username outside of this if statement would probably have um an undefined index error so if you if you find you're getting errors undefined Index this is why because you're setting a variable to something that may not exist uh before you do your checks or you might not be doing check to anyway so username equals uh get username so let's just Echo that out so we can uh preview this in our browser and get an idea of what's going on so I'm typing Alex with the capital a first of all and I'm going to click submit now um oh it doesn't seem to have shown let's have a look what we might have done wrong username oh yeah okay so I haven't included my um underscore there so uh let's just type that in again I'm going to type Alex with a capital A and I'm going and I'm going to click submit so you can see that's been posted back to us we we can view it we can also keep an eye on we've got a capital A up here and then the rest uh Le X is in lowercase now I'm going to type it in uh in completely lowercase and you can see that both values here are updated however now what I want to do is inside here uh let's just take away that Echo I want to create a check to say if username equals Alex so remember we're using um a double equals here um for a comparison then I want to say um let's just say you are the best okay so um I know a bit of an odd example but okay so my point is that if we um were checking for the username oh this this user's name that we've specified now let's just type in Alex with a capital A again now the result I'm going to get now is absolutely nothing however if I type in lowercase we're now checking in lowercase just here so you know it's only going to Echo out you are the best if the user has typed their name even though it's the same name we're only going to get this message here if you look if it's in lowercase so The Simple Solution is to create a new variable don't convert this username variable because if you if you need to use it later on or store it you want to store it the same way the user has typed it in but you want to use a comparison in your lowercase version so you want to create a new variable for this so user uh name uh I'm going to say LC for lowercase equals dollar UND oh no what we can do is say uh equals username with the underscore remember however we're going to enclose this in the Str str2 lower function so now what we're doing is we're creating a new variable could username we're converting what the users already typed to lowercase and now what we can do is we can simply perform this check here but we've still got the original value that the user entered even though we've created a lowercase version so let's just check if this works which it should do so um with Alex in here with the lowercase version and we click submit it says you're the best however with the Alex the capital A beforehand it didn't work but now it does and we can even even just uh do something silly like that and click submit and it still works however the point I wanted to get across because we've created this new variable now what you can do is you can specify uh the variable the original way that it was typed so even though we're comparing only the lowercase version you can still use the original version so uh let's just refresh it says you are the best a capital l small uh E capital x so uh same with Alex with a capital a and then exactly the same with the small so it maintains the structure that the user has used to type it whether it be this this or this but we're performing the check on the name as a whole so we're not taking into account the user's case we're taking into account what they have actually typed so that's basically uh a really useful example of the Str strr TOA and how it could be used in everyday applications
