So today we're going to talk about classifying polygons and polygons are named based on the number of sides they have so of course a threesided polygon is called a triangle foursided polygon is called a quadrilateral five Pentagon six hexagon seven septagon eight octagon nine nonagon 10 decagon and 12 is a do deagon um other polygons that don't have a special number of sides are just called you put the number of sides they have and then put gone so that's how you would write that so an important thing to note is that if you have a regular polygon it means that all sides are congruent and all angles of the polygon are also congruent so now we're going to do a little practice with classifying each poly polygon so the first thing we have to do every time is count up the number of sides it has because that's how we name it so obviously this is a this has three sides so it has to be a triangle okay so this has one one two 3 four five six sides so if you remember it's called a hexagon so this right here is called a hexagon so this has one two three four sides and the correct name is a quadrilateral I know know it looks like a square and it it could be a square but a square is a regular polygon and we don't know that these are all the same size and that these angles are all the same measurement so we can all we can call it is a quadrilateral right now so this has 1 2 3 4 five 6 7 8 9 10 so this is a decagon because it has 10 sides this has one two three four five six seven so it's called the septagon and lastly this has three four five sides so it's called a pentagon so now we're going to do some practice with regular polygons and if you remember a regular polygon has congruent sides and congruent angles so this is asking for the measure of angle V well if this is a regular hexagon that means all the angles have equal measure so that's 120° and they want the measure of VM or the length of segment VM so it has to equal five MERS so this is a regular triangle and a regular triangle is a special kind of triangle and it's called an equilateral triangle now if you remember when we learned about equilateral triangles we said that they had congruent sides and congruent angles so that's what we call it if we have a regular triangle a equilateral triangle so the measure of a c has to be 3 cm the measure of C has to be 60 cm or 60° so this we know is a regular polygon and like I said before a regular quadrilateral because it has four sides is called a square squares have all their angles are right angles so so the measure of angle R so if all of the squares angles are right angles that means each one of its angles measures 90° the length of RL has to be 7 in because they have congruent links so be sure to watch the next video which is going to deal with angles of polygons and figuring out some problems with those
