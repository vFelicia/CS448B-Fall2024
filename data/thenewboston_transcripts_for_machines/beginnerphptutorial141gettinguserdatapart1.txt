hi this is Alex from PHP academy' dorg and this is a video tutorial for the new boston now we've already established how to log a user in depending on database values such as Alex or Billy both here now when we do login let's go ahead and log me in you'll see that we have you're logged in log out that's absolutely fine now the one thing that we're missing you know round off our website once users logged in is we're not displaying specific information about the user that is logged in you already know that the users ID which is unique to each user is stored in a session here so at the moment this value here this session will be equal to one because I've logged in as Alex so the idea has been set to one now inside corridor Inc dot PHP which remember we set up to be included in every file we want to create a function to be able to grab any field from our database here depending on the ID so this is going to shorten the amount of code we do inside our our our actual fight our files ourself so inside this cording dot PHP we're going to create a function which we can use however many times we want and also it will save a lot of resources as well so it won't slow down your server as much and won't perform as many queries so where do we start we need to outline the skeleton skeleton of our function so I'm going to call this get field okay so what arguments is this function going to take so get field the first important bit of information we need is the ID the user's ID the second we need is the field name so I'm just going to call this field okay so we need the user ID the supplied user ID and we need the field in fact looking at this we don't actually need the user ID already stored isn't it okay so we don't need the user ID we just need the field name this is going to grab the corresponding data from the field specified from this users table so the first thing we need to do is make is create a variable up here which is going to hold the value fadna we don't need to do that I'm just making it longer for myself so I'm going to write global dollar underscore session user ID now the reason I've done this is and I have a tutorial on why you need to do this and in fact maybe I don't think we even need to do that do it okay so let's echo this out and we'll see if this works so echo out basically the session the users ID so we'll come to index dot PHP you're logged in so let's create a line break there and down here we'll let's run the function get field okay so let's go back to our page and we'll see what we come up with okay yeah so we echo one now this get field we're aiming by the end of this tutorial to display the users name okay from in after this logged in so we're going to say you're logged in Alex Garret obviously not everyone is called an X camera tweet so we need to use this get field and function to make this work well so the first thing we need to do is we need to perform a query so the query equals and select now we need to specify the field so that's field and that's encased in apostrophes from users we're and this is the important part ID equals so let's just a pasta please buy all this we're ID is equal to dollar and the score session and that is user ID let's just them concatenate this on so it looks a bit tidier okay so select the field that we specify in here from users where the ID is equal to something okay so this is get a guest get user field we can call this because it's only selecting from the table users so get user field and we specify a field in here then what we need to do is we need to execute the query so query run is equal to MySQL query query and we need to encase this in an if statement to ensure that we only execute this block here if this query is successful so if the we're basically saying in plain English if this query is successful then what we need to do is we need to grab this data so we're going to return and what we're going to return is my SQL result and the result is from the query run the row 0 because we remember we're only returning one row and because there's only ever going to be one ID and the field we can pop again in here so field let's just get rid of them single quotation mark so field
