okay so today we're going to talk about opposites and absolute values the opposite is when you take the opposite sign of something so say you had positive five if you took the opposite of it you would have negative five and when you take the absolute value which is indicated by these bars right here you take the positive value so opposite is just the opposite value absolute means the positive value so for this when you take the opposite sign of five see and 90 so we get negative 5c 9 D and for our absolute value we would do the subtraction inside the absolute value bars so you get negative two and then these bars tell you to take the positive value so the positive value of negative 2 is positive 2 okay so now we're gonna do some examples so I have negative 12 and I want the absolute value of negative 12 so that means that our answer is going to be 12 so I have the absolute value of negative 25 which is 25 minus the absolute value of 14 of negative 14 which is 14 and if I subtract those two I'll get 11 okay so these once again are brackets that means you do what's inside the brackets and then you add so I'm going to take negative 18 plus I have negative 13 this minus outside tells me to take the opposite value so these this becomes positive so I've plus 13 so negative a negative 18 plus 13 gives me negative 5 okay so this negative out front tells me that I want the opposite value of each so this is gonna be positive it's gonna be positive so then I'm gonna get 2x plus 3y okay now when I have this negative out front it tells me to take the opposite this 2 right here tells me to multiply each one of these terms by 2 and this night and this negative tells me to take the opposite side so I'm gonna have this is positive 3 so I'm going to take the opposite sign which is a negative of 2 times 3 which is 6 and then this M Squared stays the same I have negative 2 M so I'm gonna take the opposite which is positive of 2 times 2 which is 4 M and then this last one is negative 1 and take the opposite of which is positive of 2 times 1 which is 2 and here I have opposite absolute value absolute value so what I want you to realize is that this negative right here can be written as plus negative 9 absolute value of negative 9 so this lets me know that I'm going to take the opposite of the absolute value of negative 3 and the opposite of the absolute value of negative 9 so I have the opposite sign um absolute value of negative 3 the absolute value of negative 3 is positive 3 but I have this opposite out front plus the opposite of the absolute value of negative 9 which is 9 so I'm negative 3 plus negative 9 which gives me negative 12 so that's all we're gonna do with opposites and absolute values make sure you come back we're going to talk about how to combine like terms of equations
