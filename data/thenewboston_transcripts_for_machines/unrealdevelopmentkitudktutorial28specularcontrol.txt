alright guys welcome to your 28th udk tesoro and actually this is the last tutorial where I'm going to be covering materials for now and in this store what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be covering the specular control of a material in other words how to control the shininess of a material and it's going to be awesome so well stay tuned so the first thing we want to do is we're going to be adding three textures so go ahead and remember our shortcut hold down T on your keyboard and click three times one two three now one of them is going to be plugging into the diffuse one of them is going to be plugging into the specular and last one is just going to be a normal map so go ahead and I already know what textures I want to use so go ahead and clear everything out and we're going to be searching for something called ceramic now go ahead and might as well search textures and check it out I want to use this cool Alliance base texture I think that looks pretty cool and you can see by the last letter the D symbolizes the diffuse the N symbolizes the one we're going to be plugging in the normal map in the sm symbolizes specular map that is a map that basically controls which areas of the map should be shiny so let me go ahead and grab my textures and I want to associate this one with the diffuse so I'm going to go ahead and do that by clicking the arrow right there let's plug that in right now I'll associate this one with the normal map so go ahead and do that or at narrow and I want to associate this one with a specular map so go ahead and do that right there so like I was saying before let me go ahead and give this set up and we can go ahead and expand this we're done with that for now so like I said before the specular map is basically a map that shows what areas should be shiny so basically you have a map that consists of black white and gray the black spots say are right I don't want those spots to be shiny at all the white spots are basically the glossy spots those are the spots that should be really shiny so as you can see kind of the top strip right here that has since that's kind of grey on our map that's going to be shiny this area right here is going to be really shiny in this part right here this kind of brown area since it's totally black on our map as you can see that part's not going to be shiny at all it's going to be dull so that's what a specular map is so let's go ahead and if we go ahead and unplug this we can see that we lose a little bit of the shine but it's really not shining as much as we'd like it to so in order to do that we're going to go ahead and boost the shininess by multiplying it by a value now we're already familiar with this and we actually know a shortcut to do that go ahead and hold em on your keyboard and click wherever you want that multiply box the pop up so now let's go ahead and plug in your specular mass 2a and we of course need another value to multiply it by so we can just go ahead and add a constant by having new constant and let's go ahead and plug this in right now so we don't forget and further constants value I'm going to pick something like 150 that should be a pretty good value so now if I go ahead and plug this in the specular check it out our object is now incredibly awesomely shiny so let me go ahead and rotate this so we can see maybe that's a better view so now you can see hmm want to get a real good view here well I guess the lights coming from that direction so basically you can see that the gray areas which is the top strip and especially this face is really glossy in those areas such is this brown area right here isn't really glossy because that was the part that was a black on our specular map so as you can see check out the difference whenever I disconnected that is our map by default it kind of looks like a plain block of cement with some blue paint painted on and now by adding the specular attribute we can get some definite boost and shiny kind of turns into like a metal block rather than you know just a cement one so aside from that what we can do is we can further control the specularity or the shininess control by adding another attribute to the specular power so that being said let me give you guys another tip if you hold down control in all on your keyboard injury egg you get a box around your selected items and that way you can go ahead and you can actually group them into group which I don't want to do now I just want to move them to the side over here pretty cool huh so now what I want to do is I want to mess with the specular control a little bit so this specular control just takes a constant number so let me go ahead and rightclick constant new constant and go ahead and plug this in right now and by default here's how it works low numbers give you a big shining this area it's kind of like if you were to shine a big lamp on it the whole area would be lit and zero is a pretty low number so that's why this whole entire area is lit big numbers such as like 500 give you a really specific small shinin ceria it's kind of like shining a small flashlight or laser so a big area like 0 gives you a big area a small number like 200 gives you a very specific area just like that you see where I'm saying so let's go ahead and give it something like put a somewhere in the middle like four and this kind of lights up our area my wanna give it a bigger let's say 220 pretty good median so check it out so with controlling the specular attribute and the specular property you pretty much have all the control you would ever want over the shininess or glossiness of your material so that's all I had talked with you guys about in this tutorial let me think if I forgetting anything no I think that's pretty much it so that's how you control the shininess of your material so thank you guys for watching to subscribe and don't forget if you have any questions just go ahead and ask me on my forum because i rarely look at my youtube comments i'm sorry to admit that so anyways talk to me on my forum and i'll be happy to chat with you so thank you guys for watching and I'll see in the next video
