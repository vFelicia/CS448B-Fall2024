hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're going to be making a random number generator so go ahead and select a new project we will select windows forms application and we will call it random generator then we'll go ahead and click OK now before we get started I want to talk to you guys about something computers cannot truly be random because computers always follow a set set set instructions and they cannot decide for themselves or make random decisions now the random class is the best attempt at this that the dotnet developers have created and I'll show you a little flaw with that now here is a small application that I made in about 10 minutes just to show you guys that computers aren't really random so if I start this random animation you can see that it starts drawing on these graphics right here you can see that as a trend it's going up and to the left and it just keeps doing that now if we leave this running after a while you will see that lines just streak up into the left over and over and over again now we will be making this closer to the end of the series of tutorials when we get into graphics just so I could show you guys how the random class works and how it isn't really random so um let's go ahead and get started I'll leave this running back here so we can come look at it after the tutorial is over so go ahead and resize this we will come over here to our tool box and we will add a list box and we will add a button and we go ahead and make this a little bit larger okay so let's go ahead and set the name of the list box to list random numbers and we'll set the text value off the button to random numbers and we'll go ahead and set the name to button generate so let's go ahead and double click on random numbers and we'll zoom in once we get in here okay so now what we need to do is we need to create an object of the random class now in the next couple tutorials we're going to be learning about making classes now we have used objects before so this is kind of something that you need to learn leading up to making class your own classes and stuff so when you create an object of a class it's pretty much like making a variable it takes that class and makes a little a copy of that class that you can change the values call the methods call the functions and it exists all on its own and has nothing to do with the original class and you can make as many objects of a class as you want so let's go ahead and declare let's just do generator as new random so now that we have made a new random object we're going to go ahead and print out all these random numbers to the list box so we'll go ahead and do we will make a dowhile loop so do and we'll just type list let's see what are the name of our list box was list random numbers dot atoms dot add and we'll type generator dot next and it returns a nonnegative random number of type integer so it will just set a limit for this so we'll do from value 0 to value 20 and then we'll go ahead and convert that to a string okay so what this does is it uses our annum class object and it generates a random number between the value of 0 and 20 by using the next function and then we went ahead and converted that integer to a string to add to our list box so what we want to do is let's come up here and create a variable so we'll declare my R and as integer and we will set it equal to generator dot next and we'll go from 0 to 20 now let's go ahead and take out this right here because this will generate two different numbers so I'll just go ahead and type my R and sorry I didn't think of this later but um so now that our generator or our random number is stored in a variable we can loop while my R and is equal to a certain while it is not equal to a certain value so let's go ahead and loop while my R and does not equal 5 and let's go ahead and declare this outside of the loop so that it can be used there so we'll just take this out and we will type my R and equals generator dot next okay so well this is going to do is it's going to keep running out random numbers while my R and is not equal to 5 and once it equals 5 it is going to stop the adding the numbers to it so let's go ahead and bring this over here and we'll go ahead and click random numbers so you can see that it adds 0 11 and 5 and then when we do it this time it gets to 15 4 16 10 to 19 14 13 and it goes all the way and it generates a whole bunch of random numbers until it's five and then it it stops doing that so let's go ahead and type list random numbers dot atoms dot clear so each time we click the button it's going to clear the list box and give us a new clean list box so we got lucky on this one and the first time I generated a number it was equal to five and when we did it this time we get a whole bunch of numbers and then finally the last one is equal to five and it stops the loop so go ahead and create a couple random numbers by using the next and you can specify the the limit here and you can also do some other stuff so play around with that and see what else you can do you don't have to use this you don't have to use loops but just once you get familiar with the random class and how to use it go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
