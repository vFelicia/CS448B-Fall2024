now let's try a different username so we'll try say Josh for example and the password pass one 123 pass 1 2 3 and click register and that's okay because the password or the username Josh for example doesn't already exist so we're down to the last stage of our um of our registration where now everything is okay so we just need to register the user one thing to note before we do so is we need a version of the password which is md5 encrypted so I'm going to say password um hash equals md5 of password Okay so we've got our password hash now that we can pop into the database that will allow our login system to work correctly otherwise we're just going to be comparing an md5 hash to plain data so now what we can do is actually start the registration process so um else um we need a new query and the new query is going to be query equals so we need to now say insert into users values and how many values have we got let's just go to our databas and check we have got let's go back to our table in fact let's completely refresh that as well so we're ready to use that in a minute we've got 1 2 3 4 5 so we need 1 2 3 4 5 remember they're comma separated values and what we're doing is we need to use the MySQL real Escape string as well to um stop um SQL injection so the first one is the username then the password then the first name then the surname so um username password but password has because we're storing it as md5 data first name and surname but now what we need to do is just end that string there and concatenate on username um we can do the same with the password hash I guess end the string there and concatenate on first name and then concatenate on the rest of the string and then we do the same for the surname so end concatenate concatenate start okay so now we can enclose these in MySQL real Escape string and the same with this and the same with the first name and the last name as well so MySQL real Escape string and MySQL real real Escape string okay so now that we've done this this should successfully register um our user into the system so we need to perform the query first so query run is equal to MySQL Query and then we put the string data of the query inside of that um we're going to turn this into an if statement to ensure that we tell the user if they've been successfully registered or not so we can say if the query run equals myql query so this if this query there is successful then we can say to the user Echo uh successfully registered blah blah blah but I'm going to tell you how we're going to do that in a minute otherwise Echo sorry we couldn't register you at this time try again later so um let's just uh Escape that St up and that inverted comma there single quotation mark if you like otherwise um we're going to say uh we're going to confirm that the user is registered in fact we're not what we're going to do is we're going to locate them to a page that's going to tell them that they've successfully registered what this is going to do is it's going to stop them pressing F5 F5 on the keyboard refreshing the page and registering them again and again I know that won't work but it's it's a good practice to get into with a lot of data so header location and we can call the page something like uh register success. PHP okay so let's go ahead and create this register success. PHP file now you can bear in mind you could transfer over the um get variables so you could say U equals username password equals pass P equals password or something or just the username but I'm just going to tell them they're Reg for now in this page so you've registered um let's just uh call this page what do we call it um register success. PHP okay so that's going to be it for now I'll leave it up to you guys to you know use your imagination on this one um so let's test the process and see if we've got everything working so register.php I'm going to register a user called Dale password is going to be pass1 23 password again is going to be pass1 23 and then we're going to say Dale Garett we've bypass all our security up our validation checks now check that the username is there the password is uh matching we click register we transferred to this register success page youve registered perhaps you could have a link saying now you can now you can log in and we'll take ourselves back to the index.php file take a sneaking look inside here first and you can see that all the data has been processed L we've got ID of three now username Dale the password matches that because all the passwords are the same and we've got the first and last name now let's take Dale and password um pass one two 3 and click log in and you can see that we've successfully logged in as our new user
