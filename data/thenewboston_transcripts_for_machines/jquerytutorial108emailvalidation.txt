and that's something else will be to check the email address again so let's click in here okay so it tells us going into a valid email address I'm gonna enter a valid email address and come away then I'm going to click back in and you can see that we don't have the same message instead what we want to do is something else and that is to check the email as well so we're gonna leave this for now I'm just going to change this text here to say check email address valid because what we want to do is if the user has entered something into here and then they click back into it we want to revalidate it it doesn't matter whether they've entered a valid or for example an invalid email address we want to revalidate it so we can tell the user again if the email address is invalid or if it's valid so now we need to create the actual function that will do that will will outline it at the top of our page and this is going to be let's just call this validate email and in that we take an email address so here's our function validate email now it's going to cool it here it's going to call this function just here so this this bit later on when we've actually filled in the block in here we'll equal or we'll call the validate email function also when we have a key up event we also want to call the validate email function as well so we've appended like we have with blur the key up function or the key up event had long to the end of here and inside we want to go ahead and create a function so in here what's going to happen is we're going to first of all retrieve the value of the in fact we don't have to read have to store this in a variable to waste memory we can go ahead and call the validate email function directly and here we want to supply an email address and the email address that we wanted to supply is the email address field so email dot Val so I've used a selector and the valve function in jQuery to grab the value of this email address field so we also want to do this here so we can just copy and paste that there so we've used this function outside of here because otherwise we would have to duplicate the code here and here to validate the email address now this function is going to deal with the Ajax request and it's going to take this email address here it's gonna feed it to a PHP page which we're going to create in just a moment and it's going to you know PHP is going to handle the validation it's then going to return the result of this and then with valid email we can return the result and then we can put that into a or we don't have to return the result from this function we can go ahead and just put this straight into our field it's probably better practice though to return the value so perhaps we'll do that instead okay so now I need to think about what what we're going to write inside of our function well we're going to use the post a jack request so I've just outlined this here it's a dollar sign a full stop post and in brackets inside brackets we're gonna give this three parameters the first one obviously there's a comma separated the first one is going to be the file we're looking for or we're submitting our data to the second in curly brackets remember this is extremely important is going to be our data and the third is a callback function which is going to hold the result returned by this page so that is function data and we can go ahead and bring that down okay so the file that we're submitting this particular data to that will eventually appear inside of our brackets is PHP /e male PHP we need to send some values so we are sending a variable called email and this is going to be the value we pick up inside PHP and the email here is the one that we want to put in here to be submitted so I've used the same variable name here and here but not to be confused this is the name of the variable that we're sending and this is the value retrieved from our function so now that we've done that it's going to submit this variable here with this value to PHP /e male PHP so the first thing to do is go ahead and create that file and we're just going to outline PHP tags and I'm going to save this inside our PHP folder as email dot PHP now that I have that we can actually run some tests before we start to validate so we can run tests to see if our owl Ajax or our jQuery is working so I'm simply going to say email feedback dots text data now remember this data here is what is what's returned from this file here so we've we've created a callback function with data as the handler or the variable that handles what's returned from this file here and then we're just putting that inside of our email feedback span so now what should happen is we are using the validate email function or calling this with the email that we've picked up we are then using what we're calling this validate email function supplying an email for example Alex at PHP academy' de org this is then sent to email dot PHP with the variable name email and this value here would correspond to Alex at PHP academy' de org data then contains whatever email throws back asks for example if we echo something out in here we were to echo hello hello would then be inside of date this data variable here
