all right guys so before we get into selecting the target what I want to do is I want to run this program real quick and I'll show you guys pretty much what we did so far and what we're going to have to do next so what we did is let me just start this right here is whenever we run the script the first thing that's going to pop up is this right here just this interactive prompt So then whenever a client start connecting let me run this real quick we're going to see a little indicator that says connection has been established and whatever their IP address is so this is my IP address I just connected to it so now that we're in Turtle remember we gave it two um prompts custom prompts you can type in list and then what it does whenever you do that is we built this in the last video where at all right so what does is it goes through and it lists all of the computers that are currently connected to your server so it just gives them an ID number which is pretty much the list number and then their IP address and then their port so then later on you're going to be able to say select zero and you know eventually we're going to have more 1 2 3 4 5 or whatever and whenever we select it it says you are now connected to that computer and from here you can just write like whatever you want so Echo hey and look on their machine it says hey whatever and eventually also we're going to be able to type in quit and then we're going to get back to our main program so list and I'll show you guys a bunch of cool stuff that you can do with that and how to customize it however you want but just to reiterate what we did so far is we just listed the connections we're just displaying them now in this tutorial what I want to do is I want to show you guys how to actually select a computer so let me stop that and that's what we're going to do all right so I'll say select uh uh Target client and if you guys were like wait a minute I just try to run this program and it doesn't work like yours did that was another um I have the completed program already and you know that was from that so if you try to run this right now it's going to give you a bunch of Errors so you know just a heads up in case you guys were trying to figure that out all right so Define get Target and we're going to pass in the command right here all right so this function right here remember if they typed in list then it's just going to display all the computers that are connected now once they review that list and they find one that they want to control they're going to write select and then their ID number so I wrote select zero and then I was connected now what we also pass this in is the command so the entire command so this isn't any actual code code so it's going to be like select zero select one select two So eventually what we're going to do is we're just going to rip out this part of the command so we only return the ID number so it's going to be pretty simple but we need to do some weird things so what I'm going to do first is just make a simple try I always call it try catch try accept whatever so this is the easy part we're going to command replace and what do we want to replace we just want to replace select and make sure you add a space after this because it's going to be like select zero select 54 and if you just try to replace select then it's going to return space like 64 or whatever so you actually want to replace this and what do you want to replace it with just nothing so now this variable right here should be equal to just the number now another thing that we want to make sure of is right now it's equ equal to a number but it's in the string format since that's what they typed in so what we want to do is we need to convert it to an integer and I'll just write Target right there and you can actually wrap this all in one line but I want to keep things simple all right so now this variable is an integer of whatever the computer they want to connect to and now what we're going to do is we're actually going to get the connection object so from all connections all the computers that are connected we want to connect to Target so whatever connection was in that list that's the one we're trying to connect to and now we're just going to print out a little indicator say you are now connected to this computer or whatever so I'll just write um you are now connected to all addresses what is the item in the list well that's just Target and zero zero is their IP one is their port so remember this connection object is what we're going to return and that way they can have a bunch of computers connected but they can only pretty much um be interactive with one at a time it's freaking beautiful so print after this remember that I don't know if that's going to pop up but you remember as soon as you became connected to another computer what it did is it didn't say turtle anymore it actually gave you the IP address of that computer and that was the new input so then you know you're not in the interactive prompt anymore you're actually controlling their machine so I actually need to convert it to a string in well this right here so now we'll just uh use the RP address and give you that little greater than indicator and I also want to write end equals blank because if we just print this out without out this parameter right here then it's going to print out your prompt and then it's going to move your cursor down to the next line however whenever you have an interactive prompt it prints it out in the cursor is right on the same line it's not on the new line so that's why I need to say end right there so it keeps your cursor on the same line and now the last thing I want to do is I just want to add in accept so basically what they're going to do is they're going to try to connect to this computer however if we ever get you know an invalid connection we don't want to continue on with the program we just want to take care of it and let them know that something went wrong and I'll just say uh not a valid selection so maybe whenever they listed all computers there are only five computers and list but they tried to select 13 like number 13 and that's you know it's not going to work work so we're just going to say that and since we need to return something then we're going to return none and up here we actually need to return the connection all right so whenever they get the Target and write select one or select three it's going to go through connect it and return our connection object if we write select tuna or select 828 and it's not valid then it's going to just print out not a valid selection you dummy and then it's just going to return none so looking good uh yeah in the next tutorial what we're going to do is we're actually going to start sending them commands getting into the good stuff so I'll see you guys then
