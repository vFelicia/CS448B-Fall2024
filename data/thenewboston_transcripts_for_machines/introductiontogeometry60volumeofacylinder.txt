okay so today we're going to learn how to find the volume of a cylinder so the volume is equal to the base area times the height so for a cylinder each each base is a circle so that means that the volume for a cylinder is the base area which is PI R squared times the height which is always perpendicular to both bases and it's kind of hard to see but if this was sitting up like a soup can that side of the soup can is perpendicular to both circles so PI R squared times H so now we're going to do some examples so we have a radius of 8 inches and a height of 9 inches so volume is equal to PI R squared H volume is equal to PI R radius which is 8 squared times our height which is 9 so PI R squared is 64 x 9 and I have to plug that into a calculator 64 x 9 equals 576 pi inches and remember we're in volume so we're talking about three dimensional space so it's inches cubed now we have another example with a radius of 3 centimeters and a height of 12 centimeters so volume equals PI R squared H volume equals PI our radius which is 3 squared x 12 pi three times three squared is 9 x 12 so our volume is he a hundred and eight pi centimeters cubed ok so wait one final example volume equals PI or squared H so pi we have a radius of 5 so 5 squared times our height which is for volume is equal to 5 squared which is 25 times for so volume equals a hundred pi and remember volume is threedimensional so centimeters cubed so when we find the surface area of a cylinder we find the area of the label of a soup can and the two lids of the soup can when we find volume of a cylinder we find out how much soup can be held in that soup can so that's why when we find surface area where in centimeters Q squared and when we do volume where in centimeters cubed so that's all we have for volume of a cylinder next we're going to go into surface area of pyramids which are another kind of threedimensional shape
