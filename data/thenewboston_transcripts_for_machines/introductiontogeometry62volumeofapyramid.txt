so now that we've learned the the surface area of a pyramid we're going to learn how to find the volume of the pyramid so the formula for volume of a pyramid is v equals onethird base area times height okay now there's a couple things we need to talk about first so ba is the area of the base so the area of a base so the area of a base of a pyramid is going to be the area of this square so to find the area of a square we take length times width which for a square we know would just be side squared because they have equal length and width times the height so that's our final formula for volume now when we talk about the height we're not talking about this height of this triangle right here we're talking about the height that if you drew in would come perpendicular from this point up here to the center of the base so the height is the altitude drawn perpendicular to the center of a base so sometimes we're going to have to use our pythagorean theorem to solve for this length because if you look at it this height with this height of this triangle and and this little line right here forms a right right triangle with this being the height this being one half of the length and then this being just the height of the triangle which just so we don't get confused we're just going to call this a so sometimes we're going to have to use that to give us our h but you have to make sure you are taking that the line drawn perpendicular to the center of the base so now that we know how to find volume we're going to do some examples where we have to find volume so volume is equal to 1 3 length times width times h now since it's since we're multiplying these and multiplication is commutative it doesn't matter what order we multiply in as long as we multiply the right stuff so volume is equal to one third and since we know that the bottom of this is a square it'll be eight times eight or eight squared times our height which is this line right here which just so happens to be three so v equals one third 8 times 8 is 64 times 3. now we're going to multiply these all together so if you look the 3 is going to cancel to the onethird because when we multiply fractions remember we multiply across so this three is like a three over one and if we multiply across we'd get three over three which is just one so our volume is equal to 64 and we're in centimeters so centimeters cubed remember volume is always written in cubic units so now we're going to do one more example so volume is equal to onethird length times width h so volume is equal to onethird four times four h and right here that's a seven so volume is equal to one third times four squared is sixteen times 7. now i don't know that at the top off at the top of my head so i'm going to plug that into a calculator real fast and if you do that you will get thirty seven point three three three repeating and then pretend they gave us inches this would be inches cubed now that's all we're going to do with volume of a pyramid now make sure make sure you come back and watch the next video which is going to be our final video in this series for intro to geometry and then after that we're going to go into geometry with which takes the things we learned in these videos and makes us do something a little bit harder with them so make sure you come back to check that out
