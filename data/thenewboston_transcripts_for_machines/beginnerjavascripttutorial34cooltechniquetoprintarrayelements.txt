what's going on guys welcome back to your 34th of JavaScript sorrow and this story's probably gonna be pretty quick because I only have a one small thing to talk about but it's a really cool technique and the easiest technique for printing out an array so you definitely want to pay attention so let's go ahead and first create an array um I'm just gonna name it stuff why the heck not and new array let's just go ahead and create it right in here and go ahead and type like five random words like apples um pears let's see bacon tuna and ham simple enough and actually that looks like my grocery list so anyways we have an array called stuff and it consists of five elements the first thing that people like to do before they just go ahead and print it out is you probably want to sort this in some kind of order and might as well just use the sort method and it'll sort it in alphabetical order so go ahead and take stuff and use the sort method and now what this does is it sorts the array stuff so now whenever you print it out it's going to be in a nice neat alphabetical order so ever saying all right let's just go ahead and print out this array using you know the technique we learned before we go ahead and make a for loop and then we go ahead and say I equal to zero and then we go ahead and set I is less than and then we go ahead and count the elements one two three four five so we can go ahead and set I is less than five and this is gonna loop through five times simple enough but a better technique is this say later on you might add an element to your array or take an element out of the array so the array size might change from five to four or may go from like five to seven or something well then we would have to change our for loop and things would might get confusing so a better technique is this whenever you start at zero your second parameter can just be I is less than the length of that array so now later on if you were to change the size of this array you wouldn't have to change this variable this variable would automatically know to count however many items are in your right so I'll show you guys that later on but now again go ahead and increment my one and we'll be good to go so now all we have to do is tab and documents dots rights write anything you want on the screen so using that technique we learned less oriole if we just go ahead and put our array and use I is the index it's going to work perfectly since it's going to start at zero and go all the way to four and since there are five elements in our array 0 1 2 3 4 that's going to give us our 5 indexes as I and it's going to work perfectly so we can't bring that like this but it might appear a little jumbled so I want to go ahead and add a line break using that right there so now each item in our array we're on a new line whenever we print it out on our webpage so let's go ahead and save this launch in chrome and check it out our array which was jumbled before is now sorted in alphabetical order and we also printed out nice and neat on each line so go ahead and let me show you guys the benefit of this so now let's go ahead and delete bacon or something and now we only have four elements in our array so before where we would have to change this variable it's going to recount it and it's automatically gonna know that your length of the array has changed so no need to change the variable here now whenever we save it and refresh it our program is gonna continue to work fine so the technique I want to teach you guys in this tutorial was basically instead of a number here which would be the size of your array you can just use this length property and what this does is it automatically counts however many elements are in your array so you don't have to worry about what number appears there it's gonna do all the dirty work for you and this is really useful when you have an array like of 800 elements or something so you don't have to count them every time and aside from that I just want to show you guys how you can use that index in the for loop to plug that in as the array index and loop through an array really easily and simply so this is definitely combining this technique I taught you in this tutorial in the last technique we learn basically how to use for loops and arrays to just build programs that work so easily together so don't forget these techniques because they're definitely going to come in handy later on so for now that's all I have for you guys but uh yeah I don't know why I'm gonna be teaching in the next tutorial but it's gonna be pretty cool so thank you guys for watching don't forget to sub and I will see you next door Oh
