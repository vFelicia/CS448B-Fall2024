so today we're going to find the area of rectangles and squares the area is this shaded region right here and it's how much square units a shape takes up this is a two dimensional measure area so the perimeter deals deals with what's on the outside the area is what's in the inside of the square so the area for a square is side squared and I'll explain that to you in a minute because the area of a rectangle is the length times the width so length times width and since area you find an area by multiplying and multiplication is commutative it doesn't really matter what you call the length and what you call it with as long as you get this one and this one so for a square all of its sides are congruent so if I was going to take the length times width the length times the width of this square it would be s times s and if you remember when we are going over squares a while ago this just becomes s squared so that's how we get that formula now we're going to do some examples so find the area of each so this is a rectangle so to find the area we're going to take the length 13 times the width and if you put that into it you find that the area is equal to 78 now this thing right here the unit's they gave us they gave us two they gave them to us in centimeters but when I take these two numbers and multiply them together i'm going to multiply the numbers and i'm going to multiply the unit so i get centimeters times centimeters which gives you seventy eight centimeters squared which makes sense because when we find the area we're finding how many little square centimeters fill up our shape and our units are very important when we find the area so if they get a few units you have to make sure you have the correct units on your answer so now we have this and all the ways sides are congruent to this must be a square so that area is 112 and notice they didn't give us unit so i don't have to worry about that now i need to find the area of this shape so we're going to in order to do this we're going to break it in up into smaller rectangles then i can easily find the area of so i'm going to draw a line here this is one rectangle and i'm going to draw a line here this is two rectangles and this is our third rectangle that we're going to use so in order to find the area of this one you have to remember that this six is the area of this entire side this five is the area of just this side so we're going to ignore that six right there and this is going to be 5 times 1 so the area of rectangle 1 r 1 is equal to 5 times 1 which is just 5 now if you look over here the area of this rectangle is going to be the same as the area of this rectangle this 6 once again is a 64 this whole side so we're going to ignore that and we just want the five for this part of the side so once again we're going to get area of rectangle three so good to 5 times 1 which is five so now I'm going to find the area of this rectangle right here rectangle too so if I know that this part of this leg is 5 in this entire leg is 6 i'm gonna mold minus they'll big the hole and i'm going to subtract apart from it and that means that this little piece right here is one and we would do the same thing over here to get one over here so for this rectangle its area of rectangle 2 is equal to 10 times 1 which is 10 so now I'm going to add these all up to get the area of this entire shape inside here so I'm going to at five plus five is 10 plus 10 is 20 so the area of the shape is 20 so now in order to find the shaded area or the area of the shaded region I'm going to take this big area minus this little area so 112 minus 20 will give me will give us 92 so that's the area of the shaded region well that's how we're going to do for area of rectangles and squares but the next lesson is going to do deal with area of parallelograms and triangles and they have their own special kind of formula so make sure you come back and watch that
