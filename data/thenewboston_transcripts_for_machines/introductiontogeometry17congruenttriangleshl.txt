so now we're going to talk about the last way to prove that you have congruent triangles it's called HL okay so HL or hypotenuse leg is a way to prove that right triangles are congruent because only the right triangles have a hypotenuse so the hypotenuse and a leg of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding parts of another triangle so like we said this is going to be a right triangle because the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle of a triangle and only right triangles have right angles so we know that the hypotenuse of this triangle is congruent to the hypotenuse of this triangle I know that this leg is congruent to this leg of this triangle and a leg is just any side of the triangle of the right triangle that is not its hypotenuse and we know that these are both right angles because they're right triangles so therefore I can say that triangle a is congruent to Triangle B by HL except we want to say that it's a right triangle because HL only works for right triangles because if you think about it right angles are always congruent to one another because right angles measure always is 90Â° so you have a side an angle and a side so now that we know that we're going to do some examples so for the first one I have these two triangles I know that this leg is congruent to this leg of this triangle since they share their hypotenuse that is congruent to itself and we know that these two are right angles so we can say therefore triangle a a is congruent to Triangle B by h l so we have these two triangles down here we know their right triangles their hypotenuses are congruent and they share this leg right here so therefore this will be triangle one and this will be triangle two triangle one is congruent to Triangle 2 by HL and for this last example we know we have these two triangles right here they have we know they're right triangles and they share this leg but to prove they're congruent by HL we need a hypotenuse and a congruent leg but we don't know that these hypotenuses are congruent so therefore we cannot prove triangles congruent because we don't have enough information so we just learned all five ways to prove that triangles are congruent now in our next lesson we're going to talk about special properties of isoceles triangles
