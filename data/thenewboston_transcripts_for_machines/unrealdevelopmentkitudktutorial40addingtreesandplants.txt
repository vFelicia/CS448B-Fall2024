what is going on guys welcome to your 40th udk tutorial and in this tutorial what i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be taking our terrain we made and i'm going to be taking it to the next level because our terrain is looking pretty good right now with these rocky mountains and nice little valley and even a nice little dirt path for our user to walk along but check it out if we were to walk outside right now no piece of earth would look like this because outside has more trees and rocks and plants and bushes and there are definitely none of them in our terrain it's kind of like a wasteland right now so let's go ahead and add some of those things through the use of something called a deco layer now a deco layer is just short for decoration layer and these are the layers that you add that hold the trees and plants and bushes and even rocks and stuff like that so in order to do that before just go ahead and start plopping new layers down in our layer panel let's go ahead and select the static mesh that we want to use so go ahead and open the content browser select static meshes and i'm just going to go ahead and search for a tree to see what trees we got all right some nice options some kind of dead looking trees right here even a tobacco plant to the right here and you see all right so the only really two trees we got that aren't dead are this tree and this tree so i'm going to go ahead and use this tree because it looks i know pretty cool to me however i want to say this anytime you have a static mesh and you want to incorporate it in your terrain you need to make sure that it's loaded now if you can see these options right now it says path day added and status you see that the status is not loaded and we need to make sure that this tree is loaded in a memory for us to use it so go ahead and it's probably easier just to load the entire package that the trees in so what we can do is go scroll down here try to look for the tree r is in this package nope this package nope is it in this package nope well what we can do if we go ahead and right click it and hit find package it's going to automatically jump to the package that it's in so the package that this is in is generic foliage so go ahead and right click it and hit fully load and now it's going to load everything that's in generic foliage so check it out with our tree selected you can see that path info day added and status it's now loaded into memory so go ahead and just select that right now and make sure it's the currently selected item in your content browser and then go ahead and close out of that now like i said in order to add trees to the terrain we need to add them on something called a decoration layer or a deco layer so in order to add a new deco layer right click and add new deco layer and i'm just going to name it something clever like you would never guess like trees go ahead and hit okay however right now we basically have a blank decoration layer it's a layer but it doesn't know what static mesh it needs to associate with so go ahead and with your layer selected right click and hit add selected decoration this is going to take whatever object is currently selected in your content browser and associate it with this layer so now this trees layer is actually associated with the tree in our content browser however before i just start painting them on we need to change a couple properties of this layer so go ahead and hop up the properties and under your terrain under your deco layers you now have a bunch of options go ahead and just expand everything zero zero and factory what we're looking for actually you don't even need to expand that factory but if you do you can see that it is indeed associated with this tree right here what we're going to be looking for is this min scale max scale and density now these are the three most important settings in your terrain properties layer remember this is the decoration layer working with in min scale and max scale is basically just like it sounds whenever you're adding trees to your terrain it doesn't know how big or how small to add them so it's going to add them randomly so the minimum size you want is like 0.2 of the normal size now by default the size is one so we'll just say change it like the maximum size of the tree is one by default now the density is how thick do you want to add these materials so if you have something like point one then it's gonna add one every time i it's just an example it's gonna add like one every time you hit your brush but if you have something like 2.0 it's going to add like 50 every time you add your brush so how dense do you want those trees whenever you start painting and i'm just going to put it like at 0.6 because that's a nice medium we don't want them too thick or else our player isn't going to be able to run through them and we don't want them too skinny or it's only going to be like three trees across our entire terrain so these look like pretty good settings to me we can always change them later on but just go ahead and when you have your settings applied x out of there and now what we can do is go ahead and start painting on the screen so go ahead and let me change my radius hold ctrl and start painting those trees right across my terrain and another thing you want to notice is that these trees the more you paint just like anything else the longer it's going to take your game to load so sometimes you want a lot of trees but a lot of the time you uh well i just want to say i can i'm not going to go into the fact that the more things you have on your map the longer it takes to load but just like anything else make sure you don't you know add a ton of trees to your map or else your game is going to process forever so now that we have a couple trees added um let's go ahead and hit play from here and i want to show you guys a few things first of all you guys notice that some trees are small and some trees are bigger and that's because of that mint scale and max scale you might be able to see better right here that some trees are small some are bigger bigger it randomly adds them depending on the settings you chose so actually that's basically all i need to teach you for decoration layers that's how you do it that's how you add it again to paint hold down control and left click if you want to go ahead and erase them hold down control and right click and it's going to erase some of those trees from your layer and again you can add trees and rocks and bushes and tobacco plants marijuana plants and any illegal drug plant you want using this way so that is the basics of a decoration layer and through the use of all those things i taught you with terrain you should be able to now create some awesome amazing looking terrains so for now i think that's going to be all i'm going to be covering with terrain there's a lot more that i can go over but uh for now you guys got the core understanding of how to work with terrain so thank you guys for watching don't forget to subscribe and i'll see you guys in the next zorro
