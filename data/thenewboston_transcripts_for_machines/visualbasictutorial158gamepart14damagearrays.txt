and then we will do current enemy dot attacks at index of current enemy dot attack num now attack num may not show up for you that is perfectly fine because what you need to do is come over here into enemy VB and create public attack num as integer you don't need to do it in any of your other enemy classes other classes because they all inherit enemy and when they inherit everything from enemy they are going to hear it inherit the attack num so it can be used for all types of enemies and it needs to like I said it needs to be public as integer in your enemy so then we will go ahead and add close that in brackets and then we will say for and then we're going to do the damage so we'll do current enemy dot and we're gonna get attack damage at index of current enemy dot attack num now you may notice that we don't actually have a current enemy dot attack damage so what we need to do is we need to come into each one of these classes and make that so we'll go ahead and do public read only zombie attack damage now you may notice that we'll have a conflict because of this we can't we would have to find out what type of enemy it is and then do it according to that so what we can do is come over to enemy and we can do public read only attack damage as string and since each enemy has three attacks we're going to put a three right here so it'll have three places at indexes of 0 1 & 2 now for each one of the classes let's go ahead and make a constructor so sub new and we'll go ahead and do int health equals start health so let's see here so we'll come into each of our enemy classes and we will just go ahead and add the items to the attack damage alright so we'll just type attack damage at index of zero it's gonna be equal to and we'll come over here to attack and for the first one let's just do set it equal to ten so so we'll set that equal to ten and then attack damage one it's going to be equal to five and then attack damage it's going to be equal to let's see now you see here that it won't let you set values outside of a a sub or a constructor so we can just just go ahead and copy this and we will just type sub new so we have a constructor and if we put this inside the constructor it's going to go ahead and set those values for us now don't worry about the constructor inside of our enemy class because that code will still run it'll set the in Health equal to the start health and then it will do all of this right here so what we're going to need to do is do that for each one of the classes so I'll pause and then come back once that's done okay so you can see that I've done that for each one of these classes done it for Dragon villain and zombie and I've changed the values accordingly now you can go ahead and use indirection right here if you would like but I'm gonna leave that the same for this tutorial so come back into for Mondavi B so we've got current enemy attacks attack now and you can see now that our attack damage in our tech Nam works and then we'll add damage so go ahead put this code in if you have it if you have any questions leave them in the comments and they stay tuned for the next tutorial
