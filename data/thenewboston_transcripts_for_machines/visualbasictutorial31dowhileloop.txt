hello YouTube sam here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the New Boston in this tutorial we're going to be taking a look at the dowhile loop so basically what the dowhile loop is is it sounds very similar to the do until loop but the concept of it is completely opposite now what I mean by this is that the do one two loop will perform a set of code until a value or until something is true now the dowhile loop is completely opposite it will perform a block of code while a value is true and then once that value is false it's going to stop so let's go ahead and make a couple demos of this so go ahead and make a new project we will call it dowhile loop make sure you've selected console application and go ahead and click okay so we'll just give that a second to load here now let's zoom in a bit let's go ahead and add console dot readline so I don't forget this when we try to run our program and now let's come up right above that and we're going to create a variable so we'll use the dim keyword we'll just call it num1 as integer and we'll set it equal to zero now let's go ahead and make our dowhile loop so we're going to start off by using the do keyword which the description says repeats a block of statements until a baloon boolean condition is true so now we're going to add wild so repeats a block of statements while a balloon booth lean condition is true so do while num 1 is less than or equal to 15 now you can see that as the loop for us so that it'll loop back up to the dowhile statement after every iteration of the loop and you can see we did less than or equal to 15 in this now if we just did less than 15 then it would printout until it got to 14 and then it would stop so we just add the equal so it will print all the way to 15 so we'll just do console dot write line num1 okay so now we're going to increment num1 because we don't then it's just going to run forever so we'll go ahead and do num1 plus equals 1 so now you can see that if we run this we get 0 to 15 so I finish the load here I don't know why it's been doing this to me lately but um let's go ahead and we'll take this statement right here number one plus equals one we'll cut that out and then we'll add it before our print statement or our right line statement so basically what this is going to do it's going to add one two numbers to number one first and then it's going to print it out so we're going to start at the value one and go all the way to 16 now you may be wondering why does it go to 16 well because in the last one we had num1 plus equals 1 after our console dot write line so it was equal to 16 after we printed out 15 and then it looped up back to the top and said oh no it's not less than or equal to 15 so let's go ahead and quit out of this okay so if we do num1 plus equals 1 before then it will go to 16 and then it'll come back up and say oh it's not less than equal to 15 let's go ahead and exit out of here so that was a quick tutorial on how to do dowhile loops go ahead and practice some dowhile loops some do until loops from the tutorial before this once you got those down go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
