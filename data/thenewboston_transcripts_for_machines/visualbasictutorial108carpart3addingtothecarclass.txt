hello YouTube Sam here from youtube.com/ onli gamer for the New Boston and in this tutorial we're going to continue working on the car program now you can see here that I've organized our code and commented it so that we can see what each uh part of it does now you can minimize them and maximize them by using these buttons right here and you if you remember from the last tutorial we have name color and show info and then I just organized the button click events into one little group right here and then here's our form one load now let's go ahead and add some stuff to our car class that's going to be inherited by other classes but first let's get rid of some of this white space here okay so now let's come down below overwrite two string and we're going to create something uh that will set and uh get the number of doors now this is going to be a property called number of doors so we'll create a variable here that's going to store that so we'll make it private because we're going to use the property to indirectly access the value and we'll be able to set the value so number of doors as integer so now that we have our number of doors um value there let's just go ahead and add a comment that says uh tells us what we're going to be doing so number of doors property so gets and sets number of doors so now what we're going to do is declare our property so public property and we'll just call it number of doors so number of doors as integer and when we press enter uh let's see uh yes this is not not case sensitive so let's go ahead and call it property number of doors or just to make it a little bit easier to read let's leave this one to number of doors and set this one to INT in number of doors so that we know which data type it is so now we have our number of doors property and we will here let's do this we'll add our get and our set so we'll type get and you can see that adds in get and the set for us and the end of the property so what do we want to get we want to get the number of doors so we'll return int number of doors now we have our uh our set function or our Set uh method so if you know cars can only have or at least uh like normal cars that you see driving around they have either two doors uh all the way up to five doors so let's just add an if statement to keep out any other values uh from to keep out any other values besides 2 to five so if and now the value passed to set that will set the number of doors is called value so if value is greater than or equal to two and if value is greater than or equal to 5 so or less than or equal to 5 then what do we want to do we want to set the number of doors to that value so int number of doors equals value okay so now that we have created this you can see that if the value um is anything else it's not going to set it so let's just tell the user that it has not been set if any other value has been entered so we will just type else and we will type messagebox do show and we will will show we will say uh the number of doors you have entered is not valid okay so now that we've created this property right here number of doors let's go ahead and come back over to our form 1vb code and we'll add another button so we'll go ahead drag this button on here we will set the text to doors and we'll go ahead and set the name to button set doors and we'll double click on that to open up the click event and we'll just get rid of that white space right there so it's group with our button clicked events so let's go ahead and look and see what we did up here well you can see that we used an in input box so we'll type default car dot and let's access the property number of doors you can see that it has the finger and the um little piece of paper because it is a property instead of a an actual variable like car name so default car number of doors equals and what we're going to need to do is convert what they type in to an integer so we'll just type c type and now we need to do is type input box um please enter the number of doors okay so when you call input box um it's going to return a string value to you to you or to the caller so basically what we're putting right here for the first argument is the string that is returning by input box so we're going to be converting a string to a type integer okay so now it will set the number of doors and basically when you call default car. number of doors and use the equals sign it's going to call the uh set method and it's going to use this right here as the value that it uses for that so let's go ahead and run this uh but first let's go up here and we need to um change the two string so let's get rid of this message box right here and we'll come back here to all cars and for our override two string let's go ahead and show the number of doors so we'll do that just before the car speed so we'll type number of doors and then we will add default or we'll add um number of doors and then we'll just add a new line and then we'll add another and sign okay so now when we call two string it will give us all of this stuff back so we'll go ahead and set the name of it to uh or let's do to a challenger and we'll go ahead and click okay we'll set the color to Black and we'll set the number of doors to four so when we show info we get Challenger SRT8 black and number of doors is equal to four now if we set the number of doors to something like seven and click okay we get a message box that says the number of doors you have entered is not valid so we'll go ahead and try that again we'll do four doors right there and click show info and we get all the info about our car so if you haven't typed this code in I I highly suggest you do that because you will learn a lot from typing it in yourself and making changes to it and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial and thanks for watching
