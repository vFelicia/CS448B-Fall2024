okay so today we're going to talk about surface area of a pyramid so a pyramid is a threedimensional object with four triangular faces that and one rectangular base now for the formula we're going to use this rectangular base is always going to be a square so this is congruent to this side so to find the surface area of a pyramid you're going to find the surface area of each face and add them together so we're going to write our own little formula right here surface area equals first we're going to find the area of the base which is going to be length times width or because it's a Square side squared plus the area of this triangle which if they had this height drawn in for you remember it has to be this this perpendicular height which is perpendicular to the base and I know it's kind of hard to see because I can't show you a pyramid but um this side when you draw in your height it's going to be perpendicular to the base so to find the area of one triangle we're going to take2 base times height and since each one of these triangles is going to be congruent because the only way this pyramid will compl completely close up top is if each one of them are congruent we're going to multiply this by four so now now let's do an example so surface area is what we're trying to find so first we're going to find the area of the base which is 8 * 8 + 4 12 time base time height and they drew our height in and told us it was equal to five now if you remember since this is a square that means that every one of these sides has to be congruent that's why every one of these triangles is going to have the same area because if I try to find the area for this triangle it's also going to be 1 12 base time height every single triangle is going to have that so you don't have to worry about not getting the right area so 8 * 8 is 64 plus 12 * 8 is 4 4 * 5 is 20 20 * 4 is 80 so we get 64 + 80 so surface area is equal to 144 and pretend us they told that this this was in inches so we have 144 in squared cuz remember area is always is a twodimensional measurement so we have to have units that show that we are twodimensionally twodimensionally measuring it so let's do one more example so we have a square base 6x6 and a height of 10 now what we're going to do is we're going to find the area of the square so 6 * 6 + 4 1 12 * base * height surface area is equal to 6 * 6 is 36+ 12 * 6 is 3 * 10 is 30 * 4 is0 so if you add these two together you'll get 15 6 and pretend these were in cenm it'd be 156 cm squared now if you don't have units you can always write 156 unit squared which just shows that you know that you have to have a one di a twodimensional unit even though they didn't give you any that just shows that yeah you know what you're talking about so that's our last example um and that's all we're doing with surface area today but make sure you come back and watch the next video cuz we're going to go into volume of a pyramid and that's a little bit different
