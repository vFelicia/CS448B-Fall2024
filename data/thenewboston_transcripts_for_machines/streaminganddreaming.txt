all right all right right right right actually let me see on youtube beautiful and by the way that's my chair not me all right you guys got me okay let's see what are we gonna do today hey what up what up all right today i gotta make some uh docks however i figure it might as well stream it wasn't a fart it was my chair what up man got a couple people here very cool what's up all right got some saudi arabia chem america okay let's get to it so what do i got my docket today teaching videos man lots of people love me too hey hey ferds muhammad james james there you go lots of beanies by the way all right today i don't got anything too exciting i just have to write up some tickets and then design some like wireframes because whenever we have like a feature for the website like today what i have to do is we have we have a test net for the network and we need to put that test net information on the website however it's not just uh like ready to hand off to design right now since the designers don't know about test net or ip addresses ports protocols so i essentially have to give them a really basic wireframe and i'll show you guys oh you can't even see my screen can you let's do this share screen entire screen yeah should we do application window and let's do the entire screen all right so we got my entire screen in all right little inception there but i'll show you guys these and then you guys will understand what i'm doing so whenever we get out of here thing nice to see you too nice to see you guys all right so essentially whenever we have a feature for the website i go in some application using lucidchart right now and create something like this and then i give a very like uh the most basic wireframe that i can and any technical details i leave a note and also some of the flow like if you click this then this model pops up so on and so forth and then i give this to the design team mainly christy and then she turns it into something beautiful like this and that is our main process and it's been working out really good because okay let's go through some of these uh comments all right how am i doing i'm doing good how are you doing by the way how's my audio too quiet too loud what's up daviesh big fan okay excellent flexible man frederick all right major sauce videos audio good okay sounding good like we're ready to roll also another thing i might as well just ask you guys instead of trying to figure out whenever i uh do these streams are you more interested in kind of seeing the software development process and how things work or would you prefer if i just answered did you guys hear that or would you prefer if i answered uh questions the majority of the time or mix of both skipped cs1 in college thanks to bucky awesome it makes it both okay how many hours do i study on average every day so i have a job so not as much as i would like to um so my typical day is essentially uh wake up and then i gotta get shower go to work and then after work i usually meet or have a meeting or two because after work i'm working on the digital currency so i usually have a meeting or two with either the design team or the product team marketing team whatever and then after that i have a huge checklist of things to do like reviewing tickets or uh merging npr's so on and so forth writing up road maps doing this and then after that uh late at night i usually have dinner and then read or study until i fall asleep so it's pretty cool uh pretty cool life actually all right what else we got however relevant would you say your tutorials from four to six years ago are as of today i would say a lot of them are pretty relevant the ones that are probably uh give you some trouble is the ones that i teach software things like photoshop or illustrator i have a feeling those are pretty out of date but a lot of the programming concepts they stick around some things like react and redux they a lot of the newer ones or that were new back then they changed things up a little bit but i would say the majority of it is uh still relevant maybe not as high def as the current ones are but uh okay what do we got now any plans on a new podcast maybe you could do with your friends developers tmb or community that's another thing you just reminded me of actually um let me stop sharing my screen for a second because what i want to do is why am i so not high def right now i'm like 10p come on stream okay so anyways uh caleb curry told me on streamyard that you can invite other people however i don't know how so if anyone used streamyard before and knows how to invite other people oh guess play a sound when guests enter definitely guess messed authenticate i don't think i want that okay so let's see now if you were a stream how would you invite someone to it am i unfocused for you guys as well this is definitely not 1080p this is 10.8 p which is game boy color camera all right so i see people saying invite man this this is aggravating now what do i need to do and that did not work fantastic uh let's see let's see it was going good hey was i hd at the beginning it's focusing on background i'm over here cam oh that was actually pretty focused was better earlier should i restart the shrimp i don't know if that's gonna gonna help hmm debate debate 720p but it doesn't look like it nah this is definitely not all right so let's figure out a couple things let's figure out how to invite people on stream yard all right so let's go to settings and see if it's in here also i can okay so my camera resolution is different definitely 1080p in settings although it doesn't look like it okay audio's good green screen i should just uh message caleb on discord uh oh hey i'm gonna make uh san jeeve spamming like crazy maybe putting down the camera a bit would help uh oh there we go the old trick of the hand i like to call it okay now one last task to complete and that is how to invite people on stream yard video i don't want to watch a video okay joining the broadcast your host should provide you with a link before the show okay did not do that so do i need to have a link before actually you know what okay okay all right so we got something here uh varshith kumar said there should be an invite link but now where so if you were invite link where would you be and i and i will do some researching as well we'll tag team it we'll get it together figure this out okay how to invite to stream and destination broadcast you broadcast this enter broadcast studio okay i'm in the broadcast studio invited guests depending on your guests this is where all guests include oh add to stream i do have that oh here we go invite at the bottom wait my screen isn't showing is it okay okay check it out send this link to your guest you may also want to share instructions for guests and what are these instructions because i told someone earlier today that you did not have to download anything okay your host should provide you a link before the show apparently this is a show and okay fantastic easy enough so let's try it out who's going to be my first guest on the show thank you nazmul hussain hey you know i should actually post this in my uh slack as well man a lot of people okay what's the plan for the stream so i was uh going to oh don't tell me this thing again that's what i have to do every time okay so let's go ahead and invite someone to the stream just to test that out jesus rosario 199 with the super sticker thank you jesus rosario i like that name i think i i think i'm going to change my name to that all right guys my name is jesus rosario from now on log into your account one second okay oh oh god some more okay i need some mods on this thing gotta all right let me put these users okay do you update your webcam drivers recently that can cause issues sometimes i have never updated my webcam drivers so that would explain it entering allow this allow all right the new boston how am i doing today i am doing absolutely all right this isn't is annoying now i'm doing fantastic what if i turn my lights up all right let's see if that worked display name is bucky and all right check you got both my videos on here what's going on here oh this is interesting oh we got my laptop on here all right i just sent a message to christy seeing if she wants to test my stream in but oh am i still on here we'll see if she does okay let's get jacob clevenger wheatley i mean i know i'm not supposed to have favorites on the new boston community but how can you not love wheatley core come on what did i have for dinner so the only thing i plan on having for dinner is these very very small bag of peanuts are you kidding camera okay however then i realized that this is probably the loudest thing i could possibly eat on camera so uh let's see what else was that hey bucky will you kindly share your video plans for 2021 so the plans are and this is uh most likely gonna change but as of now they are essentially to finish the digital currency tutorials and that should just take uh a few days uh maybe a week at most and then i recently took a poll on twitter and krisha helped me uh tally one of the members of the community helped me to tally the results and the top voted for was actually python which i was surprised because i figured a lot of you would be sick of python by now but essentially we are rolling out with docker aws and flutter are gonna be top three i don't know exactly what order they're gonna be in but those are gonna be top three and then okay some more suggestions coming in and then what we are going to do is go back and see what you guys want to watch most so at least those three but if there's any other things then yeah let me know plans for a go tutorial so go and rust were two of the top um languages so yes yep okay and another question i got right now was data structures and algorithms so this is something i wanted to ask you guys so a lot of people were asking about data structures and algorithms tutorials however it seems that the community is kind of divided in half right now because even though um a lot of people would like those let me just quit this real quick another set of the community is saying that oh everyone's creating these data structure and algorithm tutorials on youtube so they just want me to make something else to have unique content but what do you guys think i figure i got a couple people here now unit testing okay is it cold um it is not cold here however check this out i have had these headphones for a long time and if i don't have any hat on then these things uh this like little fake leather maybe it's real lever it's like flakes off and it gets all over my face so yeah don't really dig it harmon can i pronounce your name i will not harmon absolutely not harmon okay wtf data structures and algorithms nice headphones finally some appreciation for the headphones don't got the comments about the toothbrush okay vue.js all right i i should make videos that interest me well i like uh yes they are sennheiser so i think uh my interests will are mostly fulfilled by the digital currency network that we're building it's just a huge community huge open source project it's basically every single thing that i love doing and what i wanted to do with the videos is actually do two things i wanted to listen from the community since that's where i get all my ideas if i'm not then you know you guys are just gonna peace out since if i'm not creating content you don't like but another thing i was hoping to do is actually create the videos that would benefit the network as well so right now we are going to so right now we're in alpha so people coming onto the network and starting up nodes isn't that uh high of a priority right now but later on people are going to need to know aws skills or networking skills docker skills what have you so kind of like that and also whenever we were ready to start developing mobile applications then i could teach flutter react native uh native app development android ios so that's kind of the general plan and then it'll just all right get some other questions here so anyways yeah uh i missed something up here i saw from okay jacob oof i've had that recently happened my headsets before switched to some wireless ones that are lifechanging okay lifechanging i need to know what these this headset is now lifechanging what are my hobbies outside of tech hmm do i have any hobbies outside of tech wow this is uh getting depressing now so yeah i don't know if i do have any chess that was uh i used to be really in the chess and who asked this by the way nikhil meta yeah i mean uh okay i have to slow down these questions so yeah i do work uh i'm a director of engineering during the day and then later i work on digital currency network and then on the weekends i just like to uh keep working on it and then study about different blockchain technologies different cryptocurrencies um i don't know it's i never feel like oh only tech only tech it's something i always enjoy i like building i like the fact that you can create something that connects so many people pretty much just typing here um yeah it's uh it's never i don't feel the burnout that a lot of other developers do okay saddam gianty said shout out my name i like how everyone that says shout out my name is always people with the difficult names to say like you're just messing with me or something all right ozar's algister this is so embarrassing trying to say trying to say everyone's name but we got 5.49 canadian baby that's what i'm talking about thank you have to say ozers owl gerster all right i hope that was close at least all right usual sharma says sir some advice for beginners uh mr sharma what exactly would you like advice on okay let's see let's see imagine lev 11 year old 11 year old kid watching this video okay is your digital currency tutorials for beginners this was another hard thing and of course i'm gonna answer this with a little story so whenever okay so whenever i'm creating a video tutorial like python um javascript whatever it's pretty easy for me to look at the subject from the perspective of a beginner someone new to python uh someone new to programming someone new to photoshop it's um it's pretty uh easy to get into that perspective now the issue in the big challenge i had to teaching these digital currency tutorials was that instead of just someone who wanted to learn about digital currency i know that the audience was going to be a mix of people just from the new boston like designers and people learning photoshop but also in tech there were going to be people who were brand new to blockchain maybe just heard of blockchain before but didn't really dive into it and there's also going to be another set of people who are like expert devops and they've been working with solidity and have their own erc20 token so it was difficult for me to put myself in their shoes when each person's shoes was so different so to answer your question is that series made for beginners i tried to tailor it for beginners but there may be some things in there that i kind of went over quickly just so i didn't i didn't aggravate the more experienced users but is mostly shifted and tailored towards beginners and okay let me okay tanveer ahmed five bucks thank you tamber ahmed and hahaha call it a pair very cool okay uh let's see let's see let's see how much time do you spend with your family and kids so i do not have any kids um my family lives in new york and i wasn't able to see him for a while actually i went there last christmas and then this the virus hit i'm in california now so i haven't been able to get back but i am hoping to get back uh this christmas even though i'm in the united states was like number one worst country ever for the virus and then i would have to fly through la to new york city which are like the two cities that are spiking so i don't have a real good feeling about you know what's coming up in the next couple weeks but you know that answer your question okay pranav gupta i got a feeling that we are not going to get any work done by the way but um pranav gupta have you heard about white hat jr any views on that so i saw this on my uh suggested youtube and then i saw it on reddit i think yesterday and then maybe someone even posted it on the new boston slack i remember but i haven't had time to look into it or even see what it is what is white hat jr and what is this debate i actually want to get up to speed on this um shui baby that's what i'm talking about uh whoa what is this what is this okay question question any plans on making goaling or rust tutorials yes those are two of the highest voted um programming languages that in the twitter poll people mention so there definitely is plans to make those and awesome languages by the way uh let's see please don't spam okay i gotta time out someone put them in timeout okay anyone who spams and gets timed out i should put jacob clevenger's mod as well kyle longrich 20 bucks uh oh focus kyle long rich kyle longrich 20 donation thank you kyle and so this is only my so this is only my second day streaming so kyle now has the record of donations this is cool it's my biggest donation ever okay uh okay i am i didn't scroll down to see what the um debate about whitehead junior is about but let's see what else we got bucky will you give a tutorial on erlang hmm that's not one i hear too often maybe if i'm making a communication type app i don't know to be honest uh probably not in the near term actually what are your interests man minaj i'm not even gonna try to say that last name but what are you interested in building with it that'll be interesting to hear okay nikhil said white hat jr has been very hot recently now let's see james said wish i could donate tnbc coins through youtube that would be sweet i was actually talking with christy a little bit earlier because i told her that i started shreeban and she asked if i like needed any graphics for my youtube banner or i like those little emojis that people can use so on and so forth and one second so we were talking about these uh different so kind of just comparing slack versus discord and then youtube versus twitch talking about the different communities and the different functionality the different uh just things that arise from it and discord and twitch seem to have a lot more like uh developing developing built in since you could build all these bots for it so on and so forth but maybe there is a way i never programmed a twitch spot before or a discord bot for that matter but i don't know that would be a very cool thing to teach as well actually i'm going to write that down that was a good suggestion tnbc coins thank you james for that suggestion okay what up are you interested in video games like minecraft from air run brawl so believe it or not i'm not a big gamer i don't like first person shooters i rarely play any computer games i don't even have a ps3 i mean all right i'm pretty sure uh we're on five now but there is my gaming knowledge where i don't have an xbox or playstation however are you kidding me i do have a nintendo switch and i do have minecraft for it and i really really love games where you can build like a system like not so much roller coaster tycoon more like minecraft where you can just discover things and put them together and like you build a huge tower or like these little gears that are connected i don't know just like taking simple things and putting them together into more complex systems so i would say to your question do you like games like minecraft i absolutely do those are probably the only type of games i like go laying or rust yes making tutorials on those 20 21. all right got some comments here uh let me scroll up scroll scroll all right a coding scam 10year kid getting google job a coding scan yeah for this uh all right so i think i might have missed it but this white hat jr um so whitehead jr was someone who created tutorials i should probably just look it up but okay how did i come up with the name the new boston this is a very disappointing story that um disappointing if you're looking for a cool story behind it but i actually just was choosing a youtube name and i had no idea that i was going to be creating tutorials or teaching anything this was before any of that so i'm just sitting there trying to come up with a youtube name i was like what sounds cool the new boston that sounds pretty cool if i would have foreseen that i would be creating tutorials and teaching millions of people then i definitely would have put a lot more thought into it but yeah that is um that's pretty much all i got for you all right it's a learning platform for learning basic coding for kids huh and i'm guessing putting together the info now so i'm guessing white hat jr was teaching kids and then they like ripped them off somehow i'm guessing something not good happened all right all right do you have any good programming in quant finance i do not no technical analysis i was actually looking recently just for like a library in python or something just with lots of technical analysis uh like functions already built in surprisingly i could not find one so yeah what about react.js uh so i already taught i think a bit of react and then react redux so on and so forth i haven't heard too many requests for react.js but yeah something to consider okay i think your slack link has expired or something the one on reddit yeah these slack links it's kind of annoying because every time i create a link it only is good for 30 days and then if i post it in a readme or anything so on our github we have like 20 different repos and i like to post the link on each readme but then after 30 days whenever it expires i have to go update each one so kind of annoying but uh yes so on reddit i'll remember to update that who is this by the way who told me that who told me that told me that utkarsh doobie oh car stubby thank you for that slack link and also if you guys want to join our slack if you go to thenewboston.com and i believe in one of the drop downs that says join community then you can click on slack or if you don't feel like dropping something down you can just go to thedoomboston.com and right there on the main hero there's a little uh button with a slack logo on it so you can click that as well you know whatever way you want to get in just follow your heart okay let's see let's see one at a time your thoughts on degrees versus certifications for tech so okay so both are good and if you have either one it's not going to hurt you for getting a job software companies want the best developers straight up whether that develop developer came from studying on their own whether they went to a boot camp whether they got certifications online whether they went to school it doesn't really matter a lot of these things like degrees and certification those are good for getting you past the resume phase where if you just said no experience then you're probably not going to get an interview now if you say that you have a master's degree or you are certified in aws for example then you're a lot more likely however it feels like once you are once you got the interview then it pretty much just comes down to talent so whether you are no matter where you're from um you essentially need to get in the door and then you need to prove that you got the skills so uh degrees first certs another thing about that is some companies care a lot about your degree in your experience and some are more um they don't care about it that much and some are just open to boot campers some aren't so on and so forth so it's heavily dependent on the actual company but in general i would say work on improving your skills uh join open source projects make sure you have a nice portfolio and you'll be looking really good okay let's see let's see please enable slow mode i think i do have slow mode enabled unless i have to enable it for each one well what is this i see a 50 thing up there but did someone just donate 50 okay oh let me scroll okay lots lots of stuff going on here uh which book is on your back desk what is that i mean i could clearly just turn around and look but rather just look into my monitor so this is mastering aetherium what was i learned about yesterday uh i think i was all right so yeah uh we are looking into creating an erc20 token so we can wrap the new boston coins and get them on decentralized exchange and i was just uh that was the book that i read before bed last night it was my bedtime story ethereum books okay your real name please i'm not telling i'm not telling but i did show it in my a lot of my tutorials so if anyone knows it do not tell it's a top secret info any plans on making dart and flutter tutorials yes um flutter is okay so aws docker and flutter are the top three most requested tutorials and then after that i am going to be looking for others have i heard of see a network decentralized data storage i have not i'm going to look this up too this is like the most helpful stream ever and i was actually looking for something like this are you kidding me come on camera focus just focus okay see and who said that i want to make sure uh see you see i see uh can't you see sia yep decentralized data storage all right so infraro dude 11 i was actually looking because we want to store some um some separate chains somewhere okay real name still not telling uh what do you think are the best certificates to get into the it feel so i would say that this is uh heavily dependent on which area of it you want to get into for example um this design count as it i'm not sure but like programming versus uh devops and cloud computing it's just a separate set of certificates that they would be looking for okay here we go add astro white had junior teacher online code into any kids during this time that doesn't sound that bad james paying is basically tricking indian parents to get their children to take thousand dollar courses okay that does sound bad okay uh so so this is unique teaches coding to indian kids why only indian kids and also tricking any parents to get their children uh to take thousand dollar courses um so was the course just oh okay let me turn this down so was the course like um bad or did they like since like i guess universities like thousand dollar courses i'm guessing that it just was not high quality or maybe they promised something that they didn't deliver okay let's see let's see uh functional programming tutorial that's an interesting suggestion i haven't heard that before okay how many indian subscribers do you have so fun fact the majority of my subscribers are from india so i don't know exactly how many but probably close to a million and then right after that is uh the united states and then after india in the united states there's a big dip and then all the other countries are kind of like um like third fourth fifth so on and so forth but india number one and then us and then earth thing else all right uh dexter talbert dude i owe you my career okay awesome dexter seems like things worked out for you glad my videos could help you hopeless decoy white hat jr is a scam please use free websites like youtube and code academy i will uh oh i see okay so white hat jr is a fraud teacher didn't know the difference between java and javascript okay so i i see this now someone said before that um like java is to javascript as car is the carpet i thought that was pretty interesting pretty humorous uh okay mauricio nareval uh thank you thanks for all your tutorials help me get started when i first started mauricio you are welcome and thank you for the five dollar donation mauricio okay okay a lot of gratitude i like it this is a very cool community i feel like this is one of the few um online communities where people just aren't hating each other about you know any little thing in social media what people like to debate about especially the development community that we got going on um it's interesting because and that i really hate to sound like i always uh bash on bitcoin and i i'm not i love bitcoin but like with bitcoin you have miners and they're kind of competing with one another and they're competing because only one miner essentially is going to get that coin reward however with this the coins are distributed through like building a better network and a better community so whenever someone does something cool in design or seo or on the front end team or in devops it's like uh yeah it helps everyone so this community is going strong jacob clevenger wheatley i've written a few discord bots they have some pretty easy to use apis so what i like to hear are you kidding me again unfocused okay and someone else said any plans on making tutorial in earling either this is the same person or there is a sudden uptick of interest in earlying all of the sudden thinking it's the same person manage yep same person okay all right asarus auguster donated 27.99 canadian and he said beat that honestly bucky have no idea what you do but best wishes in merry christmas my username is pronounced okay o s r s og lester osrs auglister by the way lol okay so he hyphenated each one so osrs auguster that's how i'm saying it okay i tried my best here do you play mobus i don't know what that is i think that's i feel like that's an acronym for a popular game but mopes oh hold on my thing just hopped to the bottom dang it uh man now i lost my spot whoa what is this lots okay so apparently i was too slow good youtube a boring streamer man i don't know uh this stream was even supposed to be more boring i was just supposed to be working on something but got caught up in this and let me ask you guys this what would you like to see on the stream would you like me answering questions would you like me coding and follow along with it would you like me um working on the digital currency network because if so i could do that but essentially i have a little bit of free time every day so whatever you guys want to see we will roll with that just like we always have been okay let me try to get through these a little bit faster and here we go can you do a tutorial on react with typescript so this was another thing i so um a lot of people are asking me if i would be interested in teaching typescript and another subset of people said um typescript already has a bunch of videos so you know no need but i will leave that up to you guys kyle longrich fifty dollars he said your art video had me in tears and if you first of all thank you kyle man that is awesome another thing is my other youtube channel i don't even know it's called the new boston tv but if you go to my youtube channel and you click on the related uh channels then or you just type in like bucky roberts art class it was it was quite the experience yeah i remember that so in high school in art class for some reason we always had to do weird stuff so we had to blow up a balloon and then we had to take like slices of clay and lay them on the balloon so like form the clay sphere and then i don't even know what the original project was it couldn't have just been creating like clay spheres but essentially we had to create this this clay sphere and then we had to let it sit overnight to get hard it seemed so silly as i even as i explained it but during the night someone came in and stuck their thumb into my balloon and then my clay was like all weird shaped and it was the only weird one so i'm like uh mr hallett who's my teacher i'm like what do you want me to do about this he's like oh just paint it whatever so i so i painted it and then he submitted it without my knowledge to like the art the art competition or whatever so i can't remember exactly what place that is but it like won the school art show this sphere of clay with a thumb in it this is what art uh qualifies as and then it won like a county art show and then something else so weird but essentially long story short i made a clay balloon someone stuck their thumbnail and i won a bunch of awards so there you go okay let's see let's see apparently you can create a link on your website and use a slack api to generate invite links so that it doesn't expire man nonexpired links this is the most helpful stream i have ever experienced in my life um mostly because it's only my second stream so not a lot to compare it to but helpful as well whitehead junior is a scam okay wait what is this this is interesting so parth os says white hat jr created imaginary characters and are lying to everyone what are these imaginary characters hmm this sounds interesting uh do i recommend learning from books or videos and who asks this harold remus okay so this is my idea on uh the different type of sources that you should be learning from at least what works best for me so hold on got something in my eye and let me focus this bad boy one more time one more time one more time okay good enough all right so i always felt that it was best to learn in the medium that you are actually going to be uh doing that final work for example if you were studying law then it may be best just to read it on a book or study in a book now if you were learning how to build a car or learning automotive uh maybe you wanted to open a body shop then that type of thing would be best learning handson because that's what you're going to do at the very end now with programming the reason that i think that these programming tutorials took off when they did however many years ago whenever i started teaching online is because programming happens on your computer screen what actually happens whenever you program is the text and the characters move you cut copy paste shift things around and you really have a hard time getting that in a book so to be able to understand it and have it taught to you in a way closest to the actual medium i think that's why this channel resonated with a lot of people and whenever i'm learning something new i kind of always keep that in the back of my head like is this kind of reflective of how i'm going to be using it in day to day life all right next next next okay so harold thank you for that and let's see arshad ali with 30 i believe these are indian rupees so i actually don't know what that currency is but got 30 of something and i am loving it so thank you arshad ali all right man what a great stream your favorite food is tuna every example is related to it so this is an interesting thing as well i mentioned this on my twitter in my other stream so fun fact whenever i created tutorials and i started naming things tuna and bacon i wasn't doing it to be funny although i knew that it was kind of funny in the back of my head i was mainly doing it because whenever i first started learning programming i started learning javascript and php now in that book i remember php it was a huge thick book i would go through these examples and it would say like i don't even remember the uh keyword to declare variable in php but um in other languages like javascript it would be like var num equals 10 and i would look at var num and i would say do i have to use num here is this like a builtin keyword oh no like testing around i can see that i can change it what about var did they just name that uh no okay so i couldn't change that one and it was just confusing for me to learn that way since it's learning a new language for the very first time how am i supposed to know what's built in and what isn't so that is why i started using bacon and tuna because whenever i taught those concepts it's very crystal clear to know when you do var bacon one of those one of those clearly is not a keyword that's built into the language and one of them is a builtin keyword so it just easier connects with people so yes bacon tuna that's the story behind that did kyle donate 20 again kyle longridge thank you kyle nice loving this all right any plans to resume old vlogs okay so the thing about resuming old vlogs is i'm gonna need to have something to vlog and right now in quarantine i pretty much just like uh walk around my house sometimes i go outside to go to the grocery store or something but i don't think that it would be interesting for people if i vlogged right now basically just me sitting in a chair okay let's see let me get through these teachers teachers didn't know what java is okay uh did solo learn rip off your tutorials so i don't know who solo learn is but i'm guessing if you're asking that question then most likely they did all right we see chares ali modding thank you headset mike looks like a toothbrush headset mic looks like a toothbrush this is actually a toothbrush i just keep it attached to my head just because i don't like walking to the bathroom what up with lola i don't know i texted her a few years ago but that was the last time i kept in contact with her seeing they're right and let me get through some of these some of these man lots of spam lots of spam okay when these people spam i wonder if they type in this manually or have a bot or what okay let me put this guy on timeout one more okay um thoughts about dsa i do say is that digital signature algorithm if so i love it ec dsa yeah baby okay the solo learn rip off the tutorials again guessing definitely now is this another test stream uh unfortunately not these streams are just getting out of hand i start with a very clear goal of something i want to accomplish then i just get lots of questions so i don't know it's cool with me okay muhammad ella's ali is learning web development worth it in 2021 absolutely it's worth it more than any other year web development is not going anywhere soon okay this is interesting mr skye bitcoin is a dumpster fire they should have made the block sizes bigger ages go mr skye if this is the same mr skye from me community then this guy is absolutely killing it with all his contributions all his different ideas loving them mr skye big shout out and yes that uh a dumpster fire huh i don't know if i would say that i mean bitcoin has been pretty successful have you ever found someone passing off videos your videos as theirs yes quite often unfortunately it happens all the time usually to be honest i don't do much about it they end up getting reported by other members in the community eventually but the the only huge issue i have is when people sell my content which i saw on like udemy i think a couple people have had issues with you to me but that's the only thing that really irks me okay okay okay let's see let's see okay so youtube keeps clearing out because i'm going too slow trying to get through these guys let's see where did you go for four years uh so i made a video called hello world and that's on my youtube channel so probably if you just type in the new boston hello world i explain all of that and let's see okay scrolling up you've impacted a lot of lives positively you are inspiring me keep up the good work narage thank you and that is what motivates me and to be able to impact lots of lives positively and to be able to do it by doing what i love doing and be part of an awesome community it i am very fortunate in where i ended up in life and i never forget that okay what language you use to create blockchain for your digital currency so surprisingly because of the specific algorithm that we use we were able to create it using python and not only that but is scalable perform it got transactions ripping in well under a second so um we were able to do this because it doesn't rely heavily on computations or mining or anything like that like a lot of other cryptocurrencies do for that logic we shifted it down to the humans now make that decision and also those decisions a lot of them are made beforehand i don't want to get into it since i know a lot of people are here for other things but python however we are we want to write it in lots of other languages as well do i play video games i do not uh mokera although i will say that i do have a nintendo switch and if you ever go on a plane nintendo switches are the best thing to pass the time on a plane i used to hate traveling i used to hate flying but i remember i went uh overseas and then i like flew to new york back to la there were times when i would be playing a game and then we would land and i'm like oh man i just want to finish this game so i don't know i always thought that was kind of cool a switch is definitely a lifesaver another thing is i i remember thinking this where i was playing my nintendo switch on the plane and after a while i'm like oh man i really wish i could just you know uh go home be done with this plane ride and then i started thinking what would i do when i was home and then i was like oh i'll probably just be sitting down playing switch so funny how things are and this was a while ago by the way i've matured since then a long time ago at least like two or three months ago so okay for android development specific language you'd recommend so surprisingly i have been i haven't been keeping up with the android development landscape unfortunately can you make tutorials on new python version so the updates in python over the years they haven't changed too much where you would really need a new tutorial maybe there are some things that would just throw an error but you might just have to look up and i can't even think of anything off the top of my head but um all of the python tutorials i created before especially python 3 they are still completely relevant will you continue your django series okay so i i did make a lot of tutorials in django django arrest framework but if you guys want more yeah let me know and let me uh also mention tr1xz so thank you for that suggestion uh let's see let's see broadcast seems to be delayed by a lot um man so much spam i gotta sort through don't all tech education channels have majority indian subs i am not sure i mean india has a lot of people uh let's see oh imaginary characters equals fake testimonials so with whitehead junior okay i see what's going on here target sixyearolds learn code so and so forth okay what are your thoughts on the price of tesla in nvidia stocks in the coming years so so first of all i didn't expect tesla stock to shoot up like uh tulip bulbs recently and i just have no explanation for that whatsoever um so the next couple years so the stock market so i am bullish mainly because i know that the fed is keeping their uh rate down until like 2022 or something so we're just gonna have a flood of money coming into the market basically any assets especially with uh high market cap companies and also what i've seen is i don't wanna be like uh cryptocurrency advocate but a lot of money seem to be shifting towards um bitcoin specifically a lot of institutional money and uh all right actually on the topic this is something that you guys would be interested in and i actually never mentioned this before i didn't know if it was a good idea but i will tell you now and i mention this one second so i mentioned this because uh let me see who just asked that actually uh tesla tested tesla and i keep forgetting okay so because they ask questions about investing and i'll uh tell you guys about a cool little investing thing that i was doing for a couple years i'll tell you now since i i'm uh kind of involved in this now and it actually plays into how this digital currency started so cool story so whenever i moved to california and started working as director of engineering i put a lot of my time into my job and i'm sure you guys know this from my hello world video or whatnot but essentially a lot of my time and energy was focused on my job i wanted to make sure that we built the software right uh just that everything was good so because i didn't have a lot of time just to like hang out uh with my friends or free time whatever i ended up with some spare cash in my bank account and i know that just leaving cash in your bank account isn't a good idea because everyone's else cash is growing and then mine is just staying the same uh depreciating every year so i figured okay i should put some of this in the stock market so at first i was just researching some companies that i was familiar with so like uh um google amazon all the big tech companies uh so on and so forth just because i knew that tech was always increasing or it was like it wasn't going anywhere and i'm in tech and i knew that the industry had like a bright future in front of it so that is how i kind of started my career in stock investing in my career i mean like 10 minutes a day uh investing any spare money in stocks but here's the cool thing and let me focus because this is important okay so after a while what i would do is i would go to this website called finviz and i would check my uh stock prices there just to see like oh google went up like two percent today so that was pretty cool now what i noticed whenever i went to finviz is that on their homepage at least they did back then i'm pretty sure they still do now but on their home page they have a list of all the top gainers and all the top losers or bottom losers that like the most uh best performing stocks in the worst performing stocks for today now what i noticed is that the best performing stocks they weren't typically stocks like tesla or google or amazon they always seem to be biotech stocks so i was like wait a minute why are these entire companies like doubling in value in a day like i know whenever amazon releases a new feature or some company gets acquired or something then that's the reason they jump up but what was it about these biotech companies that would either cause them to lose like 80 of the value 100 of the value or just like double overnight since i'm thinking in my head there's no way that a company doubles in value overnight it's not like they just copy and paste all their locations and customers and it didn't make sense so i looked into it and what happens with biotech companies is this specifically the smaller biotech companies they only develop a limited number of drugs so they have like one or three drugs that they develop across the span of like 10 years now in the united states whenever you want to develop a drug and by the way this is uh pretty cool so if you're not interested in biotech i would stick around okay so whenever you develop a drug in the united states you have to go through a bunch of different phases like phase one phase two phase three essentially breaking it down very simply you need to test it on more people and you need to test like efficacy and all these different things but you can just think of it like this for now phase one you test it on ten or dozens of people phase two you need to test it on hundreds of people in phase three you need to test it on thousands that's a very uh brief it's not accurate at all but you can just think of it like that so um technicals aside that's the general uh process now with cancer drugs and a lot of these uh more serious drugs like not foot creams or anything the entire testing process happens over the scope of like 10 years so it isn't like okay let's just get this rolled out right now so on each of these phases that's when these big announcements came out because it's like we had this three year long trial and we're either going to announce that this trial was successful or the trial failed now if it was successful and it's pretty much the only product that these biotech companies had to look forward to if you had good results then that is why the company will like jump up double in value each night now if they had bad results of course if your only one product your company has has very bad results then of course it's a reason for it to dip down a lot so i also uh figured out around that time about something called stock options where uh i know a lot of you guys on wall street bets are like oh here we go but it's interesting because you can bet uh a little i don't even want to say bet you can invest a little amount of money and then you can get some really high returns the thing is that unlike a stock your investment if the stock price just stays flat then it pretty much um decreases every every day now i don't know if this is going to make sense without going over stock options but okay i'll just briefly touch on this so for those who don't know what stock options are whenever you buy a stock you're buying essentially like part of the company whenever you are buying a stock option what you what that is is it's essentially a contract to say the person with this contract has the right to buy these shares at a certain price now it's kind of confusing to think of it like stocks and shares and whatnot but check this out so if i had a house and i wanted to sell the house for a hundred thousand dollars or maybe we can say that the value of the house right now is a hundred thousand dollars now i am around the area where i feel like the house is going to go up in value over time so this is uh let me let me try to break this down okay so i want to sell my house for a hundred thousand dollars and someone else knew a little bit more than me about this area pasadena so it knew that the pasadena rose parade was coming in that a lot of people would be flocking to the pasadena area in that house prices for whatever reason we're just going to go way up in value or maybe he thought that uh the original guitar of elvis was buried under my apartment and that if you own this apartment then you would have access to it but for whatever reason someone else would think that the value of my apartment was going to shoot up past the hundred thousand dollars in the near future so instead of buying my apartment directly because that costs a hundred thousand and it's a lot of money what they could do is they could offer me or we could essentially work out something called an option so what this would mean is that something like this hey bucky i'm interested in uh i could possibly be interested in buying your apartment however if you do not sell it in the next six months then what i would like to do is we can have a contract and you would give me the option of buying it in the next six months now here's the thing whenever i would give them the option that doesn't mean that they have to buy my apartment or they don't have to buy it this contract would just be the option to buy it so what is the point of this whole contract when you can just buy the apartment straight up well let's say that the contract only cost a thousand dollars now i wanted to sell my apartment regardless so worst case scenario that at the end of the six months they want to cash in that contract so they would already have paid me a thousand dollars and then a hundred thousand dollars more for my apartment now the other situation is that if we had that contract for a thousand dollars so i got a thousand dollars at the end of that time they didn't want to buy my apartment then okay i'm right back to where i started right now where i still have to put my apartment on the market but i still got a thousand dollars from that contract so it's a very low cost high reward for him because this is the thing the contract itself is a thousand dollars it's not a hundred thousand however with that contract whoever holds it it essentially says the holder of this contract can buy this apartment in the next six months for a hundred thousand dollars okay interesting however if this apartment goes up to a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in value then that little piece of paper that contract is essentially saying that you can buy this apartment for a hundred thousand dollars and you can sell it right away on the market for a hundred and fifty thousand dollars so essentially the holder of that contract that contract would be worth fifty thousand dollars now if you only paid a thousand dollars for that contract then you could sell it for 50 times the price and here's the other beautiful thing is that the person who owns that contract they never had to pay for the apartment they never needed a hundred thousand dollars in fact the person who wanted to pay for that contract and buy it they never intended to buy my apartment in the first place they just wanted to write the right to buy my apartment so they could sell it to someone else if that apartment went up in value so now that we know what options are essentially an option just means the option to buy something at a certain price for a certain period of time so here's where things get interesting so i already knew that we had these stocks that fluctuated a lot like 80 90 sometimes they doubled in value over 100 now with that huge fluctuation and on top of that if you could also take out a proper option to essentially leverage or that just means like magnify your gains it was a little more risky of an investment rather than just investing in the company directly but if you got it right then it could be um a pretty nice game so now we get to play the game of what is the stock going to do so these announcements these phase 1 phase 2 phase three um clinical trial announcements they happen every so years so often and these announcements are known ahead of time so companies would say something like i'm gonna announce on january 1st the results of the phase 3 trial now even though you knew the announcement was coming up the company obviously didn't tell you whether the trial was good or bad so i knew that just by looking over the website everything in the press release there wasn't going to be any information there and even if there was information there it wasn't really going to be that useful because by the time it got to me everyone else would have already sifted through it i'm sure they have bots to scan uh you know like understand the reading whatever but i figured that any information that the company publicly puts out i would just be behind the ball because i wouldn't have access to that information first so then i started thinking if i don't have access to that information in i of course am not part of like the internal company how could i know whether the results were going to be positive or negative before they announced any information at all and what i figured was that okay instead of looking at the data that they put out since i wasn't really getting anywhere with that let's start stop and think of how a company behaves and what they do whenever they are about scale up or whenever they are about to scale down now scaling down is a little bit hard to see from an outsider's perspective because you typically just let people go and there's you know not so much that i can learn however when these companies were about to announce a positive trial what did that mean well on phase one you needed to test your drug on dozens of people on phase two you need to test on hundreds in phase three you needed to test that on thousands more or less so what this means is that whenever they were prepping to scale up they would need to hire more clinical trial managers nurses uh they would need to open more locations so on and so forth so even though the company was not able to tell the public hey these uh announcements that are coming out in january they're going to be good or they're going to be bad they give off a lot of different indicators without directly saying it so what i would do is a little while like probably starting two or three weeks before is i would go to their linkedin and their website and essentially anywhere it depends on different companies have hiring different hiring practices but i would essentially just go through all of their job postings and i actually had had a little graph where i tracked how many openings they had for like months and then right before the announcement i could see the openings start going up and up and then i would read each one to make sure that it matched the positions that would be needed if that company was successful so just the uh different positions that they posted in on the last phase of the drug you get ready to like go to market more or less so they start hiring marketing people but before that they start hiring people just to beef up operations like to hand out the drugs or open locations whatever so the job postings gave me a very very very good indicator of what was going to happen with that company in the future and thinking more about it i always thought like this a job posting whenever you post it on linkedin it's essentially i don't know if you guys can see my hands a job posting is essentially a template or blueprint for an actual person that's going to be working at your company in the future so when you say i am hi or i have a job posting for um a senior devops engineer right now that's what we're hiring for well that means in about three months you are going to have a senior devops engineer working at that company so then you just start thinking okay why would a company need a senior devops engineer well in this case it would be because maybe they were scaling maybe they were moving to a cloud this or that but if you guys are interested in investing and you want a little bit deeper information about a company and their plans for the future all i'm saying is a pretty good indication of where to look could be their job postings again i want to stress this is not financial advice um i am not a financial whiz but you know just just sharing the story and another thing since i know a lot of people are gonna ask uh some other info that you can look at if you go to clinicaltrials.gov it's actually the best website for exactly what i was going to do because they have like version control more or less of the different areas that they open so whenever they announce like so clinicaltrials.gov is in the united states you can post the drug on there and i can't but like big companies can and they can start recruiting people with those diseases or disorders and they would test these drugs at different locations so at first they might test it at a couple universities but then on the next phase of the trial they may expand to other universities or other locations hospitals i'm actually not exactly sure like what type of locations however on that website you can see that there are two locations in this month and next month there are 10 locations and next month there are 30. so anyways all i'm trying to say is um i got a little bit derailed there but with investing there's limited amounts of information that a company is going to release to the public however there are certain things that companies need to do whenever they scale up that are not so obvious and they aren't allowed to announce of course their intentions however since companies do need to grow in higher there are lots of little clues so you know hopefully that helps someone out or if you think that's ridiculous then let me know as well okay uh one more thing and i promise is it and i guess this does tie into everything after all so after a while i was uh pulling a bunch of information uh i had lots of programs built to pull all this information of uh these i don't want to say because i don't wanna you know say i'm gonna be pulling information from somewhere that i should not have been it was all legal all legitimate but i was pulling information and i had it on my dashboard and it was essentially all the drugs that were coming out and so on and so forth however the thing about this is that the amount of time and energy i put into developing these applications to kind of one second to kind of analyze this it wasn't worth it because there were some months where i could invest in like um six or eight drugs and there are other months where there might be only one good one or maybe months where there wasn't any good information at all so i needed to find something that i could invest in that i could study and invest more frequently so i know that with biotech the amount of information was kind of limited and the announcements as well so that's when i looked to the general stock market and what i was trying to do at first was i knew that for normal companies nonbiotech companies that there is a big jump with their earnings so every company on the entire stock market they announce earnings which is essentially like uh of course it's their earning statement now before that they have analysis predict what their earnings are going to be so someone might predict like um they don't say it like this but like we think amazon is going to increase their earnings by like five percent this quarter now that's what the stock price is essentially a benchmark at if they announce lower than five percent then of course their stock goes down higher than five percent then their stock price goes up because it's more valuable than expected essentially so these earnings happen every day or at least every day that the stock market is open so that's what i was trying to predict at that time in my idea which i actually never ended up testing but it was essentially that whenever amazon had higher hurt earnings than expected or any other software company then what that would mean is their company itself was growing faster than expected so they had more revenue from customers which means that they could open up more locations in ramp up operations now in turn what that would mean is that if they needed to ramp up operations open up more locations and hire more employees they were going to need more computers and inside a computer you have more cpus more gpus which means that if i knew that amazon had higher earnings than expected and also if i was able to determine that amazon's supplier whenever they expand operations were nvidia or amd or these different other companies then i would be able to predict from that correlation that because of amazon's earning statement then their suppliers earning statement is more likely to increase as well again i wouldn't use this method i never tested it in real life i never got to it because and this is what i mentioned in the last stream is that whenever i was trying to find that correlation and this ties into the whole digital currency i knew that the model was going to be to be a lot more complex than just two companies connected because the cash flow of companies is very complex it's not that on their earnings statement they just don't say this is how much money we got from customers and this is how much money we spent there's lots of different types of income just like the typical economy where it isn't just uh people pay money to companies and they pay employees like you have uh taxes you have grants uh you have this and that you have retailer suppliers so there's so many different streams of cash coming into a company and going out that the only thing that i could do is essentially build a simulation now in my simulation that i was building of course i plugged in all the companies there since that was the main thing i was trying to figure out but i was essentially trying to map out how the money was flowing in the u.s economy so i added employees in there as well and this was a huge mistake that i made early on but the way that i assumed that the u.s economy worked was essentially that companies make money and then they pay their employees and then their employees go to other companies and they spend money and then that company has money to hire more employees so and so forth now breaking it down to the most simple form i thought it worked like this where companies people no matter what if i were to give you a dollar it would be minus one dollar for me and plus one dollar for you but either way at the end of it you would end up with zero it would be a fair economy and there would be no waste so i thought that this typical idea or concept was just blown out in a very more complex form however what i did not account for was how that money got into the system in the first place so if i gave you a dollar minus one for me plus one for you but how did that dollar get into the economy in the first place so that's when i had to you know figure out how the banking system work and this and that and then that led me to bitcoin and i was able to see oh okay so now i get back bitcoin it's not just another technology it actually is solving an incredibly huge problem however if that's the case then why isn't bitcoin uh more widespread like why isn't it more mainstream should i say and so back then when i was trying to figure out transaction times were a huge bottleneck because uh it was 10 minute transaction times lightning net network wasn't quite a thing yet and okay i'm missing a lot of questions here i'll get back to it but essentially um i saw that if you could reduce the transaction time where people could take a digital currency like this and actually use it in daytoday transactions where when they went to buy a cup of coffee or buy a sandwich they weren't waiting 10 minutes and standing around while their transaction verified that it was the same concept but with all the inefficiencies taken away i just saw the huge potential for that and that's when i got my notebooks i ordered some pens on amazon i knew i was gonna need a lot of them then i just started uh sketching and i i had to probably go through an entire notebook where it's like oh i try to write this down but man that's not going to work because of this thing in this thing and then finally i'm sure you guys know in my hello world video i got a pretty the algorithm that i was looking for i finally got it very happy when i did okay so that was a very long story very long question but let me go through these now i try not to get that distracted from here on okay did i get my hair back yes i did why do i uh i never had that much hair even when i was like 13 i think i started buzzing my head if you guys can see i don't pick my hat off but it's pretty short all right okay what is your favorite brand insta ramen okay osrs algoster now we get to the important questions what is your favorite brand of instant ramen also what's your favorite hot sauce if you like hot sauce so i don't like hot sauce i actually found out about it just jumped me to the bottom okay i missed out on that okay but i remember so favorite brand of ramen um i like the shrimp to be honest and i found out about ramen a long time ago whenever i uh needed to eat ramen i remember i remember standing at the grocery store i remember a point in my life where i only had like it was less than three dollars it was like two dollars and 13 cents in my bank account and i was at the grocery store and i was trying to calculate how many packages of ramen that i could get and yeah it wasn't the best uh time in my life but so thanks for bringing up those memories okay let's see what we got well i play gta 5 with commentary so i don't even have a playstation so unfortunately that probably won't happen okay let's get through uh you know tech with tim no i do not i have a friend named tim does that count oh okay shamir jadoon i think i'm saying that right uh do you follow any coding teachers on youtube or udemy so on youtube i follow probably all those same ones that you guys follow and on a udemy i do like probably my favorite tech teacher of all time is stephen grider i don't think he's on youtube but he has some courses on udemy i just love his style of teaching he goes really in depth my toilet is making noise interesting uh he goes really in depth and i don't know he's just entertaining educational stephen grider shout out oh okay when did you drop out of school what did i drop out of school i don't know i'm very bad with years by the way in case anyone was wondering like when people ask me like oh you're new to l.a or oh you're in new york like when did you move to new york and i was like huh you're like oh when'd you move back from north carolina i i don't know and they're like didn't you move it was your body right and your brain i'm like yeah i just don't keep track of that and it seems like a pretty big thing not to keep track of like the entire year when you move somewhere but funny how things are okay parth os says you should really review tech products it's going to be fun so i thought of having some product reviews on my channel a lot of people also reach out and see if i would review their product i just always felt with reviewing products that even though i agree it would be pretty fun it just feels like i would be selling out and that's why you guys also never see like uh sponsored by this like i'm sure i have videos or i do like this video sponsored by cheese but you know as far as getting sponsors or companies having me review their tech products i don't know i just feel like i would be selling out to you guys not really my not really my style java or python i gotta go with python no explanation at all just python that's it okay man thank you dennis is on fire uh sad man sucky from bangladesh what up sucka ui hawk love from pakistan i love her right back okay according to you ai could be risk for software developers in the future huh okay who has this by the way nissard sony could ai be risk for software developers in the future okay this is an interesting one so originally when i read this i thought it was going to be a question about the social dilemma where everyone's at risk but is ai presenting a risk for software developers in the future so my idea is that there are a class of problems in this world that computers are much better at figuring out in another class where humans are better at figuring it out now if i had 1000 um transactions and i needed to figure out the total amount or something humans are never going to be able to calculate that faster than a computer is just with ones and zeros you really don't stand a chance now the type of problems that humans i feel are always going to be better at are the problems that there aren't one right answer so even though if you gave a kid a toddler and a computer maybe just to think your laptop a couple spreadsheets and you said okay calculate all these transactions give me the total the computers are going to crush that little toddler hands down every time now if you give a computer maybe even a smart programmer and you also gave a toddler with a crayon the task of draw a picture of a horse or maybe not even that but i'm going to show you a picture and you tell me if it is a horse or not when it comes to those things like drawing a picture of a horse where there is no one right answer you can draw it with a crayon you can draw it with a marker you can draw its head you can draw its entire body standing in the field computers have a really tough time because of the fact that at the very base level they're all broken down to ones and zeros and there is no middle ground of oh a horse can be this or this or this so on and so forth so this is aside from the fact of consciousness and feeling and what separates humans from computers but ai on that note i think is interesting because it falls somewhere in the middle of those where with deep learning right now the biggest challenge with deep learning is or there's lots of big challenges mostly around the mathematics and organization what not but one of the big challenges with uh neural networks and deep learning right now is that whenever these computers solve these very complex problems they are unable to take that and communicate why they solved it in a certain way to humans now they're building certain things to allow humans to better understand the decisionmaking process and the decisionmaking process itself is a lot different because humans have intuition computers computers essentially just randomly guess until they find the right pass in uh you know machine learning basically but to answer the question of ai which is that area in middle could it pose a risk to software developers in the future okay so this was a harder question than i thought it's possible it's definitely possible but i see that the software and the tools that humans need in the future aren't going to just be totally automated humans are still going to give need to give direction for this technology since in my mind technology is just an extension of human capabilities technology does things that humans cannot it does it better it does it faster we can calculate those transactions but we can't calculate 10 10 000 10 000 transactions per second so it could be risk but i don't know to be honest another thing that i am that ai has the potential to do is right now we have these very intelligent ais run by many different companies all around the world i think the next phase of ai is going to be interesting whenever they start connecting communicating because i always try to look at things from the perspective of an ai so i see ones and zeros i know i had to do this on that but what's interesting is at what point does it become aware at what point does ai start asking questions and i think that we're in kind of that moment right now between okay the human brain can be broken down to biology to chemistry to uh physics and then math and if the entire human brain and thought process can be broken down to a lot of complex mathematical formulas then why can't we program that in a computer what is differentiating a complex ai in neural net uh this network of wires connected and transferring information all around how is that so much different than a brain which you know you have electronic signals in your neurons and it's going to be very interesting in our lifetime as we try to solve some of those problems so that was i keep saying i'm going to answer these quickly but i keep ripping through them okay okay okay uh let's see how does one get into ai um probably through so you need a lot of math you need a very strong math background then i would just start with statistics machine learning and then lots of great videos online and books for ai i am a penguins fan yes okay let's see let's see let's see is it worth learning c plus plus in 2020 absolutely while i continue my jingle tutorial series um if you guys want me to uh let's see scrolling down scrolling down scrolling down uh what do you think about smart contracts i'm a fan of smart contracts i'm a fan of uh ethereum overall i especially like the platform that they made and the standards around these different erc20 tokens uh d5 i think there's lots of potential in that um but sum it up i am pro smart contracts uh how okay so i don't know if i like to learn i'd like to work and learn at the same time and then selftaught programmer asked harman how can i find a job if i only know the basics i don't want to stop so believe it or not in every job that you're going to work at you are going to learn things that you haven't learned before so whenever you change careers or even as your company grows it's going to require you to learn and that's the very cool thing about programming that no matter where you are as long as you keep at it then you're just always going to be learning new things and even if your company isn't growing and you just like kind of maintain the status quo throughout your life then like let's look at web development after the last couple years whereas javascript and then react and then these different frameworks and has evolved a lot from uh html and jquery to what it is today so just stick with it and you're going to learn because technology changes very quickly and you need to learn uh pump and dumps all right i don't know what this is referring to but mad lyrics said pump and dumps there are lots of those around erc20 coins for sure uh let's okay so selftaught programmers said is that okay i feel if i will find a job that is not related to programming i will lose my focus it's yeah i mean if you so you're going to have free time to learn what you want but if you have a strong passion of programming i would look to find a career in programming just because i'm a big believer that since people spend so much time in their life at work then it's important to have a job that you enjoy you don't want to spend half your life in a place around people that you that don't make you happy so find out what your passion is not what makes you the most money and stick with that okay let's see let's see okay need to go to college for learning ai it's debatable i'm not selling my house some scroll down scroll down all right the elephant behind me looks like loch ness oh oh yeah it does especially if i do this no no all right is this recorded so this is being live stream but i believe that youtube man i got to figure out what's wrong with my camera all right there we go so uh this is not recorded but afterwards they're gonna be live on youtube and twitch and actually let me give you guys a link to my twitch i'm not a let's see one second one second hold on hold on hold on and boom roasted there we go okay so there's my twitch uh make sure to follow me or subscribe i actually don't even know what it's called on twitch i'm not a twitcher it's definitely not called twitcher either streamer okay let's see let's see osrs algoster that's a smart thing keeping tabs on the positions coming up with the company it makes sense there's always indications that tell part of the inside story if you look hard enough that is a brilliant way to describe it osrso third should be my spokesperson get all these crazy thoughts into a more organized form why does your microphone look like a toothbrush toothbrush i'm pretty sure i can just have a toothpaste right here and then i'll be good to go okay a couple more and then uh i probably gotta shut down in a little bit but i'll try to get through a couple more of these questions um okay positive africa says oh my god this guy brought me into tech like four or five years ago it's been so long looking for him to no avail glad to see you bucky damn i miss your voice positive africa it's nice to see you too feels good to be back uh let's see let's see okay dark side ff i'm just 14 and listening to this and understanding nothing oh so that was when i was talking about options okay i'll try to i'll try to keep the stream a little less focused on options and whoa what's this down here okay what are your thoughts okay so this is osrs algoster so first of all os rs algoster has awesome questions by the way i'm loving this person what are your thoughts almost certain legalization of certain psychedelic substances substances such as psilocybin wow that was a tongue twister one second i can't even say this slow legalization of certain psychedelic substances such as psilocybin okay now that we got through that sense would it possibly be wise to invest in certain agricultural companies related to them hmm that is interesting okay so first i'm not promoting any recreational mushrooms let me just get that out of the way first now with that aside if you are certain that the legalization of certain psychedelic substances such as psilocybin are inevitable then yes i do think that uh is a very smart strategy investing in agricultural companies related to them and that is it kind of goes um with the electric cars as well where with electric cars and my girlfriend is actually a big fan of this technique but it's not only just investing in tesla but investing in okay uh whenever people buy electric cars they need stations they need these accessories they need this or that so some of those other companies as well around the main product all right okay atreya bot got a hundred i got to figure out what this currency is i think they're indian rupees but atreya bot hi much love thank you mr bot much appreciated what am i going to do with all my rupees hmm you guys are very kind this is uh this is unexpected osrs elvis cert the thing with that sort of theoretical insight into business relationships is that there are many factors to consider there are many things corruption taxes lots of expenditures i agree it's uh it's very complex uh let's see let me see what do you think about the fed and libra working to create a stable coin okay don't want to get too deep into that but uh like i'm sure i'm sure they will central bring digital currencies are definitely a thing i think china released theirs like three million digital uh was it r b rem b but yeah that seemed to be going good and apparently every central bank is rolling out their digital currencies soon but uh anyone who knows anything about true digital currencies or cryptocurrencies um it's uh not exactly what the community stands for i got a feeling pretty much the opposite okay have i ever watched anime i have not actually i mean of course i know it is i saw clips on youtube or whatever but that's pretty much my extent of it what's the name of the book right behind your desk that is mastering ethereum and then under that is just a little notebook that i write in give me a shout out please mookish poo don here is a shout out what happened with your hair still there some of it a couple on top falling out but ain't nothing wrong with that okay if you're stranded on an island for a month would you rather choose linux or windows kadir better done gotta go with linux come on come on okay sufian habal shout out please you got it podcast again remember that girl from akiba reza that was lola i remember her and unfortunately probably no podcast for the upcoming future and we got simone the tiger huge fan thank you for getting me past javascript you got it okay what else we got why hat in your room are you cold no because i have really old headphones and if i don't wear this hat then i just get a lot of like flake and uh this black material all over my head so there is the boring story on that how are you doing mate i'm good all right all right um let me get through some of these already answered the brain hasn't been converted to numbers yet i don't think it will be that simple hmm so star citizen mod modding said the brain hasn't been converted to numbers yet i don't think it'll be that simple so let me ask you guys so do you feel in our lifetime that we will be able to program consciousness and if not then why what is the barrier preventing us from doing so this is going to be an interesting question i thought about this more than you guys would like to hear maybe that's the next tutorial programming consciousness in javascript all right uh where are you i am in pasadena california right now i know i said it like that so embarrassing what about mouthwash what is this no one's making fun of my breath are they they can't even smell it how did how did you know oh my god okay oh uh oh man i keep reading these good questions okay so os rs elgasters man you guys are coming too fast okay so he asked about drone delivery service i wanted to see that all right see those poops having your hair uh where is that comment drone delivery service so i missed that one unfortunately uh after i get a certain amount of comments so i scroll down and after i hit a certain amount or you guys leave comments uh faster than i could read through apparently youtube chat just pops it up anyways it's like oh too slow you didn't read through these so peace out so anyways uh some of your comments are just skipped but i can't get back to them where do you share a flutter tutorial yes i will uh do you have a learning mechanism so it depends on what i'm learning uh with programming i usually uh look for courses online most of the time and i always go online on amazon and get like the top of one to three books if they're like i'm not sure which one is going to be the best one even after looking through the preview then i'll just get a couple of them but usually when learning a new language there's like one book that really stands out so i like video tutorials of course and then uh reading as well all right all right all right what's the next big thing you want to learn about all right so we got min yi the next big thing that i want to learn about is how to program consciousness it's a problem that no one else is solving and apparently only the new boston can this community what about you mini uh how old am i i think i'm like 30 something what games you playing on twitch oh here we go here we go okay okay okay now we are back in under attack thoughts on drone delivery service i think with the continuous advancements being made in ui that it may have a bright future i agree as well i don't think that the barrier with i don't think that the barrier with drone delivery service is the intelligence or the automation i think it's more of a human problem that when drones go to some of these neighborhoods that like kids are just gonna throw baseballs at them and stuff or steal things it's very tempting i would think as a former kid so i can speak to this that if there was a jerk drone flying away okay talking a little bit too fast here but if i was playing baseball with my friends and i do not like to think of myself as is an evil kid but if there is a drone flying up there with a box i would definitely try to hit it with a baseball and so uh that is the main challenge kids like me essentially and then when they come and drop it off then i don't know i just see a lot of things uh gone wrong okay so night strike said i thought i was dead which i'm not so i think that's a good thing for everyone what's up bucky polly bloom not much what's up with you and fried rice i like this spelling too r y c e how did you get into chess oh this is a good one that you guys might like so me and my girlfriend were watching a movie called alphago i believe that was the title of it i know that was the uh software but i believe the movie was just called alphago as well super awesome movie and then after that uh kind of since while i if there's anyone out there playing go or chess then i don't want to start a debate but in my mind at the time go and chess were related like they were both strategy games that were based on uh skill rather than luck and for some reason i wasn't that compelled to go but i just started learning chess right after that and i got super obsessed with it i went online i took chess lessons i actually got decent like i was increasing my skills since on chess you have a rating so it was going up quite a bit but then it just kind of you know got busy with other stuff but i still enjoy playing it chess is pretty awesome nine there he is i love nine bucky the legend there you go nine has been helping out a ton too with the community with discord and check this out floor and pop 25 ron floor and pop this guy too uh it brought me actually i'm not supposed to say this super secret community but uh yes floor and pop thank you for that 25. also foreign i see that you are very active just need a compilation of me doing this for hours so for pop i noticed that he is very active on twitter and i am always jealous of that because i never tweet says nice to see you live buddy nice to see you too my quest jerome powell has been talking with facebook okay so basically the two entities that i would not want in control of the value getting together so that seems like a great idea okay so nine asks would you say this cryptocurrency the new boston is getting transactions faster and has more potential to get to the market than other cryptos had in their beginning do you have do like due to you having such a large following so i think there are a couple of reasons that once we do hit the market that things are going to be very interesting one is the follower base which of course uh not many others have the community that we have so we got a head start there another thing that is probably the biggest thing but we are not going in seeking an exchange right away of course we're going to get there of course that's where we want to be however what we are doing is just focusing on building the community and building value so instead of looking on okay let's get on exchange now we are saying let's build apps let's build out a marketplace let's start selling tshirts for this and then let's go to integrations to get on other websites and my idea is that once this does have monetary value in other crypto currencies other investors want to come in by that time i want to make sure that any developer who wants to build app or anyone who wants to join it they have the tools needed to essentially just blast this thing uh away from the earth like just to make it explode i whenever i think about how this cryptocurrency is going to grow and expand of course i think about it from a human perspective of why would someone want to send this to their friends and for those things what's preventing them from doing it now but technologically as well from a developer point of view whenever someone wants to make an app or work on a project or just help out on the core team there is a barrier from them being able to get started they need to have the tools they need to have the libraries the sdks so we are essentially preparing all of that stuff now so when we do hit an exchange we're gonna be in a much much better position than almost every other cryptocurrency or digital currency out there i'm super excited for that 2021 is going to be very interesting for the new boston i'm looking forward to it good question nine who are you who am i wow hey i got another question for you guys on the subject of that so 80 row hit rowit prasad asked who are you i don't know i don't even know who that is to be honest but so i make uh youtube videos i'm a programmer however i thought about this as well one second okay so here's another question for you guys that one thing that i see as a barrier between humans and technology and ai specifically is that ai one thing that it cannot do is it can't ask questions and i know that i can make a computer program now where i can print out who are you or what is your name in some input that you can even respond in it like says yes or no or whatever but for a computer or artificial intelligence to be able to truly be curious and ask questions not because it was programmed to by any known entity but what would entail getting it to that place where technology could ask a question any question and if so what would the first question it would be asking itself so that's another thing that i thought about quite often because whenever i try to look at things from the perspective of an ai i just imagine darkness and i can't smell things i can't hear things i can't feel i can't touch i can't see maybe there's a couple cameras hooked up and now i can see but these things they don't have any meaning to me and okay now i have audio plugged in and i see these noise okay broken it down to bites but it doesn't really mean anything to me and once it's turned off unless it's in my hard drive then i'm not gonna remember it anyways but i'm just trying to bridge the gap between at what point could if it's even possible and we don't know yet could this thing start to ask questions would it start to feel would it start to be curious so anyways that's what i think of uh in case you guys were wondering that which i'm guessing you weren't but i told you anyways uh let's see let's see let's see lots of lots of questions and it hopped again uh do i freelance i do not freelance oh man all these good answers too foreign pop all right in life wild one run a dusau woohoo i passed my exam exam today guys congratulations awesome uh okay so i see nope no chance but oh okay so star citizen modding and joe neil abedin said nope no chance i believe this was to my question of can computers in our lifetime will we ever be able to program consciousness and i believe that no chance was that so i would disagree not with the end result of no but just to jump to conclusions to say no chance because even though i myself find it hard to imagine that an ai even if you have a huge server like uh you know an entire warehouse or whatever i find it hard to believe that ai can have true consciousness but i don't know why i can't answer specifically why it can't happen and because of that i am hesitant to just say no i see possibility has your coding philosophy changed as you are growing older this is an awesome question shinjan shaha yes so one huge thing i noticed with senior developers and i do this a thousand percent now and it has helped me tremendously is that when i was younger i would get a problem or i had an idea for a feature i wanted to work on our app i wanted to build and i would just start coding right away okay let's do this let's do this and very quickly things turned to spaghetti it turned out to be a mess it was just a huge pain in the butt and what i've noticed through working and also just through planning out very large projects myself is that the best developers whenever they are tasked with a new project or a new feature they spend more time than anyone else just either on a whiteboard or with notebook pen and paper planning out exactly what they're going to build they plan out as many details as they can of course they don't like write out each line by code this and this and that but essentially so much of their time and effort goes into planning which seems like a waste at first like why are you writing on a notebook when you can just be coding or why are you doing this on the whiteboard but it saves so much time because the moment their fingers such a keyboard they know exactly what they're gonna do there may be some like form libraries or you don't know how to organize your components what naming conventions you use whatnot but the main path is all laid out and it just it seems like it wastes time but it ends up through the life of a more complex project saving so much time so i would highly recommend that um this digital currency network i think i went through i can't even i don't even know if i have them here but like five thick notebooks and i'm still going through each one those two are filled with it i got one right here but uh yeah plan plan plan before your fingers ever touch that keyboard uh let's see let's see okay so star citizen modding said i just don't believe it's only math man now you guys are making me think deep about stuff i'm just trying to come answer some questions thought you guys were going to make fun of my hat a little bit but let's see okay so the reason that computers could never develop consciousness is because the original assumption was that everything could be broken down to math kind of like everything is broken down to math in school where you learn about biology then you can break that up into chemistry and then chemistry can be broken up into physics you know how these uh atoms and molecules are formed and then even that as you break down physics and physics and physics it eventually just becomes math and now a lot of that math like quantum mechanics right now which is the limit of physics and where physics meets math is a lot of gray area but even then i think what we're seeing is there are some things in physics that we just can't explain that don't make a lot of sense and not only that but science and life overall at least not now so maybe it is more than just math very possible very possible indeed i mean even now with physics there are areas that we just didn't know exist like i would look at myself and way back then i wouldn't know that i had cells and if i did if i could see that closely maybe someone invented a magnifying glass then to understand exactly what is in the cell in these different uh chemicals and this and that all this stuff did not exist to human beings long ago and i think as technology progresses we are able to understand the big picture concepts uh space time light and then small uh quantum mechanics there's a whole other universe that we have left to figure out and consciousness is another frontier would you tutor me in programming so i have a youtube channel and i tutor lots of people all right robots judging humans i missed this earlier part of the convo all right kapil batare said lack of computation power may be it's also possible because in our brains we have a lot of complex algorithms going on only a certain subset of them we really understand if you think about it it's like your brain is doing like 98 of the work in your body uh right now my heart is beating i put no effort in that um my lungs are expanding i'm breathing uh that's all going good maybe i have some little cuts on me and they're healing my body's just like yeah i'll take care of that don't worry about it and if my brain could talk i imagine that it would just say look i'm gonna take care of all this stuff i'll take care of healing digesting breathing keeping your heart pumping all you need to do is figure out what to do it every day and make sure we get something to eat every now and then every now and again so it's like the brain is doing like 98 of the work and me the conscious part of me has got the easy part however i feel that that two percent the conscious part of me is the part that's messing up all the time where the brain's like i'm gonna do all this you just figure out something to eat and i'm like uh what about this cheeseburger and it's like it's like wow of all the things you could have chosen to eat you chose the worst thing okay don't worry about that just figure out something to do like maybe exercise uh maybe study and i'm like i'll just watch netflix and my brain has to be like are you kidding me i gave you two simple jobs and you ruined both of them so you know that is my thought my brain's probably pretty mad at me right now with my poor decision making all right enable slomo uh let's see let's see okay we do flutter what are your thoughts on flutter so yes we have tried or i have so many questions that i'm reading through and try to answer in my head at the same time flutter is on the menu for 2021. star citizen modding have you ever tried dmt i have not tried dmt however i did used to have a sensory deprivation tank in my living room and i spent lots of time in there but dm dmt scares me i don't know it's um it's interesting okay goldengamer4d bucky if you know every language why didn't you create an insane program that will dominate the world with a social media app or an instructor app or an or event a chess puzzle app use what you know so so first i do not know every language in the world there is a lot about technology that i have yet to learn and of course i will never learn even within any single language i doubt i will ever learn everything there is to know just because they're always changing and if i did learn everything there was to know then tomorrow uh there would be more stuff so i'll never get to that point however why didn't you create an insane program oh we are um 2021 that program is going to blossom into a beautiful little flower okay osrs algosaurus this was from the convo wildlife copeland uh talking about the drones he said i also i thought i wouldn't be surprised to see a drunk person shoot a drone with a shotgun or something and then steal it when it crashes to the ground okay i don't know if they would steal it since it was already ruined because they you know shot it with a shotgun but then again they are drunk and a drunk person would steal something broken just for the fun of it so yeah i agree that is a and you know in those amazon meetings they have to be talking about this stuff they probably have a whiteboard with like some drunk eye drawing on it shooting this drone in a big red cross back no this is a problem this is what we got to figure out and then some other one on the other end of the white board has like some little kid like swinging a baseball bat at the drone bag what about this what about this i wanted that job that'd be a great job in what stack do you feel more productive so i'm a big fan of django in react i know it's pretty standard now nothing fancy but i mean come on okay consciousness this is i'm liking this okay suddenly consciousness doesn't simply emerge out of the complexity of the system you can mimic conscious decisions however you can't create consciousness so i agree with that first part let's just get that out of the way consciousness doesn't emerge out of the complexity of a system i know that because i wrote some very complex spaghetti code and there is no consciousness evolving out of it you can mimic conscious decisions however you can't create consciousness you know maybe instead of trying to think of it from technology converted to human consciousness maybe it's a better question to ask at what point does a human have consciousness and i'm sure i don't want to get too political or anything but um aside from like the legal uh what is life debate that i know is going to come i try to bypass that and say as a human being a human being sperm egg at what point does that being begin to think at what point does it become to be is it able to be aware at what point does that mix of chemicals sperm and egg and then it grows the cells multiply multiply then it's born at what point does it become conscious so i think for that to break that down we would first need to define what consciousness is exactly what it is and then once we have that and agreed upon point in time or definition then we could break down the pieces to see what led up to that moment so with that i guess the question is this if you can't create consciousness however you can recreate the mathematics behind living things namely it is possible to create a program where you have a model of sperm and a model of an egg whether it's 3d 2d however you want to do it and you can mimic those mathematical bonds and you can also mimic the cells reproducing of course even one cell to be able to program it would be an incredible amount of engineering mathematics so on and so forth i can't imagine what would be needed for an entire human body not not only the brain but i'm wondering if you can break each thing down to its fundamental pieces and you could map that into a mathematical formula then why not go backwards what is preventing you from combining all those pieces into a cell and then into a body and then into a human and if you have everything mapped out then could you call that conscious or would it be conscious or would it just be a robot mimicking human behavior is there something else there that's a missing ingredient interesting i don't know myself but we will find out on the stream okay okay this is getting very interesting now osrs algoster said if the universe can create an eyeball to look at itself from nothing i don't think that it's impossible for ai to create a metaphorical eyeball to view and improve itself without human interference hmm it's very interesting interesting all right night strike background don't let him fool you he's an ai created by elon musk from the future came back to educate a whole generation so that's an another thing is that if this is a simulation then there's a possibility that this simulation maybe even the new boston community was created from the simulation however what if we have an open source project where we create a simulation of the universe then we would just have a recursive endless loop of simulations going on in no one simulation would ever understand how it was created but of course we would know duh it's the new boston that's great and everything so that's the most likely scenario lauren pop said hello you're jealous of me what can i say then on your youtube journey haha your inspiration buddy yes there's um there's a lot of different youtubers a lot of different what are they called twitters tweeters um i don't know i'm just i'm jealous but uh yeah i look up to different people for different aspects of what they're good at you know doesn't matter if you're famous this or that uh let's see let's see let's see okay uh oh okay i have no idea how to say this guys names russian characters have you ever heard about 5d chess with a multiverse time travel i have not i have not played that game yet okay flutter yes okay i'm definitely doing flutter everyone is asking about flutter okay now i got osrs out sir who are you is that an important question i got a question for you guys if you were the only thing in the universe there is no light and you were just an empty space assuming that you know you just didn't have your insides sucked out uh whatever but if you were just floating there in empty space and there's no stars there's no moon uh there's nothing that you could see and let's see that maybe you couldn't even see your hand in front of your face and maybe you couldn't even uh feel like when you slap your hands together what would you be thinking and i don't mean right now like if everything just went dark because then you would be thinking why did everything just go dark and why can i not hear my hand slapping but if you were born into that environment technicalities aside like you didn't starve to death or you didn't like get dehydrated so on and so forth but if you were born into a universe of emptiness no light could you have a thought would it be possible tough because if you had a thought what would it be about i don't even know if you would be able to ask where am i because there would be nothing else to judge location location wouldn't exist you couldn't ask what time it is because that concept wouldn't exist i don't even know if you could ask who am i or what am i because to be able to ask those questions it would involve comparing it to something else oh that person is them they are there but without any concept of any of that it's interesting and i guess that is where we are with ai we have these neurons that you know exist in a computer of course but they're connected they can have thoughts but even though you can hook it up to a camera or input audio from its point of view it's it's just all data it can't feel it can't touch it doesn't have emotion man this this stream got pretty deep pretty quick okay uh should i focus on some problems like code first or should i focus on my own projects so i would say a mix of both really anything that you're doing to program it doesn't hurt whatsoever so a lot of these websites where you solve coding challenges they are going to help you with an interview because they always ask those during interviews may not be the best method of interviewing since it usually has nothing to do with the actual job but that aside it doesn't hurt because you're programming you're getting better what i would suggest is building things that you are passionate about passionate about because you stick with those things for longer and also that passion comes from a better place than having to do something it's not that i have to do this but i want to do this because it's enjoyable i like building this thing so not only i just think it's a much better way of learning overall have i seen okay so earned loyalty ass have i seen a bicentennial man with robin williams hey you know that i i did see that a while ago so that's kind of an old movie isn't it where they like make a robot or android i don't know if they call them in that movie and then they like slowly swap out their leg for a human leg and then the other leg for a human leg and the arm and then the brain for a human brain or something but then slowly over time this robot becomes a human and they become conscious or was it the other way where it was a human and then they slowly start swapping it out for a robot no i think it was the first way but um yes i did see it and uh huh that was actually a good movie one of my favorite actually i need to ask you guys this wow i got a couple people here what's your favorite movie favorite movie of all time and as a bonus question what's your more recent favorite movie let's get some inputs in here another bonus question i don't know i was going to do stuff but now i just feel like talking to you guys is what did you guys think about the social dilemma all right we got alex kimmel said yo yo got bucky livestream for once yeah yeah uh okay i think most say when we have knowledge of self in humans i think mostly when you have knowledge of self the body is a machine for our brain that is absolutely correct another thing on this subject since we're just you know talking about the meaning of life and consciousness and whatnot another little thought experiment i like to play is i always try to close my i don't say i always do this like 12 hours a day or whatever but i often close my eyes and think where am i so i'm so this is my body of course you can see it of course on my computer screen not really close to you guys physically but where am i so this is my entire body but i'm not in my hands i'm not here i'm not in my mouth or my voice is coming out i'm not really in my eyes i'm a little bit behind my eyes like in here so i myself when i ask myself where am i even though i have this entire body it's i am somewhere in here and that's where i can say like that's where i am another thing is that whenever i think about consciousness in myself and what it means to be conscious some simple questions like where am i or what time it is i notice that you can never you're always stuck in the same place for example i can say okay i'm going over here but i can never say i'm there whenever someone asks me where am i the only question or excuse me the only response i can ever give is i am right here so right now i'm right here now if i want to go over there then i'm not there now i am here so no matter where i go from my point of view i'm always here and it's the same thing with time where me i was a teenager and i was a kid and i was a lot younger but if someone asked like what time is it now uh i don't know how they would phrase this question but it's always right now from my point of view even though i lived in the past and even though i am planning to live in the future whenever someone asks me what time it is from my perspective i can only say now so 30 years of my previous life it's it's like that's part of me in a way but when i close my eyes i can only ever be right here and the only answer i can ever give you is it is only ever right now so we have this infinite space around us infinite amount of time but i as a conscious human being is stuck in this one slice of time in this one location in space and that is never going to change it has never changed from the moment i was born and it will never change to the day that i die however given that given that i am always in the same place there are so many things that are always changing around me so i have no idea what that had to do with any question that anyone has but just a random thought since that's apparently what we're doing today okay sam crafter says you need to check out the project blue brain i have no idea what this project is but i already know from the sounds of it it's just going to be a huge rabbit hole and i'm probably going to spend the rest of my life searching okay project blue brain that's a pretty cool name by the way blue brain sam crafter uh let's see let's see each cell can be a java object it could it could very well be actually bought a book on um cells a while ago they are very complex i thought like okay i learned in biology different parts of a cell but when i started breaking it down to try to model those individual interactions in each different protein i mean who knows how many proteins are in any given cell good luck just programming one first of all but um yeah so programming one cell uh that would be a huge achievement for our entire lifetime i highly doubt that uh any company has come close right now i'm sure they would claim that they did but no way and that's another reason why whenever people are wondering like why did this vaccine take so long to create and i was thinking the same thing like can they just create a model of the cell and then just machine learning ai figure out what vaccine works figure out what vaccine uh like harms the virus but also harms a cell and that's when you don't want cells in the human body are incredibly complex and even that each human body it doesn't resemble what it resembles in a health book everyone's body is a little bit different and what may be normal to one person may be completely abnormal to another person so that's why if someone comes in uh with the same set of symptoms the doctor may say okay you're fine but you with the same set of symptoms that's something to worry about because your health is free but because of that and how everything is different and so complex yada yada tomato tomato here we are talking to each other sending me messages and then responding through a computer computer screen who would have imagined that and it is kind of weird that on the other side of the world that you could be talking to someone less than a second communication fascinating and we are building it okay let's see this here's a question human intelligence and by the way this is that's as best as i can get with pronouncing your name i apologize okay uh okay let me scroll up i'm missing some questions here night strike background says do you think that we rebirth does it not feel like although mortal we will come back or is it just me so interesting that you didn't say reincarnation you said rebirth and here's the thing from a scientific perspective and i'm not going to do science versus religion all this and that but from scientific perspective whatever this thing is this consciousness this soul this energy it can't just disappear it has to go somewhere and the answer to that do you think that we would rebirth i think without a full understanding of what consciousness is or what does it mean to be born what does it mean to be alive there is a lot of things that we cause fires alive like trees but they don't have consciousness or do they or is consciousness not a thing that we think of like you either have it or you don't maybe it's more of a gradient where trees and plants maybe they can be consciousness slightly from a certain perspective maybe animals have a higher consciousness and maybe we think of ourselves as being the most consciousness but do you think that we rebirth at least not in this sense of reincarnation but i mean it is interesting because we ourselves are my entire body from the moment the sperm and the a connected everything that i am built of is just a combination of everything that was around me first in the environment that was dark in my mother's body but now later on i am a combination of culture and society and the food that i put in my body and the things that i learn on the computer screen and essentially all of these different things are combining into this thing right here right now and that is what i am so with that said let's go on to the next question okay now here's the question human intelligence can be replicated but can human imagination this is a question we've discussed in neuropsychology lab from time to time human intelligence okay imagination imagination so let's break down what imagination is so imagination is the ability to envision something that doesn't exist to be able to see something that isn't there to be able to hear something that isn't there and in a way imagination is very similar to memory and i think they're closely tied together as well where memory how does that work there are things that happen in my past that i'm able to bring back to this moment but where are they well they don't exist behind me or anything for some reason human beings are able to hold on to certain moments and recreate those to a certain extent of course i'm not going to be able to reimagine someone right in front of me but pieces of it remember how they talked and they sound like remember the events that happen so something very interesting with imagination and memory that i think plays into consciousness a lot because those things that you just mentioned uh godallah 2k uh imagination and memory those are things that separate human beings from other living things at least that we know plants of course nonliving objects computers aside since they do have memory but a different kind of memory but yeah this uh i was not expecting this stream to turn into this okay okay okay let me get through ah tooth rush okay here we go oh sorry i'll just sir i actually asked myself that question when i feel need to be reminded of my position knowing and understanding where you are in all aspects helps recenter you and keep your mind fresh i like your brain osrs i'll just stare okay now we're okay apparently we're just going to figure out physics and consciousness tonight that's cool nothing else to do gedalia 2k if time is linear and it was laid out like a media track we would see that for most of history we either didn't exist yet or we were dead already yeah that is um it is an interesting way of looking at it that in a way for yourself and from no one else's perspective but only yours time began when you began and time will end when you end and religion aside again this is strictly science here but the entire universe from your perspective it only exists because you exist and when you don't exist then time universe and everything else will cease to exist and it's interesting that you bring up a media track because what i imagine sometimes is that time is a lot like a media track however it's not just flat like you can roll out those old film reels or whatever it's happening in in 3d for example if i was on so i don't want to calculate the speed of light but if i was on a planet very far away and i was looking at earth i was looking at myself if i was on a planet that was uh 15 light years away looking at the earth i wouldn't see me talking in a web camera right now i would see myself uh learning how to drive a car or learning how to uh figure out a test on in my high school so the closer i got to earth then the more recent i would see so the further away if i was 30 something light years away i would see the moment i was born closer i would see whenever i was driving closer i would see what i did last night and right now if someone was sitting right here they would see now so time is relative depending on how far you are away and in a way i think that is for people too where instead of people looking at it i am essentially broadcasting my life in every position top bottom left right kind of in this sphere where this sphere where no matter where you are around this bubble if you were 33 34 light years away okay i think i'm 33 then you would see the moment where i was born and because of this the closer you get you're more closest to the present according to me but in a way we don't have one tape we don't have one media reel one reel of film we have this 3d ball of film that's broadcasting all over and when we interact with other human beings what we are doing is we are inserting ourselves in their movie for a limited amount of time now some people are very close to you in life and they get to play a big part in your movie and you are also impactful in other people's lives and if you're fortunate you get to play a big part in their movie as well and everyone's movie is a little bit different and even you you're going to be a big part in some in a small part in others but anyway that's how i imagine it it's almost this unexplainable way this 3d media film reel but essentially we are a combination of everything around us every person every moment of time so i do think that that is a big part of why we need to focus on pushing the world in a better direction because if someone can influence my life in a positive way then i am able to take my 3d movie explosion and then influence a lot of other people's way and then together once we all get on the same page and build some pretty great things again no idea what the original question was but uh again way off track oh yeah then the media track this kadalia 2k was uh he's getting deep deep in the brain okay what's the time at your place and don't say no ivan catalinic i have no idea how to say anyone's name but i am gonna just try so hard and be confident that i'm saying it perfectly so ivan katari nick it is 10 59 or should i say now okay jose maria land ever seen the space time cone maybe that'll give you some insight yes theory relativity morphed so it's pretty much um that famous uh spacetime curvature but if you can envision in all directions maybe that is a spacetime cone maybe i'm thinking of something else have you ever stopped and think about how i move my fingers how it works see now we are very far away from uh flutter tutorials question one uh are you gonna teach flutter question two how does life work okay i'll get to each of these have you ever suddenly think how i move my fingers how it works interesting as well because your body okay man getting way too way too nonsense here so this is what i think when i think who am i what am i so these are my fingers this is my body i can move my fingers of course we're all connected here's my head here's my hand whatever now if i cut off my hand so i don't have any hand anymore like this i'm still me my hand is gone but i'm still me well what if i cut off my arm would have cut off this arm what i've got off both legs i am me now how much of yourself assuming that you just don't bleed to death and die how much of yourself can you cut off and you still be you now if that's the case if you just keep cutting cut and cutting what is the minimal thing and i guess in my mind that's you so arda senorik have you ever stopped and think how i'm able to move my fingers how does it work thinking about it right now and now that you said that and i said it on stream i'm sure a lot of other people are thinking about it as well okay some coding questions buck of the philosopher uh why does your headphone have a toothbrush i like how one question is like what is consciousness and the other question is like why does your headphone have a toothbrush i don't know the answer to either of those but hopefully you'll figure it out i don't believe in previous lives i believe that all life that has been will be and is being is all at once why would it be any other way why would everything be restricted to that boundary okay once i need to think about this for a little bit hmm okay okay very valid point so here's the thing let's go back on that spaceship so right now i'm sitting in california pasadena and we know that if someone was on a planet 33 light years away let's say that there were 35 light years away looking at earth i wouldn't be born yet a couple of years later they would see me born and as they got closer and closer and closer they would see what i am today the present time so in the inverse of that if someone was to start right here next to me and they were able to shoot off on a rocket ship at the speed of light what they would see is since they were expanding at the speed of light if they were to look back at me they would see myself frozen in time i don't know why i did that motion but that is essentially what they would see now if somehow they were able to take that rocket ship and go faster than the speed of light then they would see me start to reverse now because time expands at the speed of light then according to a photon and osrs algoster okay this also makes sense all life has been will be as being all at once why would it be any other way so time exists for us because we are not photons and that we are mass we are not just simply energy and because of that we are stuck in this location in a slice of time when everything around us is changing and things would not change for that because time would not change man so i guess that uh osrs algoster don't believe in previous slice all life has been will be in his being all at once why would it be any other way i guess it depends on perspective for us we know that there is life and it does begin and it does end because from our own perspective that's what we see however it doesn't make it universally true where some things in my life some people that i met in another part of the universe those things never existed and some parts of the universe they will exist at a future time funny how things are funny how things are we dream about the future remember the past and live in the present do you have a tutorial on c sharp okay i have i definitely have to go soon but got very sidetracked i was supposed to do so much today the design team is going to be so mad at me okay can you recommend uh program language should be going with i would start with python it's very user friendly and you can build things play around pretty easily so definitely python zeus cybersex said i had a crush on your sister so she has a boyfriend now unfortunately zeus so you missed your chance okay sam crafter a cellular human brain is equivalent to a thousand rapperings with a total of 100 billion cells that have been predicted to be possible by 2023. oh okay oh that's a blue brain hmm interesting i'm definitely gonna look that up uh yeah terry hendrick said ex machina yeah we're getting there that's that's the next open source projects okay india india india big fan from india hey what's that a festival and you called diwali that one looks awesome are viruses live no they are not and just lost my place okay okay okay uh um screen up oh man i hate this thing uh man so many good questions but i do have to sleep at some time okay what about space i think i missed the context of that uh one second one second i'll read them okay do you think you are in control bucky i do because all evidence points to that and i will say that i i don't know how we got here i don't know how time began i don't know if this is a simulation i don't know if a dream i don't know if it's a simulation dream or if it's just like it is you're born and this is life and you die but what i do know is whatever this is dream simulation real life whatever that i want to make it the best that it can be even if it's a dream then i want to make it a good dream it's a simulation then let's make it a good one and if this is it where we were born for a very thin slice of time and that life is truly unique then let's make it a good one okay couple i always keep saying a couple more but more questions coming we're basically the universe thinking about itself consciousness probably isn't regulated to humans alone but to the cosmos which it is derived thought about this as well this is um this is actually pretty interesting that i didn't think so many people thought about these different things but apparently they do and uh so this was gedalia 2k and i thought about this as well because um the living things inside me the cells my heart my lung whatever they are living but they aren't really intelligent now i can't think of anything in this universe where a component of something is more intelligent than the entirety of it now if that's true expand it out to a bigger picture that means that if we are intelligent and then if we are part of the universe then it would mean that the universe is intelligent and almost that it would be impossible for the universe not to be intelligent because if nothing else there's a small slice of it that is intelligent and of course since you are just uh some of your parts then you know the universe is us we're making it up it's not like us and any universe we're you know we're a pretty key ingredient here okay knight strike b g memory can be so trippy sometimes where you can go back feeling how you felt in that moment in the past but it was today but feel it today without actually living through it yeah memory is a very trippy thing how you can so we know where these moments are in time physically they are out in space i know that one year ago from today that moment is exactly one light year away from me right now however for some reason even though we know according to physics exactly where that moment is i am somehow able to take that and in my mind bring it back now not that specific thing since i have no idea what i was doing exactly one year ago however when i was 16 when i was 21 events that happened when i was in my 20s early 30s which i guess i still am in my early 30s but to be able to take something that isn't here that happened before and bring it back crazy life we live in crazy life time is just a feeling code gator that's his opinion time is just a feeling how can i agree with that all right easy i think spirits are mainly matrix computation and memory storage so i'm not sure if he's talking about computational matrix mathematical or the matrix we'll find out okay favorite movie is a rival that is awesome movie ality man my stomach is uh is this recorded so i believe that this is going to be saved to youtube and twitch okay let's see we have so many associations stored in memory don't we think about a ball and how many memories site sounds concepts are attached to that object alone that is true that is true man i'm never gonna get through these comments okay mike looks like a toothbrush i agree and all right hunter johnson did you know i was the guy who said give cat bagel gift cat bagel unless streams i did not know that but now i do uno dos can we capture light um we can we capture light in matter yeah that's uh that's essentially all matter is um whenever you shine light on something if that material or that mass absorbs that energy of course shining light on this a certain amount of light is going to be reflected and a very small percentage of it is going to be absorbed in the form of heat or sometimes uh it actually like uh it gets absorbed and then like electrons can hop up energy levels but whatever anyways all these different forms of light electromagnetic waves they can get absorbed into mass in matter which essentially just energy that's spinning around in the same place for a while what the flying effort are you talking about are you on something where is webstorm i agree who is this it's like what are we doing here gurleen sethi trying to be programming talking about life and space and time and lots of i didn't plan this out it's it's where the stream took me okay you guys were pulling me towards this so i blame you guys i completely blame you guys goodale 2k i'll be honest a lot of companies would rather outsource to people without degrees because it's cheaper but bucky's right it has more to do with experience and is a good portfolio than anything this is a nice one osrs elgaster if we could communicate without words what would you learn from me what would i learn from you how would immediate communication and connection of our minds impact us so i do not have a good answer to that but i have an interesting fact and that is with primates they are able to teach them sign language and they are even able to like uh ask a question and it can respond uh so on and so forth but what is interesting is that i i just want to call them monkeys i know that's not technically correct but i feel like a little pretentious thing primates or whatever so what's interesting is that even though you can teach monkeys uh sign language one thing that they saw is that monkeys do not teach other monkeys sign language so when new monkeys are born and they have kids even though that they know sign language they don't teach it to the next generation so with humans that is one thing and they say that this is one of the main reasons for why humans are able to evolve to the level of intelligence that we did is because we teach that knowledge from generation to generation and we see it all the time teaching kids so on and so forth but yeah so maybe not with words but through sign language that's how i remember that okay let's see let's see let's see uh i cannot find your video on printing multidimensional arrays i'm not sure which one which language was that you guys are so high i wish i would man if we were high figure all this stuff out is this a mindfulness stream apparently apparently do you watch vsauce and also what do you think about three blue one brown i used to watch those a lot i haven't anymore but i i'm a fan uh any educational videos on youtube and also they make it entertaining i mean who can hate it okay vanveer shah says i think this is a prerecorded stream you will now learn that it is not or is it and i just knew that that comment was coming so i prerecorded that answer i did okay if you can no longer communicate i think i missed the earlier part of that let's see night strike background the new boston it always hits a different and deep or it always hits different and deep when you realize that all this will one day end and it wouldn't really matter because you won't remember it or feel it it will just be darkness maybe so but it matters to me and it matters now and even though it's possible that i may not have any concept of space or time or i exist at all in the life that i have i want to make sure that i am helping the people that i care about because even though universe doesn't live on for me i feel that it will live on for them all right now i got a little debate going there's darkness before we arrived here too so what's there to fear another good point also okay you know what i gotta get back on track here well streaming be a daily thing please tell me because i miss half of it due to time zones and i will manage my sleep time you know what i really should stagger these streams so i'm missing all these missing old oh let's see let's see let's see also chares ali thank you for modding this very well man just helping out so much with the new boston head of python client library development going beautifully modding awesome huge asset jack middleton says uh where is this comment jack middleton said answer these questions with interstellar soundtrack in the background now that's a good idea this is what i'm talking about people these ideas are what i came here from okay he will have to go to the washroom and to eat someday we'll see about that i didn't wear this diaper for nothing okay uh let's see let's see let's see uh what do your parents do do you think they raised you any different or special from most other people i was just wondering how you think you became so smart so i don't think that i am um smart hungry so i actually do not think that i am uh so i don't think i'm dumb first of all but i don't think i am smarter than average if especially with like trivia if everyone in this chat room sat down and played a trivial pursuit or jeopardy i would be bottom five percent easily it's just that certain areas of what i learned technology uh and certain other things as well i like to go very deep into them and if there's one little thing that i don't understand then i'll just keep digging and digging until i i figure out why so um to answer your question my mother is a nurse and my father is a construction worker they didn't really raise me different than most other people in fact uh two brothers one sister and turned out normal more or less i was the only weird one i guess but um yeah i became so smart i i would not say i am smart by one sam dumb but uh i don't think i'm like uh those people on guinness book or world records were just like memorize seven billion numbers at once this is unique i guess do you still play chess good question hey you know what that'd be actually pretty cool so i don't play chess anymore just because i'm uh busy with everything else man my stomach is going crazy i should play chess maybe i should play it on stream uh probably not on youtube since everyone would just be like why is the new boston playing chess but maybe on twitch so homachu chuan do you play tess maybe we can play actually uh we were thinking about game development for the new boston since we have this thing called project proposals where we're having actual some trouble now where people are coming into the project faster than we have worked for them like we have a frontend team we have backend team we have marketing design but there's just so many people coming onto the project we just can't create enough work for them there's just not that many things to do so we created something called project proposals where anyone interested in joining the project they can essentially build whatever they want as long as it connects to the new boston digital currency network and it's not like inappropriate it's not brutal or has like people fighting or anything but essentially the reason i'm saying all this is because we allow games as well and i was thinking of making a chess game since i was always interested in building one since it's just a really interesting and also challenging thing to program now that would actually be pretty cool if i build a chess game or if anyone else is interested in building that chess game yeah maybe we can team up maybe we can make a little project and of course it still does help the new boston digital currency network community project but yeah okay let's see uh alp technologic why should parallel universes exist maybe they shouldn't are you excited for a future of vr not really to be honest i don't know vr to me and i thought just about blockchain too that it turned out being way wrong but vr to me is kind of like um 3d tvs like okay you can put on glasses and you see your tv in 3d but it's like over hyped so i don't know i just with that you had to wear glasses and it was pretty inconvenient and now wearing a big old headset and some people get sick too it's cool don't get me wrong but you know it's just not my thing i guess how much of social media do you use i rarely use well does youtube count on social media because that would change my answer um as far as all other social media not barely at all sometimes to like um talk to the community ask some questions get their feedback you know i know floor and pop but uh i don't know i just doesn't interest me a lot of things and okay now we're getting off on a little tangent but something important i think i should explain so i was actually thinking about why all of you guys asked me questions and i thought about them a lot a while before it was kind of weird but on social media i feel what is happening is that people are more focused on the things that have happened in the past and they're frustrated and they like to talk about it uh get attention for a lot of different reasons however i really am not a fan because i feel like if you are human beings only have a limited amount of time and energy in each day if they spend that time and energy debating against strangers online and focusing on the past and things they cannot change they are never going to make that meaningful of an impact in this world however if you take all the time and energy that you would have spent on social media arguing with people and put it into building a better solution and to solving a problem then you could change the world in a very meaningful way and that is why i think that no matter who you are or where are you from you should never underestimate the impact that you can have on this world as long as you stay off of social media so probably didn't need to throw in that last chat but come on okay do you still use that tank thing salt infographics i believe you mean salt tank thing all right so it's a sensory deprivation tank and i do not it was in my house whenever i was living up in new york but now i'm in pasadena an apartment and i don't think they want a huge tank in here unfortunately if i ever get my own house again then i would love to have it i spent a lot of time in that thing way too much time more than recommended but okay harmon the new boston universe is live you just proved it i mean we're creating it what the future holds is up to what we build so we might not be able to build the entire universe planets and suns and whatnot but this little slice whatever this thing is this network how we're connected the software we're building how it connects people and the impact that it has on this world that thing is going to come from us so i think that's pretty cool hello teacher hello farooq okay islam hollaby said thanks for helping me get through my computer science degree you are welcome glad you got through it what's plan on coming daily live uh so sanjay s asks what's the plan on coming daily live no plans i didn't even have a real plan for this stream until about half an hour before stream see that's the thing i know a lot of people say schedule your stream schedule your streams and me i kind of just like to wing it but i do take note of if the community would like me to schedule these streams then i probably should um so yeah maybe i'll look into that however i will say that i'm gonna be traveling not like tomorrow or anything but i'm gonna be like traveling all around until uh next year 2021 not that far away so no consistency definitely until 2021 and then i could have a really consistent schedule if you guys would like it uh let's see you should really stick the program in this is like childish yeah that's uh this program is my thing this is one stream that just got a little off track but i don't know childish or not i like talking about it and i like hanging out with the community and sometimes we just need to be childish every now and again roast snipes said do you stream rarely i do not this is like my second stream ever however i did get lights and i got some new lights coming since this background these decorations just aren't cutting it i had to steal them from my living room and now my living room looks pretty bare but uh okay mr scott i have something for you to think about all feelings ideas are an opinion not fact it's not science until science gets involved and it becomes theory hmm interesting and that's true although i wonder i think about this with uh like schizophrenic people if if they hear voices and everyone tells them that the voice isn't real the thing is the voice is real to them does that mean that they're wrong or does that just mean from their own perspective they have a different perspective of reality than everyone else does so feelings ideas are an opinion not fact it's interesting because maybe what is fact is different for each person now i don't know how to translate the schizophrenia over to me and you who i don't believe are schizophrenic but life man crazy and my thing just jumped okay okay let's try to get these real quick uh yes okay uh let's see what did nathan preston scott say i don't know words and speaking is a terrible way to express ideas this is why visual content excels yeah i agree all right let's see oh this is gordon goodalia 2k i know the certified programmers struggle with new projects because those projects don't resemble what they learn in college this is an interesting point and this also has to do with those algorithms that you have to learn for your interviews and that just have nothing to do with the actual job so learning the bits and pieces of something is the concepts that you learn are different than putting those concepts together in a system as a whole because whenever you go through chapter by chapter example by example you're essentially learning the pieces but what you aren't learning is how things work as a system and how information flows from one part of the system to another so while it's definitely needed i don't even want to say this is an option but you definitely need to know how to learn those concepts in individual components subjects it also is good to create projects so always be learning with the intention to build something build something that ideally you're interested in because i think that is a really strong way to learn uh let's see teach me photon oh you are in the right chat for that where is he reading these messages from if you ask that then i guess i don't even have to answer because wherever you just type that uh let's see let's see man my stomach is going crazy right now i'm starving and i gotta eat okay have you ever been burnt out from programming i have the only program i have been burnt out from is from work it was projects that some things i wasn't really passionate about or interested about for projects that i don't think it's programming that you get burnt out from because i know people at my work who said they were burnt out and then they moved companies basically doing the exact same thing and uh it was just something new so it isn't really programming like i'm you're it's not like you're burnt out where your fingers get tired or your arm hurts it's just mental because maybe you are working on the same thing day after day and you don't understand how it impacts the company or you don't understand the purpose of why am i writing this or maybe you had to rewrite it for the fifth time and you're just burned out but i don't think it's the actual programming that burns you out i think it's the environment and the project itself that more leads to
