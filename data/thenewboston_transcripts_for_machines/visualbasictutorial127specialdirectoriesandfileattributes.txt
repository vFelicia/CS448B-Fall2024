hello YouTube say I'm here from youtube.com slash on live gamer for the new Boston and in this tutorial we're gonna be taking a look a couple of things we're gonna look at getting special directories from the computer and also setting attributes for files so you can even write hidden files to a computer to store information that you don't want the user to change by accident so let's go ahead and delete this right here from form one load and what we're gonna do is we're gonna get the My Documents folder so we'll type text box 1 dot txt and we're gonna set that equal to my dot computer dot file system dot special directories dot and you can see that we have desktop My Documents my music my pictures Program Files programs temp and a whole bunch of other stuff we're gonna be using My Documents so now all we need to do is we need to read a file from that so we'll type file dot read all text and we're gonna use the path from My Documents now we're gonna need to add a string to this so in order to allow us to use the backslash we have to type the @ character backslash hello dot txt and let's see here looks like I was getting my csharp mixed up with Visual Basic we don't actually need the @ character right there so we're gonna read all the text from my documents and then hello text so let's go ahead and open up my documents and I will find hello dot text so here it is right here we'll just write some stuff in there YouTube Visual Basic will go ahead and save that close out okay so now let's go ahead and run this and you can see that it's going to load on live gamer YouTube and Visual Basic into our text box one dot txt so we can also use like I said we can get pictures we can get program files whatever you want and this is very useful if you want to get certain files from the computer and you don't know where those will be let's say you just should be distributing your app and not everybody's gonna use the same folder for my documents so you're gonna want to use this to get special directories now we can also set attributes of a file to make it hidden so now that we've read all the text of this let's go ahead and make it a hidden so file dot set attributes and for the first argument we're gonna need path a string so we'll just type my computer dot file system dot special directories dot My Documents then we'll go ahead and get hello dot text for our second arguments we're going to need our file attributes so since we've already imported system Daioh all we need to do is type file attributes instead of system dot IO dot file attributes and you can see here that we've got archive compressed device directory and crib did hidden normal offline whatever we want now let's go ahead and set this to hit him so let's go ahead and run this it's going to load everything into our text box let's close out of that and head back into the My Documents folder and let's see where is hello it is not there let me set this pretty sure I have a set to view hidden ah so it's a view hidden files and folders and hello is there it is hidden let me shrink this down a bit for you so here is our hello file and you can see that a hat and has a sort of transparent text document right there now that means that it is hidden so go ahead play around with getting special directories and setting file attributes and then once you've done that go ahead and move on to the next tutorial
