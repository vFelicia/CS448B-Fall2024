so at the moment when we have a keyword down we look for it in fact let's change this to search text a lot better so when we press a key down we run this function here that we've just created and what it will do is it will take the value of the the HTML output from search doreen dot PHP and put it into the results div so we can simply test this just by going into search doing dot PHP and echoing something out so let's give it a test let's run on our page ok so hopefully when I press type a key down we should have the value something read back to us into that results div so let's test it ok it's not working oh yes it is okay it's working so when we press sir let's refresh the page and we'll just test that again so when we click in here and type something we're now loading the data from this search Inc PHP okay so we've done everything we need to with regards to this for now we're going to come back to a bit later because what we need to do is we need to be sending the value that's currently in the textbox in the search text here we need to be sending this consistently every time we type to this search dot in PHP so first of all we're going to we're going to write some code inside search string dot PHP and what we're going to do is we're basically going to return to the user what they're already typing so we're going to test out every time they press a key we're going to repeat it back to them inside this div much the same as when we did echo something so this is pretty simple we just need to come down here and we need to say if is set dollar underscore get and we're going to call this will call this search underscore text so if this is set we want to say search text equals dot underscore get search text so let's echo that out now on its own if we were to access this search dot Inc dot PHP file let's just do that now so search inc dot PHP okay so we've entered this file there's nothing come up at the moment but now if we specify it in here search text equals let's say Alex you'll see that that's written back to us on the page so what's going to happen is every time the user enters a character this URL is going to be accessed but via Ajax and we're going to put we're going to put the value into it so let's say the user types an A the first round the the page will be submitted like this then it will be submitted like this then it will be submitted like this and then last it will be submitted like this so that's what's going to happen every time we press a key on our keyboard so let's go back to an index dot PHP okay so now what we want to do in here is we want to open oh we've done this now so we're echoing each each value that we're grabbing from this search text now what we need to do in here is we need to dynamically update this to be sent through to our PHP file search door in PHP so what we need to do is on here specify search underscore text equals something so now we're going to press we're now going to have a plus so we're going to append on something from our page now what we want to append on from our page is the current value inside this text field so let's go ahead and type document dot and we're referencing it from our form so our form is called search dot and then it's search underscore text so search underscore text and then we say dot value so what we're doing now is every time we on key down we're running this function but now what we're doing is we're accessing search th P search underscore text equals and the current value that's typed in so now what should happen is we're returning in results every time we press a key the current value of the text field so basically like I said before we're repeating this to the user so let's go back to our page and test this out I'm going to start stop my name okay right okay so this is what I wanted to happen we have a problem here where we're only echoing out the three characters so why is this well let's return back to our page and think about this carefully on keydown equals fine match what we actually want let's come and refresh again to make sure this is correct don't yeah okay so unque down instead we want Anki up because when the key is up we want to be repeating this value so a lex2 outing in I can type anything I want in here so anything I type in here is just going to be simply repeated so you can see how we can use this to our advantage because now what we can do inside search in PHP is we can create a structured query that will search the database for the current value being typed in here and that's going to do a query for every time we enter a key so it is going to significantly slow down our webpage our server load is going to be quite increased if you like but I'll give you a couple of tips on how to increase the how to stop this inside a search in PHP so we're going to be connecting to our database so again what what's going to happen is the value is going to be well everything in this page is going to be completely repetitively accessed so we're connecting inside here to our database so so we're just constantly connecting and everything like that so we'll go ahead and do it anyway because it's just for the purposes of the tutorial the main goal is to get this to work first of all and then obviously the research comes later on how to speed up your code so let's just quickly connect to our MySQL server we need three properties if you don't already know how to do this there's another tutorial on it so go back and watch that I have created a tutorial on connecting to databases etc etc so I should have probably mentioned it at the start but you should be comfortable with databases before attempting this tutorial so let's go connect to localhost my username is root and I don't actually have a password so we're not going to bother with any error messages right now but err but you could probably put some validation in here in fact let's do let's do this so if MySQL Connect then we come down here so if this connection is successful basically let's put an @ sign there so we don't get any any errors returned if it's not successful then we want to say if MySQL select DB our database if you remember let's just go back to our PHP myadmin is called Ajax so put the database name that you're using in there so if if that's connected then we do something here so we've connected to our database let's go and grab this and put this at the top of the page so we're grabbing the first thing we're doing is we're grabbing the search text that's being typed and then what we're doing is we're putting it into a variable called search underscore text
