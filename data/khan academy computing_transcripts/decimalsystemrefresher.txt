00:00 - - [Instructor] Let's
star with the refresher
00:02 - of the decimal system.
00:03 - Since understanding decimal
00:05 - will help us to understand binary.
00:07 - Consider this number 234.
00:11 - We often say that the
four is in the ones place.
00:14 - The three is in the tens place.
00:17 - And the two is in the hundreds places.
00:22 - That makes this number equal
00:23 - to two times a 100, plus three times 10,
00:30 - plus four times one.
00:33 - All equal 234.
00:38 - Now we can also say that this ones place
00:41 - is 10 raised to the power of zero.
00:44 - The tens place is 10
raised to the power of one.
00:47 - And the hundreds place is 10
raised to the power of two.
00:52 - If we're going to add another place here,
00:55 - this would be a 1,000 and
that would be the same
01:00 - as 10 raised to the power of three.
01:04 - Each place represents a power of 10.
01:07 - And that's why this is the decimal system
01:09 - from the Latin for 10.
01:12 - To figure out what
number we're looking at,
01:15 - we just look at the digit
that's in that place
01:17 - and we multiply it times its place.
01:20 - So a one here would be one
times a 1,000, plus 234.
01:27 - And that's the decimal system.
