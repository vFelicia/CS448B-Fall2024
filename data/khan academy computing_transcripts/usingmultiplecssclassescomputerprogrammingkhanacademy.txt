00:00 - - [Voiceover] We've
managed to do a lot so far
00:02 - with the selectors that we've seen in CSS:
00:04 - selecting elements by tag name,
00:06 - by ID, and by class name.
00:08 - Let's review those for a second
00:10 - in this webpage.
00:11 - This webpage is all about donuts,
00:13 - and it has a heading, paragraphs,
00:16 - and some of the paragraphs
00:16 - are short, one-liner facts.
00:19 - The CSS starts with a rule about selecting
00:21 - all the p tags on the page
00:23 - and giving them a font
family of Sans Serif.
00:26 - I'll change this to monospace
00:28 - so you can see everything it selects.
00:30 - See it?
00:34 - The next rule selects whatever element
00:36 - has an ID of donut header,
00:38 - and we know it's looking for an ID
00:39 - because it starts with this hash symbol.
00:42 - Since the ID is pretty descriptive,
00:43 - it sounds to me like it's selecting
00:45 - a big heading at the top
and changing its font,
00:47 - but I'll just scroll down and confirm
00:49 - that the h1 has the idea.
00:51 - Yep, there it is.
00:53 - The final rule selects all the elements
00:55 - that have the fact class name.
00:57 - We know it's looking for class names
00:58 - because it starts with a dot.
01:00 - To figure out which elements
have that class name
01:02 - I can either look at
what the rule's doing,
01:04 - adding a top and bottom
border and some padding,
01:07 - or I can look through my
HTML for the class name.
01:10 - I can see the class name
is on this paragraph
01:13 - and this paragraph,
01:14 - the two paragraphs with
the one liner facts.
01:16 - That's why they have the border.
01:18 - Class names are great because they let us
01:20 - use the same styles
across multiple elements,
01:23 - but there's even more we
can do with class names.
01:25 - That's what I'll show you now.
01:27 - So we have a webpage about donuts,
01:29 - but donuts are really
not that healthy for you.
01:31 - They might be one of
the least healthy things
01:33 - for you and they're also kind of addictive
01:35 - because of all that sugar.
01:36 - So if we're going to have a page
01:37 - talking about them, we should probably
01:39 - warn people about their unhealthiness.
01:42 - How about we make this top fact red
01:45 - to really get across that it's a warning?
01:47 - How would we do that?
01:49 - Well we could start with
adding a color property
01:51 - to the fact CSS rule.
01:53 - Let's see what that does.
01:55 - Okay, but that made both of the facts red
01:57 - and that 2nd fact isn't a warning,
02:00 - it's just a spelling thing.
02:02 - So we don't want it to be red.
02:04 - We could add an ID, but then if we wanted
02:07 - to color other things that were warnings
02:09 - later and add more warnings, then we would
02:11 - have to keep adding IDs
and rules for those IDs.
02:15 - In a case like this, the best thing to do
02:17 - is to add another class to the p tag.
02:20 - Browsers actually let
us add as many classes
02:22 - as we want to a single tag.
02:24 - To do that, we just put our cursor
02:26 - after the last class name, put a space,
02:30 - and then write a new
class name like warning.
02:34 - Now we can make a rule for warning
02:37 - and move this color
property into the rule.
02:41 - And now the top fact is red
02:42 - and the 2nd one isn't.
02:44 - Beautiful.
02:45 - We can put the class name
02:47 - on more elements like before.
02:49 - Maybe we want to color the strong text,
02:53 - deep fried, we want to color that red
02:55 - because deep fried stuff are often
02:58 - associated mean unhealthy.
02:59 - So we can just add class
equals warning also red.
03:05 - Now notice that this warning fact here
03:10 - has that red color and it also still has
03:12 - the border top, border bottom.
03:14 - That's what happens when
you use multiple classes.
03:16 - The browsers will look at all the rules
03:18 - that apply to them and apply
03:19 - at all of the relevant styles.
03:22 - We should be careful
about using just colors
03:25 - for conveying meaning because
03:27 - some people are colorblind.
03:29 - There are some people who can barely tell
03:30 - the difference between red and black,
03:32 - and maybe you're one of them.
03:33 - So let's change our class to make it
03:35 - more noticeable for everyone.
03:37 - We'll change this color
to a background color
03:40 - because anybody can tell that something
03:42 - has a background color.
03:45 - That's pretty low contrast,
that red and black.
03:47 - Contrast is also important to make
03:49 - our page readable to everyone.
03:51 - So let's just make the color white,
03:55 - and now we have high contrast
03:57 - and a red background for
people who can see red.
04:00 - Since we used a class,
both our warning tags
04:02 - have the same styles.
04:04 - Now, thanks to the
flexibility of CSS classes,
04:07 - we can save the whole world from donuts.
