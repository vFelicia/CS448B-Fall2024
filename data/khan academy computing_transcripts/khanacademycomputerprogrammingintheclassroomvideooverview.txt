00:01 - Voiceover: First of all thank
you for watching this video.
00:03 - We're really excited about CS on Khan
Academy
00:05 - and we're happy that there's other people
excited too.
00:07 - Even though computer science isn't a part
of
00:11 - the core curriculum in U.S. K through 12
education
00:14 - or really anywhere in the world we still
00:17 - think that it's an incredibly important
subject to learn.
00:20 - Because when students learn to program,
they learn how to think logically, how
00:22 - to break down problems into steps and how
to learn from their mistakes.
00:26 - These are skills that they can use outside
of programming too.
00:30 - It can also be a great outlet for
creativity.
00:32 - Once students know the basics of
programming, they can start to
00:36 - include their own ideas and feel like they
have the power
00:38 - to invent new things, and they don't need
money or time
00:41 - to buy supplies, all they need is their
computer and their brain.
00:44 - Personally, I get a surge of adrenaline
every time
00:47 - I realize an idea into reality via a
program.
00:50 - And every student deserves to feel that.
00:54 - Plus, the statistics show that there'll be
a massive number of
00:57 - jobs in computing in the future, more than
any other STEM field.
01:00 - So, by teaching them these skills now,
they'll
01:03 - be much more likely to go into that field.
01:06 - We wanna get them pumped and prepared.
01:09 - So that's why we have an entire topic
01:10 - dedicated to computer science and
programing on Khan Academy.
01:14 - And we look forward to working with
teachers like you
01:16 - to figure out how to incorporate it into
the classroom.
01:19 - One way is to actually teach it as a
subject.
01:22 - If you're lucky enough to work at a school
or
01:24 - a summer camp, where CS is a core topic,
then you
01:28 - can use the Khan Academy CS curriculum the
same way
01:30 - you could use any of the other topics on
Khan Academy.
01:34 - We now have a full intro to programming
01:35 - curriculum that teaches JavaScript using
the processing JS language.
01:39 - Which means that students learn both a
JavaScript language and
01:44 - how to make fun drawings and animations at
the same time.
01:47 - So, in this curriculum, go watch talk
throughs, where
01:50 - we'll explain a concept and have code on
one
01:53 - side and output on the other, and then
they'll
01:55 - actually do interactive challenges
themselves, which they'll get points
02:00 - for if they complete.
02:01 - And and throughout, they'll also have
projects, which
02:03 - are more free-form and creative things,
and these are
02:06 - great things that you could actually do
pair programming
02:08 - with in the classroom, if you have that
opportunity.
02:11 - So this this curriculum here is between 10
to 15 hours,
02:14 - depending on how much time you spend on
the challenges and
02:17 - the projects, and will take them all the
way through all
02:20 - the basics of JavaScript all the way up to
Object-Oriented Design.
02:23 - As a programming teacher, you also have
02:25 - multiple ways of tracking your students
activity.
02:27 - For example, you might check out their
activity graph and find
02:30 - out what coding challenges they've
02:31 - completed or talk throughs they've
watched.
02:35 - You might get the email every week that
says you
02:37 - know, what your students have been up to
that week.
02:40 - And you can also look at all the programs
that your students have been making.
02:44 - You can also use Khan CS for independent
study.
02:47 - Let's say you have advanced students, that
you wanna keep engaged
02:50 - and they've already blazed through the
curriculum that you've given them.
02:53 - Well, you could assign them to learn
programming as an independent project.
02:57 - Maybe ask them to go through the
02:58 - programming tutorial, up to a particular
point.
03:00 - And have 'em propose a project that ties
into what else they're learning.
03:03 - For example, if the student is learning
chemistry.
03:06 - They could learn programming, and then
write a
03:08 - program to visualize a molecule, like this
cool 3D
03:13 - one.
03:13 - Or if they're in math, and they're
learning trigonometry
03:15 - they can write these visualizations to
show what they've learned.
03:20 - And then, think about it, they could
actually
03:21 - share these with the rest of their class,
03:23 - and say, hey, classmates, look at this
thing
03:25 - I made to help us visualize what we've
learned.
03:28 - And if I were their classmates, I would be
really impressed.
03:31 - If I was the student, I'd be really,
really proud.
03:33 - You can also use Khan CS for Applied
Learning.
03:36 - We've a lot of great programs that
demonstrate
03:38 - concepts from math and science, and
they're highly interactive.
03:42 - Even if your students don't yet understand
programming, you can play
03:45 - with these programs to give them a
different understanding of a topic.
03:49 - And you can even tinker with a few of the
variables.
03:52 - For example, if students are learning
about pendulums, you can point them to
03:57 - this pendulum example, where you can
actually play with the angle and the lane.
04:02 - You've seen, I've already had to tinkered
with some of the variables.
04:05 - You can change the gravity to be on a
completely different planet that,
04:08 - you know, most of us don't get the
pleasure of getting to visit.
04:11 - You can change the mass.
04:13 - You can change the radius.
04:16 - So you can tinker both in the UI and in
04:18 - the variables over here for a lot of these
simulation programs.
04:22 - And look, I'd managed to do what every
school child wants to do
04:27 - when you're on the swingset, be able to
swing all the way over.
04:31 - The Holy Grail.
04:31 - For another example, if you're learning
the
04:33 - solar system, like in Astronomy, you could
use
04:37 - this solar system simulation to see how it
is that the planets move around the sun.
04:42 - And then you can just easily tweak the
variables on the side.
04:44 - And say, you know, what happens if the
Earth moves
04:46 - really, really fast and goes zoomy zoomy
zoomy around the Sun.
04:51 - And what happens if the Earth is huge.
04:53 - So you can give students this program and
have them tinker with the variables and
04:59 - get them actively engaged in it with
thinking
05:01 - about, you know, how the solar system
works.
05:04 - And maybe also it gets them thinking about
programming
05:07 - and maybe they start to explore
programming independently which
05:10 - is something that would be great for
schools that
05:13 - don't actually get to teach it as a core
topic.
05:16 - Eventually in the future what we're hoping
is that you know, all kids
05:19 - will grow up learning how to program and
every time they learn something in.
05:24 - You know a math or science or even
05:25 - an art topic, they'll think oh, that's
really cool.
05:29 - I wonder if I can make this program to
help me understand it even deeper.
05:32 - Right?
05:32 - And I think that's the power of programing
is that I can actually connect
05:34 - all these pieces together and help us
explore them in a more interactive way.
05:41 - So those are some ways that we thought of
about how you can use the Khan CS program.
05:45 - But don't feel limited by them.
05:46 - The world is your programmatic oyster!
05:49 - If you come up with some other way of
using it, let us know.
05:53 - We would absolutely love to hear it.
