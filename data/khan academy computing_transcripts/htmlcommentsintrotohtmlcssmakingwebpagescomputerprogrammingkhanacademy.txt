00:00 - - Everything that we've
put in our webpages so far
00:03 - has been either content
displayed by the browser
00:05 - or tags to tell the
browser how to display it.
00:08 - Sometimes, though, we just
want to put information
00:10 - in our webpages for other humans to read
00:13 - and for the browser to ignore.
00:16 - To do that we write an
opening angle bracket,
00:18 - exclamation mark, two dashes,
00:22 - and some text inside here,
00:25 - and then two dashes, and
a closing angle bracket.
00:29 - We call this a comment,
00:31 - and it's something we do
00:32 - in all sorts of programing languages
00:33 - because we often want to do things
00:35 - that are just for humans.
00:37 - That's the thing about programs,
00:39 - there not just for computers to look at,
00:40 - they're also for other humans to look at
00:42 - because we often work together on things
00:45 - and learn from each other.
00:47 - O.K., what do we use comments for
00:49 - besides just saying hello
to our fellow humans?
00:52 - Well, we might use them
for letting people know
00:55 - where content came from.
00:57 - If they want to update it.
00:58 - I'll say this paragraph is based
01:01 - on the Wikipedia article...
01:05 - I should probably give a
link to that too, but..
01:08 - And this paragraph is based on
01:13 - Pamela's personal opinion.
01:16 - It's a very well trusted source,
01:19 - and then, you know, maybe we'd even say
01:22 - give a link inside the comments.
01:25 - These lyrics were from here,
01:30 - and that helps people know
01:32 - how I got the content of this page.
01:34 - Do you notice something
about these comments?
01:36 - They are all green.
01:38 - That's because we're using
01:39 - a code editor with syntax highlighting,
01:41 - and it uses colors to
help us see what's what,
01:43 - and comments are pretty much
01:45 - always colored green by convention.
01:48 - We could also use comments to
comment out part of our HTML.
01:52 - Like if we want to experiment with
01:54 - taking something away from our webpage,
01:56 - we just surround it with a comment.
02:00 - Dah, dah, dah.
02:02 - Now, the browser no longer sees that HTML
02:05 - because browsers ignore
everything in comments,
02:08 - and that part is gone from the page.
02:10 - If I decide that I actually like it,
02:12 - I can comment it back in
02:14 - by removing those comments on both sides,
02:17 - and now it's back.
02:19 - Remember, comments are for humans,
02:22 - at least the kind of humans
02:23 - that like to look at web page code,
02:25 - which is pretty much all of us now, right?
