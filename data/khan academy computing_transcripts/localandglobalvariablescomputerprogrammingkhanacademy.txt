00:00 - Now that you've mastered
the basics of functions,
00:03 - I want to talk about a topic
that can get a little tricky:
00:07 - the difference between
local and global variables.
00:11 - These terms may not
mean anything to you now.
00:14 - So let's start with an example.
00:16 - I made this program here to show you
00:18 - how many inches I grew in my childhood.
00:20 - Since humans grow at different rates,
00:22 - I came up with this function, calcInches,
00:24 - where I can pass in
a startAge and an endAge,
00:27 - and an inchesPerYear,
00:29 - and then it would calculate
how many inches total
00:32 - were grown during that time.
00:34 - . . . and return it back
to whoever called it.
00:37 - So you can see here from 0 to 8 years
00:40 - I call calcInches
and I pass 0, 8, and 2.5,
00:44 - because I grew about 2.5 inches per year.
00:48 - And so it does a calculation,
and you can see it spits out 20.
00:52 - Then from 8 to 16, I call it from,
and I pass it 8 and 16 and then 2
00:57 - because I didn't quite grow as much,
and you can see it spits out 16.
01:01 - So this is neat, but now I
want to actually display
01:05 - how many inches I grew, total,
in my whole childhood.
01:08 - So how do I do that? Well, I
might start by looking at my code
01:13 - and thinking, "Hmm, what values
do I have here?"
01:17 - Do I have anything that looks
like it represents total inches?
01:20 - Well, I do have this totalInches variable
inside my calcInches function,
01:26 - so I could just output that,
see what it says; start there.
01:30 - So let's say text(totalInches, 10, 200),
and put it down at the bottom.
01:36 - All right, let's see, what have we got?
01:38 - Oh, o-oh, we've got the 'Oh noes!' guy.
01:40 - And he says there's a problem.
01:42 - totalInches is not defined.
01:45 - Well, that's weird, because we
01:47 - defined totalInches right here, right?
var totalInches =.
01:51 - Well, the problem is that we declared
01:54 - totalInches inside a function.
On this line here.
01:59 - And when we declare a variable
inside a function,
02:01 - it's considered a local variable.
02:05 - It lives only inside
this function here (calcInches).
02:09 - And the code outside the function,
all of this, it doesn't see
02:12 - local variables inside functions.
02:15 - It only sees whatever gets returned.
02:18 - It only sees that value,
not that variable.
02:21 - So when we try to use totalInches
outside the function,
02:24 - it doesn't know what it is,
02:26 - and it says 'Hey, I've never
seen this variable before.
02:28 - It's not defined. I can't display it.'
02:32 - So there is a way that we can make it
02:34 - so that the outside code
can see this variable.
02:37 - And that's if we turn it from
a local variable into a global variable.
02:42 - We can do that by moving the definition
outside of the function,
02:47 - into what's called the global scope.
02:51 - And now, inside the function,
all we're doing
02:54 - is changing the value of it each time,
not defining and declaring it.
02:58 - So you can see that it says
'Total grown over life: 16'
03:02 - So it found the variable because
we made it into a global variable.
03:06 - But it's not actually the value
that we're looking for.
03:09 - That's just the most recent value.
03:11 - And that's because every time
we call this function,
03:13 - it's setting totalInches to whatever it's
calculating that time. Right?
03:18 - So what we really want to do is,
we want a new variable
03:21 - that we use only
for storing the overall total
03:24 - that we add to every time we calculate,
you know, the total for a range,
03:29 - So let's change this back
to being a local variable,
03:33 - and let's make a new global variable
called lifeInches,
03:38 - and we'll start it at zero.
03:40 - And then inside the function,
we'll add to this global variable
03:45 - by saying lifeInches += totalInches.
03:49 - So we're going to add
however much we calculate
03:51 - each time we call this function,
03:52 - we're going to add it
to the lifeInches global variable.
03:56 - And then at the bottom,
03:58 - we'll display lifeInches:
text(lifeInches, 10, 200).
04:00 - Tada! our total growth over life.
04:03 - Now that's not actually how tall I am.
I'm taller than that.
04:06 - But that's because you know,
04:07 - we start off born with more than 0 length.
04:10 - So if I want total,
maybe I could start at 20.
04:14 - And there you go, that's how tall I am.
04:17 - All right. So let's review, totalInches
04:20 - is what we call a local variable.
04:22 - And we know that because
we see the declaration of it
04:24 - inside this function
and not outside the function.
04:28 - And so that means that
this outside code here
04:30 - doesn't know about this variable
called totalInches.
04:34 - Now lifeInches is what we
call a global variable.
04:37 - And we know that because
we see its declaration
04:39 - outside of any function
in our global scope.
04:43 - So try to keep this in mind when
04:45 - you're writing your functions
and your variables.
04:47 - And think to yourself whether you want
04:48 - a local variable
for just your function to use,
04:51 - or a global variable
for your whole program to use.
04:54 - And don't worry if this is hard
to wrap your head around.
04:57 - It's one of the trickiest
concepts in programming,
04:59 - and in JavaScript in particular.
05:01 - And it's something you'll get better at
as you keep practicing.
