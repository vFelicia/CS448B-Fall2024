00:00 - A basic webpage, like this one, 
is made up of HTML tags, like all these.
00:06 - Now, when we want to style a webpage,
how do we bring CSS into it?
00:12 - We add a `` tag.
00:14 - And the browser knows
when it sees a style tag
00:17 - to use its CSS engine
to process that tag.
00:20 - We usually put the `` tag
in the ``,
00:23 - because we want to make sure that
the browser processes the styles
00:27 - before it renders the HTML tags.
00:30 - Otherwise, if we put ``
at the bottom here,
00:34 - then we could have an FOUC:
a flash of unstyled content,
00:40 - and people would see
our webpage naked-- gross!
00:44 - Let's bring it back here where it belongs.
00:48 - Okay, so now this webpage has style.
00:51 - How do we bring JavaScript into a webpage
when we want to add interactivity?
00:57 - For that, we add a `` tag.
01:01 - And the best place to put a `` tag
01:04 - is actually at the very bottom of the page
right before your end `` tag.
01:10 - I've put it there, and
I'll explain why it's there in a bit.
01:15 - Now what can I put
inside this `` tag?
01:19 - Hmm, we can put any valid JavaScript in it,
like `var four = 2 +2;`.
01:25 - But that's not terribly exciting, because
nothing's happening on our webpage.
01:30 - And if you're on Khan Academy,
you probably already knew
01:33 - that four equals two plus two.
01:35 - So one thing I can do
to check that it works,
01:39 - is to write this line of code here.
01:42 - Okay, you don't see anything, right?
01:45 - And maybe you've never seen
this function before.
01:48 - This function, `console.log`,
is a special one we can use
01:53 - in many JavaScript environments,
including browsers.
01:56 - And it will write out things
to the JavaScript console.
02:00 - You can find that console
in your browser
02:03 - by pressing Command-Option-I,
or Control-Option-I,
02:08 - or right-clicking anywhere on the page,
and selecting "Inspect element".
02:14 - Pause the talkthrough now,
and try to bring up your dev console
02:19 - to see that message.
02:21 - So, did you see it? Great!
02:23 - You can close the console now
if you'd like,
02:26 - as it can take up a lot of room.
02:28 - It can also get distracting since
it'll show you every error as I'm typing.
02:32 - It is a great tool for debugging, though.
02:35 - So definitely file it away
in your toolbox.
02:38 - Now let me actually do something
to the page with JavaScript,
02:42 - using a line of code that
will not make a lot of sense yet.
02:56 - See what happened?
02:58 - Our webpage disappeared, and was replaced
with our "leet hacker" message.
03:03 - We'll go into more details about
how this line of code actually works.
03:07 - But basically it found the `` tag,
and replaced the contents.
03:12 - Now what would happen if I copied
and pasted this `` tag,
03:16 - and stuck it up in the ``
with the `` tag?
03:20 - It doesn't work-- why not?
03:23 - Because the webpage evaluates
the `` tag
03:26 - before it sees the `` tag.
03:29 - And it says, "Uh-oh, I haven't even seen
`document.body` yet,
03:34 - "And you're trying to manipulate it!
That can't happen."
03:38 - That's why we have to put our
`` tag at the bottom of the page.
03:43 - So that the webpage sees
the `` tag first,
03:46 - sees everything in it,
and then we start doing stuff to it.
03:51 - We want to make sure that
the webpage exists first.
03:54 - And that's different from CSS:
03:56 - We want to put our `` tag
at the beginning,
03:59 - because the CSS parser is fine
with applying styles
04:02 - to things that don't exist yet.
04:04 - It'll just apply them once they happen.
04:07 - But JavaScript DOM is not fine with that.
04:09 - So make sure it goes at the bottom here.
04:12 - Try adding the `` tag
in the next challenge,
04:16 - making sure you put it at the bottom,
04:18 - and then I promise I will explain
much more about this line right here.
