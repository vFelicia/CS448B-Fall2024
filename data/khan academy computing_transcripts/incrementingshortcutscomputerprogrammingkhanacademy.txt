00:00 - - [Voiceover] Do you remember the steps
00:02 - of making an animation?
00:03 - Let's review them to see how
this ball animation works.
00:08 - So, first, outside of our draw function
00:12 - we declare variables,
00:13 - whatever variables we
wanna use in the animation.
00:16 - In this program, we
declare four variables:
00:19 - x, y, ballWidth, and ballHeight.
00:23 - Then inside our draw function
00:25 - we use those variables and
change them in some way.
00:29 - In this program, we use the
variables to draw an ellipse,
00:33 - passing a variable for every parameter.
00:37 - And since we are passing a
variable for every parameter,
00:40 - that means, actually, that
we can animate every aspect
00:43 - of this ellipse.
00:45 - And that's just what
we're doing, look at that!
00:48 - So, how are we changing those numbers?
00:50 - That's what we're doing with
these lines of code here.
00:54 - On this line we add one to x,
00:57 - which means that the ball
moves one pixel to the right
01:00 - in every frame.
01:01 - On this line we subtract two from y,
01:05 - which means that our
ball moves two pixels up
01:07 - in every frame.
01:09 - See that?
01:11 - Now, on these lines we're
using some math operators
01:14 - that you may not have seen before.
01:16 - This star operator is how
we multiply in JavaScript.
01:21 - And the slash operator is how we divide.
01:24 - So this expression here is
taking the variable ballWidth
01:29 - and multiplying it by
the fraction 99 over 100.
01:34 - Basically, it's making the width be 99%
01:37 - of what it was before.
01:39 - See?
01:40 - And we're doing the same
thing on the next line,
01:42 - but with ballHeight.
01:43 - So, each time ballHeight becomes
99% of what is was before.
01:49 - That means, you know,
just to show you the math,
01:51 - if ballHeight starts off at 200,
01:54 - then on the second frame it'll be 198
01:57 - because that's 99% of 200.
02:00 - See?
02:02 - All right.
02:03 - So, we can see that this
is the actual effect
02:05 - of our animation.
02:07 - Now, if you look at
these four lines of code,
02:11 - you'll notice they all
follow a similar pattern.
02:15 - We have a variable, then an equal sign,
02:18 - then that same variable again,
02:20 - then some math operator,
and then some number.
02:26 - And you can see that in
all four lines of code.
02:30 - This pattern is common in programming
02:32 - because we often take a variable
02:35 - and do some math operation to it
02:37 - and store the result in the same variable.
02:40 - Now, programmers, we don't like to do
02:43 - more work than necessary,
02:44 - so, you know, a long time
ago programmers decided,
02:47 - hey, since we use this pattern so much,
02:50 - shouldn't there be an
easier way to type it?
02:53 - So, they invented shortcuts.
02:56 - I'll show you.
02:58 - Instead of writing x equals x plus one,
03:01 - we can write x plus equals one
03:05 - and it'll do the same thing.
03:07 - Instead of this, y equals y minus two,
03:10 - we can write y minus equals two.
03:13 - Same thing.
03:15 - Here, we can replace
this with times equal.
03:19 - And the same thing on the next line.
03:21 - And when we restart, we
can see our animation
03:24 - is precisely the same.
03:25 - All we've done is use the shortcut
03:28 - to write the same expression in less code.
03:32 - There's also a divide equals shortcut
03:35 - if you want to divide instead.
03:37 - Hoo hoo, look at that!
03:39 - That's weird!
03:40 - All right, so now that
you know the shortcuts,
03:42 - you can write less code for
the same beautiful result.
03:45 - And that is what we programmers love.
