00:00 - - [Voiceover] jQuery is
the most popular library
00:03 - on the web today.
00:05 - It's a library of JavaScript functions
00:07 - that make it easy for webpage developers
00:09 - to do common tasks like
manipulating the webpage,
00:13 - responding to user events,
getting data from their servers,
00:17 - building effects and
animations, and much more.
00:21 - jQuery builds on top of the functionality
00:24 - that browsers give us via
the JavaScript DOM API
00:27 - but let's us accomplish the same
00:29 - things in fewer lines of code.
00:32 - For example, let's say
you wanted to resize
00:35 - all of the images on your page,
00:37 - like when the user clicked a button.
00:40 - You could write these
four lines of code here.
00:44 - And that would work.
00:46 - Or, you could write
this single line of code
00:49 - and jQuery will do all
the heavy lifting for you.
00:53 - Plus jQuery takes care of any
00:55 - cross-browser bugs or inconsistencies.
00:59 - In 2014 over 60% of the top
01:02 - million webpages included jQuery.
01:05 - So pretty much all web developers
01:08 - either know jQuery or have used jQuery
01:10 - at some point in their career.
01:13 - And now you can become
one of those developers.
