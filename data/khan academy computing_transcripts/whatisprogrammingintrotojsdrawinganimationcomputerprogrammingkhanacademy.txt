00:00 - Hi, welcome to programming!
00:02 - If you've never learned
to program before,
00:04 - you might be wondering
what programming actually is.
00:08 - Well, when we write a program,
00:10 - we're giving the computer
a series of commands
00:12 - that kind of look like
a weird form of English.
00:15 - You can think of a computer
as a very obedient dog,
00:19 - listening to your every command,
and doing whatever you tell it to do.
00:23 - So what's so cool about programming?
00:25 - Well, it really depends on
what you think is cool.
00:29 - Because as it turns out, you can
use programming for almost everything.
00:34 - Programs control robots
that can take care of patients,
00:38 - and my favorite,
robots that can roam around Mars
00:41 - and look for water on the surface.
00:43 - Programs help self-driving cars
know which way to turn--
00:47 - which is pretty important!
00:49 - Programs help doctors cure diseases by
processing huge amounts of medical data.
00:55 - Programs can be really fun games,
like Doodle Jump, Angry Birds, Minecraft.
01:01 - Programs make it possible for Pixar
01:03 - to put out their awesome
3-D animated movies,
01:06 - and for movies like Harry Potter
to have such cool special effects.
01:10 - What's your favorite movie?
01:11 - I bet that a computer
helped make it somehow.
01:14 - Programs are behind
the websites and the apps
01:16 - that you use every day, all the time,
01:18 - like Google Maps, and
Wikipedia, and YouTube,
01:21 - and of course, where you are now,
Khan Academy.
01:25 - Here, on Khan Academy, you'll learn
how to write JavaScript programs
01:28 - to make drawings, animations, and games.
01:31 - And that will be a great start
01:33 - towards creating whatever
you're imagining in your head.
01:36 - I know, it might be hard to see
how a drawing program
01:40 - relates to programs for robots,
or curing diseases.
01:44 - But believe it or not,
the same basic concepts
01:47 - are used by pretty much
every programmer in every program.
01:51 - Once you learn to program JavaScript,
01:54 - you'll be able to learn other
programming languages much more easily.
01:58 - Now you just gotta keep going!
