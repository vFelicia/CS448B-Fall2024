00:00 - - [Narrator] This is a
tool that will help us
00:02 - visualize exactly what
the computer's doing.
00:04 - The line of code that's on,
00:06 - the memory it's storing
00:07 - and what it's out putting.
00:09 - So let's begin.
00:10 - The computer will start
at the very beginning
00:14 - in the header of the outer for loop.
00:17 - The first thing it does,
00:19 - is initialize the variable I to one.
00:22 - We can see here, that it says
00:24 - in memory I is now equal to one.
00:28 - The next thing it does,
00:29 - is check that I is less
than or equal to 10.
00:32 - Since one is less than 10, that's true
00:35 - and now the computer knows,
00:36 - it can enter this for loop body, here.
00:40 - So let's go next.
00:43 - Inside the for loop,
00:44 - it sees another for loop.
00:48 - This one has a very similar header.
00:51 - But this time it's going to
set a different variable, J.
00:55 - So it sets J equal to one
00:57 - and we can see that the memory is updated.
01:00 - And it checks to make sure that
01:01 - J is less than or equal to 10,
01:03 - which it is.
01:04 - And that means it can continue
01:05 - into the body of this inner for loop.
01:10 - It goes into the body
01:11 - and sees this console.log statement.
01:14 - Now here I'm using console.log
01:16 - instead of print line,
01:17 - because it's a slightly
different environment,
01:19 - but it does the same thing.
01:21 - So when it executes that,
01:22 - it'll multiply I times J.
01:24 - We can see I is one and J is one.
01:26 - So we're gonna get a very
exciting, one, beautiful!
01:31 - All right now, it goes back
to this inner for loop.
01:36 - Because it's not don't with it yet.
01:38 - The first thing it needs to do
01:39 - is execute this increment part,
01:41 - because that always happens
at the end of a repetition.
01:47 - So once it does that, you
can see that J is now two.
01:51 - So now it's going to check the condition
01:53 - to see if it's still true.
01:55 - Is J still less than or equal to 10.
01:58 - It is, so that means it can keep going
02:01 - into the body of this loop.
02:05 - And once again, it's going
to display I times J.
02:08 - This time J is two and I is still one.
02:10 - So we're gonna see two, great.
02:14 - So, now it goes back once
again to the inner for loop.
02:18 - It's going to change J to three,
02:21 - see that it's less than 10.
02:23 - Go into the loop.
02:25 - Execute that there.
02:26 - And this is how we're gonna get through
02:29 - the first multiples,
02:33 - all the way, you know, up to 10, ready?
02:40 - Up to nine.
02:43 - And the final execution,
02:46 - will be when J is 10.
02:48 - Once it's set J equal to 10
02:52 - and gets to 11,
02:54 - it can no longer enter this loop.
02:57 - Because it says, is 11
less than or equal to 10?
03:00 - No, it is not.
03:02 - At that point, it knows
that this loop is done,
03:05 - it's going to exit it and go back
03:08 - to the outer for loop, here.
03:12 - So now it goes back.
03:14 - And in this outer for loop,
03:15 - I is still only equal to one,
03:19 - and it hasn't executed
this I plus plus, yet.
03:23 - It finally needs to do this
03:24 - now that it's done executing
the inside instructions.
03:27 - So we should see, I become two, very good.
03:31 - Now it's two.
03:32 - And now we can see, oh, is
two less than or equal to 10?
03:35 - Yes it is.
03:37 - And it's gonna go inside
to that inner for loop.
03:41 - And execute that inner for loop.
03:43 - Now see that J resets to one.
03:46 - So that's really interesting,
03:49 - because it's starting all
over again with this for loop.
03:53 - So now when it gets here,
03:54 - it's gonna do I times J,
03:57 - this times it's doing two times one.
03:59 - We're gonna see two.
04:01 - So this time, I is gonna be two,
04:02 - the whole time.
04:03 - And J is gonna go from one to 10.
04:06 - So we should see two times one
04:08 - and then we should see, two times two.
04:11 - And then we should see, two times three,
04:14 - and so on.
04:16 - So this'll keep going until
it gets to J equals 10
04:20 - and then it's going to go back
up to that outer for loop,
04:23 - and I will become three and
it'll keep going and keep going.
04:27 - So hopefully this gives you an idea
04:29 - for what is actually happening
04:31 - with the computer behind the scenes.
04:34 - If you want, you can try out
this visualization yourself
04:37 - and go all the way through
04:39 - every execution of the
code, all 342 steps.
