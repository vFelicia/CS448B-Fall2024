00:01 - We're back with Winston,
00:03 - and now we have both 
an x and a y variable
00:06 - for Winston's position.
00:08 - So, now we can make Winston 
hop up and down
00:11 - and have a little Winston party!
Wooo!
00:14 - Very nice.
00:15 - Let's review what this code does 
before we keep going.
00:19 - We have these x and y variables
at the top
00:21 - that store the center position 
of Winston's face,
00:25 - which we use in this line here
when we make the ellipse for his face.
00:29 - Then, we position the eyes 
and the mouth
00:31 - relative to the center of the face.
00:34 - So, we subtract or add to x and y 
in order to make sure that the eyes
00:39 - are 50 pixels away and 100 pixels away.
00:43 - For example, the mouth
00:45 - is 50 pixels to the right 
of the center of the face,
00:49 - and 40 pixels below 
the center of the face.
00:55 - So, let's go through and see 
what else we can store as variables.
01:00 - To do that, I'm going to go through 
each line of code
01:03 - and look for what we call 
hard coded numbers.
01:07 - Those are numbers 
that are just straight numbers,
01:11 - not variables 
or dependent on variables.
01:14 - Let's see. 
In our first ellipse call here,
01:18 - we have 300 and 300 
for the width and height.
01:22 - So, we can make a variable 
for these instead, like faceSize.
01:26 - So, faceSize = 300,
and then we can pass faceSize in here,
01:32 - and right now it would pass 300
as the value.
01:37 - Cool. Now, let's keep going.
01:41 - Everything in here 
is using x or y or eyeSize,
01:45 - but here for the mouth, 
we once again have 150
01:48 - and 150 for the width and height.
01:51 - So, we can make a mouthSize variable,
say mouthSize = 150,
01:56 - and we'll go pass mouthSize here.
01:59 - It'll just pass 150 right now,
02:01 - because that's what
the variable is equal to.
02:04 - OK, so now that we've done that,
we can easily change the faceSize here,
02:11 - and we can easily change the mouthSize,
and we can move it like that,
02:16 - and we can change the eyeSize again.
02:19 - OK, so that's cool.
02:20 - But, there's something 
I don't really like about that,
02:24 - and that's when I change the faceSize.
02:28 - I actually want everything else to change
relative to the faceSize,
02:33 - so if I make the faceSize 
really small like this,
02:37 - I want his eyes and his mouth 
to be really small, too.
02:41 - If I make the faceSize 
half of its original size,
02:44 - the eyes and the mouth 
should also be half of their size.
02:48 - Otherwise he just looks really silly,
02:50 - because his eyes and his mouth 
are way too big for his face.
02:53 - They're not even connected anymore.
02:55 - So what we want to do 
is somehow make these variables,
02:59 - mouthSize and eyeSize,
03:01 - be dependent on this variable,
faceSize.
03:06 - So, let's bring it back to what it was.
03:09 - The way we can do this
03:11 - is we can make these values 
be based off the faceSize values.
03:16 - So, we can say
mouthSize = faceSize/2.
03:22 - We are using a fraction of the face;
03:24 - we're saying take one half 
of the face size.
03:27 - If you're not familiar with fractions,
03:29 - there's tons of videos on Khan Academy
03:32 - that you can use 
to review how fractions work.
03:36 - All right. Now for eyeSize. 
It's around faceSize/4.
03:40 - It's not perfect, 
but it's pretty good.
03:43 - Oh, 7.
There we go, that's better.
03:46 - See, if you get the fraction 
wrong at first,
03:48 - you can always fix it later.
03:50 - Just fiddle with that number 
until something makes sense.
03:54 - OK, so now if we resize the face again,
03:58 - see how the eyes and the mouth 
are actually resizing along with it?
04:02 - It's pretty cool.
04:04 - But, there's still something wrong.
04:06 - The eyes and the mouth
04:09 - are still going off the face 
when we go really small.
04:12 - The sizes are correct;
the problem is the offset from the face.
04:18 - What's happening here 
is that down here,
04:21 - when we position the ellipses,
04:24 - we have x - 50 and y - 50,
and then x + 100 and y - 60,
04:31 - So even if our face size 
is only 50 pixels,
04:35 - we're still having the eye positioned 
at -50 pixels to the center,
04:41 - which is going to make it off the face.
04:43 - So, we need for 50 and 100 
and all these numbers here
04:47 - all of these should also be fractions
of the faceSize,
04:51 - so that when the faceSize changes,
the amount that the eyes are offset
04:56 - and the mouth is offset,
04:57 - those numbers should also change.
05:02 - So, to show you what I mean, 
let's do the first eye.
05:05 - x - 50. So, x - 50 pixels.
05:08 - This means it should be 50 pixels
to the left of the center of the face.
05:12 - Well, what we actually want now
is to use the fraction,
05:15 - so it's going to be faceSize/6.
05:19 - So, one sixth the size of the face.
05:22 - Cool. And then 50 
will be also faceSize/6.
05:29 - So, now if we resize,
05:31 - notice how that eye 
is perfectly positioned.
05:35 - Good eye, Winston! Good eye.
05:38 - The other eye still needs
some help though.
05:41 - So 100; that'll be faceSize/3, 
so one third the size of the face,
05:48 - and 60 is one fifth the size of the face,
so faceSize/5.
05:54 - Great. Let's resize it, very nice.
05:57 - We still have a problem with our mouth,
06:00 - so we'll go down to the mouth.
06:02 - This one is maybe faceSize/6 again,
06:07 - and this one is about faceSize/7.
06:11 - All right, now everything is done 
proportionally. Let's check it out.
06:15 - Woo! Now we can make Winston really small,
06:19 - and his eyes and mouth 
are still inside his face!
06:23 - I'm sure Winston 
is really happy about that.
06:26 - All right! Yay!
06:28 - So, let's review what we're doing here.
06:31 - At the top, we have our variables.
06:33 - We start off with a variable 
that's just storing a number: 200.
06:37 - Then, we make our mouthSize 
and eyeSize variables
06:39 - be dependent on that number
as fractions of that number,
06:43 - so that if faceSize is currently 200,
06:45 - then mouthSize will be 100.
06:47 - But, if we change faceSize to 300,
06:50 - then mouthSize
would suddenly be 150,
06:53 - so it's always changing in proportion.
06:56 - Then, down here, 
when we calculate our offsets,
06:59 - we're also using fractions,
07:01 - because we want the offsets 
to also be changing
07:06 - proportional to the faceSize.
07:08 - We basically just want to make it
07:10 - so we just have this one variable
that affects everything.
07:14 - We can do that with variables 
and variable expressions.
07:19 - So, now that we understand
07:21 - how to make variables dependent
on the values of other variables,
07:24 - we can do way more with our programs.
07:26 - Let's celebrate 
by making Winston huge!
07:30 - Go Winston, come on, 
keep going! Keep going!
07:33 - Never stop!! 
Keep going! Naaaaaa!
