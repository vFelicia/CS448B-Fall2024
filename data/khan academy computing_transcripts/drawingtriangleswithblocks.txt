00:00 - - We're back with Winston,
00:01 - and he's shaved off his unibrow
00:03 - 'cause he didn't like it that much.
00:05 - But now Winston is going to a party,
00:08 - and he wants a party hat.
00:10 - So what can we use to make a party hat?
00:14 - Well, what I wanna do
is show you how to use
00:16 - the triangle function 'cause
we haven't used that before.
00:19 - So let's try making a
hat out of a triangle.
00:22 - I'll drag the triangle over here,
00:25 - and it showed up yellow
because we've got this
00:27 - fill that's yellow, and it's
making both these things
00:30 - yellow, but now it's really
confusing to figure out
00:33 - the difference between the
ellipse and the triangle.
00:35 - So let's drag in another fill
and make it a party color.
00:39 - The triangle function
looks a little intimidating
00:42 - because it's got six parameters here,
00:45 - and before we were only dealing with four.
00:48 - Now these parameters,
as you can see above,
00:50 - it's the x1 and the y1, the x2 and the y2,
00:54 - and the x3 and the y3.
00:56 - What does that actually mean?
00:58 - It's the three pairs of coordinates
01:01 - for each point of the triangle.
01:03 - So this point and this
point and this point.
01:07 - Now it's not obvious when you look
01:10 - exactly which one is which point,
01:12 - so you have to kind of
look at the numbers,
01:14 - and look up here and
kind of figure it out.
01:16 - So the first one is
(20, 20), and this here
01:19 - looks exactly like point (20, 20). Right?
01:22 - 'Cause 20 pixels over, 20 pixels down.
01:25 - This one is (100, 100).
01:27 - Well, that looks like this point here.
01:29 - 100 pixels over, 100 pixels down.
01:33 - And then this one.
01:34 - That leaves the last point (250, 50).
01:37 - So it's 250 pixels over from the left
01:40 - and 50 pixels down.
01:42 - So those are our coordinates.
01:44 - And if we want to change our triangle
01:46 - to be in a different place,
we need to figure out
01:48 - which of the coordinates
to change and by how much.
01:51 - Or, we just play with the numbers.
01:53 - So I'm gonna make a party hat,
01:55 - and I think this is in a good spot,
01:56 - so I'm gonna leave the
(100, 100) the way it is.
01:59 - But this right here needs
to move way over here.
02:03 - So that means changing the X
02:05 - because this is our X direction.
02:08 - I'm gonna go here and just move it over.
02:12 - Ok, that looks good.
02:14 - And now I'm wanna bring
this one down and out a bit.
02:18 - So, let's see. Let's go down,
02:22 - and then I want it to be wider.
02:24 - That looks cool.
02:26 - I'm just gonna move this X over a bit.
02:28 - Ok, beautiful.
02:31 - Now he's got a party hat.
02:33 - And yes, the triangle
function, it is confusing.
02:37 - It's got a lot of numbers,
02:39 - and you have to do a
lot of playing around.
02:41 - And this is once again a
situation where I love to
02:43 - draw out my shape on paper
first and figure it out,
02:47 - but you can also sit there and
02:48 - play with those numbers on the screen.
02:50 - And hey, once you've made a few triangles,
02:52 - you're going to be an
expert at coordinates.
02:55 - Go for it.
