00:00 - - [Voiceover] Welcome back!
00:01 - Are you feeling a little more
comfortable with HTML tags
00:04 - now that you've typed some yourself?
00:05 - We've a bunch more tags to cover,
00:07 - so you'll be tagging
all over the place soon.
00:10 - Now, do you remember this
paragraph about rabbits?
00:13 - I'm a bit worried that
the aliens might read it
00:16 - in a monotone voice, and
they wonâ€™t pay attention
00:18 - to the really important
words and phrases in it,
00:21 - so I want to mark up the parts
that they should emphasize.
00:25 - We can start by using the m
tag, which stands for emphasis.
00:29 - We use it whenever we want to indicate
00:31 - where we'd emphasize a
word whilst speaking, like,
00:34 - if I want the aliens to say,
00:35 - "The most orange
vegetables in 'our' world,"
00:38 - then I can wrap the 'our'
00:41 - in an m tag.
00:44 - The browser will see the m,
and then italicize the text
00:47 - inside of it to show the emphasis.
00:49 - Now the aliens will really realize
00:51 - that I'm talking about
'our' world, not theirs,
00:54 - 'cause I don't know
anything about their world
00:56 - and what their vegetables look like.
00:59 - What if the aliens are
just skimming the text?
01:02 - What if they don't even read the entire
01:04 - amazing paragraph that I wrote?
01:06 - In that case, I want to make sure
01:08 - a few key phrases stand out,
01:10 - and I can use the strong tag for that.
01:13 - Probably the most important fact
01:14 - is how much rabbits reproduce,
01:17 - because I wouldn't want aliens
01:18 - taking rabbits home with them,
01:20 - then being mad at us when
the rabbits have, eventually,
01:22 - over-populated them and
take over their government,
01:25 - so I will wrap this fact
01:27 - (speaks in a deep voice) in a strong tag.
01:29 - (sings) Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, duh!
01:32 - All right, the browser
will see the strong,
01:35 - and then bold the text inside of it
01:37 - to make sure that it stands out.
01:39 - We can even combine m and strong,
01:41 - and put them inside each other,
01:44 - like, if I want the aliens to say,
01:46 - "More than any human 'ever' has,"
01:48 - then I can wrap
01:50 - the 'ever' in an m.
01:54 - Okay, now I'm happy.
01:56 - I think they'll really pay attention,
01:58 - and now you've got two more
tags in your HTML toolbox.
02:01 - Use them, but don't abuse 'em.
