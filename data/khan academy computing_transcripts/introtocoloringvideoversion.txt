00:02 - There are three steps 
you need to know about
00:03 - to make your drawings 
splendiferously colorful.
00:06 - Let's start by coloring 
the background.
00:08 - To do that, just type background and (,
00:11 - and the rest of the line 
will complete for you.
00:13 - If you look closer, you'll notice that 
this is actually a function call.
00:17 - See, we have the name 
of the function here,
00:19 - which is background,
then ( ),
00:22 - and three parameters inside, 
separated by commas.
00:25 - These three numbers represent 
the amount of red, green, and blue
00:29 - in the background color.
00:31 - The numbers can go anywhere 
between 0 and 255,
00:35 - where 0 means 
there's none of that color,
00:37 - and 255 means 
we're maxing out on that color.
00:39 - Right now, I'm maxing out on red, 
and there's no green and blue.
00:42 - That's why the background is 
a super bright red.
00:45 - If I make the first number smaller,
then there'll be less red,
00:48 - so it will look like a darker red.
00:49 - I can keep playing around 
with these numbers
00:51 - and seeing what kind of colors
I can come up with.
00:53 - Or, I can use our handy dandy
color picker,
00:56 - which will set 
all three numbers for me.
00:59 - Now it's important to know that
01:00 - what this background function 
is really doing,
01:02 - is just drawing a big colored square
over the entire canvas.
01:06 - If I moved it to the end 
of my program like this,
01:08 - then it would draw that 
big background square
01:10 - over all my shapes.
01:12 - Maybe you're thinking, 
"That's stupid,
01:13 - why would anybody want that?"
01:14 - But hey, you never know.
01:16 - We'll leave it at the top
for now.
01:19 - Now, to color our shapes!
01:20 - It might be helpful to think 
of the computer
01:22 - as having a color assistant,
01:23 - or some sort of color butler.
01:27 - Basically some dude 
that's in charge of the colors.
01:29 - This color dude can only hold 
one colored marker in his left hand,
01:34 - and one bucket of paint 
in his right hand.
01:39 - The computer uses the colored marker
to draw all of these outlines,
01:42 - and the bucket of paint 
to fill in the shapes.
01:44 - Now, the marker is black, 
and the bucket has white paint.
01:47 - You can change the color 
of the marker
01:49 - by calling this function, stroke.
01:51 - It also autocompletes, 
and then you can pick a color.
01:55 - This switches out the marker
that color dude is holding,
01:58 - so that all shapes drawn 
after this line
02:00 - will be drawn 
with a pink marker.
02:02 - Sometimes you don't want outlines
on your shapes.
02:05 - There's a function for that too!
02:06 - It's called noStroke,
and for the first time,
02:10 - we see a function that doesn't take
any parameters.
02:12 - We just have this empty set 
of ( ), and ;
02:17 - and now you can see our shapes
have no outlines.
02:19 - We can switch out 
the color dude's paint bucket
02:21 - by calling this function, Fill.
02:25 - Now, from this line of code forward,
02:27 - you will fill in all the shapes 
with this bright red color.
02:30 - Just like we have a noStroke function,
02:31 - we also have a noFill function, 
which also takes no parameters.
02:38 - This makes all of our shapes transparent;
they're not filled in.
02:42 - Now let's go ahead 
and actually color this dude.
02:44 - We start off by drawing a triangle
for his body.
02:46 - I'm going to pick a stroke color for it,
02:49 - set the outline,
02:51 - I don't know...
let's do a dark green.
02:56 - Now we pick a fill color.
02:58 - Hmm, what would be nice? 
Maybe a lighter green.
03:02 - A lighter green.
It's nice.
03:04 - For his face, we don't want his face
to have a green outline,
03:07 - so I'll change stroke color for his face.
03:12 - I'll pick a dark tan brown-ish outline.
03:18 - Now I'll pick a different fill color.
03:19 - Yikes!
03:21 - What's a good face color? Hmm...
03:25 - That's kind of a face color, right?
03:30 - Now, the next two lines, 
these two ellipses, are his hands.
03:33 - I want his hands to be 
the same color as his face.
03:35 - So we're not going to 
switch out the marker
03:37 - or paint bucket.
03:38 - We're just going to leave stroke
and fill the same,
03:40 - and move on to his mouth.
03:42 - His mouth is just this line,
03:46 - and lines don't have fill colors
because there's nothing to fill in.
03:50 - But we can change the stroke color 
of this line.
03:54 - Yeah, red's a pretty good color
for his mouth.
03:56 - Now, his glasses frames.
03:57 - Once gain, 
we only need to set the stroke.
04:00 - What's a good color for glasses?
04:01 - Black is pretty classic.
04:03 - For his glasses lenses,
04:07 - I want the rectangles to have 
the same outline as his frame.
04:11 - I'm not going to change the stroke,
but I will give it a fill color.
04:17 - Let's make it black 
to match the frames.
04:20 - There we go, 
our dude is colored!
04:22 - Awwwwww, yeah!
