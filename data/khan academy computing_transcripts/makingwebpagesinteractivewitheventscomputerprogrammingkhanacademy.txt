00:00 - Now you all know how to access 
and modify the DOM of your webpages.
00:04 - And you can do that for hours on end. 
But why would you do that
00:08 - when you could just start the webpage 
off with the HTML that you wanted?
00:13 - Because now you can do all of that 
in response to user events.
00:18 - And that is what makes JavaScript 
on webpages so powerful.
00:22 - For example, you could 
create interactive slideshows
00:26 - by responding when 
the user clicks a button.
00:29 - You could create games of all sorts,
00:31 - responding when the user presses keys
or moves their mouse to aim a bird.
00:36 - You can process forms 
and validate user input,
00:40 - responding when the 
user types in the form.
00:43 - You could create 
infinitely-loading galleries,
00:46 - responding whenever 
the user scrolls the page.
00:50 - All of that is possible by listening
to events in your webpage.
00:55 - The user will do some action, 
like click a button.
00:59 - The browser then fires-- or triggers-- 
the click event on that button,
01:05 - and your code already has a listener
function set up for that event,
01:10 - so the browser then 
calls your listener function,
01:13 - which is some bit of JavaScript 
that you want to happen in response.
01:17 - That's the basic gist of how it works,
01:19 - and now I'm going to show you 
how to actually code it in your webpage.
