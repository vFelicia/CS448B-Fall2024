00:00 - - [Instructor] There's
some interesting patterns
00:02 - in binary numbers.
00:03 - And I find that by
understanding these patterns,
00:06 - I have better intuitive understanding
00:08 - for what binary number I'm looking at.
00:10 - So let's look at a few
patterns in this video.
00:13 - We'll start with odd numbers.
00:16 - The decimal number three is odd
00:19 - and in binary it's 0011.
00:25 - Then there's decimal five that's odd.
00:28 - And in binary that's 0101.
00:32 - Then seven, in binary that's 0111.
00:38 - Finally, nine, in binary is 1001.
00:45 - So do you noticed the pattern
00:46 - in these binary numbers here?
00:50 - I'll give you a hint if
you're not seeing it.
00:53 - (instructor humming)
00:57 - All of these binary numbers end in a one.
01:02 - In fact, the only way
to make an odd number
01:04 - in the binary number system
01:06 - is if it ends in a one.
01:08 - That's because the one is the ones place
01:11 - and every other place is a power of two.
01:15 - And odd number is a number
that if you'd divide it by two,
01:18 - gives a remainder of one.
01:20 - So that means that we
always have to have a one
01:23 - in that ones place to make an odd number.
01:28 - Now we should be able to
look at any binary number
01:30 - and say if it's odd or even.
01:33 - Let's try that out for
some very large numbers.
01:38 - Which one of these is odd?
01:41 - Well, let's just look at
the ones place and see.
01:46 - Zero, zero, one, zero.
01:48 - Okay, this one is the odd one out.
01:53 - These other ones, they're all even.
01:55 - So even though I have no
clue what these numbers are,
02:00 - I do know that this is the odd number.
02:04 - So now we have a little
more of an intuitive
02:06 - understanding of binary numbers,
02:09 - but let's keep exploring
and see what else there is.
02:13 - Another interesting pattern
02:15 - is when a binary number is all ones.
02:18 - So we can have one, we can have one, one
02:20 - we can have one, one, one,
02:21 - and we can have one, one, one, one.
02:24 - Lots of ones.
02:26 - So in decimal, this is the same as one
02:31 - for this first value.
02:33 - Three is one, one.
02:35 - Seven is one, one, one.
02:37 - And 15 is one, one, one, one.
02:41 - So what is special about
these decimal numbers here?
02:44 - one, three, seven, and 15?
02:48 - It's probably not obvious at first,
02:50 - but each of these are actually
a power of two minus one.
02:54 - So this one is the same as two minus one.
02:59 - Three is the same as four minus one.
03:03 - Seven is the same as eight minus one.
03:06 - And 15 is the same as 16 minus one.
03:11 - We can also write these in
terms of their powers of two's.
03:13 - So this is two to the one minus one.
03:16 - Two to the two minus one.
03:18 - Two to the three minus one.
03:20 - And two to the four minus one.
03:24 - So whenever a binary number has one
03:26 - in all of its places,
03:28 - then it will always equal to largest
03:30 - number that can be represented
by that number of bits.
03:33 - This is a lot like in the decimal system
03:36 - where there's nine,
03:37 - nine, nine,
03:39 - nine, nine, nine,
03:40 - and nine, nine, nine, nine.
03:43 - If we add one, we'd go over
03:46 - and this is a largest value
03:48 - that can be expressed in
that number of digits.
03:51 - That's what we're looking at here.
03:53 - We can also write the number of bits
03:55 - that we're dealing with here.
03:57 - So the number of bits,
03:59 - this is one bit,
04:00 - this is two bits,
04:02 - this is three bits,
04:03 - and this is four bits.
04:05 - So we can see that for four bits,
04:06 - the highest number that can be represented
04:09 - is two to the fourth minus one.
04:12 - For three, it's two to the
three minus one, et cetera.
04:16 - So that means if we know the
number of bits that we have,
04:20 - we know the highest value
that could be represented
04:23 - and we know that that high value
04:25 - will be a one in every place.
04:29 - So we can use that information to help us
04:31 - have a better understanding
of binary numbers.
04:34 - So consider this binary number; 11111.
04:39 - What is this equal in decimal?
04:41 - Well, it's got one, two,
three, four, five bits.
04:45 - So that means this must be
two to the fifth minus one.
04:50 - Two to the fifth is the
same as two times two times
04:54 - two times two times two,
04:58 - which is the same as 32,
05:01 - and then if we minus one,
05:02 - we get that this is 31.
05:06 - So without having to add these up,
05:09 - we find out what this is.
05:11 - Now we could have it
done it the old way too.
05:13 - So let's see what this is.
05:14 - The one place, two place, four place,
05:16 - eight place, 16 place.
05:18 - And we can say 16 plus eight is 24,
05:21 - plus four is 28, plus two is 30,
05:24 - plus one is 31.
05:27 - So either way we do it,
05:29 - we get the same value.
05:31 - This just gives us another
way of understanding
05:33 - binary numbers and having a
better intuition for them.
