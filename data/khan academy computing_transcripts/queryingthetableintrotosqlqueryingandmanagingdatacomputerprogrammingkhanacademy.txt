00:00 - - [Voiceover] We're back
with our groceries table
00:02 - but we've expanded on it a bit.
00:04 - It now has a column for which aisle number
00:07 - we can find the item at the supermarket
00:09 - plus we've added a few more items.
00:12 - You can really see the power
of SQL in the different ways
00:15 - that you can retrieve your
data from your database.
00:17 - This is also where it
can get a bit tricky.
00:19 - To start off simple, how would we retrieve
00:21 - all the rows from our table?
00:23 - To form any query we write select,
00:26 - and then which columns we're
interested in, like the name,
00:29 - and then from and the table
name that we're selecting from.
00:36 - We can see a list of the groceries
00:37 - on the right under that results section.
00:40 - What if we want all the column names?
00:42 - We can just replace name with star
00:46 - and that was also the
query that got inserted
00:48 - when you clicked the table name
00:49 - which you might remember
from the first talk through.
00:52 - This list is out of order, though.
00:54 - If we went from top to bottom
at the store with this list
00:57 - we'd have to keep changing aisles.
00:59 - We'd rather have it ordered by aisle
01:01 - so that we can be more
efficient at the store.
01:03 - To do that we can just add an
order by clause to our query,
01:08 - specifying which column
we want to order by.
01:11 - That's better, now we can
get our ingredients faster.
01:16 - To be even more efficient,
my brother and I
01:19 - like to shop together and split the store
01:21 - so that I shop in half the store,
01:22 - he shops in the other half
and we meet at the checkout.
01:25 - There are twelve aisles
at this grocery store
01:27 - so for my list I just want to know
01:29 - which items are in aisles 6 through 12.
01:33 - Any time we want to filter results out
01:34 - we can use a where clause for this
01:37 - and specify the column name and then
01:41 - what we want to compare it to.
01:44 - In this case I used a
greater than operator
01:46 - but there's lots of different
comparison operators
01:48 - depending on what it is you
were trying to filter by.
01:52 - Great, so now I know exactly
what items I'm going to get,
01:56 - I'm going to be really efficent
01:58 - and you've learned a few
ways to use SQL to query.
02:03 - Stay tuned to find out even
more ways you can select.
