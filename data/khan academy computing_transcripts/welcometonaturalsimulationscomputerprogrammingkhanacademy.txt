00:00 - Voiceover: The world is a beautiful place.
00:01 - Sometimes we walk outside
and just revel in it,
00:04 - but other times, because we're programmers
00:06 - and we like to program everything,
00:08 - we walk outside, get inspired by it
00:10 - and then run home to program a simulation
00:12 - of the world around us.
00:14 - Be it's a leaf falling,
spinning to the ground
00:16 - or maybe it's a fire
burning in a dry forest.
00:21 - We can program simulations
of all those things
00:24 - and we can do it here on Khan Academy
00:25 - using JavaScript, ProcessingJS,
and a bit of math.
00:29 - In this course on natural simulations,
00:32 - we'll think about how and why things work
00:35 - the way they do in the real world,
00:36 - and then figure out how we
can translate into code.
00:38 - We'll make many simple [cases]
00:40 - because the real world
is filled with complexity
00:42 - and we don't always need
to model that complexity
00:44 - in order to achieve a
[machine] simulation.
00:46 - Of course our computers
can only handle so much.
00:49 - Whenever a programmer simulates nature
00:51 - we'll always have to fall
short of a 100% copy.
00:54 - Hey, I think you'll be really impressed
00:56 - with what we can do,
especially in the browser.
00:59 - We'll start off by
talking about randomness.
01:02 - A technique you've probably already used
01:03 - in your programs.
01:05 - Then noise, a more
sophisticated form of that.
01:07 - We can use those to
model motion of objects
01:10 - in the world, like
somebody lost in the woods
01:12 - but most objects don't move randomly.
01:15 - Next we'll introduce vectors and forces,
01:17 - which you might have
covered in physics class
01:19 - and figure out how to programmatically
01:21 - apply forces or objects
so they can accelerate.
01:24 - Based on being pushed,
and pulled, and repelled
01:26 - by everything around them.
01:27 - To make it so our objects
can spin on their own axis
01:31 - while they're moving,
01:32 - we'll brush up on trigonometry
01:33 - and come up with formulas
for angle acceleration.
01:35 - We can also use
trigonometry to model things
01:38 - like pendulums and waves,
01:40 - which can really get pretty hypnotic.
01:42 - Finally, we'll create particle systems.
01:45 - Many objects moving together
01:47 - according to their own properties
01:48 - and the systems properties.
01:50 - That will let us model a natural phenomena
01:52 - like water, fire, smoke.
01:53 - Okay, so doesn't that sound awesome?
01:57 - Are you pumped?
01:58 - Are you throwing confetti in the air
02:00 - thinking about how soon you'll be able
02:02 - to program that confetti?
02:03 - I know the feeling and you're
almost ready to dive in.
02:05 - First we want to give a huge
shout out to Daniel Shiffman.
02:09 - Daniel's an NYU professor
that teaches a course
02:12 - on natural simulations.
02:14 - He wrote NatureofCode.com,
02:16 - a whole book about it.
02:17 - Since he CC licensed that book
02:20 - we were able to put it over to JavaScript
02:21 - and bring it over here on Khan Academy,
02:23 - so that all of you can learn it here.
02:25 - Plus do coding challenges along the way.
02:27 - Without Daniel's book,
02:28 - we wouldn't have this exciting course.
02:30 - Now, ready, set, simulate!
