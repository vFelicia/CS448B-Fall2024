00:00 - - [Voiceover] I've made
this webpage about my pets
00:02 - with a list of their names.
00:04 - When you look at the
list what do you wonder?
00:07 - I've had pets named Black
& White, Demon and Angel
00:11 - but what kind of pets were they?
00:13 - What color were they?
00:14 - How old are they?
00:16 - I should probably give
you more information
00:18 - about the pets in this list
to answer your questions.
00:21 - I could do that by making nested lists
00:23 - or you know, maybe putting
information in parenthesis.
00:26 - So, you know, Black & White is a rabbit,
00:30 - Demon is a cat and Angel is also a cat.
00:34 - But I don't like this
00:35 - because it doesn't look very organized
00:37 - and I can't just easily skim down
00:38 - and see all of the of the species
00:40 - in one nicely aligned list.
00:43 - This is in fact the perfect opportunity
00:46 - for a table with a row for each pet
00:48 - and columns for each
attribute about the pet
00:51 - that I want to share with you.
00:54 - In order to make tables in HTML,
00:56 - we will need a lot of
tags so brace yourself.
01:00 - And don't worry about
memorizing all these tags,
01:02 - you can always look them up later.
01:04 - It took me 10 years to
memorize all the table tags
01:06 - and I'm a pro.
01:08 - All right, get ready.
01:10 - The first tag is table, aptly named.
01:15 - Next, we need a header area for the table
01:17 - to hold the labels for each column.
01:19 - So we write thead.
01:23 - Inside that we tip we
just want a single row
01:26 - of header cells.
01:28 - Any time you write a row in a table
01:30 - we use the TR tag.
01:32 - Inside that row we want header cells.
01:35 - For a single header cell we write TH.
01:42 - Okay, what will the first column label be?
01:45 - Maybe pet names since that's
01:47 - pretty much the most
important thing in the row
01:48 - and the identifier for it.
01:50 - Now let's add another column for species
01:55 - and finally, let's add a column for color.
01:59 - I think that's enough columns for now.
02:01 - Let's add some data.
02:04 - We start off the rows of data with tbody,
02:07 - underneath our thead.
02:09 - And then once again we want a row
02:12 - so we're gonna use that TR tag.
02:14 - But inside here instead of using TH,
02:16 - we'll use TD because we're in the body.
02:19 - So we're gonna say TD which
stands for tabular data.
02:23 - And what is the value that goes
02:25 - in this first cell in
the first row of data?
02:28 - Well, I'm just gonna look up to my list
02:30 - and see that the first thing in my list
02:32 - was Black & White and that's her pet name
02:35 - so I'll write Black & White.
02:40 - Now the second TD.
02:42 - We can look up and see that
our second TH was species
02:46 - and Black & White was a rabbit
02:49 - so we'll write rabbit.
02:52 - And finally the third TH.
02:55 - So we look up and see that
the third TH was color
02:58 - so the corresponding TD.
03:00 - Well, I was not a very creative kid
03:02 - when I named this rabbit
03:04 - so you can probably guess the colors.
03:08 - Okay, let's do another row.
03:11 - So I'll show you a little trick
03:12 - because I like to actually...
03:14 - Once I've made one row,
I select that first row,
03:17 - copy it using a keyboard shortcut
03:19 - which is usually control C or command C
03:22 - depending on your operating system.
03:24 - And then I will paste it
03:27 - also using a keyboard shortcut
03:28 - which is usually control V or command V
03:31 - depending on your operating system.
03:33 - And now that I've pasted it
03:34 - I will just go and change the values.
03:36 - So this one will be Demon, cat and black
03:42 - and then we'll do it one more time,
03:44 - and this one will be Angel.
03:48 - Cat and orange.
03:52 - Okay, so it just gets really boring
03:56 - actually writing those
TRs and TDs over and over
03:58 - so that copy paste trick
04:00 - will make all that a lot less boring.
04:03 - And there we have it, a table.
04:05 - I could easily add more columns
04:07 - just by adding another TH in the head
04:10 - and then TDs in each of the rows
04:12 - if I wanted to share more
details about my pets.
04:16 - And you might be wondering
how you can change
04:18 - the way this table looks.
04:19 - Like changing the borders
or colors or spacing.
04:22 - You could do all that with CSS properties
04:24 - which you may have already learned
04:25 - or you'll learn soon.
04:27 - Now, try spinning off this webpage
04:29 - to make a list of your own pets
04:31 - or the pets you wish you had.
04:33 - Tabulate that data.
