00:01 - - [Voiceover] Another fun way
to use JavaScript on web pages
00:03 - is to animate properties over time.
00:07 - Before we can do that,
however, I need to make sure
00:09 - that you know about
another global variable
00:11 - that is available on every
web page, the window variable.
00:17 - Here I will console.log
it and you can pause,
00:21 - check out your dev tools
and see what's inside it.
00:27 - Did you see?
00:28 - It is huge.
00:29 - It contains so much it is overwhelming.
00:33 - To make it a little less overwhelming
00:35 - I will tell you some of
my favorite properties
00:37 - and methods that you can access on it.
00:40 - There is window.location, which has
00:44 - a bunch of information
about the URL of the page.
00:48 - And actually let's go and just
write that out to the page
00:51 - so that you don't have to keep pausing.
00:54 - So, textContent and then we're just
00:57 - gonna say the URL of this
page is window.location
01:03 - and then that's an object so
01:04 - we need to reach inside say .href.
01:08 - And there you go, that's actually the URL
01:10 - of the iframed web page on the side.
01:14 - Another property is
window.navigator.user agent.
01:18 - Which tells you about the browser
01:21 - of the user, say, the browser that
01:25 - we'll call it the user agent is
01:28 - plus window.navigator.user agent.
01:33 - Okay, that user agent string probably
01:36 - looks pretty crazy to you.
01:38 - It's not really meant to be human readable
01:42 - and it doesn't always make a lot
01:43 - of sense for historical reasons.
01:46 - So most web developers use libraries
01:49 - to actually understand
what that string means
01:51 - and what browser they're on
and what OS and all of that.
01:55 - 'Cause it is very weird.
01:59 - Here's one that's not so weird.
02:00 - So window.outerWidth
and window.outerHeight.
02:05 - So let's say the
02:10 - this webpage is window.outerWidth
02:15 - we'll do the width first,
02:17 - by window.outerHeight.
02:21 - So it says, to me it says 1280 by 715
02:24 - but maybe it says
something different to you
02:25 - depending on what your web page looks like
02:28 - when you're viewing this talk through.
02:31 - Now, let me show you
something a little surprising.
02:35 - I'm going to delete the window
part of this line of code.
02:41 - And so what happens is that it
02:45 - still works, that is because window is the
02:49 - default global variable on web pages.
02:52 - When the browser looks for
a variable that you use
02:56 - it will look for it on the window object
03:00 - and when you create a new global variable
03:03 - the window object will actually
store it as a property.
03:07 - That means that you should not declare
03:09 - your own variables named
outerWidth and outerHeight
03:13 - because then they'll override
03:14 - window.outerWidth and window.outerHeight.
03:18 - Generally, you should
avoid global variables
03:20 - altogether since it's so
easy for them to collide
03:23 - with each other or existing
variables on the window.
03:27 - To be extra safe, you can
prefix your global variables.
03:31 - Like at Khan Academy, we write KA_
03:35 - in front of any global
variables that we have to have.
03:40 - Okay, so that's the window object.
03:42 - Now we're going to see how you can use
03:44 - two functions on it to make animations.
