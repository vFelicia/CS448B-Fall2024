00:02 - - [Instructor] Have to make
these variables yourself.
00:31 - You've already learned
00:32 - how to make your own
variables and use them,
00:34 - so now we're gonna learn
about two special variables,
00:37 - mouseX
00:38 - and mouseY.
00:41 - Now, you never have to make
these variables yourself,
00:43 - and, in fact, you shouldn't
because they already exist.
00:47 - You see, the program sets
a value of these variables
00:49 - behind the scenes, making
that value of mouseX
00:52 - is always the X position of your mouse,
00:54 - and the value of mouseY
00:56 - is always the Y position of your mouse.
00:58 - This makes it really easy to
do cool, interactive things
01:01 - based on the user's mouse position.
01:04 - Let's look at this ellipse
that I'm drawing here.
01:06 - So, right now, I'm always
drawing at 200, 200.
01:11 - If I use mouseX and mouseY,
these special variables,
01:14 - then I could actually draw
it at mouseX and mouseY.
01:20 - Now, if I move my mouse over the canvas,
01:22 - you can see ellipses always
being drawn where my mouse is,
01:26 - so it follows my mouse around.
01:28 - That's pretty cool.
01:29 - Can you tell what I'm drawing?
01:30 - Whee!
01:31 - If you're going to use mouseX and mouse Y,
01:34 - you've got to make sure
01:34 - that you use them inside
the draw function,
01:37 - because look what happens if
we move these two lines of code
01:41 - outside the draw function.
01:44 - You see?
01:45 - Now, this code here,
it only gets run once,
01:50 - so this ellipse is only drawn once,
01:53 - and it's drawn wherever
my mouse happened to be
01:54 - at the very, very
beginning of the program.
01:57 - So that's why we need to have it
01:59 - inside the draw function,
02:01 - because the draw function
02:02 - is this function that's called
repeatedly over and over
02:05 - while our program is running,
02:06 - so we want that when it gets called,
02:08 - and it looks at what the current value,
02:10 - mouseX and mouseY is,
02:11 - and then it draws the
ellipse at that position.
02:14 - If you think about it,
02:15 - it's actually very
similar to an animation,
02:17 - it's changing over time,
just in a different way.
02:19 - Okay, so now we can do
all sorts of fun things.
02:23 - So what if, instead of drawing
it in mouseX and mouseY,
02:27 - I drew it in mouseX still,
02:30 - but then I fixed mouseY
at something like 300.
02:34 - And now, you can see the ellipse
02:36 - only follows my X coordinate,
02:38 - ignoring whatever I do on the Y.
02:41 - Yeah, so then, what if I now
draw it at mouseX and mouseY,
02:46 - we'll bring that back,
02:47 - but I get rid of the background
and just comment that out.
02:51 - Okay, woo!
02:52 - Now look, now I've got this
funky paintbrush kind of thing.
02:56 - That's pretty awesome.
02:57 - Or, or I could even
switch these variables.
03:01 - Let me bring back in our background, okay.
03:04 - So I'll switch these variables here,
03:05 - mouseY, mouseX, and then see what happens.
03:09 - Okay now it just feels
really, really, really weird.
03:12 - Cause I've got these mouse controls
03:14 - that are doing opposite of
what I expect them to do.
03:16 - But that's cool,
03:17 - you could imagine even
making a whole game,
03:18 - which is about trying to draw
something or do something
03:20 - while using inverted mouse controls.
03:23 - So, that's it for mouseX and mouseY,
03:26 - really pretty fun.
03:29 - Enjoy.
