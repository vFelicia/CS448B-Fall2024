00:02 - point() is a function that takes in
00:04 - an x coordinate and a y coordinate
00:06 - and draws a point on the screen.
00:08 - So right now it's drawing a point 
that's only one pixel big,
00:11 - which you might be able
to see if you squint.
00:13 - If you want to make the point bigger,
00:15 - you can call this function strokeWeight()
00:17 - and pass it a size, let's say 10.
00:19 - Aha! That's better. So now let's talk
about some math expressions.
00:22 - A math expression is any string 
of numbers and symbols
00:25 - that evaluates to some other number.
00:27 - For example, 1 + 1 is 
a math expression that evaluates to 2.
00:31 - A more complicated expression might be
00:33 - 4 + 3 * 8 / (2 + 2),
00:38 - which evaluates to -- let's see,
00:41 - two... never mind what it evaluates to.
00:44 - The point is, while you're coding,
00:46 - any place where you would normally use
00:48 - a number, you can actually substitute
00:50 - one of these math expressions.
00:51 - So for example, this point() function
00:53 - here accepts two numbers as parameters.
00:55 - Instead of 100, I could just as well say
00:57 - "50 + 50," or maybe "25 * 4,"
01:02 - and the computer would evaluate
those expressions for us
01:05 - before drawing the point at that position.
01:07 - The basic order of operations 
you learned about in school
01:10 - applies to coding as well.
01:11 - Remember PEMDAS?
01:16 - Well, maybe you don't, but this is
01:18 - the acronym I learned 
in school and it stands for
01:20 - Parentheses, Exponent, Multiplication,
01:23 - Division, Addition, Subtraction.
01:25 - And there's actually no symbol 
for exponent in this language,
01:28 - so in our case, it's just PMDAS.
01:32 - This means that everything
01:34 - inside parentheses are evaluated first,
01:36 - and then multiplication and division
01:38 - are evaluated next from left to right,
01:40 - and finally we do addition
01:42 - and subtraction, also from left to right.
01:44 - So let's just go through a couple 
more examples and see
01:46 - what kind of things we can do.
01:48 - Let's draw a rectangle, 
maybe at 100 * (4 - 2),
01:54 - and then, y coordinate -- give it
01:57 - (300 + 50) / 7 + 80,
02:04 - and maybe a width of 100 + 50,
02:11 - and then a height of 60 * 3,
how about that?
02:14 - Whew! That is a fat rectangle.
02:17 - Maybe I wanna set the strokeWeight()
02:20 - to something smaller like 10 - 7, yeah?
02:23 - I can also draw an ellipse()
02:27 - at 130 + 50
02:31 - and 100 + 60,
02:34 - maybe 40 * 3,
02:38 - and let's do 200 - 17, yeah?
02:42 - Oh, and would you look at that!
02:45 - Kinda looks like... an elephant!
02:50 - Well that's it, now you know 
about math expressions.
