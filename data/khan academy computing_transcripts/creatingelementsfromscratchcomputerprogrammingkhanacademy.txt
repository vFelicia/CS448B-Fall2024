00:00 - - [Voiceover] Now I'm going
to walk you through the basics
00:02 - of using jQuery in your web page.
00:05 - The first step is to actually
include the jQuery library
00:09 - using a '' tag
00:12 - Now before, we put JavaScript
inside of our '' tag,
00:16 - but this time, I'm going
to add a 'src' attribute.
00:20 - And I need to set that to a URL.
00:24 - What should that URL be?
00:26 - If I was working on my own computer
00:28 - and have downloaded jQuery
00:30 - into the same folder as my web page,
00:32 - I could just write 'jquery.js' here.
00:36 - But that won't work here on Khan Academy.
00:39 - Here, I need an absolute URL of jQuery
00:43 - on an online server somewhere.
00:45 - And there is a list of
those URLs in jquery.com,
00:50 - and I have one of them
here I'll just paste in.
00:52 - There we go.
00:54 - All right. Now I wanna
point out a few things
00:56 - about this URL.
00:58 - The first thing is that
it starts with 'https'.
01:01 - That means that it is a secure URL.
01:05 - We only allow you to
bring in secure resources
01:09 - in Khan Academy web pages
01:11 - and that's generally a good
practice in web development.
01:15 - Okay. The second thing
is that this is located
01:18 - on a Google server: googleapis.com.
01:22 - This server is called a CDN,
01:25 - a content delivery network,
01:27 - which means that it's optimized
01:29 - for serving static files
like JavaScript libraries
01:32 - and serving them very quickly.
01:35 - Now this Google server is one that I trust
01:38 - and generally, you should
always trust the servers
01:41 - you bring scripts in from
01:43 - since they could potentially
do nasty things to your page.
01:47 - Okay. The third thing is
that there's a version number
01:50 - in this URL: 2.1.4.
01:53 - The jQuery library is
in active development
01:56 - and they often release new versions.
01:59 - The numbers farther to the left
02:00 - represent major version changes
02:03 - versus the numbers farther to the right,
02:05 - which represent minor versions.
02:08 - I'm using jQuery 2 here,
02:10 - which works in modern browsers
02:12 - but doesn't work in IE8.
02:14 - On your own site,
02:15 - you can decide which version
to use based on what you need.
02:19 - All right. So we have jQuery included.
02:22 - Now, let's actually use it
02:24 - inside another '' tag.
02:30 - Every JavaScript library exposes functions
02:33 - and they give their functions names.
02:35 - We have to look in the documentation
02:37 - to find out what those function names are
02:39 - and what they actually do.
02:41 - Well the jQuery library
exposes one main function
02:45 - and it has a very short name.
02:47 - It's just the dollar sign.
02:50 - That means that the first thing we write
02:52 - is dollar
02:53 - then two parenthesis,
because it's a function,
02:56 - and of course, semicolon.
02:59 - Now it's nice that this
function name is so short
03:01 - because we'd be calling
that function an awful lot.
03:06 - There are lots of things we
can pass to that function,
03:08 - but for this intro example,
03:10 - I'm just going to pass a string 'h1'.
03:16 - Now, when I've done this,
03:17 - this tells jQuery to find
03:19 - all of the 'h1' elements on the page
03:23 - and return them as a
jQuery collection object.
03:28 - Now that I've done that,
03:29 - I can call other methods
on the jQuery object
03:33 - in order to manipulate all the
'h1' elements that it found.
03:37 - Like if I want to change the
inner text of all of them,
03:39 - I can call the 'text' function
03:43 - then pass it a string.
03:47 - It's happening.
03:48 - Yes!
03:49 - And we're done!
03:50 - That is our first bit of jQuery.
03:53 - So we included the jQuery
library with the '' tag,
03:56 - told jQuery to find all
the 'h1s' on the page,
03:59 - and then asked jQuery to
change the text of all of them.
04:03 - If you keep going, we'll
go through much more
04:06 - in more detail,
04:07 - more ways to select and
manipulate elements,
04:11 - using jQuery to respond to
user events on the page,
04:14 - plus fun stuff with animation and effects.
