00:00 - - [Voiceover] In the last talk through,
00:02 - we played with a lot of neat functions
00:03 - that animate size and opacity,
00:05 - like 'slideDown' and 'fadeIn'.
00:09 - Most of the time, those
give you all the flexibility
00:11 - that you want for your animations,
00:13 - but sometimes,
00:15 - sometimes,
00:16 - you want to be able to
have much more control.
00:19 - Well, for more control,
00:21 - we can use jQuery's 'animate' method.
00:25 - Let's start with deleting
all this code here
00:29 - and then let's try
'animate' on the picture.
00:34 - So I'll find it and then
I'm going to call 'animate'
00:38 - and I'm going to pass it in object
00:42 - and that object is going
to contain CSS properties
00:45 - that we want to be animated.
00:48 - And it will have the final values
00:49 - that we want for each of those properties.
00:52 - We can animate any CSS
property that's numeric,
00:55 - like width, position, margin, padding,
00:58 - border width, font
size, opacity, all that.
01:02 - Let's start with 'width'.
01:04 - So we'll go to 400 pix.
01:07 - All right. So jQuery figured
out the starting value
01:10 - for the width, 200 pix,
01:12 - figured out how much to
change it in each frame
01:15 - and made sure that it ended at
this target value of 400 pix
01:19 - and it did it all for us, nice and easy.
01:22 - It did go kind of fast though.
01:24 - If we want, we can tell it to go slower
01:26 - by passing in a second
parameter to 'animate'
01:29 - the number of milliseconds.
01:34 - Nice.
01:35 - Nice and slow.
01:37 - Okay. Let's animate a few more properties.
01:39 - We have 'marginLeft'.
01:43 - Okay, now it kind of moves over a bit.
01:45 - We have 'borderWidth' to
thicken that green border.
01:50 - All right. It gets nice and thick.
01:53 - How about we animate our text next?
01:56 - So let's find the text
01:59 - and then call the 'animate' method
02:03 - and decide what we're going to pass in.
02:06 - Let's pass in a 'marginLeft' again
02:08 - so that they both end up
with the same 'marginLeft'.
02:11 - Great.
02:12 - And now, instead of changing its width,
02:15 - we're gonna change its font size
02:17 - because that is the more
appropriate thing to change.
02:22 - All right.
02:23 - So, now you've got more tools
in your animation toolbox.
02:29 - And now you're quite powerful.
02:30 - So don't abuse your power.
02:33 - Think about whether it's
actually a good user experience
02:36 - when you animate the
elements on your page.
02:38 - Sometimes, an animation can
actually frustrate users,
02:41 - like when it slows down their ability
02:43 - to accomplish some task on your site.
02:45 - But other times, animation
can make your users happy
02:49 - when it adds a touch of fun
02:51 - or makes it more clear what's
happening on your site.
02:54 - You should aim for happy users.
