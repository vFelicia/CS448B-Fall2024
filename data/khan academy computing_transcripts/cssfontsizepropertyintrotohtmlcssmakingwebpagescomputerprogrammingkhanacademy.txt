00:00 - - [Voiceover] We can also use CSS
00:01 - to change the size of our text.
00:03 - As you can see by looking
at the headings on this page
00:06 - compared to the paragraphs,
00:07 - the browser already
provides default styles
00:09 - with different sizes
for different elements.
00:12 - There's a body font size and bigger sizes
00:14 - for each level of heading.
00:15 - Sometimes you want to
tweak those sizes though.
00:18 - And we can do that with
the CSS font size property.
00:22 - For example, what if we want
all of the text on our page
00:26 - to be just a little bit smaller.
00:28 - Well go to the style tag.
00:30 - And we'll add a CSS rule for the body tag.
00:34 - And then inside that put
a font size property.
00:39 - Now what should the
value be for font size?
00:43 - How do we measure font size anyway?
00:46 - It's actually a really good question
00:47 - because there are at
least ten different units
00:49 - that CSS supports for font size.
00:52 - Let's start with a unit
that you've seen before.
00:54 - Pixels.
00:55 - We use pixels to decide
how big to make images.
00:58 - And we'll keep using them a lot in CSS.
01:00 - Let's try 11 pixels.
01:03 - Hah.
01:04 - Everything got smaller.
01:06 - Even the headings got smaller actually.
01:08 - Hmm.
01:09 - Why did the headings get smaller too?
01:11 - Shouldn't they be whatever pixel size
01:13 - the browser set them to before?
01:15 - No.
01:16 - Because the default
browser style for headings
01:19 - isn't specified as a pixel.
01:22 - It's specified using a
different unit called M.
01:25 - And that unit is a relative unit
01:27 - that makes the heading font
size scale proportionally
01:30 - to the body font.
01:31 - Lemme show you what I mean.
01:33 - Let's go to our H2 style rule.
01:36 - And add the font size property.
01:38 - This time instead of thinking in pixels,
01:42 - I'm going to think relatively.
01:44 - How much bigger,
relatively, do we want H2s
01:47 - compared to body text?
01:49 - Maybe two times bigger.
01:53 - For that we write 2M.
01:57 - What actually happened
now is that the browser
01:59 - has calculated a pixel size for the font.
02:01 - The browser knows that the
body font size is 11 pixels.
02:04 - And you told it that H2
should be two times bigger.
02:07 - So now all the H2s are 22 pixels high.
02:11 - If we change the body
font size to 12 pixels,
02:16 - then how big will the H2s be?
02:18 - That's right, 24 pixels.
02:21 - What if we change the
H2 font size to 1.5M?
02:26 - Now the H2 will be 12 times 1.5.
02:30 - 18 pixels high.
02:32 - We can also specify a
pixel size for the H2 rule
02:36 - like we did for body.
02:37 - And it would work the same way.
02:39 - It depends on what you find easier.
02:41 - And, like I mentioned earlier,
02:43 - there are lots more units
that we could use besides
02:45 - pixels and M.
02:46 - These are just two of
the most popular units.
02:49 - But if you're hungry for more,
02:51 - check out the documentation for font size.
02:52 - Or search the internet for more tutorials.
02:55 - It's time to super size your font size.
