00:00 - - Welcome, let's talk about the web,
00:02 - the thing that you're using right now.
00:05 - The web is this fast network
of connected computers,
00:08 - and as of 2014, there
are literally more than
00:11 - a billion websites - a billion!
00:15 - When I was a kid, we only had one million,
00:17 - and we thought we were cool.
00:18 - What do we use websites for?
00:20 - Well in the beginning,
researchers used websites to share
00:23 - their research, like on
high-energy particle colliders.
00:26 - But now everybody uses it
for pretty much everything.
00:30 - Maybe you use a social network
to chat with your family,
00:33 - a photo website for sharing photos
00:35 - of your adorable kitty cats,
00:37 - a travel website to decide
where to go on an exotic trip,
00:40 - or a news website to figure out
00:41 - what's going on in the world.
00:44 - And of course, you must be using
00:45 - the Khan Academy website to learn.
00:48 - So what's your favorite website?
00:52 - Actually, I have a better question.
00:55 - What website do you wish
existed, but doesn't yet?
00:59 - Maybe a website about yourself
01:00 - or about something that you love?
01:03 - The cool thing is you can
program a website yourself,
01:06 - and you can learn how to
do it here on Khan Academy.
01:09 - Start brainstorming what you want to make
01:10 - because you'll be able
to do it soon enough.
01:14 - First, let's back up a bit
and clear up some terminology.
01:17 - What is the "web," exactly?
01:20 - Well, like I said, it's a bunch of
01:22 - connected computers that have websites.
01:25 - When a computer is connected to the web
01:26 - and spitting out a website, we
call that computer a "server"
01:30 - because it's "serving" the website.
01:34 - A website is written
using three languages:
01:36 - HTML, for marking up the website content;
01:39 - CSS, for styling it;
01:42 - and JavaScript, for making it interactive.
01:46 - How do users like you
actually see those websites?
01:50 - Well you use an app dedicated
for website browsing,
01:53 - like Chrome, Firefox,
or Internet Explorer,
01:56 - and we call those apps "browsers."
01:59 - Browsers try to all show the
same website the same way,
02:01 - but they do have their
differences, which is why
02:03 - we sometimes say, "Oops,
there's a bug in that browser.
02:06 - "Try another one."
02:08 - Which browser are you using right now?
02:12 - Well you must be using that browser
02:13 - from some sort of device, like a laptop,
02:15 - phone, tablet, or even a smart TV,
02:18 - and we call those devices "clients."
02:21 - Clients can be really different.
02:23 - Some are way smaller than others,
02:25 - some have touchscreens,
others have keyboards,
02:27 - some are black and white.
02:29 - So websites have to try to work well
02:32 - in all sorts of clients.
02:34 - What client are you using right now?
02:36 - And that's the web.
02:37 - Well, the two-minute version.
02:39 - There's lots more to learn about the web,
02:41 - but now I think it's about
time to start having you write
02:43 - some HTML and CSS to
make your own web pages.
