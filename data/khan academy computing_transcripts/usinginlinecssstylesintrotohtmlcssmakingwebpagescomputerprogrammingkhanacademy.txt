00:00 - - [Voiceover] So far I've
shown you only one place
00:03 - where you can put CSS styles:
here in the style tag,
00:07 - usually in the head of your page.
00:10 - I have a little secret, though.
00:12 - You can also put CSS styles
directly on your HTML elements
00:17 - and you don't have to
use selectors at all.
00:20 - That's called inline styles.
00:23 - For example, I can use inline styles
00:26 - to make this heading be a salmon pink.
00:31 - To do that, I'll go inside the start tag
00:35 - and type style equals.
00:39 - So this is an HTML attribute,
00:41 - and inside these quotes
00:44 - I'll put the CSS property value pair.
00:47 - So we're gonna set the background
00:49 - and we're going to set it to salmon
00:52 - because that's a color in
CSS, conveniently enough.
00:55 - And there you have a
beautiful salmon background.
00:59 - If I want, I can apply multiple styles.
01:02 - I just need to make sure
I've got that semicolon,
01:04 - then I can write my next
property value pair.
01:07 - Beautiful.
01:09 - So, this is basically what
you'd see inside a CSS rule,
01:13 - but without the newlines
and without the selector,
01:17 - since it knows exactly which element
01:20 - it's going to put these styles on.
01:24 - It can be a little tricky to
use inline styles at first
01:27 - because you have to have valid CSS syntax
01:30 - inside of valid HTML syntax
01:33 - and keep track of which
syntax is actually which
01:36 - and keep them correct.
01:39 - Now, when would you
actually use inline styles?
01:43 - It's a very good question.
01:45 - Well, for me, I often use them
01:48 - when I'm first prototyping a webpage,
01:50 - when I don't yet know what the
structure of the page will be
01:53 - and I want to quickly see
what something will look like.
01:56 - Once I have more structure in my page
01:59 - and more of an idea of where it's going,
02:02 - then I can figure out the best selectors
02:05 - and move my inline styles to
CSS rules in my style tag.
02:11 - I also use inline styles
when I'm writing HTML
02:15 - inside more restricted environments.
02:17 - Like if I'm writing HTML for
an email marketing campaign
02:21 - or for a blog post.
02:24 - Plus, there are some websites
that use inline styles
02:28 - for performance reasons, like Google.com,
02:31 - because they think it's
faster for the browser
02:33 - to display inline styles
than to go through the effort
02:37 - to parse style sheets and
then apply styles to elements.
02:42 - Most of the time for you,
02:43 - you should probably avoid inline styles
02:46 - in your final webpage
because they often lead
02:48 - to messier HTML with styles
that are harder to reuse.
02:53 - They're a great tool for
when you need them, though.
02:55 - So add it to your toolbox.
