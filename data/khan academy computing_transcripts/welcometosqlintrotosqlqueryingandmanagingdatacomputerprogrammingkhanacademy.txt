00:00 - - [Instructor] The world is full of data.
00:01 - Every app that you use is full of data.
00:04 - On Khan Academy, we store data about users
00:07 - and badges and progress.
00:09 - On Facebook they store
data about who you are,
00:12 - who your friends are,
and what they're posting.
00:14 - On Bank of America they store
data about how much money
00:17 - you have and what accounts that's in.
00:19 - How do these apps store data?
00:22 - Well, they use a database
which is a program
00:24 - that helps store data and
provides functionality
00:26 - for adding, modifying,
and querying that data,
00:29 - and doing that all fast.
00:31 - Databases come in many forms,
but a really popular type
00:34 - of database is called
a relational database.
00:38 - It stores each kind of data in a table,
00:41 - which is kind of like storing
data in a spreadsheet.
00:44 - A row represents an item,
00:45 - and a column represents
properties about that item.
00:49 - For example, to store data
about Khan Academy users,
00:52 - we'd have a users table with a
row for each user and columns
00:55 - for properties like their
nickname and location.
00:58 - Relational databases
make it particularly easy
01:00 - to form relationships between tables.
01:03 - For example, in order to
store Khan Academy users
01:05 - and their badges, we
might have a users table
01:08 - and a badges table, and
then a user badges table
01:11 - to remember which users
earned which badges,
01:14 - just by mapping user IDs to badge IDs.
01:17 - That's a more efficient
form of storage than having
01:18 - to repeat everything about the user
01:21 - and everything about the badge
in the user badges table.
01:24 - Most database come with a
query language to interact
01:26 - with the database.
01:28 - SQL is a language designed
entirely for accessing databases
01:32 - and is the most popular of them.
01:34 - With SQL, we can create
tables, change data,
01:38 - get back the data we're interested in.
01:40 - Like if we wanna find
out which users joined
01:42 - in the last week or which
users have a particular badge.
01:45 - That's what we're going to teach here.
01:47 - And you'll actually get to try
out SQL here in the browser
01:50 - using SQL Lite, a particular
implementation of it.
01:53 - You won't be able to
write the whole app here,
01:55 - but when you're done learning SQL,
01:57 - you'll have a much better understanding
01:59 - of how data is stored
in the apps that you use
02:01 - and be able to use SQL
if you ever build an app.
