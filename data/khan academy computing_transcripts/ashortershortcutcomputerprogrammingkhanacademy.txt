00:01 - - [Voiceover] Let's animate Winston
00:02 - using the shortcuts that you just learned.
00:05 - Here we've got Winston with his eyes,
00:07 - and we've got this eye-size variable.
00:09 - So if we wanted to make
Winston's eyes get bigger,
00:12 - we could just say, "Eye
size plus equals one."
00:17 - Adding one pixel to the
size of the eyes each time.
00:19 - Whoa, look at it, it's bugging out!
00:21 - So we start, whoa, bug
out, bug out, bug out!
00:24 - Now that's pretty cool, and, it turns out,
00:26 - in programming, we actually
add one to variables a lot.
00:30 - Maybe while animating, but
also you'll see there's
00:32 - a lot of other reasons why we
add one to variables later.
00:36 - Programmers got bored of writing,
00:38 - "Plus equals one" all the time,
00:39 - because programmers get
bored of silly things.
00:41 - So they came up with a
shorter way of writing it.
00:44 - Instead of "Eye size plus equals one,"
00:46 - we could just write, "Eye size plus plus."
00:49 - You see? It will do
exactly the same thing.
00:52 - It's just a shorter way of doing it.
00:55 - Not only do we use this for programming,
00:57 - now most programmers just
use it in everyday speech.
01:00 - Because we're all familiar
with this plus plus,
01:03 - and it's an easy way of saying that
01:05 - you're making something a little bigger.
01:07 - If we went to Winston's
birthday party we might say,
01:09 - "Happy birthday, Winston,
Winston plus plus."
01:12 - Because Winston just got a year older.
01:15 - If we just learned a new
fact, we might be like,
01:17 - "Oh, go us. Intelligence plus
plus," and that's pretty fun.
01:23 - So when should you use plus
plus versus plus equal?
01:26 - I think, actually, for animation
it's cool to use plus equal
01:29 - because then you can use a number scrubber
01:30 - and you can be like,
"Whoa, let's make it--
01:33 - "Whoa, whoa, that was awesome!"
01:35 - Let's make it really
crazy, really different.
01:38 - Whoa! (laughs) See how fun that is?
01:43 - Depending on what you're doing
01:44 - it might be convenient
just to say, "Plus plus."
01:46 - You'll see later that
there's lots of other times
01:50 - when you might want to
add one to variables.
01:51 - Not just for animation,
where that plus plus
01:53 - operator can become even more useful.
01:55 - Just keep that in mind,
where you see that plus plus
01:58 - and try using it in your everyday speech.
