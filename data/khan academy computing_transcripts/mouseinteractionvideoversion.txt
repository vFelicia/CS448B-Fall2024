00:00 - - [Instructor] You've
already learned how to make
00:01 - your own variables and use them,
00:03 - so now we're gonna learn
about two special variables,
00:05 - mouseX and mouseY.
00:10 - Now, you never have to make
these variables yourself,
00:12 - and in fact, you shouldn't,
00:13 - because they already exist.
00:15 - You see, the program sets
a value of these variables
00:18 - behind the scenes, making
sure that value of mouseX
00:21 - is always the x position of your mouse,
00:23 - and the value of mouseY
is always the y position
00:26 - of your mouse.
00:27 - This makes it really easy to
do cool interactive things
00:30 - based on the user's mouse position.
00:32 - Let's look at this ellipse
that I'm drawing here.
00:35 - So, right now I'm always
drawing at 200, 200.
00:40 - If I use mouseX and mouseY,
these special variables,
00:43 - then I could actually draw
it at mouseX and mouseY.
00:48 - Now, if I move my mouse over the canvas,
00:51 - you can see ellipses always being drawn
00:53 - where my mouse is.
00:54 - So it follows my mouse around.
00:56 - That's pretty cool, can you
tell what I'm drawing, me!
01:00 - If you're going to use mouseX and mouseY,
01:02 - you've got to make sure that you use them
01:04 - inside the draw function,
01:06 - because look what happens if
we move these two lines of code
01:10 - outside the draw function, you see?
01:14 - Now, this code here,
it only gets run once,
01:18 - so this ellipse is only drawn once,
01:21 - and it's drawn wherever
my mouse happened to be
01:23 - at the very, very
beginning of the program.
01:26 - So that's why we need to have
it inside the draw function,
01:30 - because the draw function is this function
01:32 - that's called repeatedly over and over
01:34 - while our program is running,
01:35 - so we want that when it gets called,
01:37 - then it looks at what the current value
01:38 - mouseX and mouseY is, and
then it draws the ellipse
01:41 - at that position.
01:42 - If you think about it,
it's actually very similar
01:44 - to an animation, it's changing over time,
01:46 - just in a different way.
01:48 - Okay, so now we can do
all sorts of fun things.
01:52 - So what if, instead of drawing
it in mouseX and mouseY,
01:55 - I drew it at mouseX still,
but then I fixed mouseY
02:00 - something like 300?
02:02 - And now you can see,
the ellipse only follows
02:06 - my x-coordinate, ignoring
whatever I do on the y.
02:09 - Yeah, so then what if I now
draw it at mouseX and mouseY,
02:15 - we'll bring that back, but
I get rid of the background,
02:18 - and just comment that out.
02:19 - Okay, ooh, now look, now we've got
02:22 - this funky paintbrush kinda thing.
02:24 - That's pretty awesome.
02:26 - Or, or I could even
switch these variables.
02:30 - Let me bring back in our background, okay.
02:32 - So I'll switch these variables here,
02:34 - mouseY, mouseX, and then see what happens.
02:38 - Okay, now it just feels
really, really, really weird,
02:41 - 'cause I've got these mouse controls
02:42 - that are doing opposite of what
I was expecting them to do.
02:44 - But that's cool, you can imagine
even making a whole game,
02:47 - which is about trying to draw something
02:48 - or do something while using
inverted mouse controls.
02:52 - So, that's it for mouseX and mouseY,
02:55 - really pretty fun, enjoy!
