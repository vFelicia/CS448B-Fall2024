00:01 - Now let's talk about something 
you've been using
00:03 - this whole time: Functions.
00:05 - Whenever you've used commands 
like rect() or fill() or text(),
00:09 - you've been calling functions, 
and those functions have drawn
00:12 - what you've told them to do.
00:15 - What is a function really?
00:16 - It's a collection of code
that we've grouped together
00:19 - and given a name
because we want to be able
00:21 - to use that bit 
of functionality many times.
00:23 - Think about rect()? 
What does a rect() do?
00:25 - It just draws four lines, right?
00:28 - We could just do that 
using our line() function, right?
00:31 - And here we have 
what looks like a rectangle.
00:33 - But we realize that we 
kind of want to be able
00:36 - to draw a rectangle a lot of times,
00:39 - and it would be really annoying
00:40 - to do the math every time
to try and figure out
00:42 - how to draw a line
from one corner to the next
00:44 - and next and next.
00:45 - So instead, we just made 
a rect() function,
00:48 - and that function does exactly 
the same thing
00:50 - that those four lines of code did,
but in much less code.
00:55 - So that's pretty cool, 
and rect() is one of those functions
00:58 - that we've made available
for ALL programs
01:00 - to use here on Khan Academy.
01:02 - But - you can also make up 
your own functions
01:05 - to use in each of your programs.
01:08 - For example - let's say 
we are making a program
01:11 - and we want to draw Winston
multiple times -
01:14 - maybe cause we're going to tell
the life story of Winston
01:17 - and show him at every age
in his life.
01:20 - So, here's what our Winston 
drawing code might start off as:
01:24 - We have 'faceX' 
and 'faceY' variables
01:27 - to store the center of the face,
01:29 - and then we draw the eyes
and the mouth
01:31 - relative to those variables.
01:33 - Right now the program 
sees the code,
01:34 - and it's not inside any function,
so it just runs it,
01:37 - and it only runs it once.
01:39 - OK, let's turn this into a function.
01:43 - To do that, we do it 
very similarly to the way
01:46 - we declare a variable,
because that's actually
01:48 - what we are doing.
01:50 - So we say 'var drawWinston'.
01:52 - We give it a nice name,
very descriptive,
01:54 - and then '=', but here,
instead of writing a number or a string,
01:59 - we're going to write 'function'
(make sure you spell it right)
02:02 - and then empty parentheses '()' 
and then an open curly '{'
02:08 - and then a close curly '}' 
and our semicolon ';'
02:11 - OK so what we need to do
is put everything
02:14 - that we want inside our function
in between the start and end curly.
02:19 - So we're going to take 
all this code here,
02:22 - put it in our function
(indent it nicely), and Ta Da!
02:26 - So now what we have 
is we have this variable
02:28 - that is storing a function -
so basically we've given
02:32 - a label to this block of code,
so that we'd be able to tell
02:35 - our program at any time,
02:37 - "Hey, find that block of code
with that label and run it!"
02:40 - We we're making
this bit of code reusable.
02:43 - But now notice, that we have 
no Winston anymore!
02:46 - We've lost Winston!
Where did he go?
02:49 - OK - so what happened is 
that once we put this inside a function,
02:53 - we told our program 
"hey here's a bunch of code
02:55 - that I want to be able 
to run later,
02:57 - but only when I TELL you to run it"
03:00 - So we have to tell it to run the code, 
which means we need
03:04 - to 'call' the function - just like we do
with ellipse() and rect() and line().
03:09 - So we just write
the function name ('drawWinston')
03:13 - followed by our start 
and end parentheses '()'
03:16 - and, of course, our semicolon, 
and Ta Da -
03:18 - We have a Winston!
03:20 - OK! So I think it's cool, 
but you might not think it's cool
03:24 - because all we've done is made 
our program do exactly
03:27 - what it did before. 
Kinda silly huh?
03:30 - The whole point of functions 
is we can reuse them.
03:32 - So let's do that now.
03:34 - We can just copy and paste this function 
called "ta da!" "ta da!" over and over.
03:41 - Hmmm, but it looks the same - 
- well - it worked -
03:46 - it's drawing multiple Winstons, 
but the problem
03:48 - is they're all in the same place.
03:51 - If we had x-ray vision,
we could x-ray the canvas
03:54 - and see three Winstons, 
but I don't have x-ray vision.
03:57 - (I don't know about you).
04:00 - But, we can make a small change 
to our function
04:03 - that WILL make it obvious.
04:05 - So you see faceX and faceY - 
they're always 202 and 208?
04:08 - We can change this 
to using the random() function -
04:11 - - let's say like random() from 50 to 350 
and it'll generate
04:14 - a random number between those two - 
and we can do the same thing for here -
04:19 - and so every time this function is called,
it generates this new random number,
04:23 - and if we push restart, 
we can keep getting random Winstons.
04:26 - So cool! 
Whoo!!
04:29 - Alright - so I think this is cool 
because it would have been
04:32 - a lot of code to write this 
if we didn't have it in a function.
04:34 - It would have been
three times the amount of code.
04:38 - But it's still not AS useful 
as it could be,
04:40 - because we probably 
don't want random Winstons.
04:43 - We probably want to be able 
to position a Winston
04:45 - at specific points on the screen.
04:47 - So stay tuned, 'cause we'll talk 
about how pass parameters
04:49 - to our functions next,
and then you'll be able
04:52 - to do exactly that.
