00:00 - (upbeat music)
00:14 - - See, I started working on JQuery in 2005
00:19 - before then it wasn't,
JQuery wasn't even a thing.
00:22 - It was just a collection of
tools that I had written.
00:27 - It was mostly because
00:28 - I had been creating a number of websites
00:31 - and resources around that time
00:33 - and I kept wanting to have
00:36 - the certain utilities
00:38 - to make my development easier,
00:41 - and part of that was
00:46 - one just working around
sort of like the browser
00:49 - incompatibilities that
existed at the time.
00:51 - There was, you know, Internet
Explorer, and Firefox.
00:56 - It was just so hard to
try and develop against
00:58 - all these different
browsers simultaneously.
01:01 - So that was one issue, but the other issue
01:02 - was just that I felt that the preexisting
01:06 - development tools,
01:07 - especially the JavaScript
development tools,
01:10 - could be better.
01:13 - The most popular library at the time was
01:15 - the prototype JavaScript library
01:18 - and this was one that was bundled with the
01:21 - Ruby on Rails framework,
01:23 - so it was popular and it
was taking off with rails,
01:26 - and that library actually I found it to be
01:31 - extremely informative.
01:34 - That was the first time I
had seen a JavaScript library
01:37 - written in a nice, clean,
obagetoriantive manner,
01:42 - where you have nice, all these
nice functional paradigms
01:46 - built into it,
01:48 - and I didn't really realize
that JavaScript could be so
01:51 - beautiful and elegant.
01:53 - And once I saw that, it really inspired me
01:56 - to want to build something even better,
01:58 - and I realized that prototype
primarily focused on
02:02 - the JavaScript language
02:03 - whereas there weren't
many tools that focused on
02:06 - the JavaScript language
inside the browser,
02:08 - specifically manipulated HTML in the DOM
02:12 - and so there was this gap here
02:14 - and there was this big usability
02:19 - chasm and so that's when I
started to build different tools
02:23 - and different libraries
02:24 - and eventually all these kind of
02:27 - glommed together into
a single library, which
02:31 - I ended up calling JQuery.
02:33 - I was originally gonna call it
02:35 - JSelect, but that domain
was taken or something
02:39 - and I ended up going with,
02:40 - going with JQuery
02:43 - and ended up releasing it January of 2006.
02:48 - I should say, at the
time I was in college.
02:52 - I was doing all of this
while I was in college
02:54 - and all these different projects
and stuff I was working on
02:57 - were just various side
projects and things that I had
03:00 - and JQuery kind of spun
out of these side projects.
03:05 - And I should say none of those
side projects exist anymore.
03:07 - JQuery is the only one that still exists.
03:09 - So the Selector Pattern came from,
03:12 - at least where I saw it from,
03:14 - was this library written by
this developer in the UK,
03:18 - Simon Willison, and he created this method
03:24 - where it was like, "get
elements by Selector"
03:27 - if I remember correctly,
03:28 - and it allowed you to just
run a simple CSS Selector
03:31 - and find some elements,
03:32 - but it was very, very primitive.
03:34 - You could only do just
the most basic of queries
03:36 - and it didn't have the full, nice,
03:38 - CSS two inches, three, and everything.
03:42 - And so one of the things I wanted was one,
03:44 - I wanted a better version of that library,
03:46 - a more comprehensive version,
03:48 - and additionally, I
wanted to make the process
03:51 - of attaching events into the page.
03:54 - Because when you're building
03:56 - an interactive JavaScript application,
03:58 - you need to listen for when the user's
04:00 - gonna be doing certain things
04:02 - and so doing that process
of finding an element
04:04 - and attach an event to it,
04:06 - I wanted to optimize completely for that.
04:09 - And so that's really what JQuery was
04:11 - initially all about
04:13 - and it wasn't until later
that I started in adding
04:15 - and other things like being
able to have like animations
04:18 - and it wasn't even until
after I released it
04:20 - that I added Ajax and stuff.
04:22 - That's because other people wanted it.
04:24 - I wasn't even using that personally.
04:27 - So it really was, I was
definitely inspired by
04:32 - all these other developers
and their libraries
04:35 - and they just weren't quite perfect.
04:39 - I wanted to be just that little bit better
04:42 - to all fit together.
04:43 - - So how'd it go from you
sort of making something
04:48 - and giving it, to it sort of
taking on a life of it's own
04:51 - cause it didn't take long for it
04:53 - to take on a life of its own.
04:57 - - It felt like it took a long time to
04:59 - take on a life of its own.
05:01 - Mostly because, so like you know,
05:03 - release it January 2006,
05:05 - and one of the very first
design decisions I made,
05:07 - I guess there were a couple that I made
05:09 - right from the start that helped a lot.
05:11 - One was that I provided an
explicit plugin architecture,
05:15 - so that people could write plugins
05:17 - and add them into the JQuery library
05:19 - and then now they could
get the full advantage
05:21 - of this framework.
05:24 - The other decision I made was that
05:26 - on the very first day it was released,
05:28 - I had documentation written.
05:30 - Like I sat down and went
through every method
05:32 - and documented it and how it worked
05:33 - and provided little examples
05:35 - and one thing I think
is interesting is that
05:38 - from January 2006 when
I released the library,
05:42 - to January 2007, JQuery
was the only library,
05:46 - the only JavaScript
library with documentation.
05:49 - All the others were just
like, "Read the source code"
05:51 - or "Go through revision
control" or whatever it was
05:54 - and that always really surprised me.
05:58 - Well, I think it's just a
side effect of developers.
06:00 - Like you want to write your code,
06:02 - you don't want to do the boring stuff
06:06 - and writing docs and whatever,
06:08 - and so at least as far as
the growth of the library,
06:14 - there were a lot of decisions that I made
06:17 - over the course of its history
06:20 - that weren't code related.
06:23 - And one of the things I always
try to emphasize is that
06:27 - when you're trying to
manage a good project,
06:30 - especially a good open source project,
06:32 - code is only a very small portion
06:34 - of the total equation.
06:37 - You have to spend a lot of time
06:39 - and a lot of effort in
06:42 - making something that
06:44 - people are going to want to learn,
06:47 - that it's is easy for them to learn,
06:49 - and that once they do learn it,
06:51 - they don't get frustrated
and leave later on.
06:54 - And you have this whole flow
06:57 - that you have to make sure
at every step of the way
06:58 - that people are happy and as satisfied
07:01 - and that they're learning,
07:02 - so that usually involves doing things like
07:04 - you have to make sure
07:05 - you have a clear website,
07:08 - that it's easy to download
whatever you're trying to give,
07:11 - that the documentation is very clear,
07:13 - that you have like a very nice
like Getting Started guide,
07:18 - but then additionally
that you have a community
07:19 - built up around this.
07:21 - Now the very first person I
brought on to the JQuery team,
07:25 - at this point it was just me,
07:27 - then the next person I brought in
07:28 - was actually someone to
help manage the community
07:32 - and not another developer per se
07:34 - and although he was a developer.
07:37 - And because the reason
why I wanted this was
07:41 - I wanted to make sure that if
anyone was having a problem
07:44 - anywhere, that their needs
07:47 - were going to be taken into account
07:49 - and that we would be able to help and fix
07:50 - whatever issue that they were hitting.
07:52 - So we were just extremely proactive
07:55 - in fixing browser issues,
07:57 - in finding just issues in
the library in general,
08:01 - and Summer of 2006 till the end of 2006,
08:05 - I was actually in Y Combinator,
08:08 - the startup accelerator
run by Paul Graham and co.
08:13 - and at that time they were in Boston
08:15 - and I moved to Boston with some friends.
08:18 - We tried to do a startup,
08:20 - which ended up failing.
08:21 - Well we did not get enough funding
08:23 - and it just didn't take off.
08:24 - Once the startup went away,
08:27 - I ended up joining Mozilla
and there I worked as
08:31 - primarily for many years,
a JavaScript evangelist.
08:34 - So my job was to promote JavaScript
08:36 - and get people, you know,
08:38 - to understand what's coming
in the specifications,
08:41 - tools, and all sorts of stuff like that.
08:43 - But again, I wasn't actually working
08:45 - on JQuery as part of my job.
08:47 - Like it was still very much like,
08:49 - I would do that and then in my spare time
08:51 - I would just be doing mailing lists
08:54 - and fixing bugs and all those
sort of things you have to do.
08:57 - It wasn't until about
my last year at Mozilla,
09:01 - so like about 2010 to 2011,
that they actually said,
09:07 - "Okay, you can work on JQuery full time"
09:09 - and that's when I started working on it.
09:11 - And it was great because
what I ended up doing
09:14 - during that time
09:16 - was I put a lot of effort into
09:19 - making sure there was
infrastructure in place
09:21 - so that if I wasn't working on it,
09:24 - if I wasn't there on a day to day basis,
09:26 - it could continue to exist
09:28 - and part of that was
setting up a non-profit
09:32 - and making sure that
there were enough people
09:35 - working in every aspect of it
09:36 - such that when I eventually
came and joined Khan Academy,
09:41 - I actually stepped down
from the JQuery project
09:43 - and everything's been
running very well since
09:46 - and I can just use JQuery
now as a happy consumer.
