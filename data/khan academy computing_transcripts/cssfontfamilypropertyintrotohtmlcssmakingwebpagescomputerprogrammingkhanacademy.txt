00:00 - - You've seen how to change the color
00:02 - and background color of
the text on your page.
00:05 - But there is so much more that
you can do with text and CSS.
00:09 - To start off, let's change the font.
00:12 - What's a font?
00:13 - You probably already know what one is,
00:15 - but you may not know the word for it.
00:17 - It's the style of the letters
that make up the words,
00:19 - like whether the letters
have flourishes on them,
00:22 - or how thick they are,
00:23 - or if they look like they
are written with an ink pen.
00:25 - Here. It'll be easier if I just go ahead
00:28 - and change the font
family on this webpage.
00:30 - I'll go to our p CSS rule,
00:33 - that selects all the paragraphs,
00:35 - and add a font family property here.
00:38 - So we have font-family: sans-serif;
00:42 - Do you see how the letters changed?
00:44 - Notice they look a bit simpler now.
00:45 - OK. Now let me change the font family back
00:49 - by specifying serif instead.
00:52 - Notice the letters look
a bit more complex?
00:55 - A serif font is any font that has
00:57 - what looks like little
feet on the letters.
00:59 - When we tell the browser
to use a serif font family,
01:02 - it will use the default
serif font for the computer,
01:05 - which is usually the Times New Roman font.
01:08 - I'm not a big fan of that font, though,
01:10 - so I'm going to change it
back again to sans-serif.
01:13 - The sans comes from latin
and means "without,"
01:17 - so a sans-serif font is one that doesn't
01:20 - have those little feet on the letters.
01:22 - That's why the letters look simpler.
01:24 - When we tell the browser to
use a sans-serif font family,
01:27 - it uses the default
sans-serif for that computer
01:30 - which is usually Arial or Helvetica.
01:33 - But here's an important point.
01:35 - It'll pick the default
font of whatever computer
01:38 - the viewer is on, not the author.
01:41 - So we may very well be seeing
01:43 - two different sans-serif fonts right now
01:45 - if your computer has a
different default than mine.
01:47 - Sometimes I'm OK with that,
01:49 - but other times I'm picky.
01:51 - And I really want to make sure that
01:52 - whoever's viewing my webpage
01:53 - sees it in exactly the same fonts as me.
01:56 - In that case, I can specify
the precise font name.
02:00 - Like Helvetica.
02:03 - This will work as long as both you and me
02:06 - have Helvetica on our computers.
02:08 - But not all computers have the same fonts,
02:10 - and in that case the computer will
02:12 - just ignore the property entirely.
02:14 - Luckily, CSS lets us specify
a fallback font family.
02:18 - A backup, in case a particular font
02:20 - doesn't exist on a computer.
02:22 - We just add a comma after "Helvetica"
02:25 - and then bring back sans-serif there.
02:28 - Now the computer will look for Helvetica,
02:30 - and if it can't find it,
02:31 - just use its default sans-serif font.
02:34 - Generally, whenever you
specify a specific font name,
02:38 - like Helvetica,
02:39 - you should always specify a
backup family name as well.
02:43 - Besides serif and sans-serif,
there are a couple
02:46 - other generic font
family names we can use.
02:49 - If we wanted our lyrics
to look more hand-written,
02:53 - we could specify
font-family: cursive. Nice.
02:57 - Or, if we wanted the
lyrics to be a bit fancier,
03:01 - we could try the fantasy font family.
03:05 - Or, what if we wanted them to look like
03:06 - they were written on a typewriter?
03:08 - We could specify the
monospace font family.
03:11 - A monospace font is fixed-width,
03:13 - meaning that all the letters
take up the exact same width.
03:16 - And in fact, you've seen
a lot of monospace fonts
03:19 - here on Khan Academy,
03:20 - because we always use monospace
fonts for code editors.
03:24 - That's because we want all
of our code to line up,
03:26 - regardless of the letters in the words.
03:28 - OK. Now that you know how
to change the font family,
03:31 - use your power wisely.
03:33 - If you want your page to look good,
03:35 - limit yourself to a few different families
03:37 - and come up with pairs of
fonts that look good together.
03:40 - But hey, if you don't want
your page to look good,
03:42 - then the world is your ugly oyster.
03:45 - Go forth and fontify.
