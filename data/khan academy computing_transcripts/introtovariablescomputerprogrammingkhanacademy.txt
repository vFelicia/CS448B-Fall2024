00:01 - So I've got my good friend Winston here
to help us out with this one.
00:03 - And I know he already looks
impossibly awesome,
00:06 - but I think I want to change
his eye size a little bit.
00:08 - So here is where I draw his eyes.
00:10 - You can see we set the fill color,
and then drop two ellipses.
00:13 - And if I want to make
this ellipse smaller,
00:15 - I can change the width,
but then I also want it to be round,
00:18 - so I'm going to change the height
to be the same thing.
00:20 - And, well I want the eyes
to be the same size,
00:22 - so we should change the width
and the height of this eye.
00:25 - No, now the eyes are a little too small,
so I should change them back.
00:28 - Wouldn't I be great if I could
just change one number,
00:30 - and have both eyes change?
00:32 - And here is where variables come in.
00:37 - Now, a variable is just like a name
or a placeholder for something else.
00:41 - I like to think of a variable
as a big bucket with a name on it.
00:44 - You can put anything
you want in the bucket,
00:46 - but the name stays the same.
00:47 - We call the thing inside the bucket
the value of the variable.
00:53 - So let's start out by actually
making a variable.
00:55 - I'm going to do it all the way up here.
00:57 - All you do is type var,
which stands for variable,
01:00 - Space, and then
the name of the variable,
01:02 - which should describe
what the variable will hold.
01:04 - So I'm going to call this one eyeSize.
01:06 - And you can pretty much
name it whatever you want,
01:07 - but you're not allowed to have
spaces between words.
01:10 - And of course,
don't forget that semicolon!
01:12 - So now I've made
a variable called eyeSize,
01:14 - because it's going to hold
the size of Winston's eyes.
01:16 - But so far this variable
doesn't have a value yet.
01:19 - To give it one, we just say eyeSize,
01:22 - and then an =, and then 20; .
01:27 - Okay, now see that equal sign?
01:29 - Forget whatever your math teacher
taught you about it.
01:31 - That equal sign does not mean "equals,"
it means assignment.
01:35 - This means we're assigning
the value 20 to the variable eyeSize.
01:42 - In other words,
we're putting the number 20
01:43 - into the bucket called, eyeSize.
01:45 - And remember how in math class
you can say stuff like,
01:48 - x = 3, and 3 = x,
01:51 - and it all means the same thing,
because duuh, they're equal?
01:54 - Well, you can't do that here, either.
01:56 - The thing on the left-hand side
of the equal sign
01:58 - is always the variable.
01:59 - And the thing on the right-hand side
of the equal sign is always the value
02:03 - that you are assigning to the variable.
02:05 - A good way to help you
remember which side is what
02:07 - is while you're coding
and talking out loud to yourself,
02:09 - like every cool programmer does,
02:11 - if you hit an equal sign
don't say "equals," say "gets."
02:15 - So this becomes, eyeSize gets 20.
02:19 - And now, whenever I use
eyeSize in my program,
02:22 - the computer is going to be like,
"Oh yeah, that's a variable,
02:24 - I know what she really means
is this value 20."
02:28 - So check it out--
I'm just going to copy this,
02:31 - and then replace these four numbers
02:34 - with my new variable eyeSize,
02:38 - and Voila!
02:39 - Winston's eyes are now both
perfectly round and the same size,
02:43 - and if I want to change
the value of both eyes--
02:46 - or the size of both eyes,
02:47 - I can just change the value
of this one variable.
02:51 - Aah that's so cool!
02:54 - Okay, couple of last notes.
02:55 - Up here we made
a new variable called eyeSize.
02:58 - And here we gave it a value of 33.
03:01 - We can actually do that all in one step
03:02 - by saying var eyeSize,
that's the first step,
03:05 - gets 33,
that's the second step.
03:08 - And if I delete these two lines,
03:10 - you can see everything still works.
03:13 - Also remember that the computer
reads your code from top to bottom
03:16 - so the only reason it knew
what eyeSize was down here,
03:19 - was because we already
defined it up here.
03:21 - If I had put it down here instead,
03:25 - then once we got to this line of code,
the computer's going to be like,
03:28 - "eyeSize, what the heck is eyeSize?
I don't know what that is."
03:30 - In fact, here we get an error that says
eyeSize is not defined.
03:34 - And maybe you're thinking to yourself,
03:35 - "Yes, I did define it; it's right here!"
03:37 - But the computer's not smart,
and doesn't get that.
03:40 - So let's just move it back up to the top.
03:44 - And you've got to always make sure
03:45 - that you define your variable
before you try to use it.
03:49 - And now you know
about variables! Yaaay!
