00:01 - - [Voiceover] Now that you
know about While loops,
00:02 - let's talk about another kind of loop,
00:04 - For loops.
00:05 - Here's a For loop I made to place the
00:07 - most delicious kind of pizza,
00:08 - pineapple pizza.
00:11 - You might think, "I liked While loops
00:12 - "why should I care about
this kind of loop?"
00:15 - Soon you'll see that a For loop is a way
00:17 - to write simple kinds of While loops,
00:19 - in a bit of a shorter way.
00:21 - Before we inspect this For loop
00:22 - let's go ahead and look at a While loop,
00:24 - which will be a little bit more familiar,
00:25 - and then we'll get back to
00:26 - this For loop in a moment.
00:28 - Just like you saw in Intro to While Loops
00:31 - we start out with this variable y
00:33 - and we write a message
using that location y.
00:36 - We say that we want to keep going
00:38 - as long as y is less than 300,
00:40 - and change y by 40 each time.
00:42 - Just to reinforce each of these,
00:44 - which again should be pretty much review,
00:46 - we can say that "Pineapple
pizza is the best!"
00:49 - is a really important message
00:50 - so we probably want to be writing it more.
00:52 - We probably should start higher,
00:54 - so we change that.
00:55 - Should probably go on for longer
00:57 - so we make that bigger.
00:58 - And it should probably be closer
00:59 - spaced together don't you think?
01:01 - That's a little bit better.
01:03 - Now let's see how we can change
01:04 - this While loop into a For loop.
01:07 - I'm going to comment out this While loop
01:09 - just so you can see that a For loop
01:11 - really is doing what I'm
saying it's going to do.
01:14 - We'll say that when we create a For loop,
01:17 - we'll just create some space
01:18 - for us to fill in later.
01:19 - Something really important,
01:20 - kind of different for a For loop,
01:22 - is that it's not just one thing
01:23 - that goes in here,
01:24 - it's actually three things.
01:26 - You tell the computer
that by putting these
01:28 - semi-colons to separate the three parts.
01:31 - We'll have one part here,
01:32 - one part here, one part here,
01:34 - and then the inside of the loop
01:35 - just like we had before.
01:37 - What goes in each of these parts?
01:39 - You can think of it,
01:40 - as we say "For" we can
say that we're going
01:42 - to have some sort of
start or initialization.
01:46 - Then we'll have the semi-colon.
01:47 - Then we're going to have some sort of
01:49 - instructions of how long to repeat,
01:52 - and then we're going to have
01:53 - some sort of change happening.
01:56 - How does that correspond
with this While loop?
01:59 - Really concretely we can say that
02:00 - the start sets up this variable y here,
02:03 - so let's copy and paste that over
02:06 - onto this first part of the For loop.
02:08 - And similarly it appears
first so it's first.
02:11 - We can say that this
middle part is telling
02:13 - us how long we should keep going for.
02:15 - That goes in the middle.
02:18 - Then we say that the change
02:18 - happens at the end here,
02:20 - so we'll put that at
the end of the For loop.
02:25 - These three parts always have
02:27 - to occur in this order.
02:28 - In your For loop you always
02:29 - have to start out by saying, "This is
02:32 - "where this variable should start out as."
02:33 - Here it's 27.
02:34 - Then you need to say how long
02:36 - you want to keep going for.
02:37 - Repeat as long as it's less than 354.
02:41 - Then you need to put how you're
02:42 - going to be changing things.
02:44 - Here we're going to be changing
02:45 - by increasing y by 24.
02:48 - Then last you just have to do whatever
02:50 - you wanted to do inside the For loop.
02:52 - We'll go ahead and write that text there.
02:54 - There we have it.
02:55 - Pineapple pizza is the best!
02:56 - And everybody will know.
02:59 - Let's think a little bit more closely
03:01 - about what's happening with this For loop.
03:03 - If we wanted to change where it started
03:05 - we'd just change the start here.
03:07 - If we wanted to change where it ended
03:09 - we would change this end point.
03:11 - If we wanted to change the spacing
03:12 - we would just change the increment number.
03:16 - Then we can also change,
03:19 - just like with the While loop,
03:21 - what value we have for x
03:23 - when we write our text.
03:25 - Great!
03:28 - One thing that can be confusing about
03:29 - a For loop is to remember
03:31 - what these semi-colons do.
03:32 - You just need to remember that they
03:34 - always have to be there
03:35 - to separate the three parts.
03:37 - If we don't have them there
03:38 - then we're going to get some weird
03:39 - error messages about our For loop,
03:42 - so whenever we see that just
03:44 - double check that you have them.
03:45 - You also make it over enthusiastic
03:46 - and add an extra one at the end.
03:48 - If you just remember that semi-colons
03:50 - are only there to
separate the three parts,
03:53 - then we can say this last
03:54 - semi-colon isn't separating anything.
03:56 - It's just kind of trailing on there.
03:58 - We can get rid of it
because we don't need it.
04:01 - I know you're probably getting
04:02 - a little bit tired of seeing
04:04 - these For loops getting converted
04:05 - into While loops and back.
04:06 - Let's just do it one more time
04:08 - just so you can see that a For loop
04:09 - really is just another way to write
04:11 - a simple kind of a While loop,
04:12 - and you'll be really really confident
04:14 - and understanding how to go from
04:16 - a For loop back into a While loop.
04:18 - Because you can do that actually
04:19 - with any kind of For loop,
04:21 - not just this one.
04:22 - First thing that we do is think
04:24 - about where to put this first value
04:26 - that we have inside of our For loop.
04:28 - Since it's just initializing this variable
04:30 - remember it has to go outside,
04:32 - not inside the While loop.
04:33 - And it should go before as well
04:35 - because we need to be using it
04:36 - during our While loop.
04:38 - Then you think about,
04:38 - "Where should this condition go?"
04:39 - That's pretty easy.
04:41 - You probably remember that usually
04:42 - the stopping condition,
04:44 - or the repeat until condition,
04:45 - usually go inside here.
04:47 - We're going to say that while y
04:49 - is less then 313 we'll just keep going.
04:52 - Finally, the change.
04:54 - We always put the change at the end
04:55 - of the While loop in the loops
04:56 - that we've seen.
04:57 - We should go and do that here.
05:00 - We just need to move this text call
05:02 - inside and there we have it.
05:04 - We can just comment out this For loop
05:05 - and see that we made the exact
05:07 - same thing happen once more.
05:11 - Hopefully by now you can see that this new
05:13 - For loop isn't actually necessary.
05:15 - We can go through our
entire programming lives
05:18 - writing loops that look like this,
05:20 - but it is a little bit impressive how much
05:21 - more concise this For loop is,
05:23 - and how it makes it a little bit more
05:24 - clear once you're used to it.
05:26 - What's going on with how
05:27 - we're starting a variable.
05:29 - We're saying how long to keep going,
05:30 - and then we're changing
that variable here.
05:33 - If you really hate For loops
05:34 - you don't have to use them ever,
05:36 - but you should be used to seeing them.
05:38 - If they're confusing just remember that
05:39 - you can convert them right back
05:40 - into a While loop like this.
05:42 - If you're feeling adventurous try using
05:44 - a For loop in your new program,
05:46 - or going back to some of your old,
05:47 - simple While loops and converting them
05:49 - into For loops if appropriate.
05:51 - As a final note you cannot always
05:54 - convert a While loop into a For loop,
05:56 - only when they're in a really simple
05:58 - form like this where it's really clear
05:59 - what variable you're starting out,
06:01 - how long it's going for,
06:03 - and how it's changing.
