00:01 - So now that we learned how to use text,
let's get a bit more fancy.
00:04 - The first fancy thing is that now we're
00:06 - going to start using the word "string".
00:08 - You might think, "String?
That's what my cat plays with."
00:10 - But for programmers,
string is a special name
00:12 - we use for bits of text.
00:14 - You can think of it like
a string of characters, if it helps.
00:16 - Your name is a string,
your school's name is a string,
00:19 - and every text message
you've ever sent is also a string.
00:22 - Basically, just think, string equals text.
00:25 - So we used drawing
and coloring with strings already.
00:28 - Could we use variables
with strings? Of course!
00:30 - Just like you might normally
put a number into a variable,
00:33 - you could also put a string
into a variable.
00:35 - We just say something like,
00:37 - "var myName = (whatever your name is)"
so "Sophia";
00:40 - remembering those quotes.
00:42 - And then we put the variable myName
00:44 - into the quoted text
instead of writing "Sophia" directly,
00:46 - like we were doing before.
00:48 - And this way though it
looks the same right now,
00:50 - we can actually,
write this multiple times
00:53 - you know, one time there, one time there,
00:55 - you know maybe we
can be a little artistical.
00:57 - And then all you have to do
is to change this one variable
00:59 - to be your name, and then you have
01:02 - your name written three times.
01:04 - So, just flipping that back,
what if we want to get
01:07 - kind of crazy, can we
start adding together strings?
01:09 - Like you remember when we maybe
started adding together variables?
01:12 - Well we can actually do that,
01:14 - the computer will just
stick the two strings together.
01:17 - So for example, you know,
we can get rid of this,
01:19 - to do it only one time
and then we can use this other variable
01:22 - message that's going to be my name,
plus say a bunch of exclamation marks.
01:27 - And if we stick message into text
to draw this variable
01:30 - instead of my name,
we can see that
01:32 - all it did is just stuck those exclamation marks
01:34 - that we had onto the back of my name.
01:38 - And we can even make this
a little bit more exciting,
01:40 - if we wanted to write message, say, twice.
01:42 - So this looks pretty reasonable,
you know adding strings means
01:46 - you stick one string
onto the back of the other string.
01:49 - But you might be thinking,
can we get really crazy?
01:51 - And start multiplying or dividing
or subtracting strings?
01:54 - Could we do that? Well no we can't,
01:57 - with strings we can only add them.
01:59 - You're right that we could divide
and subtract with number variables,
02:01 - but string variables only allow us to add.
02:04 - But still being curious and asking
those sorts of questions,
02:07 - is the right attitude in programming.
02:09 - You might think, "What would
it mean to divide a string?"
02:13 - So we can also use animation
and mouse interaction with text strings.
02:17 - For example, we can make the string
follow the mouse around.
02:20 - Just by sticking it in a draw loop
like we did with the rectangles.
02:23 - So if you think about how to do this,
we would say var draw,
02:26 - and then we'll stick all of this, right in here.
02:29 - This probably looks really familiar,
from "intro to animation."
02:32 - And you might think, alright, well to
make it follow the mouse around,
02:36 - we certainly need to use
mouseX, and mouseY
02:39 - and there you have it we're
actually painting with our name.
02:43 - And of course if we wanted,
we could easily set a background,
02:46 - say to, you know, a nice light blue.
02:50 - And now we have that the text
is just following the mouse around,
02:55 - just like we saw with the rectangles.
02:57 - And now as a last fun trick,
let's use animation,
03:00 - and make the text size
grow and grow and grow.
03:02 - So, here we're setting the textSize to 30,
as we learned in variables
03:06 - instead of using 30, we could also say,
var howBig equals 30;
03:10 - and then use this variable
instead of doing 30 directly.
03:14 - Well that's the exact same thing,
03:16 - and we need to obviously
be changing something
03:18 - in order to get an animation.
03:20 - So we can do that by saying,
how big equals how big plus one
03:25 - which actually means,
if you remember howBig gets,
03:28 - you know how big it was before,
plus one to make it a little bit larger
03:32 - and now we just need to
restart the program,
03:34 - and here we have that
as we're moving the mouse around,
03:37 - the text size is growing and growing
and growing and growing
03:39 - because of this line right here.
03:43 - And you know, just on your own,
03:44 - you might think, okay how
can we make it grow faster?
03:48 - So now, not only do you know how
to manipulate shapes with code,
03:51 - but you can also use text with code as well.
