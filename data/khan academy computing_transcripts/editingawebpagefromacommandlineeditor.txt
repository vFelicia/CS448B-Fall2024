00:01 - - [Voiceover] Alright, so I've
got my webpage about rabbits
00:04 - and I would like to edit that
in my command line editor.
00:09 - So to do that, I need to
go over to my command line,
00:14 - which is the Terminal app on the Mac,
00:17 - and then I'm going to pick one
of the command line editors.
00:20 - I'm going to use vim.
00:23 - Type the command for that editor,
00:25 - and now I'm going to make up a filename,
00:28 - say allaboutrabbits.html,
00:32 - press enter,
00:34 - and now I am actually inside the editor.
00:38 - Doesn't look like much
00:39 - but there's actually a
lot of functionality here.
00:42 - So, I'm going to paste it
in using some vim commands,
00:47 - and now you can see my html is inside vim
00:50 - and I can navigate everything
using the keyboard,
00:54 - the arrow keys, and
different other commands
00:57 - that I'm familiar with.
01:00 - And, if I'd like, I can
make a little edit here,
01:05 - so, what did we do before?
01:07 - Let's make this about bunny rabbits, okay,
01:09 - and then I'm going to
save using the wq command.
01:15 - Alright, so I saved and I left
it, now I'm going to open it,
01:18 - using the open command.
01:23 - And that should go ahead
and open in the browser,
01:25 - there we go.
01:27 - I can see my change
and it's working great,
01:31 - and if I want to I can go open it back up
01:34 - and make some changes,
01:35 - and then reload the page when I'm done.
01:37 - So let's see, All about bunny rabbits,
01:39 - add even more exclamation marks!
01:42 - Save it, go back into my
browser, open it, ta-da.
01:46 - So there you have it, this
is the command line workflow.
01:50 - And, it's going to be
different depending on exactly
01:52 - which command line editor you use,
01:54 - but generally it's a lot of
using different commands,
01:57 - getting really comfortable
with that editor,
02:00 - and coming up with a nice flow for editing
02:04 - and reloading in the browser.
