00:00 - - Alright, so I have this web page
00:02 - that I'm editing about
rabbits on Khan Academy
00:05 - and I've decided I want to edit it
00:07 - inside a different online editor.
00:10 - So I'm going to select all of it
00:12 - and copy it
00:14 - and then head on over to this other tab
00:18 - where I have Cloud9 open.
00:21 - So I've created a new file
00:24 - and I can paste my HTML inside the file.
00:29 - Next, I'm going to save that file
00:32 - and give it a nice name
00:34 - plus the HTML extension at the end,
00:38 - press 'Save' and now you can see
00:41 - that the syntax highlighting is working
00:42 - and showing me that it looks like HTML.
00:46 - Now I want to see what it looks
like so I'm going to press
00:50 - 'Preview',
00:52 - and they have this live preview here,
00:54 - which opens up a mini browser
00:57 - inside my editor in the browser,
01:00 - which is kind of funny.
01:01 - So here we have, and I think
this might do a live preview,
01:05 - so let's try it out.
01:08 - Awesome. So as I'm editing
it, it updates it here
01:12 - and I can just immediately see
01:15 - all the changes that I'm making.
01:18 - Quite similar to the one
that we have on Khan Academy.
