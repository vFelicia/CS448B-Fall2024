00:00 - - [Voiceover] Let's begin programming
00:02 - by making a face with circles.
00:04 - To draw a circle we need
to use the ellipse command,
00:09 - so I'll type ellipse in this editor.
00:11 - After I write a command name in a program,
00:14 - I always follow it with
parenthesis and a semicolon.
00:19 - But I don't see an ellipse.
00:22 - The right side is still
that boring white canvas.
00:26 - Well, there's no ellipse
yet, because I need to give
00:28 - more information about
where to draw the ellipse
00:32 - and what size it should be.
00:35 - Since I am drawing a
face, I want this ellipse
00:38 - to be smack in the center of the canvas
00:41 - and pretty big.
00:44 - I'll type four numbers in.
00:46 - That'll make that happen.
00:48 - And we'll explore why they work.
00:52 - Ta-da, a face.
00:54 - Okay, so this first number,
00:57 - what does it control?
00:59 - I can change it by clicking
on it and using the numbers
01:02 - cover that path set.
01:04 - Watch, it's moving across the canvas.
01:07 - So this number control
how far the ellipse is
01:10 - from the left side of the canvas.
01:14 - What about the second number?
01:16 - If I change this, the ellipse moves up
01:19 - and down the canvas.
01:21 - Okay.
01:23 - On to the third number.
01:25 - Changing this makes the ellipse wider
01:28 - and thinner.
01:30 - All right, nice.
01:33 - Finally, the fourth.
01:35 - What else can we change?
01:37 - The height, making ellipse
taller and shorter,
01:42 - kinda squishy.
01:44 - Let's make it taller again.
01:46 - Okay.
01:47 - Now you know what all of our numbers do.
01:50 - The first two control the
position of the ellipse
01:53 - and the second two control
the size of the ellipse.
01:56 - We call these numbers the
parameters to the ellipse command.
02:01 - And actually we usually
call a command a function.
02:06 - So here in our program we're
calling the ellipse function
02:10 - and passing it four parameters
to change how it draws
02:14 - the ellipse.
02:16 - When we describe the
parameters of a function,
02:19 - we usually give them nicknames,
so that we don't have to say
02:22 - first and second.
02:24 - Let's go through the nicknames
for these parameters.
02:28 - This first parameter, remember that
02:31 - it controls this.
02:33 - We call this parameter X, because we think
02:37 - of x as the direction it
goes across the canvas,
02:42 - like I'm showing here.
02:44 - It starts at zero
02:46 - and ends at 400.
02:50 - So that, that's our x.
02:54 - This second parameter, we call it Y,
02:58 - because it controls
03:01 - this direction.
03:02 - And we think of y as the direction
03:04 - that goes down the canvas.
03:07 - That's y.
03:09 - And it also starts at
zero up here in the corner
03:12 - and goes to 400 down at the bottom.
03:17 - So that's x and y.
03:20 - We call the third parameter Width,
03:23 - because it controls the width,
03:25 - and the fourth parameter we call Height.
03:28 - Okay.
03:29 - So now we understand
what out code is doing
03:33 - and why it's doing that,
03:35 - let's write some more code.
03:37 - What, we have our face,
03:39 - it needs a mouth so they can eat things.
03:42 - I'll make a mouth by typing
a second ellipse underneath.
03:46 - I'm going to use the same
x as the one before it,
03:51 - because I want it to be
in the center of the face,
03:54 - but I do want it lower down on the face.
03:57 - So I'll try 250 for the y.
04:02 - For the size I want it
smaller than a face.
04:05 - Let me try 110.
04:10 - Okay, it's a little, little too small.
04:12 - I'm just gonna widen that up a bit.
04:16 - All right.
04:18 - Next we need eyes, because
a face without eyes
04:22 - is pretty creepy.
04:24 - Let's start with the left eye.
04:27 - It should be closer to the left-hand side
04:30 - than the center, so I'll try 150
04:34 - and it should also be closer to the top,
04:37 - so I'll try 150 for y as well.
04:41 - And they should be small perfect circles,
04:44 - so I'll try 30, 30.
04:47 - Okay, I don't see my eye yet,
04:50 - what's wrong?
04:50 - Ah, here's the issue.
04:53 - Oh noes guy, our error buddy, pops up
04:56 - and it's telling me
that something is wrong
04:57 - with the code.
04:59 - I am missing a semicolon.
05:01 - Where am I missing it?
05:03 - Line five, the line of
code that I just wrote,
05:06 - I forgot my semicolon.
05:08 - Classic mistake, I'll just add it back in
05:11 - and here we go, we have our eye.
05:14 - Now, you will probably see Oh noes a lot
05:16 - when you're getting started,
because this is your first time
05:19 - writing code and it takes time to get used
05:21 - to the syntax, making sure
you're spelling things right
05:25 - and using the right
parenthesis and always putting
05:28 - that semicolon there.
05:30 - So don't worry if you see him a lot,
05:33 - you'll get used to him.
05:34 - (chuckles)
05:36 - All right, now finally,
05:38 - this is not a cyclops,
so we need one more eye.
05:41 - Since our next eye is pretty similar
05:44 - to our left eye, I'm just going to copy
05:47 - this line of code and paste it,
05:50 - and then move the x
05:53 - and there we go.
05:54 - Beautiful!
05:56 - My face is finished.
05:58 - And I might be a little bit hungry too.
06:01 - Mmm.
06:02 - Well, now you're going to
try drawing some circles
06:06 - with code yourself.
