00:00 - - Welcome to my webpage.
00:01 - I know, it's not a very exciting webpage.
00:04 - It's completely blank,
00:05 - but every webpage starts that way,
00:07 - and I'll show you how to
build up this page soon.
00:10 - First, though, give a
minute to show you around
00:12 - the skeleton of a blank webpage.
00:15 - Every webpage starts with this fun
00:17 - looking thing called a DOCTYPE at the top,
00:20 - and this is just a signal to the browser
00:22 - that this webpage is
written in modern HTML
00:24 - and not a cludgy, old, weird HTML.
00:27 - Next, to the very first tag of the page,
00:30 - HTML is a markup language,
00:32 - so it's all about tags,
00:34 - and a tag is one of these things
00:36 - that start with an angle bracket
00:38 - and ends with another angel bracket,
00:40 - or if you like math,
00:41 - you might think of them as less
than and greater than signs.
00:46 - The first tag of every page
is always that HTML tag
00:49 - right under the DOCTYPE.
00:51 - This one is the start HTML tag,
00:53 - and then at the bottom
there's this end HTML tag,
00:57 - which is the same except
for this backslash,
00:59 - which is really important.
01:01 - The HTML tag needs to
contain every other tag
01:05 - that makes up this webpage,
01:07 - and that's why we don't have
01:08 - the end HTML tag until the bottom.
01:11 - A lot of HTML tags come
in pairs like this,
01:13 - but not all of them.
01:15 - O.K., underneath HTML
there is always head tag,
01:19 - and that contains tags that helps
01:20 - the browser render the page,
01:22 - but doesn't contain anything
the user actually sees.
01:25 - There's this meta tag
that gives the browser
01:27 - more details on how to render the page.
01:29 - For example, if you're
using common characters,
01:31 - like from English language,
01:33 - and not harder to render characters,
01:34 - like from the Arabic language,
01:36 - then you should have meta
charset equals utf eight.
01:40 - Then there's this title tag,
01:41 - which the browser uses to
decide the title of the page,
01:44 - and this is what shows in
the tab on top of browsers
01:47 - and in bookmarks and in search results,
01:50 - and here on Khan Academy
01:51 - the title shows up above our webpage.
01:53 - Let me change the title.
01:55 - I'm going to make a
page all about rabbits,
01:59 - so I'll say all about rabbits,
02:01 - and maybe you can actually
see as it changes above.
02:05 - Nice.
02:06 - O.K, now we're done with these details,
02:08 - so we end the head tag
02:10 - and move on to the tag where
it's all going to happen.
02:13 - The body tag.
02:14 - It's pretty boring right now.
02:16 - Just the start and the end.
02:17 - O.K., what should I add?
02:19 - Well, I'm making a webpage about rabbits,
02:21 - so I should probably should declare that
02:23 - in a big, old headline at the top.
02:25 - To add a headline we use the H one tag,
02:29 - and all about rabbits.
02:32 - Great, actually, we have six tags
02:34 - that we could use for headlines.
02:35 - H one, H two, H three, H
four, H five, and H six.
02:38 - The H one is for the most
important headlines on the page,
02:40 - and H six is the least important.
02:43 - Let me add a few more
headlines for other sections,
02:45 - and I'll use an H two
02:47 - since these are slightly
less important sections,
02:51 - and add some songs, O.K., great.
02:56 - Now let's add some information.
02:58 - Well, my target audience for this page
03:00 - is aliens that have never seen rabbits,
03:03 - so I better give them a
good description of rabbits.
03:06 - In fact, I think I need a
whole paragraph of information.
03:10 - How can I mark up a paragraph in HTML?
03:13 - With the P tag, of course,
03:16 - so we put in a P tag,
03:18 - and then I'm just going to go ahead
03:20 - and paste in information,
03:22 - so that you don't have to
watch me type the whole thing.
03:25 - Beautiful.
03:27 - Alright, now the aliens will need
03:28 - a song to greet the rabbits with,
03:30 - so I'll give them lyrics
to my personal favorite,
03:33 - and once again use that P tag for it,
03:36 - and paste in the song
03:39 - ♫ Little Bunny Foo Foo ♫
03:40 - Such a good song,
03:43 - but, uh oh.
03:44 - It's showing up all on the same line.
03:47 - How will the aliens know when to pause?
03:50 - Why didn't the browser
render the line breaks
03:52 - that I put in here?
03:54 - Well, actually, browsers mostly ignore
03:56 - line breaks and white space in your HTML,
03:59 - and if we want the browser
to render a line break,
04:01 - we have to tell it explicitly
04:03 - using another tag,
04:05 - the B R tag, which stands for break,
04:07 - so we'll go through and
add B R's after each line.
04:13 - Now it looks like lyrics.
04:15 - Do you notice something funny about B R?
04:19 - There's no end tag.
04:20 - Well, if you think about it,
04:22 - a line break doesn't contain any content,
04:23 - so it has nothing to end after.
04:25 - Just the start tag is all we need,
04:28 - and there we have it.
04:30 - The aliens will learn
the basics of rabbits,
04:32 - and you've learned the basics of HTML.
04:36 - After I'm done talking,
04:37 - play around with this
04:38 - and try changing things,
04:39 - and when you are ready,
04:40 - go on to your first HTML challenge.
