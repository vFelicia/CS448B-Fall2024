00:00 - - [Instructor] So far we've
seen how you can use CSS
00:02 - to style your text,
00:04 - but we can also use CSS
00:05 - to completely change
the layout of our page.
00:07 - That means we can move things
around, change your size,
00:10 - even put them on top of each other.
00:12 - But what are the things
we wanna move around?
00:14 - Sometimes there are elements
that we've already made
00:17 - like a certain paragraph
or a certain heading,
00:21 - but oftentimes they're group
of elements that we've made
00:24 - like a selection of text,
00:27 - or a heading, and a few paragraphs.
00:31 - In order to move them
around together as a unit
00:34 - we need to introduce two new HTML tags
00:36 - which we call the grouping elements.
00:39 - We didn't talk about them before CSS,
00:41 - because they're only useful
when combined with CSS.
00:44 - They have no semantic
meaning to the browser.
00:47 - The first tag is the span tag
00:50 - and it's what we use for
grouping a selection of text.
00:53 - Let's say we wanna color
this word "love" red
00:57 - and we just wanna color the word,
00:58 - not the rest of the heading.
01:00 - We'll put our cursor before love,
01:02 - type the start tag for span,
put it after type the end tag.
01:10 - Okay, now we wanna style
this span of characters.
01:12 - We could make a rule to
color all spans on the page
01:15 - but we may not want them all to be red.
01:18 - Let's give the span a
class of "lovey-dovey"
01:21 - (keyboard clattering)
01:25 - And add a rule just for elements
01:28 - that have the class "lovey-dovey".
01:30 - So dot lovey dovey color red.
01:34 - Look how lovey dovey that text is.
01:38 - Now, so spans are good for
grouping selections of text.
01:41 - How do we group a bunch
of elements together?
01:43 - That's where the div tag comes in.
01:45 - Let's say we wanna group
this bottom section.
01:48 - The official info header,
and the paragraphs,
01:50 - and picture below it.
01:51 - To do that, I'll put
my cursor before the H3
01:57 - and do the start tag for div,
01:59 - and then go down to the final paragraph
02:02 - and write the end tag for div.
02:05 - We have a div, now we need to style it.
02:08 - To style the div, I'm gonna
give it an id, official info,
02:14 - and then add a rule for it up here.
02:16 - So hash official info and background
02:21 - and let's make it a nice gray.
02:23 - Let's pick out what's, that's good.
02:27 - So now you can see the
div has become a gray box
02:29 - containing all of the
elements inside of it,
02:32 - and it's different from
02:33 - if we'd given each of them a
gray background separately.
02:36 - If we did that, there'd
be a space in between them
02:37 - that wouldn't go gray.
02:39 - We have to make a div if we
wanna box around everything.
02:44 - You can think of span as
being for grouping text
02:48 - and you can think of div
for grouping elements,
02:52 - but there's another way to
distinguish them as well.
02:55 - You see there are two types
of elements in the CSS world,
02:58 - inline and block.
03:00 - An inline element does not
have a new line after it.
03:03 - Like if you make multiple of them,
03:04 - they'll all be on the same line.
03:06 - A few examples we've talked
about are, "a" and image,
03:12 - and you can see with this image
03:13 - how it just runs into the text next to it.
03:16 - There's no new line after it.
03:19 - A block element does
have a new line after it
03:22 - and that is what most HTML tags create.
03:24 - Look at all the examples on this page,
03:27 - the headings, the paragraphs, the lists,
03:31 - the browser put new
lines after all of them
03:33 - without you needing to write a "br" tag.
03:37 - What does that have to
do with span and div?
03:39 - Well, a span creates an inline element
03:44 - and a div creates a block element.
03:47 - That means that if you add a div,
03:50 - and don't add any other style,
03:55 - the browser will blockify
that part of the page.
03:58 - Like that bit of text
I just wrapped in a div
04:00 - now has new lines before and after.
04:03 - And maybe that's what you want.
04:05 - Just keep this difference in mind
04:07 - and keep going because there's a lot more
04:09 - we can do with these tags,
especially the mighty div.
