00:00 - - [Instructor] Let's see how we would add
00:02 - these two 16-bit binary numbers.
00:04 - It's a lot like adding numbers in decimal,
00:07 - the only difference is that
we're dealing with powers of two
00:10 - instead of powers of 10.
00:12 - So we'll start on the right side,
00:14 - just like we do for
adding decimal numbers.
00:17 - One plus one is two.
00:20 - We know that, but what does
that look like in binary?
00:23 - Let's do it up here.
00:24 - One plus one equals one, zero.
00:30 - That's a one in the twos place
00:33 - and a zero in the ones place,
00:35 - which gives us the decimal, two.
00:38 - So now, down here, we can
say one plus one is zero,
00:43 - and carry the one.
00:46 - And we have one plus one
plus zero, that's two again,
00:49 - so we put the zero, we carry the one.
00:52 - One plus one plus zero is two again.
00:55 - We put the zero, we carry the one.
00:58 - One plus one plus zero is two again.
01:02 - We put the zero, we carry the one.
01:04 - Finally, we have something different.
01:06 - One plus zero plus zero is just one.
01:10 - We have nothing to carry.
01:12 - One plus one is two, we put
the zero, carry the one.
01:17 - And now something else,
01:19 - one plus one plus one.
01:21 - Well, that's three, let's
just look at that in binary.
01:24 - One plus one plus one equals one, one.
01:30 - That's a one in the twos place,
01:32 - and a one in the ones place,
01:35 - which gives us three.
01:37 - So now, we need to put a one here,
01:41 - and then carry a one as well, all right?
01:45 - So then we have one plus
zero plus zero is one.
01:48 - Zero plus zero is zero.
01:51 - Zero and zero is zero.
01:54 - Zero plus one is one.
01:56 - One plus one is two, so we
put the zero, carry the one.
02:02 - One plus zero plus zero is one.
02:05 - Zero plus one is one.
02:08 - One plus one is two again,
02:10 - we put the zero, carry the one.
02:13 - And then one plus zero plus zero is one.
02:17 - So there we have it,
this number is the answer
02:21 - to adding these two 16-bit
binary numbers together.
