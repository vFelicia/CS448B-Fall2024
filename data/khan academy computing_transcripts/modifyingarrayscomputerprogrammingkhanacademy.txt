00:01 - So far, we've seen how to create an array and access it.
00:03 - Just like other variables, however, one of the really cool things about arrays is the way we can change them dynamically while a program is running.
00:12 - OK, let me just show you what I mean by this.
00:15 - So here we have this program that displays Hopper holding some balloons; super cute.
00:21 - And so how it works is that we have this xPositions array that has two numbers in it that say where we want the balloons at.
00:29 - And then down here we have this loop, and this loop goes through every element in that array.
00:35 - And for each of them, it draws a line from the "x" down to Hopper's hand, and then draws an ellipse at the "x" that's 30x40 pixels, and that's our balloon.
00:46 - Ok, cool. So now that we see how it works, we know that if we want to have another balloon show up, we can just add a number to this array, right? Like 300.
00:58 - Beautiful. Now we've got three balloons for a happy Hopper.
01:02 - But let's say we wanted to give a user that doesn't know how to code the ability to add new balloons.
01:10 - So we wanted to give the program to a user and say, "Hey, you can click wherever you want the balloon, and it will show up."
01:17 - Wouldn't that be cool? I think so.
01:20 - So, how should we do this? So we want our program to be changing over time, right?
01:26 - Every time the user clicks, a balloon is going to show up there.
01:30 - So let's start off by moving everything into a draw function so that it's easy to change over times.
01:37 - So we'll just move this down here and indent this here. OK, great.
01:43 - So now we want to check and see is the user pressing the mouse right now?
01:48 - Well we can do that with our "if". So if (mouseIsPressed), and then we're going to do something.
01:55 - So what are we going to do? If the mouse is pressed, then we want to somehow add a number to this array.
02:01 - And let's make this just two elements again. Ok.
02:04 - So we want to add a number to this array somehow. Well I'll show you one way we could do this.
02:10 - So we can say xPositions[2] = mouseX;
02:18 - Alright, and let me just show you that this works.
02:21 - I clicked, and ta-da I got a balloon. So what did this do?
02:26 - This said, xPositions[2] said find this array, and find the element in the 2 spot, and remember that's the third element because our arrays are zero-based.
02:38 - And if you look, there's no third element, right? There's nothing in that spot.
02:41 - So it says find that, and then put mouseX in it.
02:45 - Well since there's nothing there, then it goes from being nothing to being mouseX.
02:51 - And so now our array is three items long, and this for loop down here that goes through it, it will end up drawing that third balloon.
03:00 - So that's pretty cool, and let me just click some more to show you how this works.
03:04 - So you see every time I click, it keeps on drawing the third balloon wherever I clicked my mouse.
03:10 - And that's because we're constantly overriding the 2 spot - the thing with the 2 index.
03:18 - We're constantly overriding that with the current mouseX.
03:22 - So we're only ever going to have three balloons because we've got this one in the 0 spot, this one in the 1 spot, and we're constantly changing the 2 spot. Ok?
03:34 - So that's cool, but what we really want is we want to let the user make tons of balloons, right?
03:40 - So every time the user clicks, there's a new balloon.
03:43 - So that means we need to be constantly incrementing the index of the array element that we're storing it in.
03:50 - So we don't want it to be 2 every time, we want it to be 2, and then 3, and then 4, and then 5, and then 6, etc.
03:56 - So we could do this by having a little counter variable. So we say newInd = 2;
04:01 - That's what it will start out with, and then here we'll say newInd instead of 2.
04:05 - And then what we really want to do is say newInd ++
04:10 - So every time we add 1 to this. So we'll start off as 2, then it become 3, and then become 4.
04:16 - So every time they press, it will become more. So let's try this.
04:18 - Ta-da! Tons of balloons. Balloon party. Woo!
04:22 - So that's cool, right? But that's not the best way of doing this because it turns out adding items to an array is something we want to do a lot.
04:32 - So we have a much easier way of doing it that this.
04:35 - So let me just delete the stuff we did. Alright, so we don't need that, and we don't need that anymore. We'll just comment that out.
04:42 - Ok, so how we do it is we say xPositions.push and then mouseX.
04:50 - So what we're doing here is we're calling this method on the xPositions array.
04:56 - So we're calling like a command on the array. We're telling the array, "Hey, push this new value, which is mouseX, push it on the the end of your array."
05:05 - So every time this gets called, so every time they press the mouse, it's going to look at the mouseX and push it on to the end of the array.
05:12 - So that the array should get bigger and bigger and bigger. So let's restart and try this.
05:16 - Ta-da, it worked! And it's way less code than we had before. Alright?
05:22 - So most of the time, you're going to want to use push if you're going to add stuff to your array like this.
05:27 - And it's pretty neat because then you can just have these arrays that get bigger and bigger and bigger during the program.
05:32 - Like when you have an animation or when you have users doing stuff, and then you can do a lot more.
05:36 - So now you seen 90% of what you'll probably use arrays for and the ways you'll use them.
05:41 - But there's also a lot more you can do with arrays. So if you have questions, just ask them in the discussion.
05:47 - But make sure you master these basics first.
