00:00 - - [Voiceover] On Khan Academy, we pop up
00:01 - the oh noes guide to tell you when there's
00:03 - something wrong with your webpage.
00:04 - But we only tell you about the big things.
00:06 - There could be other things wrong
00:08 - with your webpage too, things that aren't
00:10 - quite right according to
the HTML specification.
00:14 - But the browsers let you get away with it
00:16 - because browsers like
to be really forgiving.
00:18 - They just want to make it work.
00:19 - So then you end up not knowing
00:21 - that there's something
wrong with your webpage.
00:24 - That's why it's a good idea to run
00:26 - your webpage through the
W3 validation service.
00:30 - That will actually check and tell you
00:32 - if your page is valid and if there's
00:35 - something not quite right about it.
00:38 - To do that, go to validator.w3.org.
00:41 - It'll give you options to enter a URL,
00:44 - upload a file, or just copy and paste.
00:47 - That's what I'll do.
00:50 - I'll take the most recent webpage
00:52 - that I was showing in a talk through
00:55 - and paste it in here and then check.
01:00 - Ta-da!
01:02 - It was successfully checked as HTML 5
01:04 - and there were no issues with it.
01:08 - Fantastic.
01:09 - Let's try one more.
01:13 - This is our HTML internal links example.
01:16 - I want to paste this in here and check.
01:19 - Uh-oh, there was one error, two warnings.
01:22 - Let's go down.
01:24 - It says that an image element
01:25 - must have an alt attribute.
01:27 - Uh-oh, this is a classic thing to forget
01:29 - is that alt attribute.
01:31 - We see the images, but not everybody does.
01:34 - So what I should do is
go back into that HTML
01:38 - and add the alt attribute.
01:40 - So let's say the image was here,
01:43 - alt equals photo of Tim Berners-Lee
01:48 - next to computer and let me copy
01:54 - and go back up, paste.
01:57 - I will re-validate.
02:00 - Ta-da!
02:01 - It's valid HTML.
02:03 - When possible, you should be trying
02:04 - to make webpages that are valid HTML
02:08 - because that way you can have a lot more
02:09 - confidence that the browser is going
02:10 - to interpret them exactly like you expect
02:13 - all the time.
02:14 - Now go try and validate
a few of your pages
02:17 - and see how they turn out.
