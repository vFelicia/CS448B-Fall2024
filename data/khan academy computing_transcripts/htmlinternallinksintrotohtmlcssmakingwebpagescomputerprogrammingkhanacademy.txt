00:00 - - Links are a great way of connecting
00:02 - one web page to another web page.
00:04 - But they can also connect
one part of a web page
00:07 - to another part of that same web page,
00:09 - especially on really long web pages,
00:11 - like for a Table of Contents.
00:13 - I've now added a bunch more information
00:16 - to this page so that I could give you
00:17 - a history of the web,
00:18 - and a history of HTML versions.
00:21 - And I think it's enough content
00:23 - that it deserves a Table of Contents.
00:26 - And I've started one up here.
00:28 - Just an un-ordered list
00:29 - with list items with each
of the section titles.
00:32 - And I want to link each
00:34 - of the section titles
so you can click them
00:35 - and just go to that part of the page.
00:38 - To do that, I once again use the a tag.
00:41 - So, I'll start by just wrapping
00:44 - this title, n-star and n-text for a.
00:48 - Now what should go as
00:51 - the h-ref of this link?
00:54 - Well we need to somehow tell the browser
00:57 - where to jump to in the web page.
00:59 - Some way of uniquely identifying
01:01 - that part of the page.
01:03 - If you've learned CSS selectors already,
01:06 - you've actually seen
how to do this, in fact.
01:09 - We can do it
01:10 - by adding an id attribute to a tag.
01:13 - Let's scroll down and
01:16 - find the heading here
01:19 - and we'll add an id
attribute to this heading.
01:22 - So I'm gonna put my cursor in h2
01:25 - type id equals,
01:27 - and come up with a good
identifier that's unique,
01:29 - like a web-history.
01:33 - Okay, let's scroll back up to the link.
01:35 - And, now, in order to tell the browser
01:37 - to go to this internal link,
01:39 - we need to start with a hash sign
01:41 - and then type exactly the
id like we typed it below.
01:46 - Okay, so now,
01:48 - pause this talk through
01:49 - and try clicking the link.
01:51 - Go on, I will wait.
01:53 - Clicky, clicky, clicky,
clicky, clicky, clicky, clicky.
01:56 - Okay, did you see it
scroll down to the section?
01:59 - Then it worked!
02:01 - We can add more links like that
02:02 - by putting id attributes on every heading
02:05 - and making a tags that point at them.
02:07 - But I'll leave that for you to try.
02:09 - The big thing to remember is
02:10 - that the ids must be unique
02:11 - because otherwise the browser won't
02:13 - know where to jump to.
02:15 - So make them nice and descriptive.
