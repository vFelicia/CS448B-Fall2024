00:00 - - [Voiceover] Alright so
I'm editing this webpage
00:02 - on Kahn Academy,
00:04 - and of course it's All about rabbits.
00:06 - I've decided I wanna edit it
00:08 - inside my desktop editor instead.
00:11 - So what I will do is select all of it,
00:15 - and then copy it,
00:17 - and then head on over
to my desktop editor.
00:21 - I'm using Sublime Text,
but you could be using
00:23 - some other editor.
00:26 - Next I'm going to paste in that html,
00:29 - and see that it all came out very nice.
00:32 - Now you'll notice the syntax highlighting,
00:35 - so we got all the colors showing us
00:36 - the structure of our html.
00:38 - The colors in my editor
are actually different
00:41 - from the colors on Kahn Academy.
00:43 - And this is just the
particular theme that I picked,
00:46 - you can pick whatever theme you like best
00:49 - in your editor.
00:51 - Alright so now I'm
going to save this file,
00:55 - and I'll save it as allaboutrabbits.html.
00:59 - So generally you wanna
save your file names
01:01 - with no spaces, all lower case.
01:04 - It's a nice file name.
01:06 - Okay, now I'll go on over to my browser,
01:10 - open a new tab,
01:12 - and then Open File,
01:16 - and find where I saved it on the desktop,
01:19 - open that up.
01:22 - Here we go, we've got it.
01:24 - So it's showing the file
from my file system,
01:28 - but now I wanna edit it.
01:31 - For that, I'm going to go back to my page,
01:34 - change it to adorable
widdle bunny rabbits!
01:39 - And I'll save it,
01:41 - and then I go back over
and I reload the page,
01:45 - and here's my change.
01:47 - Now when I reloaded the page,
01:49 - I did what's called a hard reload,
01:52 - using the keyboard
shortcut command shift r,
01:55 - for the Mac.
01:56 - A hard reload, both reloads a page
01:58 - and tells the browser to ignore
02:01 - whatever it has cached locally.
02:03 - Browsers often like to hold on
to old versions of web pages
02:07 - so that they can deliver them faster,
02:09 - but when you're debugging,
02:10 - you really wanna have
the very latest version.
02:13 - So you wanna do a hard reload,
02:15 - command shift r.
02:17 - Okay, so then if we wanna
make another change,
02:20 - make the change, command save,
02:22 - come on over, reload, ta-da.
02:25 - And that's generally the cycle
02:26 - when you're using a desktop editor,
02:28 - is you're going to make the change, save,
02:30 - go back over to your browser, reload,
02:34 - and you just get used to
doing that pretty quickly.
02:38 - Now you could even get lucky
and find that you're editor
02:41 - has a tool for like preview,
02:44 - in which case your editing
cycle gets even faster.
02:48 - You'll just have to
explore whatever editor
02:50 - you decide to use,
02:51 - and see what functionality it has.
