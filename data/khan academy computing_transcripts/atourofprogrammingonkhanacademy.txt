00:02 - Voiceover: Ok so now you see
how cool a short program can be
00:05 - so hopefully you're really excited to keep
going with programming and Khan Academy
00:09 - and we want to give you a little
tour of what you can expect.
00:13 - When we want to teach new concepts
we use coding talk throughs
00:16 - where we'll write code on
the left side over here
00:19 - and we'll see the result on
the right side constantly
00:21 - updating as we change the code.
00:23 - We'll also be talking
about what we're writing
00:25 - so make sure you have your
headphones or speakers on.
00:29 - To get started with a
talkthrough, just click play.
00:32 - And pause if you want to study
something that we've done.
00:36 - You can even change the code yourself
then and see the result update.
00:39 - Like maybe, I think that
Winston is actually an alien
00:43 - from this crazy planet
with purple faces and
00:46 - I just think that he should
have really, really big eyes.
00:49 - Whoah! bug eyes!
00:52 - Programming isn't just about going through
the tutorials that we've given you.
00:56 - Our favorite part about
programming is the exploration and
00:58 - the creativity of it.
01:01 - That means that when you wake
up in the middle of the night
01:04 - with an idea for a completely new program,
01:06 - just log on and click new program.
01:09 - Once you've done that,
you'll get a blank editor and
01:11 - a blank canvas and the world will
be your programmatic playground.
01:14 - So you might not remember
how to do things,
01:16 - you can look down at the
documentation and remember
01:18 - oh yeah, i want the ellipse
function and then I'm going to
01:23 - use the draw function, OK,
alright so we go up here and we
01:30 - use some variables there.
01:35 - And then we hope it runs.
01:37 - Oh! But we got a problem, uh-oh.
01:39 - mouseZ is not defined. OK, that's fine.
01:42 - It's actually supposed to be mouseY.
01:44 - And now it works. So here's the point
01:46 - It's totally OK to make mistakes.
01:48 - You should make mistakes.
01:50 - That's what we programmers
do, all the time.
01:52 - We just break things and make
mistakes, and then we learn from them.
01:56 - Now once I've made my
amazing new program and
01:59 - I'm really satisfied with it, I can save
it, give it a really nice descriptive name
02:05 - like "Circle Drawy ThingyBobby".
02:08 - Maybe, "Mr Circle Drawy Thingerbobby",
I can save that and then
02:15 - other people can actually find it.
02:17 - But creativity isn't just about
creating completely new things,
02:20 - it's just as much about building
on top of existing things and
taking them in new directions.
02:24 - That's the power of the spin off.
02:27 - So now that I've saved this program,
I can actually go and modify it.
02:31 - And if I consider my new
program to be different, I
can just go "save as spin-off"
02:36 - Alright so this one's like "Mr
Big Circle Drawer ThingyBobby"
02:45 - But you don't just have to
spin off your own programs
02:47 - you can spin off anyone's programs.
02:50 - We've made it really easy for you
to find other people's programs.
02:52 - You can browse the hot, the
spotlight, the top, the recent.
02:56 - I mean, I spend my Friday nights just
browsing programs on Khan Academy
03:00 - because I find so many cool things
that I would have never thought of.
03:04 - So some people make games, right.
03:07 - Like Doodle-Jump. If you've ever
played that on the mobile phone.
03:09 - It's a really fun game.
03:11 - And somebody made this version on
here and oh-man, almost got it, ahh!
03:18 - Alright, I'll play that again later.
03:22 - People make simulations, so if you want
to understand how a pendulum works,
03:25 - like if you're in physics class,
you can do it in a much more fun
way by using this simulation here.
03:30 - And then you can go and modify
things on the side to see
03:33 - how different variables
affect the pendulum.
03:37 - People make drawings, like of
their favorite cartoon characters.
03:40 - This is my favorite,
the TARDIS from Dr. Who.
03:42 - And if you're not watching Dr.
Who yet, you really should.
03:46 - Because as you can see from all the
programs and spin-offs on Khan Acadamy
03:50 - it's a really cool show.
03:53 - People make charts or
even animated charts.
03:57 - Some people make really trippy
animations like this one.
04:00 - I could just watch this for
hours and get hypnotized by it.
04:04 - You can see that lots of other
people liked it too because they made
all these spin-offs of it, right.
04:09 - Because that's the thing,
04:10 - if you find a program that you like,
you can just start tinkering with it
04:13 - and seeing "oh well what
if I change this, and this?
04:17 - "and maybe I change this
here, how's it change it?"
04:22 - And you may not even
understand it entirely first,
04:24 - but the more you tinker with it,
the more you play with the code,
04:27 - you get a better feel for it and
04:28 - maybe you come up with this variation
that you think is really cool,
04:30 - and then you'll save it
as a spin-off and say like
04:33 - "Alright this is my really
cool version of the Hypnozaic"
04:38 - And then you can save it and
other people can find it.
04:42 - But maybe you want to ask
a question about it. Right.
04:46 - Maybe you don't understand
how something works.
04:48 - We'll just go to the questions panel
04:50 - and say like "why did you
start your variables with i?"
04:57 - "Do you work for Apple?"
05:00 - And you can ask your
question and hopefully
05:02 - the person who created it will answer it.
05:04 - If you find a question that
you know the answer to,
05:09 - then answer them, and say
like "hey, yeah you can,
05:13 - "here's where I did it"
05:16 - And a lot of times you can answer with
actually a link to another scratchpad
05:19 - where you actually
answered their questions.
05:21 - Now if you just want to
say how awesome it is
05:23 - or give a tip, you can goto
the tips and feedback panel.
05:28 - And say like "Wow, this is the
coolest thing I've seen today"
05:35 - And then the creator will feel really good
because they got this compliment from you.
05:39 - And that's one of the awesome
things about programming
05:42 - is that you can put out
these things in the world and
05:44 - you never know who's going to find them
and who's day you're going to make better
05:47 - because they found this really cool,
creative thing that you came up with.
05:51 - So we want this to be a community
of people learning from each other,
05:56 - and sharing their
creations with each other.
05:57 - Because that's a big part of
what we love about programming.
06:01 - It will definitely be hard at first.
06:03 - And you're first programs
will start out small.
06:05 - But as you keep going, you'll
be able to do more and more
06:08 - until one day you realize that, wow, you
can do almost anything in programming.
