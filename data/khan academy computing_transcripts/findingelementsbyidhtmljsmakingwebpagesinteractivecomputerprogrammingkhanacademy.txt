00:01 - I have this webpage "All about dogs,"
which is great, but actually,
00:07 - and I know not everybody will agree 
with me, I am more of a cats person,
00:12 - and I would like to turn this 
into a webpage "All about cats."
00:17 - I'm going to use JavaScript to do it
instead of just modifying this HTML,
00:23 - so that eventually, 
I could maybe turn this
00:26 - into a browser extension to turn 
any webpage into being about cats.
00:32 - Wouldn't that be amazing, 
an entire internet about cats?
00:37 - Now, this webpage has a heading, 
a paragraph, and a couple images.
00:44 - We're going to change each part 
at a time, starting with the heading,
00:50 - using the two steps that we just learned.
00:53 - The first step is to find the DOM node 
containing that heading.
00:59 - The way that we found the DOM node 
before was just document.body,
01:06 - but now I want something much 
more specific, I want just this h1.
01:12 - Well, this h1 has an ID,
01:14 - which means it should be the 
only tag with that ID on the page,
01:19 - and there's actually a really easy way 
to find DOM nodes that have an ID,
01:24 - a method on the document object 
called getElementById.
01:30 - Let's use that down here 
in the  tag,
01:33 - starting off by declaring a variable 
to store it in-- `var headingEl`--
01:38 - I like to end my variable names 
with El or Node,
01:42 - so that I know they're storing an 
element, which we also call a node.
01:47 - Now we use the method. It's a method 
attached to the global document object,
01:52 - so we write `document`, 
then dot, then `getElementById`,
01:58 - then parentheses because it's a function.
It won't find anything just like that,
02:04 - because it doesn't know
what ID to look for.
02:07 - Inside the parentheses we need to 
pass it the ID that we're looking for
02:12 - as a string in quotes. 
So that is "heading".
02:21 - How do we know 
if we found the element
02:24 - before we actually try manipulating it?
02:26 - One way is to use the 
console.log function.
02:31 - Now, you can pause, and 
pop open your developer tools.
02:36 - Try the keyboard shortcut 
command-option-i on the Mac,
02:40 - or control-shift-i on Windows. 
One of those usually works.
02:48 - Did you see the h1 logged out in your 
console? If so, yay, that means that
02:54 - step one is complete. We found the 
element and stored it in a variable.
03:00 - For step two, let's manipulate the element
using the way that we already know,
03:06 - changing the innerHTML. Let's see, 
so that means we're going to say
03:10 - `headingEl.innerHTML = `-- 
dun-dun-dun, moment of truth--
03:17 - `"All about cats"`. 
There we go.
03:22 - We have begun. 
Catification has commenced.
03:26 - Now, you're going to try doing something
just like that in the challenge.
