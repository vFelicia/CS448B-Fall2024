00:00 - - [Voiceover] One of the
most useful skills that you
00:02 - can have as a web developer
is the ability to debug
00:05 - your web pages using the
tools available to you,
00:09 - like the browser developer tools.
00:12 - Every browser these days
comes with developer tools,
00:15 - so you should, theoretically,
learn how to use
00:17 - all of them, but it's also
good to know which browser
00:21 - has the most powerful tools
and start your debugging
00:25 - in that browser.
00:26 - Right now, that's Chrome, at least to me,
00:29 - but that could change in the future.
00:32 - Okay, so let's open the
developer tools in Chrome.
00:36 - And there's a few different
ways that you can do that.
00:38 - I like to find out what
the keyboard shortcut is
00:41 - for my browser and OS and use that
00:45 - 'cause that's the fastest.
00:46 - So on Mac, it's Command-Option-I.
00:50 - Ta-da! There's our dev tools.
00:53 - Another way to do it is to do
00:55 - right-click, Inspect Element,
00:59 - and that'll open up the
dev tools and it'll open up
01:01 - to the HTML console so you
then have to click around
01:04 - to what you want.
01:06 - But it's a pretty quick way as well.
01:09 - And finally, there's the long way,
01:12 - which is to go to your menu,
01:14 - go to More Tools,
01:16 - go to Developer Tools,
01:19 - and that'll open it as well.
01:20 - But that's a sure fire
way, but it is long,
01:22 - so I really recommend finding
out that keyboard shortcut
01:25 - and just doing it over and over and over
01:27 - 'til you remember it.
01:31 - Okay, so keyboard shortcut open, great.
01:35 - So there are a lot of tools down here,
01:38 - but there's one that we're about to use,
01:40 - so that is what I'm going to show.
01:42 - It's the JavaScript Console.
01:46 - This console shows all of
the warnings and errors
01:48 - related to http requests, CSS files,
01:52 - and JavaScript, plus it shows
anything that we log out.
01:58 - So to demonstrate,
01:59 - I will use 'console.log'
02:02 - to show a message.
02:05 - Now notice that it's showing
lots of syntax errors,
02:09 - like 'consol is not defined'.
02:12 - That's because I'm typing slowly
02:14 - and I'm in this real time environment
02:17 - that's constantly evaluating the new code.
02:19 - So it's showing me all
the errors along the way.
02:23 - That's something to keep in mind
02:25 - when you're using the console
02:26 - with your webpages here on Khan Academy.
02:28 - You can ignore all these,
all these messages here,
02:31 - until you're done typing and
see what the actual error is,
02:35 - or hopefully, there'll be no error.
02:38 - Presto! The console said hello to me.
02:41 - How very sweet of it.
02:43 - All right, so there's a
ton more that you can do
02:46 - in your browser dev tools
02:47 - and you should definitely
explore them more,
02:49 - but this should be enough to help you
02:51 - in simple debugging as you
go through this course.
