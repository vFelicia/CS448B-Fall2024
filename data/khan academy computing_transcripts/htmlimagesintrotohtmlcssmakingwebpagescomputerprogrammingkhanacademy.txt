00:00 - - [Voiceover] We've been
talking about rabbits
00:01 - this whole time.
00:02 - Describing them with paragraphs and lists,
00:06 - but we could just put a
picture on our webpage
00:09 - and actually show what
a rabbit looks like.
00:12 - Well, to insert a picture on
a webpage, we use the img tag.
00:16 - Which, as you might
guess, stands for image.
00:19 - If we just type image though,
00:21 - we don't see anything, why not?
00:23 - Well, we didn't tell the
browser which image to show.
00:27 - There are millions of
images on the internet,
00:29 - and we certainly don't want
it to pick a random one,
00:31 - because it might be something
gross that we don't like.
00:34 - And it also just won't be
what we want it to be of.
00:37 - We need to tell it the url of the image.
00:41 - The url is what shows up
at the top of the browsers,
00:43 - in the address bar, and
that's what it is, an address.
00:46 - It's a way of finding
some resource on the web.
00:50 - And it means we can only insert an image,
00:52 - if it's already on the internet somewhere.
00:54 - We can't just insert images
that are only on our computer.
00:58 - There are many ways to find
images on the internet,
01:00 - but we're making it easier for you here
01:03 - by providing an image picker
and a photo collection.
01:06 - To get that to pop up,
01:07 - we need to add an
attribute to our image tag.
01:11 - An attribute is an additional
bit of information about a tag
01:14 - and this is the first
attribute that we've seen.
01:17 - So to tell the browser the url,
01:19 - we're going to add an
attribute with the name source.
01:23 - And I will add a space, and then type src.
01:28 - Now it stands for source,
01:30 - but it's very important
that you spell it src,
01:32 - because the browser will
ignore it if we misspell it.
01:35 - Now I need to put in an equal sign
01:38 - so that I can tell the browser
what the attribute value is.
01:41 - And now I'll add a quote,
01:44 - and the editor will
autocomplete the end quote,
01:47 - so the attribute values are
always wrapped in two quotes.
01:51 - Okay, so normally, this is
when we'd start typing our url,
01:56 - but here on Khan Academy
01:57 - that's when our image picker will pop up.
02:00 - So I'll just hit pick image,
02:01 - and I want a picture of a rabbit,
02:03 - so I'll click the animals tab,
02:05 - and select the adorable
rabbit, and click okay.
02:10 - Do you see how there's a
url inside our quotes now?
02:13 - And, do you see how that
url starts with HTTP?
02:16 - That's how we know that
it's pointing at some image
02:18 - somewhere on the internet.
02:19 - And, hey, look, there's
a bunny on my webpage.
02:23 - But, what if the server
hosting the image was failing,
02:26 - and the browser couldn't load the image?
02:28 - How would the viewer know
what my amazing image was of?
02:31 - They'll see nothing, and wonder
for the rest of their lives
02:34 - what they missed out on.
02:36 - That's why image tags have
another attribute, alt,
02:39 - which we use to tell browsers what the
02:41 - alternate text for an image is.
02:44 - So, to add another attribute,
we just put a space
02:46 - after the final quote for the last one.
02:49 - Then we type alt equals
quotes, and inside these quotes
02:56 - the text will be some helpful
description of the image.
02:59 - Like, rabbit with lop ears in barn.
03:04 - That also helps people who see webpages,
03:07 - but can't really see them, like the blind.
03:09 - They use an app called a screen reader,
03:11 - which will literally
read a webpage to them,
03:13 - describing each tag it sees.
03:15 - When it sees an image tag,
it'll read off the alt text,
03:18 - since a blind person can't see images.
03:22 - So you should always, always use alt text,
03:24 - so that the whole world can
experience your webpage.
03:29 - Okay, back to the image we can see.
03:31 - It's a little big.
03:32 - Let's resize it.
03:34 - We can do that with more attributes.
03:36 - With our width or height.
03:38 - So let's say width equals 100.
03:43 - Okay, so now it's 100 pixels wide.
03:47 - That's a little too small,
let's put our cursor inside,
03:51 - and use the number
scrubber to make it bigger.
03:54 - Okay, that looks a lot better.
03:56 - Now let's try adding height.
03:58 - I'm going to say height equals 50.
04:01 - Uh oh, I squashed my bunny, poor bunny.
04:05 - See that's why I should
usually only specify
04:08 - either width or height, but not both.
04:11 - Because you might use the wrong dimensions
04:13 - and squish your bunnies.
04:14 - So I say just let the
browser do the math to decide
04:18 - what the other dimension should be.
04:20 - I'm going to delete height.
04:23 - Now that you can make images,
04:24 - start thinking about
combining all the tags
04:27 - you have in your toolbox.
04:28 - Lists with images, and paragraphs,
top 10 craziest animals.
04:33 - Just don't put too many
images on your page,
04:36 - because the person
checking out you webpage
04:37 - will have to load all of them.
04:40 - But, you can still have a lot of fun.
