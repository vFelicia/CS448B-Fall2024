00:00 - - Hey, I'm Pamela, and I teach programming
00:03 - for Khan Academy.
00:04 - I teach the second half
of the JavaScript course,
00:07 - and all of the HTML and SQL courses.
00:10 - Now, I love teaching programming here,
00:12 - because I get to see all of the creativity
00:14 - that students pour into their programs.
00:17 - I just wake up in the morning
and look at all of 'em.
00:19 - And I also just love
being around a community
00:22 - of people learning new things.
00:24 - I think it's got this
addictive energy to it.
00:28 - Now, when I'm not teaching programming,
00:30 - I'm engineering for Khan Academy,
00:32 - and actually writing a
lot of the JavaScript
00:34 - and Python code that powers
the programming platform,
00:37 - like the editor and the coding challenges,
00:39 - and the Hot List, so if
you find bugs in them,
00:42 - I'll probably be the one fixing them.
00:45 - I'm really excited that you decided
00:47 - to learn JavaScript with us.
00:49 - It'll be hard sometimes,
but if you keep at it,
00:52 - you can definitely learn it.
00:53 - I hope that you find what
you love about programming
00:57 - during this course.
