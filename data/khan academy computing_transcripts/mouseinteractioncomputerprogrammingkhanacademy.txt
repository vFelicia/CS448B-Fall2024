00:00 - You've already learned how 
to make your own variables and use them.
00:03 - Now we're going to learn 
about two special variables:
00:06 - mouseX and mouseY.
00:10 - You never have to make 
these variables yourself,
00:12 - and in fact you shouldn't,
because they already exist.
00:15 - You see, the program sets the values 
of these variables behind the scenes,
00:19 - making sure that the value of mouseX
is always the x position of your mouse,
00:23 - and the value of mouseY 
is always the y position of your mouse.
00:27 - This makes it really easy to do
cool, interactive things
00:30 - based on the user's mouse position.
00:33 - Let's look at this ellipse
that I'm drawing here.
00:35 - So, right now, 
I'm always drawing it at 200, 200.
00:40 - If I use mouseX and mouseY, 
these special variables,
00:44 - then I can actually draw it
at mouseX and mouseY.
00:49 - Now, if I move my mouse 
over the canvas, you can see
00:52 - the ellipse is always being drawn
where my mouse is --
00:55 - so it follows my mouse around.
00:57 - That's pretty cool; can you tell
what I'm drawing? Whee!
01:00 - If you're going to use mouseX and mouseY,
you've got to make sure
01:04 - that you use them inside
the draw = function ()
01:06 - because look what happens
01:09 - if we move these two lines of code
outside the draw = function ().
01:13 - You see?
01:14 - Now this code here only gets run once,
01:19 - so this ellipse is only drawn once,
01:21 - and it's drawn wherever my mouse
happened to be
01:24 - at the very, very beginning
of the program.
01:26 - That's why we need to have it
inside the draw = function (),
01:30 - because the draw = function ()
is this function
01:32 - that's called repeatedly over
and over while our program is running.
01:35 - So we want that when it gets called,
it looks at what the current value
01:39 - of mouseX and mouseY is, and then
it draws the ellipse at that position.
01:43 - If you think about it, it's 
actually very similar to an animation --
01:46 - it's changing over time, 
just in a different way.
01:49 - Okay, now we can do 
all sorts of fun things.
01:52 - What if, instead of drawing it 
at mouseX and mouseY,
01:56 - I drew it at mouseX still but I fixed
mouseY at something like 300?
02:03 - Now you can see that the ellipse 
only follows my x coordinate,
02:07 - ignoring whatever I do in the y.
02:10 - Then, what if I now draw it at mouseX
and mouseY, bringing that back,
02:16 - but I get rid of the background,
just commenting that out?
02:20 - Woo! Now look, I've got 
this funky paintbrush thing.
02:25 - That's pretty awesome.
02:27 - Or, or, I could even switch
these variables.
02:31 - Let me bring back our background.
02:32 - I'll switch these variables here, 
mouseY and mouseX,
02:37 - and then see what happens.
02:39 - Now it just feels really, really weird.
02:41 - I've got these mouse controls 
that are doing opposite
02:43 - of what I would expect them to.
02:45 - But that's cool, you could imagine 
making a whole game
02:48 - which is about trying to draw something
or do something
02:50 - while using inverted mouse controls.
02:53 - That's it for mouseX and mouseY --
really, pretty fun. Enjoy!
