00:01 - - [Voiceover] So far,
we've been using jQuery
00:02 - to modify the existing
elements in our page,
00:06 - like we did with all of these code here.
00:09 - However, sometimes we wanna use jQuery
00:11 - to create entirely new DOM elements
00:14 - and that's pretty easy to do as well.
00:17 - Let's say that we want to make
a new paragraph on this page.
00:22 - First, I'm going to declare
a variable to store it,
00:25 - so 'newP'.
00:28 - Next, I'm going to create it
using the jQuery function,
00:32 - so type '$()'.
00:35 - Now, instead of passing the CSS selector,
00:39 - I'm going to pass in a string of HTML,
00:43 - the start tag for the element
that I want to create.
00:47 - I don't have to do the end tag.
00:49 - I can, if I want, but I don't have to.
00:52 - As long as I pass in the start tag,
00:55 - jQuery will know that I want it
00:57 - to create a paragraph for me.
01:00 - Okay. So, I've now successfully
made a jQuery collection
01:04 - with a paragraph inside of it,
01:05 - and I'm storing that inside this variable.
01:08 - I probably want this paragraph
to actually say something.
01:11 - So, I'll use the 'text' method.
01:15 - Let's see. "The crocodiles
01:18 - "have eaten this ENTIRE PAGE!"
01:22 - Okay, great.
01:25 - I could also modify it in other ways,
01:27 - like let's add a class name,
01:30 - the 'crocodile' class.
01:31 - It's got some good styles on it.
01:34 - Great. All right.
01:36 - But where is my paragraph?
01:38 - I don't see it on the page anywhere.
01:40 - Well, it's floating off
in JavaScript memory space
01:44 - and it's nowhere to be found on my page
01:47 - because I haven't told
jQuery where to put it.
01:51 - So the final step after
we create the element
01:54 - and we modify it,
01:56 - is to attach it somewhere on our page
01:59 - using jQuery methods,
02:00 - like 'append' or 'prepend' or 'after'.
02:05 - So, I want this paragraph to
be at the very end of the page.
02:09 - Just here
02:11 - or below there.
02:12 - So that means I'm going to append it
02:15 - to the '' tag
02:17 - and that will make it the
very last tag in the 'body.'
02:21 - So we can do that by selecting the 'body'
02:24 - and then saying 'append'
02:26 - and passing in 'newP'.
02:29 - There we go. Yay!
02:32 - All right. So, that's creating element
02:36 - and the steps to remember
02:38 - are that you create the element,
02:40 - you modify it however you want to,
02:43 - and then very important step
02:45 - is you figure out where on the page
02:46 - you want that new element to be.
02:49 - Do not forget this step
02:50 - or you're gonna spend a long time
02:52 - poking around your page,
02:53 - trying to find an element
that doesn't exist.
