00:00 - - [Instructor] The binary number system
00:01 - works the same way as the
decimal number system.
00:05 - The only difference is what
each of these places represents.
00:09 - This is a four digit binary number 1010.
00:14 - Each of these digits can
also be called a bit,
00:16 - since a bit represents zero or one.
00:20 - Now this four digit number
equals the decimal number 10.
00:25 - And we're going to see why.
00:29 - This first place, this is the ones place,
00:31 - just like in decimal.
00:33 - Now there's zero here, so that means
00:36 - we're gonna multiply zero times one,
00:38 - get the very exciting value of zero.
00:42 - The second place, the second bit here,
00:44 - that's where things get more interesting.
00:46 - This is actually the twos
place, not the tens place,
00:50 - and there's a one here,
00:51 - so we're gonna multiply one times two.
00:56 - So so far, this number equals two.
00:59 - The third place, the third bit,
01:02 - this is zero and this is the fours place.
01:06 - So we're going to
multiply zero times four,
01:09 - which is once again just zero.
01:12 - And we're still looking at the number two.
01:14 - Finally, this fourth bit here,
this is the eights place,
01:18 - and there's a one here.
01:20 - So we're gonna multiply one times eight.
01:24 - Add that to everything else,
01:25 - we end up having eight plus two,
01:30 - which equals decimal 10.
01:35 - In the decimal system,
01:36 - each of these places
represented a power of 10.
01:39 - But in the binary system,
01:40 - each place represents a power of two.
01:43 - The first bit is two to
the zero power, it's one.
01:47 - The second bit is two to the
power of one, the first power,
01:52 - which is two.
01:54 - The third bit is two squared,
two to the power of two,
01:59 - which is four.
02:00 - And this fourth bit is two cubed,
02:03 - two to the power of three, that's eight.
02:07 - That's the only difference
between decimal and binary,
02:10 - what each place represents.
02:12 - Once we know that, we see
what digit is in each place,
02:15 - we multiply them together,
and we get our final value.
02:21 - Now let's try to convert
02:22 - another binary number to decimal.
02:25 - We can erase this work here.
02:28 - And then for the number,
let's just flip the bits.
02:32 - Zero becomes one, one becomes
zero, zero becomes one,
02:37 - and one becomes zero.
02:40 - What do you think this equals and decimal?
02:42 - I'll give you a second to think about it.
02:44 - (hums)
02:50 - All right.
02:51 - Now let's figure it out together.
02:54 - There's a one in the ones place.
02:57 - So this so far equals
03:00 - one times one,
03:02 - that's one.
03:04 - There's a zero in the twos place.
03:07 - So we add zero times two, that's zero.
03:11 - There's a one in the fours place.
03:13 - So we add one times four, that's four.
03:18 - So so far, we've got four plus one,
03:23 - and then there's a zero
in the final place,
03:26 - the eights place, that's
zero times eight or zero.
03:30 - So we've got zero plus
four plus zero plus one,
03:33 - which equals five in decimal.
03:40 - Let's try converting a bigger
binary number to decimal.
03:45 - We know that this equals five.
03:47 - What happens if we add four more digits
03:50 - to the left of these four digits?
03:52 - Let's start by figuring out
what each place represents.
03:57 - One way of doing that is just
to double the previous places.
04:00 - So this place here is 16,
04:03 - this place is 32,
04:06 - this place is 64,
04:09 - and this place is 128.
04:14 - Another way of doing this is
to calculate the powers of two.
04:19 - So this place is two to
the fourth, which is 16.
04:23 - This is two to the fifth, which is 32.
04:25 - This is two to the sixth, 64.
04:28 - And this is two to the seventh, 128.
04:32 - Okay, so now we know what
each place represents.
04:35 - Now we can add these numbers up.
04:38 - We know already that
these one's equal five.
04:42 - We already did that.
04:44 - Now, let's add in what we've added here.
04:47 - So we have a one in the 16.
04:50 - So that means we're going
to add 16 to the number.
04:54 - Then there's a zero in the 32.
04:56 - So that's just gonna be zero.
04:58 - There's a one in the 64,
so that's going to be 64.
05:02 - And there's a zero in the
128, so that'll be zero.
05:06 - So now we've got 64 plus 16 plus five.
05:11 - So that's 80 plus five,
05:15 - which is 85 in decimal.
05:21 - So it took us eight bits
to represent a number
05:23 - that only takes two digits
05:25 - to represent in the decimal system.
05:27 - That's because each bit
represents less information,
05:30 - just zero or one instead of zero to nine.
05:33 - But it's easier for computer hardware
05:35 - to store binary values.
05:37 - So binary numbers and
the binary number system
05:40 - are the foundation of all computing.
