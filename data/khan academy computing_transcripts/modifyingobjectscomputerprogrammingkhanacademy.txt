00:00 - And we're back! This time, our program has the Winston object,
00:05 - but we're only displaying the age of Winston. That's because I wanna show
00:10 - you how we could change Winston's age. Because you know eventually,
00:13 - Winston has to get older. Let's remember what it would be like if we were
00:18 - just using simple variables. We have var winston age equals 19, and then if we
00:22 - wanted to change it, we would say winston age equals 20.
00:27 - and that would change the value stored in that variable. It's really really similar
00:31 - for object properties. We can just say winston dot age equals 20, and then we've changed
00:39 - the value stored in the age property of the Winston object.
00:43 - Cool.
00:44 - So let's see if that worked. We'll take our text command, put it below,
00:49 - change the y, tada! Winston got older. So easy.
00:54 - Um, okay, so now let's try, we were just adding one here
00:59 - let's do that more programatically. Let's say winston dot age equals winston dot age plus one.
01:07 - So what we're saying here is take the previous value of his age
01:10 - add one to it, and then store it in the age property.
01:16 - And that should just end up adding one to whatever the previous value was. Let's see.
01:22 - Display it, tada! He's 21.
01:25 - Getting getting so old. All right. Now, remember we have a shortcut for adding one
01:30 - to variables, and the same shortcut works with object properties so we can say winston dot age plus plus
01:37 - And let's see if that worked. Yup! And that really just did exactly the same thing as this line,
01:44 - it's just a shortcut, so that we don't have to type as much.
01:49 - Now if we look at all this, this really looks like the situation for a loop.
01:53 - We keep on using the same code over and over, and the only thing we're changing is we're adding one
01:57 - to his age, and we're changing the y position so it's on a different line.
02:03 - So, if we used a loop, it could be really easy to show him getting older and older and older
02:07 - and not have to use that much code. Let's say, we'll make a loop to show Winston getting to 40 years old.
02:13 - He doesn't wanna get any older than that because then he'd be wrinkly
02:16 - and we'd have to call him "Wrinkleston." [laugh]
02:19 - All right.
02:20 - So we'll do a while loop and we'll say while winston dot age is less than or equal to 40
02:27 - and then inside here, we're gonna display his age
02:32 - and we're going to add one to his age each time.
02:37 - Okay, that worked, but everything is piled on top of each other, so we need to change the y position
02:42 - each time. And we'll just do winston dot age times 20, um, minus 200, minus 300
02:53 - Okay! and we'll just minus 350. All right. That looks good. Let's delete the old stuff here.
03:03 - Tada! Now we can see Winston getting older and older, but not so old that he'll be a Wrinkleston.
03:10 - Okay. So, now we can see how to change age, we can also add additional information in the
03:16 - Winston object as he gets older. Like, maybe when he turns 30, he'll meet another programmer
03:22 - named Winnefer, and he'll marry her.
03:24 - And no, he's not just gonna marry her because she has such a great name.
03:28 - So what we can do is we can add a property by just saying winston dot, and then the new
03:33 - property key which will be wife, equals Winnefer.
03:39 - Great, but, we only want him to have this wife when he's at, you know, at a good marrying age
03:44 - so we'll say equals 30 and we'll go and move, move that inside here.
03:53 - Great. So now he has a wife, so, you know, they're happy, and then they have some kids
03:57 - a couple years later, so maybe when they're, uh, 32, we'll add some kids to the object
04:04 - to keep track of that. And they have twins, of course, cause they're very productive
04:08 - And Winston's twins will be named, uh, of course Winston Junior and Winstonia.
04:16 - Beautiful. That's a, that's a great family. Great set of names.
04:21 - And so you can see we can add new properties that are strings and arrays
04:25 - and anything we could've had in the original object.
04:28 - And so once this loop finishes, winston dot age will be 40, and winston will
04:33 - have a wife, who's Winnefer, and a twins, which is a set of er, which an array of two names.
04:41 - Huh. That's an awesome loop. But, hey, if you don't like how this story ends for Winston,
04:45 - you could always spin off this program and tell your own story of his future
04:50 - now that you know all about how to change object properties.
