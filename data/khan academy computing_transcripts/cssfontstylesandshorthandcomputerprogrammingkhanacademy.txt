00:00 - - [Instructor] Let's see
what else we can change
00:02 - about the font.
00:03 - What if we want this first
paragraph to be bold?
00:06 - We could wrap the whole
paragraph in a strong tag,
00:09 - but that would be kind of
an abuse of the strong tag.
00:12 - We're not really trying to say
00:13 - that the whole first
paragraph is a highlight.
00:16 - We just think it might look better bolded.
00:18 - So instead, we should use
a CSS property font weight.
00:22 - Let's go up to the
relevant CSS rule and say
00:24 - font-weight:bold.
00:28 - Ta-dah, it's bold.
00:30 - Now, what if we wanna make
00:32 - all these lyrics italicized slanted?
00:35 - Once again, we could
wrap them all in an M tag
00:37 - because the browser always defaults
00:40 - to giving M italicized style.
00:42 - But we shouldn't do that
00:44 - because that's kind of
an abuse of the M tag.
00:46 - We're not trying to
emphasize the whole song.
00:49 - We just think it might
look better italicized.
00:52 - So instead, we should use
a CSS property font style.
00:56 - Let's go up to our relevant rules,
00:58 - song lyrics, say font-style:italic.
01:04 - Okay, great.
01:05 - Notice that we've a bunch
of font-related properties
01:08 - in one rule for our lyrics.
01:10 - We've got font family,
font size, and font style.
01:14 - If we want, we can actually bundle them up
01:16 - into a single property font.
01:19 - Just writing font:italic 13px fantasy.
01:25 - Okay, and we can delete
the three properties
01:28 - that we used to have, and
everything looks the same.
01:31 - This is called a shorthand
property, since, as you can see,
01:34 - it's a lot shorter.
01:36 - But me, I don't like it
because I always forget
01:38 - what order to write the properties in
01:40 - and it's just easier if I
write them out one at a time.
01:44 - So I'm gonna bring back what I had before.
01:48 - It's up to you if you're a
short hander or a long hander.
01:52 - The important thing is to stay stylish.
