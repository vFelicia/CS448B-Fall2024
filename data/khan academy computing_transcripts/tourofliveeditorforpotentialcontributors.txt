00:00 - - Hello everyone.
00:01 - I'm Pamela and I teach
programming for Khan Academy.
00:05 - I'm going to give you a little tour
00:07 - of our programming editor
00:09 - and hope it gets you
excited to contribute to it.
00:14 - So here is an example program
00:17 - in our JavaScript environment.
00:19 - On the left-hand side, we have our editor,
00:21 - which is the Ace editor.
00:23 - And on the right-hand
side we have the output,
00:25 - which is the output of a JavaScript
00:27 - plus PRocessing.js program.
00:30 - And PRoocessing.js is this
library that can be used
00:33 - to make drawings, animations, and games,
00:35 - and really makes learning
JavaScript quite fun.
00:39 - Alright, so what do we
have in this editor?
00:42 - One thing we have is a color picker.
00:43 - So I can click around and see, real time,
00:48 - what the effect of changing the color is.
00:50 - Alright, I like that one.
00:52 - We also have a number scrubber.
00:55 - And that's great
00:56 - because you don't have to
be an expert at numbers.
00:59 - We just have to be okay
with scrubbing a scrubber
01:03 - and seeing what happened.
01:06 - We also have errors.
01:08 - So these are based of jsunit
01:10 - and we see Oh Noes guy pop up
01:13 - and tell us where the error is.
01:15 - And then we can fix it.
01:18 - And those errors are a
really important part
01:20 - of the editing experience on Khan Academy
01:23 - and we do put a lot of effort into
01:25 - improving that experience,
01:26 - making the messages clearer,
01:28 - making Oh Noes guy less
annoying, all of that stuff.
01:33 - We also have autocomplete.
01:36 - And this helps people who
are not so good at spelling,
01:39 - which is, as it turns out, most people.
01:42 - And we also have this
inline documentation.
01:45 - So we can see how to use
a function if we forgot.
01:50 - Optional radius, great.
01:52 - Now we have a rect as well.
01:55 - And yeah, those are a lot
of the features we have
01:58 - in this JavaScript editor here.
02:01 - Now we use that editor when we're teaching
02:03 - our JavaScript courses.
02:06 - And in those courses, we teach
02:07 - all the fundamentals of programming,
02:09 - plus how to make cool
things with PRocessing.js.
02:15 - Now instead of videos,
02:16 - we have something called talk throughs.
02:18 - A talk through uses the editor
02:21 - and plays back audio synched back to
02:25 - the things that I've typed in this editor.
02:28 - So the neat thing is that
02:30 - you're actually watching this
happen in the editor itself
02:32 - and at any point, you can pause
02:35 - and you can change the code
that the teacher just wrote
02:38 - for yourself, and see what changes.
02:41 - And that's really cool.
02:41 - It makes it a lot more interactive.
02:46 - After talk throughs, we
typically have challenges,
02:49 - which are step-by-step guided exercises
02:54 - to give you practice
02:56 - with using the concept you just learned.
02:58 - And this is the same editor,
03:01 - but it is combined with
an automated grader.
03:05 - The automated grader is based off
03:08 - another open source library that we wrote.
03:10 - And it looks at the abstract
syntaxtry of your code
03:13 - and compares it to known good trees.
03:15 - And it has notions of patterns
03:17 - and wild cards and stuff like that.
03:19 - So when we look at that,
03:20 - we can decide whether to pass you
03:23 - or whether to give you a
little helpful message.
03:28 - So let's see, I should
go to the next step.
03:32 - And I'll just put in some random numbers.
03:37 - Alright, so this time
we got a helpful message
03:39 - to remind us that we really
should make this rectangle wider
03:45 - and that would be the third number.
03:46 - Great.
03:47 - I did it.
03:49 - Yay.
03:51 - So those are our challenges
03:52 - and we've got quite a few of those.
03:55 - Now we also have a real-time environment
03:59 - for making web pages.
04:01 - So here on the left-hand
side instead of JavaScript,
04:03 - we're seeing HTML and CSS.
04:06 - We have a lot of the same
features from before,
04:08 - things like image pickers
04:10 - to let them customize
what images they're using.
04:13 - We've got a linting system
04:17 - to let them know when
something isn't quite right
04:20 - with their HTML.
04:22 - We've also got warnings
you're missing our doctype.
04:27 - And we also have a color picker for CSS.
04:30 - Finally, we have an SQL environment.
04:33 - This is using SQLite and we
compiled it to JavaScript
04:39 - so we could do it in the browser.
04:42 - And once again, pretty cool,
04:43 - we can write our sequel
on the left-hand side,
04:46 - see our results on the right-hand side.
04:48 - We can get errors, syntax errors.
04:51 - These ones tend to not be as helpful.
04:53 - We haven't been able to put
as much effort into them yet.
04:56 - But they'll point you in
the general direction.
04:59 - So those are the three
environments we have:
05:01 - the JavaScript with PRocessing.js,
05:03 - the web page environment,
05:04 - and the SQL environment.
05:06 - All of these environments are inside
05:07 - the live-editor repo on GitHub.
05:09 - This repo has instructions for running,
05:12 - building, testing,
05:14 - and a long part here
about how you can help,
05:18 - with a little guidance through
our long list of issues
05:21 - to help you pick which of these issues
05:23 - might be the best for
you to start working on.
05:26 - We have a lot of issues
05:27 - and we do not have a lot, or really any
05:30 - engineering resources to help
on these issues right now.
05:33 - So we would love to
have some of you come on
05:36 - and start contributing
05:38 - and you can literally
improve the programming
05:42 - learning experience for
millions of students,
05:46 - which I think is pretty awesome.
05:49 - I hope to see you in our repo soon.
