00:00 - At this point, you might realize 
that you've been defining
00:04 - a particular function every time 
you wanted
00:06 - to animate your program, 
the "draw" function.
00:09 - To remind you, 
here is our animated car program.
00:14 - So remember we have "var x = 11"
00:16 - which is the initial position of the car
00:18 - and "var draw" strands, 
all of our drawing code
00:20 - and then we change "x" by +3 each time
00:23 - and then we can just restart 
and go: Wooo! Zoomy Zoomy Zoomy!
00:27 - Now that you have learned
how to make your own functions,
00:31 - you may be wondering 
"What about this draw function?"
00:34 - "Is it a custom function? 
Why is it always named draw?"
00:37 - Well, those are very good questions.
00:39 - You see, in our environment 
here on Khan Academy,
00:43 - there are a few special global functions,
which I call Magic Functions
00:47 - but that's just my own name for them.
00:50 - Basically when we run your program
we look to see
00:53 - if you defined functions with certain names,
00:56 - like "draw", and, if you have, 
then we call them at particular times.
00:59 - For example, when you define 
the "draw" function in your code,
01:02 - then we'll find that function 
and we'll look at the code inside of it
01:07 - and we'll call that code 
over and over and over as fast as we can.
01:12 - If you don't define a draw function, 
then we won't call anything
01:15 - because there's nothing there.
01:18 - That means if we rename 
this function to "drow" -
01:23 - - ok, that didn't work.
01:25 - Or to "drawCar" - 
- ok, that didn't work.
01:29 - So if we rename the function 
the program no longer finds it
01:33 - because it's not called draw anymore.
01:35 - So it doesn't run that code 
over and over
01:37 - so we end up with nothing.
01:40 - So this means that you 
shouldn't name your own custom functions
01:42 - "draw" unless you want them 
to be treated specially
01:45 - and called over and over.
01:48 - Now "draw" is not 
the only magic function available.
01:51 - There's also a bunch of functions 
for reacting to mouse interactions
01:56 - and key presses.
01:59 - Let's show an example 
of another animation program.
02:02 - Let's say if we wanted to draw 
a colored ball
02:08 - whenever the user is moving their mouse.
02:14 - We have "draw" and then "fill" 
and then "ellipse"
02:16 - at "(mouseX, mouseY, 10, 10)".
02:18 - Ok, let's try this - 
- Ok cool!
02:21 - We have this really cool 
colored ball thing going on.
02:24 - So this function, this code 
inside this "draw" function,
02:28 - will get called over and over
because we've put it
02:31 - inside a function named "draw".
02:33 - So it will get called even
if the user isn't moving their mouse.
02:36 - It's getting called right now 
even though my mouse is not moving.
02:41 - As it turns out, 
there is a better way to do this,
02:45 - that is more efficient.
02:47 - What we can do is change
this "draw" function to "mouseMoved".
02:53 - Our environment always checks 
programs to see
02:57 - if they have defined 
a "mouseMoved" function.
02:59 - And if so, they will call it 
whenever the user moves their mouse.
03:03 - You can see once again, it still works.
03:06 - But, they won't call this 
if they're not moving their mouse.
03:10 - As soon as I stop moving my mouse, 
it's not called anymore.
03:15 - Remember before when we had "draw," 
that code was getting called
03:18 - over and over and over, 
even when the mouse wasn't changing.
03:22 - But now that we are using "mouseMoved," 
we are only calling the code
03:24 - when we need to, 
when the mouse actually changes.
03:27 - Our program is much more efficient.
03:30 - Generally, if you only want 
to change your program output
03:32 - when the user moves a mouse,
then it is better to have it
03:35 - inside that "mouseMoved" function
instead of inside "draw".
03:39 - There are a bunch more 
magic functions like "mouseMoved".
03:43 - There is "mousePressed" 
and "mouseReleased" and "keyPressed"
03:46 - and you can read 
all about it in the documentation.
03:49 - The key thing to remember is this;
If you want to use the magic function,
03:54 - spell it correctly.
03:55 - If you don't, make sure you give
your own custom functions a new name.
