00:00 - - [Instructor] We need to begin
00:01 - with understanding shapes, the basics.
00:03 - But don't worry.
00:04 - Soon enough your shapes will
be flying around the screen
00:06 - and changing colors and all kinds of other
00:07 - cool programming things.
00:09 - Just stay with us.
00:10 - So let's start with drawing rectangles.
00:12 - We type rect for rectangle,
then open parentheses,
00:15 - and then four numbers.
00:17 - And I'll explain what
these mean in a moment
00:18 - and then a close parentheses.
00:20 - And at the end, we'll
just put a semicolon.
00:22 - And look, amazing!
00:22 - A rectangle.
00:23 - And that was so neat.
00:24 - So let's do that again.
00:25 - We can try different numbers this time.
00:28 - Maybe bigger numbers.
00:30 - And then smaller numbers at the end.
00:31 - And oh hey look, another rectangle.
00:34 - In fact, if we try
changing this first number
00:36 - to make it smaller, it'll start moving.
00:38 - And if we change this last number,
00:40 - make it bigger and then smaller,
00:42 - it's just gonna grow and then shrink.
00:44 - Interesting.
00:45 - So how is all this magic
happening, you might wonder.
00:49 - Well, remember that your
computer is just like
00:51 - a really intelligent and obedient dog.
00:53 - And with a dog, maybe
we could tell it to sit,
00:56 - stay, even roll over.
00:58 - You would just have to give the command.
01:00 - So in code, how would you
tell your computer dog to sit?
01:04 - Well the way you would do that
01:06 - is you would write the
command name, say sit,
01:09 - and then you would two
parentheses afterwards
01:11 - to tell it to go do that
command you just said.
01:13 - And then you put a semicolon at the end,
01:15 - just to say, hey yeah,
this command is over.
01:17 - And then your computer dog would sit down.
01:19 - Well of course, your computer
on Khan Academy isn't a dog.
01:23 - So it doesn't know how
to sit or roll over.
01:25 - But it does know how to draw rectangles
01:27 - when you tell it rect,
01:28 - and like that's kinda neat too, right?
01:30 - Anyway, so that's what
we're gonna do on this line.
01:32 - We'll say the command rect,
which is just the name.
01:35 - And then we'll put the open parentheses
01:37 - and the closed parentheses
to say go do that.
01:39 - And then we'll put the
semicolon at the end.
01:41 - And that's how your computer knows
01:42 - to go do the special ability rect.
01:45 - Okay.
01:46 - So now let's go back to our rect.
01:47 - We have the command name right here,
01:49 - and we have those parentheses.
01:51 - What about all these crazy numbers?
01:53 - Well the idea is that the computer
01:56 - really doesn't know enough
if you just tell it rect.
01:59 - So to see this, imagine if I
just gave you a piece of paper
02:03 - and I said I wanted
you to draw a rectangle
02:05 - exactly the way I wanted it to be.
02:07 - Well, unless you can read my mind,
02:09 - you're going to have some
questions right away.
02:12 - First you might wonder, well okay,
02:15 - where do you want me
to draw the rectangle?
02:17 - And then what I would say is,
02:19 - how about we just agree that
02:21 - this left side of the
paper that I just gave you,
02:23 - let's just call that zero.
02:25 - And let's just agree that this
right side is gonna be 400.
02:28 - Then I could give you
a number, say like 100,
02:31 - and you would know that that's gonna be
02:32 - right about like there maybe, roughly.
02:35 - Except that will satisfy you for a moment,
02:37 - but then you'd be like,
02:37 - okay well that tells me how far across,
02:39 - but how about how far up and down?
02:41 - So then I could give you another number,
02:43 - let's say maybe like 200,
02:45 - and I would say, okay well
this is the top, this is zero.
02:47 - And again we'll just say that
the bottom that's gonna be 400
02:50 - and you would think, okay.
02:52 - Well 200, that's gonna be
right in the middle here.
02:56 - And that's perfect.
02:56 - Because now you think and you say,
02:58 - okay great, I'm gonna draw
you a rectangle right here.
03:00 - Because it's 100 across and it's 200 down.
03:04 - Except that's still not enough.
03:05 - 'Cause now what are you asking?
03:07 - Right.
03:08 - You're wondering how big
do you want the rectangle?
03:10 - And I would say, well about how like,
03:13 - I don't know, like 150 wide.
03:14 - And you'd think, okay well
this is 100, and this 400.
03:19 - So if we want it to be 150 wide,
03:21 - maybe we're gonna go to like here?
03:23 - And you think like okay,
cool, 150 wide, about.
03:26 - And then you'd say, okay
well how tall do you want it?
03:28 - And I'd say, oh not very tall.
03:30 - How about like 50 tall?
03:31 - You'd be like, okay.
03:32 - Well 50, maybe that's gonna
be about like that tall?
03:35 - And then you would go ahead and be like,
03:36 - awesome, I know exactly where
you want your rectangle,
03:39 - exactly what it should look like,
03:40 - I'll just go ahead and draw it.
03:43 - And that's a lot of work
for a rectangle, isn't it?
03:46 - But the idea is just by
giving you those four numbers,
03:48 - remember we said 100 across, 200 down,
03:51 - 150 wide, and then just 50 tall.
03:56 - We now are exactly on the same page
03:57 - about what this rectangle
should look like.
04:00 - And that's actually how
the computer works too.
04:02 - You can just write the command
name like we said earlier,
04:04 - write the open parentheses,
04:06 - and then add in these four numbers,
04:08 - 100, 200, 150, and then 50,
04:12 - the close parentheses
and then a semicolon.
04:14 - And it'll draw a rectangle
exactly where we wanted it to be.
04:17 - Well, I guess if we're
honest with ourselves,
04:20 - that's not really where
we wanted the rectangle.
04:22 - I mean, it's not where we drew it, right?
04:23 - So our numbers are a little bit off.
04:25 - So let's go ahead and say, okay,
04:27 - we want it to really match
exactly what we drew.
04:29 - So we'll move this so it's
a little bit further over,
04:32 - a little bit less up and down,
04:35 - and then a little bit skinnier,
04:37 - and then maybe like a tiny bit less tall.
04:40 - And now we have it that our rectangle
04:42 - pretty much exactly matches what we drew,
04:44 - because we understood what
each of these numbers meant
04:46 - and we could just change it
so it looked like we want to.
04:50 - Alright, so now let's think
about drawing another rectangle,
04:53 - because of the beauty of this is
04:54 - we can draw rectangles
wherever we want now.
04:57 - So how about we wanna draw all
the way in this upper corner,
05:00 - all the way up there.
05:01 - So let's think of where that would be.
05:04 - Well I guess that would
be like zero across,
05:06 - zero up and down, and
then maybe, I don't know,
05:08 - a pretty small, let's
say just like 50 wide
05:11 - and maybe just like, I
don't know, like 10 tall.
05:13 - Like a pretty small rectangle, right?
05:15 - So we can just go ahead and do that.
05:16 - We'll type rect.
05:17 - And then separating these
parameters with commas,
05:19 - we'll just go ahead and
be like, alright cool.
05:23 - Well, not so cool because
we have this error message
05:26 - saying, oh no, it looks
like you're missing
05:27 - a closing parentheses, and
we're like, oh yeah we are.
05:29 - So phew, put it back in.
05:31 - And it's great, right?
05:32 - Well, not so great because
now we have another message
05:34 - saying we have a missing semicolon.
05:36 - This one is also correct.
05:37 - We could just press show me where
05:38 - and it would point to
the line we just wrote.
05:40 - And we just remember, oh yeah,
05:41 - semicolons are like periods
at the ends of the sentences
05:44 - to end our lines, and we forgot one.
05:46 - But we can just put it back, no big deal,
05:48 - and everything is good again.
05:50 - And check it out.
05:51 - A tiny little rectangle
exactly like we wanted.
05:53 - And just like before, we can
grow it so that it's bigger
05:56 - and we can move it around
05:58 - and we can just position it
exactly where we want it to be.
06:01 - So now you know in detail exactly
how this rect thing works.
06:04 - We covered what these numbers mean
06:06 - and how you always need
to put the command name,
06:09 - the parentheses, how the
commas separate the numbers,
06:11 - and then the semicolon at the end.
06:13 - It seems like a lot, but you can go ahead
06:14 - and try it for yourself
and get a feel for it.
06:17 - Next time, we'll learn
about making more shapes.
06:19 - And then we'll move on to awesome things
06:21 - like making them colorful
06:22 - and having them fly around the screen.
