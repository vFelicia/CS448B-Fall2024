00:01 - - [Voiceover] In our
previous talk-through,
00:02 - we wrote this code here
00:04 - to change all of the 'h1s' on the page.
00:08 - Now what if we wanted to change
00:09 - all of the paragraphs instead?
00:13 - We can do that by just
changing 'h1' to 'p'
00:16 - and then presto!
00:17 - They all changed.
00:19 - As you can see, in order to change
00:21 - which elements get affected
by the 'text' method,
00:24 - we just change what we
pass in to this function.
00:29 - Now what do we actually pass in there?
00:31 - Well we need to pass in something,
00:33 - some string that looks
like a CSS selector.
00:38 - Now, do you all actually
still remember CSS selectors?
00:43 - If not, this is a good time to go back
00:46 - and review them,
00:47 - because we will be using them a lot here.
00:50 - Here, I will write a few CSS
rules at the top to remind you.
00:55 - So we already have this CSS rule
00:57 - for changing the body, font, and color.
01:00 - Now, if I want all the
paragraphs to be red,
01:03 - I'd use this rule:
01:05 - 'p { color: red; }'
01:08 - So 'p' is a selector that selects
01:10 - all the paragraphs on the page.
01:12 - So down in the JavaScript,
01:14 - 'p' is the string that I pass
into the jQuery function.
01:22 - Now, I'm going to add another CSS rule
01:25 - to make the top headline purple.
01:29 - To make sure that I only
select the top headline
01:32 - and none of the other 'h1s',
01:35 - I have to identify it by id.
01:38 - That means that I start my
selector with pound sign,
01:42 - and then I type the id, 'main-heading'
01:46 - and then
01:48 - I'll put my property, make it purple.
01:51 - Yay!
01:53 - All right. So in CSS,
01:54 - anytime we start something
with a pound sign,
01:57 - it means that we're
identifying an element by id.
02:02 - Now I'm gonna go down to my JavaScript,
02:05 - start a new call to jQuery
02:08 - and pass in that same
selector: 'main-heading',
02:11 - starting with that pound sign,
02:13 - and then set some text.
02:15 - "jQuery?
02:17 - "More like YAY-QUERY!"
02:20 - All right.
02:22 - Great. Now it's purple
02:24 - and it has that new text.
02:26 - Okay. Let's do one more example.
02:29 - So let's say I want to change
all of my 'note' paragraphs
02:33 - and make them have a
yellow background color.
02:36 - So let's do that in CSS.
02:39 - Now the thing that distinguishes them
02:41 - is they have a class name of 'note'.
02:44 - So, I need to start my CSS rule with a dot
02:48 - and then write the class name
02:50 - and then I can do my property.
02:53 - So that 'dot' means we're
selecting by class name.
02:57 - So now, back down to our JavaScript,
03:00 - start a new jQuery call:
03:02 - (".note").text
03:07 - ("NOTE: jQuery has been known
03:10 - to cause EXTREME JOY!")
03:15 - All right. So, thanks to jQuery,
03:18 - we've almost completely changed
03:20 - the text of this web page.
03:23 - Now normally, you'd be
changing your web page
03:26 - in response to some user
interaction, like a click,
03:29 - but we'll cover that later.
03:31 - For now, just focus on
what the techniques are
03:35 - for changing the page.
03:38 - One thing to know about this technique
03:39 - is that you can pass any CSS selector
03:42 - into that jQuery function,
03:44 - even long, complex ones.
03:46 - If it works in CSS rules,
03:48 - it should work in jQuery.
03:50 - Try it out in the next challenge.
