00:00 - - When we write code,
we're writing in a language
00:03 - that a computer can understand.
00:04 - Now fellow programmers can
also understand that language
00:08 - but it's not our native language
00:10 - and honestly, some code just looks weird.
00:13 - And sometimes you'll look at code
00:14 - and you'll think, what?
00:16 - And you wish that you had
the original code creator
00:19 - there to explain it to you.
00:20 - Well luckily, that's
where comments come in.
00:24 - A comment is just a bit
of text in our program
00:27 - that the computer completely ignores
00:29 - and is just there for
other humans to look at,
00:33 - like you and me?
00:34 - You are human, right?
00:36 - In JavaScript, we write
a single line comment
00:39 - by starting the line with two slashes
00:41 - and everything comes after
we consider a comment
00:44 - until there's a new line, right?
00:46 - And we can write anything
00:48 - in whatever language we want.
00:53 - And we can have a little
comment part here, right?
00:56 - Keep going, going, going, going.
00:58 - So that's cool but if our
comment gets really long,
01:01 - you might wanna actually do
01:02 - what's called a multi-line comment.
01:04 - So to do that we start off
with a slash and a star
01:08 - and you know maybe I'll write a poem here.
01:10 - So roses are red, next line.
01:13 - Violets are blue.
01:15 - Comments are cool,
01:17 - and so are you.
01:20 - Very nice.
01:22 - Notice how our comments
are both colored green.
01:24 - That's good, that's a
sign that the program
01:26 - knows it's a comment, it colors it green.
01:28 - But notice how everything
else is green too.
01:32 - That means that we've managed to turn
01:33 - our entire program into a comment
01:36 - which is bad because we
want our program to be code.
01:40 - And we also get an error here
that says unclosed comment.
01:43 - So all these signs mean that uh-oh,
01:44 - I started multi-line comment
and I didn't finish it.
01:47 - No problem, just do a star and a slash.
01:51 - That'll finish the comment
01:52 - and everything will be beautiful again.
01:55 - Alright so back to the point.
01:58 - Comments are not just for me to write
01:59 - ridiculous things or amazing poetry.
02:02 - They're a way for us to describe
our code to other humans
02:06 - because we want them to
understand it as well as we did.
02:09 - So for example, let's
look at a cool program.
02:14 - This is a bouncing ball program, right?
02:18 - And it's a pretty cool program
and it's the kind of program
02:20 - that I'd really like
to modify and spin off
02:23 - and do my own thing with
because there's a lot of things
02:25 - I can imagine doing
with this bouncing ball.
02:27 - Right, maybe turning
into a bouncing penguin.
02:30 - But when I look at the code
I don't quite understand it.
02:32 - There's a lot of math
going on and I'm not sure
02:35 - what it's calculating
and where it's getting
02:36 - these formulas from.
02:38 - So if I wanted to understand it,
02:39 - I'd have to go through line by line
02:41 - and tinker things and
try and figure it out.
02:45 - Now what would happen if it
was written with comments?
02:51 - Ta-da, magic.
02:53 - So now we have the same
program with comments.
02:55 - So you can see how the
program starts off with this
02:58 - general comment at the top
that describes the purpose
03:01 - of the program and then
throughout the program
03:04 - there's these single line
comments that describe things
03:06 - like what these variables are,
03:09 - like the initial variables
are the time and the height.
03:11 - And then we got three
lines of comments about
03:14 - this formula here because
it's really important
03:16 - because this is what determines
the y position of the ball.
03:19 - And here we can see it's
actually calculating
03:20 - this parabola based on
velocity and acceleration.
03:23 - So now that I see this comment,
it's actually really easy
03:26 - for me to change this code
here and say, oh okay,
03:28 - well what happens if we gave the ball
03:31 - higher initial velocity?
03:32 - Huh huh, well it's gonna
go a lot higher, awesome.
03:35 - So you can see that as soon
as I saw comments in the code,
03:39 - I was able to understand
the program much faster
03:42 - and modify it much more easily.
03:45 - So they're cool, right?
03:47 - Now let's just go over what the nice parts
03:50 - about comments are and why you should be
03:52 - doing them in your code.
03:53 - Alright, so first of all, if
you put comments in your code,
03:56 - you'll help other people
learn from your code
03:59 - and that's something
that we're really into
04:01 - here at Khan Academy, right?
04:03 - Second of all, if you put
comments in your code,
04:05 - you make it easier for
other people to fix bugs
04:08 - in your code or add new features.
04:09 - And that's something you
probably want too, right?
04:11 - If somebody sees something in
your program and they think,
04:13 - "Oh it would be really
cool if it did this",
04:15 - and if they actually
understood your program,
04:16 - they can actually add that and say like,
04:18 - "Hey I took your program and I added it"
04:20 - and then you can, you
know, have a better program
04:22 - because of that, so that's really cool.
04:26 - But you don't just have to have comments
04:28 - when you're working with other people.
04:29 - Even when you're working with yourself
04:31 - because you're a human too.
04:33 - So if you write comments in
your code, you'll make it
04:34 - much easier for yourself to
understand your own code.
04:37 - And you might think to
yourself right now that
04:39 - oh, you understand your code perfectly,
04:41 - but trust me, just wait a month,
04:43 - wait a year, wait 15 years.
04:45 - You're gonna look at your
code and you're gonna think,
04:48 - what, what did I do?
04:50 - And you're gonna wish that you
wrote comments in your code.
04:53 - So just comment your code now
04:54 - and it'll help you and
it'll help everybody else.
04:58 - So hopefully that's
convinced you to comment
05:00 - and now you might be asking like okay,
05:01 - when should I comment?
05:03 - You know, where should I
put comments in my code?
05:06 - What line should I comment?
05:07 - So that's a really good question
05:10 - and there's no right or wrong answer.
05:13 - What I would do is start off
at the beginning of the program
05:16 - and do this general description
of the program here, right?
05:19 - And then I would go through
the program and pretend
05:21 - that I was explaining it to
someone, and if I got to a line
05:24 - that wasn't obvious, I
might add a comment there
05:27 - to try and explain it more.
05:29 - So you don't have to comment
every line in this program.
05:32 - You just comment the things that you think
05:34 - might not be obvious, right?
05:37 - And everyone will be a lot
happier because of that.
05:40 - So go forth, comment!
