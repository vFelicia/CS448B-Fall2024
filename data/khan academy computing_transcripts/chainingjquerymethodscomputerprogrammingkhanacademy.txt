00:01 - - [Voiceover] I keep
talking about how jQuery
00:02 - lets you write less code,
00:05 - but it might not seem that way yet
00:07 - because I've been writing jQuery
00:09 - in a pretty verbose way.
00:12 - For example, do you remember this code?
00:15 - It creates a new paragraph, sets a text,
00:18 - adds a class name,
00:20 - and then appends it to the 'body'.
00:23 - It actually takes as many lines of code
00:25 - as it would take without jQuery,
00:28 - but we can make it shorter, if we want,
00:31 - by using a technique we call chaining.
00:35 - Here, I'll show you.
00:37 - So, take this
00:41 - and then call the text on it
00:45 - and then I'll add the class name
00:50 - and then finally,
00:52 - I will append it to the 'body'.
00:56 - There we go.
00:57 - I just did the same thing
in one line of code.
01:01 - Amazing.
01:02 - I can do that with jQuery
01:04 - because most jQuery methods
01:06 - return the jQuery collection object,
01:08 - which means that I can
call another jQuery method
01:12 - on the return value.
01:13 - So, explain that again.
01:16 - This here makes end returns
a jQuery collection.
01:21 - Then, 'text' takes that collection
01:25 - and sets the text of the elements inside
01:27 - and returns a collection.
01:30 - So 'addClass' takes that collection,
01:32 - adds a class name to the elements inside
01:35 - and returns that collection again.
01:38 - And finally, 'appendTo'
01:41 - takes the elements inside the collection
01:43 - and appends it to the 'body' tag.
01:47 - So, that's how that works.
01:48 - Now notice that I use
'appendTo' instead of 'append'.
01:53 - I needed to do that
01:55 - because the 'append' method
01:57 - expects to be called on the
element we want to append to,
02:03 - not on the element that we want appended.
02:05 - The 'appendTo' method
02:07 - expects to be called on
the element to append
02:11 - and then it takes a parameter
02:12 - that tells jQuery where to append it to.
02:16 - So, the lesson there is
that if you use chaining,
02:20 - you have to think about your
functions, inputs and outputs,
02:23 - and whether your chain
of methods make sense.
02:27 - Now, I find that a single line
02:30 - of multiple chained method calls
02:32 - is a bit hard to read,
02:35 - so I like to make my code
a bit cleaner like this.
02:44 - Beautiful.
02:45 - I have not saved on lines
of code by doing this.
02:48 - This is the same number of lines of code
02:49 - as the non-chained version,
02:52 - but I have saved on
unnecessary variable creation
02:56 - and I think I have made
my code pretty readable.
03:01 - Remember that the goal of writing code
03:03 - isn't always to do it in the
fewest lines of code possible.
03:07 - It's also to write your code
03:09 - in a way that makes sense to yourself
03:12 - and anybody else who might look
at your code in the future,
03:16 - including your future selves.
03:19 - And let me tell you,
03:20 - your future selves can
get really critical.
03:24 - It's up to you
03:25 - if you want to chain your
jQuery methods or not,
03:28 - but regardless, you'll need
to get used to reading code
03:31 - that looks like this,
03:32 - because you'll probably encounter
code that uses chaining.
03:36 - I personally find it a
little weird at first,
03:38 - so, don't worry if you find it weird too.
