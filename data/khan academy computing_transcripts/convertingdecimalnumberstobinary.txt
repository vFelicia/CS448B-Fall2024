00:00 - - [Instructor] Let's try to
convert the decimal number six,
00:04 - from decimal to binary,
00:06 - I'm gonna show you my
favorite way of doing it.
00:09 - So I started off by writing
dashes for the bits.
00:15 - I'm gonna start off with eight dashes,
00:18 - representing the eight bits or one byte,
00:22 - even though we probably
don't need all of these
00:24 - for such a small number.
00:26 - And then I'm going to write the values
00:28 - of each of these places.
00:30 - So this first bit, this is
the ones place or two to zero.
00:34 - The second bit is the
twos place, two to one.
00:40 - The third bit is the
fours place, two squared.
00:45 - And then we have eights place, 16s place,
00:48 - you see we just double, 32s
place, 64s place and 128s place.
00:55 - Okay, now that we have these places,
00:59 - I start on the left side, and
I look at the place and I say,
01:03 - is this value greater than this value?
01:07 - 128 is greater than that value,
01:10 - so we're gonna put a zero here,
01:13 - because we do not need to
represent the value 128
01:16 - inside this tiny little number.
01:20 - 64 is also greater than six,
01:23 - 32 also greater than six,
01:26 - 16 is also greater, eight is also greater,
01:30 - so we've got a whole lot of zeros so far.
01:33 - Four is not greater than six.
01:37 - So we're finally going to put a one.
01:41 - And then what we're gonna do
is subtract four from six.
01:45 - So six minus four equals two.
01:50 - So that's the remaining value
01:52 - that we still need to represent.
01:56 - And we go to the next one.
01:57 - This is the twos place, two
is not greater than two,
02:02 - it's actually exactly equal to two.
02:04 - So we're going to put a one as well.
02:09 - And now subtract again,
two minus two equals zero,
02:15 - we fix that, two minus two is zero,
02:17 - there's nothing left to represent,
02:19 - we have entirely represented
the value six already.
02:23 - So that means we can put a
zero in this remaining place.
02:27 - So now we can say this is how
to represent six in binary.
02:32 - The full byte would look like this,
02:34 - or we might shorten it to just four bits.
02:37 - Or we might even shorten it to just three,
02:41 - but we typically do like present bits
02:43 - in groupings of four or eight.
02:46 - Now let's try a bigger number.
02:49 - So let's erase all this work here.
02:53 - I wanna keep my place values around
02:57 - because those are handy and
they're gonna be the same,
02:59 - and just erase everything
else, okay, good enough.
03:03 - All right, so let's
try the value 25, okay?
03:09 - 25 decimal, how do we
convert that to binary?
03:13 - So once again we start over here,
03:14 - is 128 greater than 25?
03:17 - Yes it is, put a zero.
03:19 - 64 is greater, put a zero.
03:22 - 32 also greater, we'll put a zero.
03:25 - 16 is not greater than 25,
so 16 is contained within 25.
03:31 - We'll put a one and then do a little math
03:34 - to figure out what we
still need to represent.
03:36 - So 25 minus 16 equals four
and five, that's nine.
03:42 - All right, so we still need
to represent the value nine
03:46 - in these remaining bits, okay?
03:49 - The next place value is the eights place.
03:53 - Eight is not greater than nine.
03:55 - So that means we are going to
need to use the eights place,
03:59 - we'll put a one in there.
04:01 - So now we have nine
minus eight equals one.
04:08 - All right, there's only one more thing
04:12 - that we have to represent.
04:13 - So we've already represented 24, right?
04:16 - Here we're looking at
having represented 24.
04:18 - If we filled the rest of zeros right now,
04:20 - we'd have the number 24,
but we're looking for 25.
04:23 - So we keep going, is
four greater than one?
04:26 - Yes, so we'll put a zero.
04:28 - Two is greater than one, we'll put a zero.
04:30 - One is equal to one, so
we will put a one here.
04:35 - So here we have the decimal
number 25 in binary.
04:40 - So this required one, two,
three, four five bits,
04:43 - so we would probably represent
it in a byte like this.
04:48 - So this is the basic strategy
04:50 - that I use for converting
numbers from decimal to binary
04:54 - and this will work for numbers up to 255
04:59 - using these eight bits here.
05:02 - Beyond that, you're
going to need more bits.
05:04 - And honestly, at that point,
05:05 - you might wanna just use a calculator
05:07 - or write a program to do it.
