00:00 - - [Voiceover] We're back with the webpage
00:02 - that links the list of famous paintings.
00:04 - The CSS starts with a rule
that sets the font family
00:09 - for everything in the body to sans-serif.
00:11 - Then a rule of group selectors
that changes the font family,
00:15 - the h1s, and h2s.
00:17 - Then we have a bunch of rules
00:20 - that you probably haven't seen before.
00:22 - It might look a bit funny.
00:24 - They all start with a and then a colon,
00:28 - and then a word.
00:29 - What does that colon mean?
00:32 - Look at those rules be selecting for.
00:36 - Well all of those things
that start with a colon
00:38 - are called pseudo classes.
00:40 - A pseudo class is used to select elements
00:43 - based on information
that's not really part
00:46 - of the webpage structure.
00:47 - Or just can't be expressed
using other selectors.
00:51 - In this page, I'm using pseudo
classes to style the links
00:55 - based on their state.
00:57 - The link pseudo class will
select all the links on the page
01:01 - that the user has not visited yet,
01:03 - which most browsers default to blue.
01:06 - The visited pseudo class
will select all the links
01:09 - that the user has visited,
01:10 - which most browsers default to purple.
01:13 - If we really want, we
can change the colors
01:15 - but you should have a good
reason for doing that.
01:18 - People get used to
associating blue and purple
01:20 - with things they have and haven't seen
01:22 - and people like knowing
which pages they visited,
01:25 - so you should not take that
away without a good reason.
01:28 - So I'm just gonna delete this two rules
01:31 - because I don't think it's
personally a good idea
01:32 - to be messing with them.
01:35 - The next rule is a fun one though.
01:37 - a hover, the hover pseudo class
01:40 - will select an element as long as the user
01:43 - is currently mousing over it
01:45 - so the properties will
only get applied then.
01:48 - Try pausing this talk through now
01:50 - and hover over the links
to see what happens.
01:53 - Go ahead, I'll wait, hover, hover, hover.
01:57 - Did you see that background change color?
01:59 - It's a pretty cool effect
02:01 - and you can actually use
that hover pseudo class
02:03 - on any element, not just links.
02:04 - Just remember that it
won't work for all devices,
02:07 - like if you're on a phone, you
don't have a way of hovering,
02:09 - you just have touch or no touch.
02:11 - It's great to have a
hover effect as a bonus
02:13 - but don't rely on it.
02:16 - What about this last two here?
02:18 - They're similar to hover.
02:20 - They depend on what the
user's currently doing.
02:22 - The active pseudo class let's elements
02:25 - that are currently being activated.
02:27 - Like for a link, if the user's currently
02:29 - pressing down on the link,
02:31 - right before they actually change pages.
02:34 - The focus pseudo class, selects elements
02:36 - that currently have the focus
02:38 - which usually happens
if you use your Tab key
02:40 - to tab around the interface.
02:42 - Pause the talk through
now and try pressing down
02:44 - on the links and tabbing around them
02:46 - and see what happens.
02:48 - Did you see the background
change color when you did that?
02:51 - I chose the same property
for hover active and focus
02:54 - because they're all
sort of the same thing.
02:56 - The user is targeting the link somehow.
02:58 - Many web designers use the same properties
03:00 - across all three states for that reason.
03:04 - What if I decide I wanna change
the color of the background?
03:07 - Well, I can either go into each of them
03:09 - and change each one of them
03:12 - or I could do what we just learned,
03:15 - I can group the selectors
by putting them all
03:17 - into one rule separated by commas.
03:19 - I would just put our comma after here
03:22 - and say a active, then a focus.
03:27 - Now, I can delete these two
03:30 - and change all three of those
03:34 - at once, nice.
03:38 - These are the first pseudo
classes we've shown you here
03:40 - but they're not the only ones,
03:41 - you can search for CSS pseudo
classes on the internet
03:44 - to find out about others.
03:45 - Or wait for us to teach more here.
