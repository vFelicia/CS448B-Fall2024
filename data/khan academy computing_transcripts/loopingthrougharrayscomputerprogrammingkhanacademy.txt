00:01 - We're back with a program that prints out my array of friends.
00:04 - But there's something that really annoys me about it.
00:07 - Every time I add a new friend to the array, I have to add a new text command down here.
00:11 - So let's say I add Winston.
00:13 - Well, he doesn't automatically show up.
00:15 - If I want him to show up, I have to go and say 'text(myFriends[3]', and then change the y position and then we see Winston.
00:23 - So that's way too much work.
00:25 - I just want it so that every time I add someone else to the array, it does the text command automatically.
00:31 - Well, do you remember when we learned loops?
00:34 - Loops were a great way to repeat the same bit of code many times in a row.
00:38 - Like, if we wanted to have a bunch of trees in a row or a bunch of balloons.
00:43 - Well, as it turns out, loops are also a great way to run a bit of code on each element in an array.
00:49 - In fact, you'll use a loop almost every time you use an array. They work really well together.
00:57 - So lets use a loop to display my friends' names, instead of having all these text commands, to show you what I mean.
01:03 - So well start with the three questions we always ask ourselves when we're making a loop.
01:07 - First, what do I want to repeat? Well, look up here. What's repeated? The text command.
01:13 - What do I want to change each time? Well, let me just look and see what's different. The y position and the current index, right? So the friend num and the y position.
01:26 - And how long should we repeat? Well, we keep going until there are no more friends.
01:33 - So now we know what we want, and we can make our loop.
01:37 - We start off with a counter variable to keep track of where we are in the loop. So we'll say 'var friendNum = 0;'
01:44 - We're going to start with zero because remember that 0 is the first element in the array, not 1.
01:50 - Then we have our while loop. So we'll say 'while(friendNum < my friends.length)'.
01:57 - So we're gonna compare the current counter variable to the total number of things in the array.
02:04 - Inside the loop, that's where we use our text command.
02:08 - So we say, 'text(myFriends[' - and then here, instead of a number, we're gonna put 'friendNum' because friendNum represents the current number.
02:13 - And then we'll just put one position for now.
02:17 - This has given us a little infinite loop error because we haven't actually changed anything about friendNum.
02:25 - Remember, we need to increment friendNum each time, otherwise the loop will go on forever because that condition's always true.
02:34 - I see something happened. Let me comment out the old code so I can really see what's happened.
02:39 - What we have is we've showed all the names, but they're all on top of each other.
02:43 - So, we need to change our y position.
02:45 - Let's just say 'friendNum*30'.
02:50 - Ok that's good but Sophia's off the screen and Sophia's not going to be very happy if she finds that out.
02:55 - So, let's just add 30 to that. So now they're all offset by 30.
02:59 - Beautiful! So now you see we have a loop displaying our array.
03:04 - And that means if we add more people like OhNoesGuy, or maybe even Sal, if I just add him to the array then Sal will be my friend. Awesome! Now he's my buddy.
03:13 - An you see that it just automatically shows the new friends because it's always going through the whole array.
03:21 - So we can delete our old code. We don't need that anymore.
03:24 - And let's just go through this code here and review what it does.
03:28 - So we start off with friendNum equal to zero.
03:31 - We check to see if friendNum is less than the current length.
03:34 - So you imagine zero is less than six. That's true.
03:37 - So then we go inside here and we say text, my freinds friendNum.
03:41 - So that'll become zero, the first time.
03:44 - And then 30 plus zero times 30.
03:47 - So it displays Sophia at 10 and 30. That's what it does.
03:53 - And then friendNum++. So then it becomes 1.
03:56 - And then it goes back around and says, "Ok, is 1 less than myFriends.length? Yeah, it is."
04:00 - And it keeps going, keeps going, keeps going.
04:02 - And then finally we get to Sal. Remember, Sal is actually the sixth element in the array, but he's index 5, since we start at zero.
04:11 - So, is five less than six? Yes.
04:13 - So it diplays myFriends five.
04:15 - And then it becomes six and we say, "Is six less than six?" No. It's equal.
04:21 - So this'll be false. So it will never display the sixth element,
04:25 - which is good because there is nothing in index six.
04:29 - There's a sixth element, but nothing in index six.
04:32 - it can be really confusing, the fact that it's zero and one and doing all that but you'll get the hang of it.
04:38 - All right, so that's our loop.
04:41 - Now, if you want to, you can actually use a for loop as well if you prefer for loops.
04:45 - For for loops, we'll just say, 'for,' and then, 'var friendNum = 0;' and then we have our condition
04:52 - 'friendNum < myFriends.length'
04:57 - and then our increment: 'friendNum++'
05:01 - and then inside the for loop, we can just put just this line of code here.
05:06 - and i'll just change the x so that you can see
05:09 - it does exactly the same thing. So it's up to you which one you use, but the point is to use a loop with your arrays because it will make you so powerful.
