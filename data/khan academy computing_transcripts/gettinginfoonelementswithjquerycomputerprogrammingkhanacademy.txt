00:00 - - [Voiceover] In the last talk-through,
00:02 - I showed how we can use jQuery
00:04 - to find the elements in a web page
00:07 - and then do something to them.
00:09 - Sometimes we actually use jQuery
00:12 - to find out things about the elements,
00:15 - like what text is currently inside them,
00:18 - and that's what I'll show here.
00:21 - Currently, this line of code
00:22 - completely replaces the main heading text.
00:26 - Now what if instead of
replacing that text completely,
00:29 - we want it to surround
the existing headline
00:32 - with exclamation marks?
00:35 - Well, let's just do that.
00:38 - The first thing we wanna find out
00:40 - is "What is currently
inside that heading?"
00:44 - And we wanna store that
inside of variable.
00:46 - So 'headingText ='
00:49 - and then I'm going to
call the jQuery function,
00:52 - pass in that selector 'main-heading'
00:55 - and then call the 'text' function,
00:59 - empty parenthesis.
01:01 - All right. Now when we call
'text' on a jQuery object,
01:06 - it returns the inner text of
all of the selected elements.
01:10 - This line of code only
happens to select one element,
01:14 - but if it had selected multiple elements,
01:16 - then it would return all of the text
01:18 - of all of the selected
elements in one long string.
01:23 - Now, good thing to do is
to console.log this value
01:27 - to see what it contains.
01:29 - See 'headingText'.
01:31 - All right. So now, pause the talk-through
01:33 - and open your developer console
01:36 - to see the value for yourself.
01:40 - All right. So now, now that
we know what the text is,
01:44 - let's set the 'text' to that 'text',
01:48 - but with exclamation marks.
01:50 - So we're going to use jQuery again
01:53 - to find the heading
01:55 - then use that 'text' function,
01:57 - and this time, we're gonna
pass in some exclamation marks.
02:00 - Good, we got those.
02:02 - And then we're gonna concatenate that
02:04 - with that variable we found.
02:06 - Aha, we've got our title back,
02:07 - and then, more exclamation marks.
02:10 - Very nice. We now have
a more excited version
02:13 - of our original title.
02:15 - And we're only able to do that
02:16 - 'cause we found out what that
heading originally contained.
02:21 - Now notice, we are using the same method
02:25 - to set the 'text' as to get the 'text'.
02:30 - The difference is that we
passed it zero argument
02:33 - when we wanted it to return the 'text'
02:35 - and we passed it one argument
02:37 - when we wanted it to change the 'text'.
02:40 - You will see that a lot in jQuery.
02:43 - The same function behaving different ways
02:45 - depending on what you pass into it.
02:48 - So pay careful attention
02:50 - to the parameters that you pass in.
02:52 - Now there are other
things you can find out
02:54 - about the elements on your page too,
02:56 - like their size, CSS styles, lots more.
03:00 - And it will get pretty useful later.
03:03 - It may not seem obvious
how it's useful now,
03:06 - but later when we do more manipulation
03:08 - based on what you find out,
it will be super useful.
03:11 - So file this away in your jQuery toolbox.
