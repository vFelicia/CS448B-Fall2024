00:01 - - [Voiceover] Today I want to talk about
00:02 - making your code easier to read.
00:04 - First let's talk about what it means
00:05 - to make a human language easier to read.
00:08 - The languages that we speak every day
00:09 - have lots of rules, but they also have
00:11 - lots of flexibility,
00:12 - especially when we write them down.
00:14 - Like if I'm being really lazy one day,
00:16 - I could write this.
00:18 - Now you can read that sentence
00:19 - and eventually figure it out,
00:23 - but you have to figure
out where the periods
00:24 - go and it takes time.
00:26 - Now what would happen if
we cleaned it up a bit?
00:29 - Ta-da.
00:31 - Okay, so you agree that
that's a lot easier
00:34 - to understand, right?
00:35 - Now imagine if everybody wrote like
00:37 - this first sentence and we constantly had
00:39 - to read everything multiple times
00:41 - just to figure out how it flowed.
00:43 - It'd be really painful, right?
00:45 - It's the same thing with
programming languages.
00:48 - They have a lot of rules and they're
00:49 - more strict than human languages,
00:51 - but they can also be
written in confusing ways.
00:54 - For example, this code here is valid code
00:58 - and it runs and it's a cool program,
01:00 - but man, it's really
hard to read as a human.
01:04 - So what would you do to
make it easier to read?
01:06 - A few things.
01:08 - The first thing we'd do is we'd move
01:09 - every statement onto its own line.
01:12 - Like this.
01:13 - Now that makes it a little easier to read,
01:15 - but there's still a lot more we can do.
01:17 - So the next thing we want to do
01:18 - is indent the code properly.
01:21 - Now in human languages like English,
01:22 - we indent to help us understand
01:24 - the structure of writing.
01:25 - Like when we indent the first sentence
01:26 - of a paragraph or indent a quote.
01:28 - It's the same thing with code.
01:29 - We indent in order to show
the structure of the code.
01:32 - Let me see.
01:33 - Okay, so let's go through this
01:36 - and see how indentation helps
01:37 - to understand the structure.
01:39 - When we talk about structure,
01:40 - we mean functions, and for, and ifs.
01:42 - So here inside this function you can see
01:45 - that we indent the first statement
01:47 - inside this function
because we want to show
01:49 - that it's inside this function.
01:51 - It's like a child of this function.
01:52 - It's only going to be called
if this function's called.
01:55 - All right.
01:56 - And then we have this for loop
01:58 - and everything inside an for loop
02:00 - is indented twice because
we're trying to show
02:02 - that this is all inside the for loop.
02:04 - It's all shown under the for loop.
02:06 - It's only going to be executed
02:07 - when we go through the for loop.
02:08 - And then finally inside the if,
02:10 - we indent things three times
02:13 - because we're trying to show that they're
02:14 - a child of the if blocks.
02:16 - They're only going to be executed
02:17 - if this if condition is true.
02:20 - So by using indentation,
we can really understand
02:22 - the structure of the program better.
02:24 - Now the cool thing is that your editor
02:26 - will help you with indentation.
02:28 - So if I go and put this on this line
02:31 - and then I just press enter,
02:33 - you see how it just automatically goes
02:35 - and is indented one thing,
02:37 - just like we wanted.
02:38 - So as long as the editor
is working correctly,
02:41 - you should actually have
correctly indented code.
02:43 - So that's pretty cool.
02:45 - All right, so our program
looks pretty good now,
02:47 - but there's still more we can do
02:49 - to improve readability.
02:51 - I'll give you a hint by showing
02:52 - this English sentence before and after.
02:55 - See these two sentences?
02:58 - They're really similar, the only thing
02:59 - that's different is that
we added some white space
03:01 - in between punctuation and letters.
03:03 - That little bit of white space
03:05 - actually made it a lot more readable.
03:07 - So once again, it's the
same thing with our code.
03:10 - If we just add white space at good points,
03:13 - our code becomes more readable.
03:15 - So here it is with white space.
03:17 - So we added space in between all our
03:19 - function arguments, we
added space on either side
03:23 - of the equals sign when we were assigning
03:25 - variables to things, and we added space
03:28 - around operators like less than,
03:30 - and greater than, and times,
03:33 - and we also added space
before our curly brackets.
03:38 - And that's it.
03:39 - So now when you look at our code,
03:41 - I hope you agree it's quite beautiful
03:42 - and it's really much easier to understand,
03:45 - and you don't have to read through it
03:47 - quite as many times, right?
03:49 - And hey, what I've learned
is that cleaning code
03:51 - is actually a lot more fun and easier
03:53 - than cleaning the room and
it doesn't get dirty again.
03:56 - So it's pretty cool and you should
03:57 - try it out with your programs.
