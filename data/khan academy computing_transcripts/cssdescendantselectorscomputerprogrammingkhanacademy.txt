00:00 - - [Voiceover] Let's move on from doughnuts
00:02 - to carrots, one of the
healthiest foods in the world,
00:05 - plus the favorite food of rabbits.
00:07 - Did you know that carrots
aren't just orange?
00:10 - They were actually originally purple,
00:12 - and some of them still are today.
00:13 - We have this short
webpage here with a list
00:15 - of carrot colors and a sentence
00:17 - about their purple origins.
00:19 - We've used classes to
style the color names
00:23 - to the appropriate color.
00:25 - I like how the styles look in a list,
00:27 - but I'm not sure I like
how the purple style
00:30 - looks in the text.
00:31 - I think I'd rather not
use a background color,
00:34 - and go for a more subtle coloring there.
00:36 - How could I tell the browser to style
00:38 - the purple text here differently than
00:41 - the purple text here?
00:43 - Well they have the same class names
00:46 - so we can't use class unless we introduce
00:47 - a new class name.
00:49 - They also have the same tag name.
00:51 - They're both strongs.
00:53 - So we can't use the
element plus class name
00:56 - selector that we just learned.
00:58 - Is there anything else
different about them?
01:00 - Well one thing is that this strong is
01:04 - inside an li, whereas this strong is
01:08 - inside a p.
01:11 - So the difference is their parent tags,
01:13 - the tags that are above them.
01:15 - We can use this information to make
01:17 - a CSS rule using what's called
01:19 - a descendant selector, a
way of selecting elements
01:22 - based on their position in the document.
01:25 - For example, to select
only the purple strong
01:29 - inside the paragraph,
we'll write p and then
01:33 - a space, the space is really important,
01:36 - and then the class name, .purple,
01:40 - and now we'll add our
properties that will give us
01:43 - the more subtle coloring.
01:46 - Background color transparent,
01:48 - override what it was before, okay, nice.
01:51 - So we've affected this purple text
01:54 - without also affecting this purple text.
01:58 - Now any time we use the purple class
02:00 - inside a paragraph like this, it will get
02:03 - those styles applied after.
02:05 - We can use that space to dig deep
02:08 - into our document.
02:10 - Let's say we want to apply a styling
02:11 - just to strong tags that are in li's.
02:16 - We start with a parent tag, li,
02:19 - and then the space, and then strong.
02:23 - Maybe we'll give them
a different line height
02:25 - to space them out more.
02:27 - Nice.
02:29 - We could even add a ul in front of the li
02:33 - if we wanted to make sure it didn't apply
02:35 - to strongs inside an ol li.
02:38 - You see, to use descendant selectors,
02:40 - we need to think hard about the structure
02:42 - of our document and what tags are
02:44 - inside other tags.
02:46 - If you're indenting
nicely, then that should be
02:48 - easy to do because your indentation
02:50 - will reflect the hierarchy of tags.
02:52 - See we have this ul,
and indented inside that
02:55 - we have an li, and inside
that we have the strong.
02:59 - If you're not indenting nicely,
03:01 - well fix that up now because it will
03:03 - make it much easier for you to understand
03:05 - the structure of your page and to come up
03:07 - with CSS selectors
based on that structure.
03:10 - You can use that space between any kinds
03:12 - of selectors, like finding
a particular tag type
03:16 - under an element that has a certain ID,
03:18 - or finding a particular ID under elements
03:21 - with a particular class name,
03:22 - any combination that you need to use.
03:25 - The thing to remember
is that if the structure
03:28 - of your page changes,
then your old CSS rules
03:31 - might not apply.
03:32 - So think carefully when you use them
03:34 - and how future proof your CSS will be.
03:37 - You could always use classes if you want
03:38 - to be less dependent on
the structure of your page.
03:41 - Let's look back at the rules I created
03:44 - and think through them.
03:46 - This first rule styles
all the purple class
03:48 - elements inside paragraphs a certain way.
03:51 - If I add a new paragraph with purple class
03:53 - elements in the future, would I want them
03:55 - to get that property?
03:57 - Yes, because I think that those properties
04:00 - will always look the best in a paragraph.
04:02 - Do I need a more specific rule?
04:04 - Maybe if these paragraphs are always
04:06 - inside some element
with class name article,
04:09 - I could add that to the rule,
04:10 - but for now, this is the
most specific I can be.
04:14 - The second rule gives
all the strong elements
04:17 - inside list items a certain line height.
04:21 - Do I always want strong items inside li's
04:24 - to have that increased line height?
04:26 - Hmm, maybe not.
04:29 - This rule might be too generic.
04:31 - Since I'm not sure, I will add a class
04:34 - to this ul and then change this one
04:39 - so it's ul.spacey, which
makes it much more specific.
04:44 - In the future, as my webpage grows,
04:46 - I might make the rule
more or less specific.
04:50 - Stick this tool in your
ever-growing CSS toolbox
04:53 - and practice it so you can use it
04:55 - when it makes sense.
