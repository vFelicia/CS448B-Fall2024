hi this video tutorial will look at these broadcast message block so put your put my um keep section opened up and let's have a quick read so broadcast message basically seems a message to all right for example here you put a broadcast chunk or if you've got a broad class of broadcasts and there's no specific message that it sends a message to all the sprites and the backgrounds and this is useful if you want to tell other folks mean to do something now what do you want them to do when they receive a message and this is when it the actual message is received by the others right what if the particular action you want them to do so let's have a look at this example of a game that I've created where I have actually used a broadcast message so jump into my car and let's see the broadcast message there so the scripts that I have on my car is that when the green flag is clicked move five step if I'm edge bounce except the rotation scale left to right through does an arm turn upside down repeat these actions until it touches right one and bright one is in my game the cat and then once it's touched this bright or one if the car has hit the cat the cat broadcast a message yet so the broadcast message is where you can jump into your event section and you can create a new message by clicking onto the dropdown arrow and clicking on new message and typing a new message to say just and okay that so that's how you can create a broadcast message in my example here are created a broadcast message called ships but now I'm going to jump into my cats light to see how I can apply when I receive the message cute so I've got a lot of groups happening my cat but let's have a look at this particular script block here so the cat is basically saying that when I receive this message here we're going to stop all of its gripped in this right basically means in the game then I'll play this out meow until done and say dog I've been hit so let me leave and there you go so the cat has been hit by the car which means that when the card touches the cat it sends that message hit and so now that cat has received that message hit it stop the game you can hear that it played that Mouse meal and then it's a dot RB check so that's how you can use the broadcast message block to create games and projects in scratch
