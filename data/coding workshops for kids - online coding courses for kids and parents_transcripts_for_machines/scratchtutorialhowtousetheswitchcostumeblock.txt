hi this batch video we'll look at the switch costume to blog and see how it works so I'm in my home page in the tips section and if you click onto the look tab you will see that that's where the switch costume of blocks is located so the switch classroom allows you to change the look of a sprite and if I go into the costumes tab you can see from my default caps like that I have a costume one and a costume too so how can I use these costumes to look but to change the look of this right and make it look like it moving and walking so let's back go back to the script tab so this is a very simple way of testing out how this witch costume blog can be used so here we've got switch costume 2 1 and switch costume 2 so let's have a look at running this Creek and looking at how it will work so I'm in my look script tab and I'll drag out the switch costume and then I'll drag out the same block again now you can see that there's a little dropdown menu here so if I click on to switch costume to costume 1 and if I go back to the costumes tab here I can see that this is the costume that I'm referring to because it's got the costume name of one here so I can say let's switch costume to costume 1 and this can remain as costume so if I click onto this Laak here you can see that it has changed the look and if I click on to the switch costume to one and see that it changed its costume to look like question one how can I program so it will constantly switch costumes and look like the cat is walking so if I snap these two together and click onto it it's kind of running the script so it is running the script where it says switch costume to one then I'm saying switch costume but it's actually running the script it looks like it's running the script at the same time so we can't actually see the costume change of the current so if I jump into my control block I might just use the wait one second and snap it in between and let's see what happens after that yeah so it's doing that quite well it is switching costume to one then it's weight in one second and it's switching costume to costume if I want to run this script and run the program continuously then I need to jump into my events tab and let's go into my control tab and grab my forever block let's search not the forever block so all of those switch costumes have our blocks are nested within low forever and let's click onto that detect mmm so it is actually running the script where it's changing the costume one weight in one second and then switch costume but it doesn't look so smooth so I might have to grab the wait one second lock and napat underneath the costume to change and let's see how that works so there you have it thats how you can use the switch costume two one wait one second switch costume two wait one second and basically I'm saying forever run these blocks and to finish this off I can add an event so I could say whenever I press the green flag let's forever run these scripts so let's check that out so I've clicked onto the green flag it's switching the question to one waiting one second switching the question waiting one second and it's forever running these script block so have fun exploring the switch costumes locks
