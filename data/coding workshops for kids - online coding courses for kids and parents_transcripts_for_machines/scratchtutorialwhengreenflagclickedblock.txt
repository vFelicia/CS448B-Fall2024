hi this video tutorial will look at the when green flag clicked block so if you're not familiar with some of the blocks in scratch you know you've got a tip section that you can open up so let's jump into my events tab and open this up and we've got a little tutorial here on the when green flag clicked let me click onto that so basically what this does is that it runs the script when the green flag is clicked which means when you've created a scratch project or a scratch game and you want to be able to start the game with start the project you may want to use this and the green flag to actually kick start the game off so we need to apply this particular event block onto particular scripts or unclothed that you want to run so for this example it's got go to x and y coordinate zero move ten tips and then turn 15 degrees forever and apply this action when the green flag clicked is clicked on so let's have a look at how we can actually replicate that example so I'll go into my motions tab and let's just grab my goto x and y coordinates block I'll click onto my move 10 steps block and let me just click onto the move 10 steps just just to show you how it works so you can see that my cats brain is moving 10 steps which is great but maybe I want my cat right to turn so let's just click onto this again and see how it would so what it's doing is it's moving 10 set and then it's actually turning 15 by 15 degrees so we want this action to occur forever and ever so let's just go into my control tab click onto my forever blog drag it out and make sure my script that I want to run a place inside my forever block let's place a goto x and ycoordinates on top of my forever block because that's what I want to do is I want my cats right to be right in the middle which is a go to X 0 and y 0 coordinates and then move 10 steps and then turn 5 15 degrees forever and ever so how do I actually start this project well I'll go into my events click onto my green flag is clicked block drag that out and snap it on the top so let me just get rid of that section here and let's click onto this to see how it works and they have it so when the green flag is clicked it goes right in the middle the center of the backdrop and it moves ten steps and then it turns by 15 degrees forever and ever nf and that's how you can apply the when green flag is clicked block let me just stop that and if I'm about to start my game I can click on to my green flag and there you go and that's how you can apply the when green flag clicked block
