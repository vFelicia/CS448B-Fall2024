hi so this crutch video tutorial will look at how you can control your sprite or your characters when you're creating a scratch game so I've got a couple of emotions like fear though we're going to have a look at the first one that we're going to have a look at the point towards a mouse pointer and this is how you can control your sprite movement in a game where you might have to guide them through a maze or guide them through a different arm course and different levels of games so I've got four of our point towards the mouse pointer when the green flag is clicked so let me just click onto that and test that script out and here's my mouse and so I'm moving my mouse around my mouse pointer and it's pointing towards my mouse pointer and basically following my mouse pointer and so that's one way of controlling my sprite so I'll just stop that how about if I want the sprite to move and follow at the same time so we're going to have a look at what would happen if I clicked on to the move five steps so if it was on its own and I'm clicking onto it you can see that the the champion five step now if I not be smooth five steps underneath my point towards the mouse pointer block and then run this script to see look at that that's pointing towards my mouse pointer and moving five steps so it's basically following my mouse pointer and actually moving around the screen rather than just moving around in circle in a stationary motion so that's a couple of ways that you can use your emotion blocks to control your sprites movement especially when you're creating a game okay have fun creating your quest game
