hi this sketch video will look at the if then block and how we can use the if then block in scratch games that you may want to create so I've got my I've got my monkey here and I've got my banana here I'm creating a simple game where the when the monkey touches the banana we're going to say that it's got his eaten banana and so it's the monkey touches of banana we want the banana to disappear to look like it's been eaten so it disappears when the condition is met so if we have a look at the if then block here I've used a sensing block so I'm telling scratch that if the the banana is touching the monkey which is a the monkeys right here then I want you to hide the banana so it can reflect the fact that it looks like the the banana has been eaten by the monkey so let me run this script and let's actually start the game and see what happens when Bo monkey happened to touch the banana yes it's disappeared okay so basically what I'm saying is if when the green flag is clicked initially show the banana and then if the monkey touches the banana then hide it and perform this action repeats these sets of commands over and over again until I decide to end the game or stop playing the game so let me just run that through once more so let me just show my bananas and we'll move the monkey back here and let's play the game and see how this script using the essence lock works so I'm using the the the mouse pointer to control the monkey and there it goes touch the banana and the banana has disappeared so it has run this script using the ifthen look have fun creating your own scratch games
