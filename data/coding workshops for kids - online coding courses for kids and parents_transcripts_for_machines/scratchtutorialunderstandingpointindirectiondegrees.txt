hi this scratch video we'll look at the directions um in scratch um looking at the point in directions so you can see here that I've got these uh blocks all set up where I've got point in directions if I click onto that zero and uh drop down the menu you can see that um basically this script is saying point in the right direction and it's at 90° left directions which is at 90 um point in the up Direction which is at zero and point in the down Direction which is at 180 so just to better understand how those um directions work we can jump into our um scratch icon here click open um to reveal more of the information that we can see and we've got this directions um area where we can sort of play around and understand how the uh how Sprites can move so here I've got the direction pointing at 90° and you can see that the Sprite is uh pointing towards the right direction so that's where we know where we're getting the 90 if I move this up and go to say 0° you can see that the cat is pointing up so that's where we understand that it's pointing in the direction zero means it's actually pointing in the direction up let's just rotate that around where we get to say 90 and you can see that the Sprite is now looking towards the left side so we know that 90 is the left Direction and then if I rotate that down again where I get a a negative 180 um sorry 180 um we can see that the cat is pointing downwards and so we know that the direction 180 means that the cat is um pointing in the direction um looking down so that's just giving you a better understanding of how the the directions and the rotation of the degrees work in scratch
