this video will take you through some of the features and tools that you have to work with when you are creating your first scratch project when you open up your scratch project and click on create you will find that you'll get a default sprite and the default sprite is your cat sprite that you can work with up the top here let's have a look at some of the tools that you have to work with if I want to duplicate a sprite I can always use this duplicate icon up here click onto that click onto the sprite that I want to duplicate and there you have it there you have your two different sprites that I've just duplicated I may decide that I actually don't need a second sprite so I can click onto my little scissors icon this is to delete click onto that and then click on to the actual sprite that you want to delete and there you go sprite gone for a particular project that I'm creating I may need a sprite that's actually a little bit bigger in size so I click onto my grow tool and click onto the sprite and I want to make it grow P and there you have it well that looked a little bit too big for me so it may want to shrink it a little bit so next to the grow I've got my shrink tool click onto that once and then click onto the price and there you go up the top here where I've got untitled eight this is where I want to give my scratch project a name so you could call it whatever you like but for this particular exercise I'll just call it my very first rage project and you can see that it's now saving the file name and I may take a couple of seconds for it to save whilst it's doing that let's look at some of the other tools and features I'm a disciple I scratch project that I need a lot of different characters so let's go and open up what options we have down here I can click on to choose right from library so I'll just go ahead and do that and there you have it opens up a sprite library categorized by all the different categories that you have the scenes and all the different types and if I scroll down you can choose lots of different sprite characters to work with so let me just choose the bat and click OK and there you have it so I've got another sprite character that I've opened up now I'm clicking onto the back here but I may want to add a little bit of my own a drawing or customize it or painted or make it different so I can click onto my paint new sprite and there you have it I can grab a pen tool which is the brush I can change the thickness of my brush I can click on to the type of color that I want and this is where I can start creating my different character or my new sprite they have it I think all this Curly's spaghetti and there is my new sprite that I've just created called curly spaghetti I may want to actually just hide my curl in spaghetti for the moment so I can click onto my little blue icon here won't put the eye and then where it's got the show I can just uncheck this and there you have it it doesn't mean I've deleted it it's just hidden from view so I can just work on the other sprites whilst I can come back to this particular sprite later on you may already have a image that you've saved into your folder or into your computer that you may want to use as a sprite character so that's what you can do when you click onto that if you actually want to take a photo of yourself or a photo of the background or photo of anything that surrounds you you can click onto new sprite from camera take a photo and use that photo as your sprite you can see that my background is just a little bit boring it's a whitespace background and if I want to make it a little bit more interesting I can always come down here where it's got new backdrop click onto the little image icon and what this does it brings up all the different backdrops that I could use for my scratch project just to make it things a little bit more interesting and exciting so again you've got all the different categories you've got all the scene that you can choose from so maybe I can click on to nature and see what I've got and maybe I'll pretend that today for my scratch prototype that they're in a hay field and there you have it now doesn't that make my scratch project a lot more interesting than just having a white background similar to the sprite tools you can draw your backdrop will paint your new backdrop you can upload an image from your computer or you can take a photo of your new fat drop and there you have it
