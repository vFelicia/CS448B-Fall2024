hi this video looks at the assignment operator and the equal to comparison operation in Python programming the assignment operator is represented by the one equal sign and the equal to comparison operator is represented by two equal signs for a double equal sign so let's not confuse the difference between the two the equal sign which is represented by the one equal sign is used in assignment statements where we want to store a value to a variable so let's have a look at an example so if I bring across my interactive shell we can say up here that we're saying spam is true so we're signing a value to the spam which is true and that's how we would use the assignment operation whereas the double equal sign is used in expressions to see whether two values are equal so let's have a look at some examples so here we could say that the number 10 is equal to number 10 so we get a true return a true boolean value if we have a look at this example we're saying number 11 is equal to number 10 and we will get a false return because this is not the case now they're not equal to comparison operator is represented by an exclamation mark and one equal sign so we have a good example here what we're saying is number 10 is not equal to number 10 and we would get a false boolean value returning hope this video has helped you to understand the difference between the assignment operator and the equal to comparison operator in Python programming
