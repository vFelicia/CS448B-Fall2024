hi this sketch video will look at how we can create our own sprite by clicking onto our paint new sprite tool here and we're going to create a bone that we are going to use in our find a bone at game so I'm in my costume I'm in my design tab so I'm going to click onto my brush and down here I might just change the width of my brush just to make it a bit thicker I might grab sort of that beiges sort of yellowy color and let's just go ahead and start drawing the sort of outlines of a bone and we'll make it fill up pretty much the whole screen if you like and we can definitely use our shrink tool later on when we're putting some clothes in to shrink the size to what we need now that I've created a bit of a a bone image I'm gonna use my fill with color tool to actually fill in the color of the bones and let me just click inside and there we have it that's how you can create your own bone sprite using the the paint new sprite tool
