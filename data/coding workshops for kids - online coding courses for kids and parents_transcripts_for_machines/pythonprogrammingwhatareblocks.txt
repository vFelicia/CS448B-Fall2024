this video will look at blocks in Python programming a block is where several lines of currents can be grouped together in a block and in every line of a block it begins with at least a number of spaces as the first line in the block so and you can tell where a block begins and ends by looking at the number of spaces at the front of the lines this disa lines indentation now Python program is typically used for additional spaces of indentation to begin a block any following line that's indented by that same amount is part of the block the block ends when there's a line of code with the same indentation as before the block started they can also be blocks within other blocks let's have a look at this table in the above table we can see that line 12 has no indentation and it isn't inside a block we can tell that it isn't inside any block or it's not it doesn't have any invitation because there's no spaces beginning that line line 13 however we can see here has one two three four spaces of indentation as the line is indented more than the previous line we can say that a new block starts here which is block one now every line of following this one with the same amount of indentation or more is considered to be part of the same block for example block 1 now if you encounter if python encounters another line with less indentation than the blocks first line the block is basically ended and blank lines like you see in line 16 are ignored line 18 has an indentation of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 spaces which means it's starting a new block called this block is inside block 1 but the next line liner 20 is indented by only 4 spaces and because the indentation has decreased you know that the line eighteens block 2 has ended and because line 20 has the same indentation as line 13 you know it's still part of the block 1 so that's sort of the primary block and we know that blog 2 is actually inside block 1 if we have a couple a line at 21 it increases the indentation to 8 spaces again so we know another new block has started and we'll call this block 3 line 23 we exit block 3 and we exit asari at and at line 24 we enter the final block within a block block 4 and both block 1 up here and block 4 end on line 24 I hope this video has given you some insight into what blocks are in Python programming
