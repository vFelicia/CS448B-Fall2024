hi this video will look at the difference between when you create a variable for all sprites and for this sprite only what is the difference between those two options when you create a variable in scratch you click onto that make a variable it allows you to type in a name that you want to create for your variable and it gives you these two options for all sprites or for this sprite owe me now when you click on to for all sprites and this option will create a variable that all sprites can use if I click on to this option for this bright only what this does is it creates a variable that only the cat sprite can use and you can see up here the variable that we have created it actually identifies the name of the sprite cat as I click on to my icon there I've actually given this write a name called cat and because I have created for this bright only when I was creating a variable it tells me on the screen here that this variable will only apply to this cat sprite and only this cat sprite can use this variable I hope this video has helped you to explain the difference between for all sprites and for this sprite only
