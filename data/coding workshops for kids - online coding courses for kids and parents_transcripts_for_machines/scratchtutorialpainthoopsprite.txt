this scratch video shows you how we can paint a new sprite and convert to vector so I've clicked on to my paint used by tool and it opens up my drawing stage I'm going to click onto my convert to vector button at the bottom here and the reason I do that is the vector mode lets you draw shapes rather than drawing the individual pixels of an image so just make sure that that's been so when I click on to convert to bitmap convert to victim I'm sorry you can see that all my drawing tools are now on my right hand side of this stage well we're going to click onto a yellow color at the bottom here where we've got our selection of color palettes and we may just adjust our line width just to make it a little bit thicker so it's easier for us and what we might do is we're going to click on to our ellipse tool and draw a shape first of all I might click on to this tool here so we know roughly where the middle of the drawing stage is and then we'll click on to the ellipse tool here and try to draw it right in the middle so it's some spot on in the of the middle of this stage might make it a little bit bigger and we try to make sure that that's right in the middle as well so if this may take a little bit of fiddling around but it's great to get it perfectly in the middle and so you can see that there's that little crosshair there so it allows you to guide what guides you as to where the middle of the UM the stage is and that's all we're going to do we'll rename the sprite as the hoop so that when we use this bright in the program we can refer to it as the hoop rather than arms right to hope this video has helped you to learn how you can use the paint new sprite tool as well as the the victim mode
