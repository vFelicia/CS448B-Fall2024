hi this scratch video tutorial will get there if on edge bounce block as you can see I've opened up my tip section and clicks on the block if on edge bounce so basically what happens with this block is that if when you are creating a game or a story and just right seems to be walking across the screen it through bumps on the edge but then econo doesn't through bounce back up again so what this block allows you to do is that if it's touching the edge of the dash then basically bounce it away so let's just have a look at some of the ways that we could use this block so if I grab the move 10 steps blocks and click on to that and I'll click onto it until my cat right touches the edge of the screen and we'll do what happens it kind of doesn't do anything keeps on moving ten steps because that's basically what this block is designed to do is to move ten steps so let me open up and scream a little bit further but if I wanted my cat to actually reach when it reaches the edge of the screen for it to bounce back and start walking back again so in that instance I would go into my motion script tab scroll down a little bit click on to this and let's snap these two together and let's see what happens when I test and click on to this and I'll click on to a several time so that it reaches the edge of the screen and hopefully you'll do there you got so kind of bounces back but you can see that the rotation style is upsidedown so to fix that problem we can go back to our little icon rotate exact direction back to its normal condition and we can then adopt this set rotation style left to right and let's see what happens when I click the script to test out its actions so there you go so it shows that I'm asking the cat to move ten steps however if on the edge kind of bounce away from the edge and then once I've applied the fit rotation style left to right it kind of bounces we're away from the edge of the screen rotates itself around and then starts walking arm in the right direction again so let's just move him all the way across and then let's just click onto this and show you what happens there you go and that's how you can use the X on edge bounce block
