hi it's Jenny from coding workshops for kids I just want to showcase our Python programming games that we've been working on so this is a turtle racing game that clever Python programmers have been working on lately so I'm just gonna run this so you can actually see how the turtle racing game works and there you go it's going ahead and creating 14 race tracks we've got a de red turtle we've got Bob which is a blue turtle we've got Ivy which is a green turtle and we've got Jim let's see who's gonna win ah oh it's ivy you want a turtle racing game so you can see all the Python programming on this side the left hand side of the screen and we get to use lots of different functions and we've looked at pin ups pinned down functions loops we've defined Turtles and giving it a shape color and we've done a lot of practice in importing functions from the Python library as well so if you would like to join our Python programming workshops on a Sunday afternoon please do so and let's program together
