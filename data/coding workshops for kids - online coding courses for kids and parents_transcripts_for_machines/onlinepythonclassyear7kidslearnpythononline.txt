yes mine's done did you get zero and then a line and then a number five thumbs up mmhmm okay so let's move on then so we now know how this right function works and then let's look at number five now so now what we want to do is label each track number let's start with five tracks to begin with and we're gonna have a small sorry tree that's gonna be some complicated code how many likes we need ah so let's have a look so we have from total import so we want to write 0 because this our transition itself from 0 so then what westerns so we're saying forward 20 spaces we don't want our hundred that's too white then we want every 20 pixels yes exactly so I want you to do this so I want you to see exactly what happens when I run this and then I want you to program it yourself so let me just run this you can see what happens and it's as easy as telling Python we want you to create five track marks with numbers going across to see that yep okay so yes Nurik I did 14 nines our ditch food already did you get 14 track marks going across yes fantastic okay that fast did you use what did you use make it please let me just run this again because see how I've got in my program right up to five now when I run this can you tell me something that doesn't yes so here okay so this is what I'm really worried is yours running wide no one knows but no one's really know okay so what's your forward spaces I've got forward at 20 steps all the time what number have you been to maybe it's just the size of this green okay I'm gonna stop sharing naari can you share your screen so we can have a look at yours and to see distance looks like right so are you able to can I can you go up and share your screen no change this to from 20 to 40 oh okay that's why cool no external in stead of 20 spaces or 20 he is put in 40 that's why he's track marks are much wider than mine so thumbs up when you've programmed 5 tracks going across and then we can move on three thumbs up no it comes up awesome you guys are cool alright so now what did you notice about programming this up here we can't I have to do what all the time we had to repeat the same instructions several times and that meant we had to physically type out these programs instructions a lot okay what is the better way of programming this Oh we put
