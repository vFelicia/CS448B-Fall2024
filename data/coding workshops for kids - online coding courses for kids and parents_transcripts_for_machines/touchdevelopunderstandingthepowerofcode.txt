hi it's Jenny from coding workshops for kids just going to take you through a next workshop we explored looking at a game development within touchdevelop so we can see that we are in the touchdevelop environment so we're starting to look at this game and our mission for this game is to change some codes so we really got to understand the power of coding and how simple changes to some lines of code can turn this some non interesting uninteresting game into into a much more interesting game that becomes a lot more interactive and that gives the the user experience a lot of interactivity as well so our mission is to fix some code to make the game a lot more interesting to help but to avoid some obstacles and to save the bot so we're gonna try to keep him alive by clicking our mouse or touching our screen so that he continues to fly up and down and avoid the obstacles at the same time so and the idea behind the coding concept behind this activity is to see what codes or instructions actually look like and and what it actually instructs the game to do and how quickly then change some lines of code so that the game becomes a lot more interesting and interactive so let's just have a quick look back behind the scenes so this is the the codes or the scripts that you see sitting behind the touch development are starting the touch develop calm environment and you can see that I can click onto my tap here to run the game and you can see that we've got Bakhtiar which is the robot is the main character in the game we can see that there's three sort of lives that he has we can see that he's got an obstacle here and with what's the point system set up at the moment the game's not as interesting so bot is not flying up and down he's not able to fly up in turn at this stage and that's what we need to do we need to add and change a few codes few lines of code so that the bot when we click onto our mouse he's flying up and down and he avoids the obstacles and so we try to save him as much as possible see you next time
