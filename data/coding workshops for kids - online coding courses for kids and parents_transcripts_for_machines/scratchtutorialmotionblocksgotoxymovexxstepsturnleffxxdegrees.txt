okay this video tutorial will look at a couple of motion blocks and look at how we can make a sprite characters move around the screen so I'm in my create project mode and I've clicked into my motions tab where it drops down a list of all the different motion blocks that I can play around with the first one that I want to show you is this particular motion block here which is that go to X&Y coordinates and just to make this exercise a little bit easier to understand I'll just change my backdrop to show you the different positioning that you have within scratch so where the cat is at the moment it's the positioning is all based on the X which is the line going across the horizontal line and the Y coordinates and the Y is the line that's going down which is the horizontal so if you can have a look in here the X and the y coordinates right in the middle of the screen is 0 and 0 so with this particular go to X Y block if I just go 0 and 0 there and click onto this a block to test my cat sprite will actually go right in the middle which is x coordinate 0 and y coordinate 0 if I want my sprite to move into this particular position you can see here that this particular X and y coordinate has already changed the cordon umbers for me so it's saying that this particular position here means it's x coordinate negative 103 and Y is negative 101 so when you have look at the x coordinate or the x axis going across you can see that this side it's the negative and with the ycoordinates the top is positive and when it goes below the xcoordinate it's negative and so that's why I've got a X of negative 103 and a y of negative 101 so let me click onto this x equals zero and y equals zero and then I'll click on to go to my x coordinates and my Y coordinates and there you go so that's how you can look at the different positioning of your characters when you're creating a a game or a story or a certain proto in scratch all right so I'll move that aside for the moment and I'll move this one up here let's have a look at this particular move ten steps so what this does is basically what it's saying it will do it will actually move ten steps so let me click onto that so that's ten steps down it's every time I click onto this it's moving ten steps I can change risks on ten to five and you can see what happens after that okay so it's taking five steps instead of ten steps now what I want this to do is I can actually look at my repeat block and click onto that and see what happens so if repeating the moved five steps ten times if I change the ten to the twenty let's have a look at what happens there you go so it's repeating the move five step 20 times now now I want to be able to move my cat sprite around the screen so I may have a look at my turn left block so if I click on to this where it's got turn left 15 degrees let's just see what happens there you go it's turned left ways towards left 15 degrees by 15 degrees and if I click onto my little eye icon here I can actually set the rotation or the direction of my cat's bite back to its original which is sitting at 90 degrees so let's say let's change that 15 degrees to 90 degrees and we'll snap that one in now and what I want to do is go back into my control grab my repeat block again and snap it around so all my scripts are inside my other repeat block and we'll say let's repeat that four times and then let's click on to this and see what happens well there you go so it looks like it's moving across up across and then back down again so it's repeating the move five steps 20 times then it turns left 90 degrees and then it repeats this whole motion again four times so now let me snap this go to block on top of my repeat block and then click onto that to test there you go so now what I'm saying is go to my ex position and my Y position which is x equals negative 103 and y equals negative 101 which is this position here then I want you to move five steps repeat the movement of the size of 20 times then turn left by 90 degrees and repeat this whole action four times now I may want to actually add an event block and so I could say to start this game or to start this project I want to be able to click on to the green flag and I want this particular step to occur so let's click onto that now you have it so that's how you can use some of the motion blocks to get your characters to move around your backdrop or your screen now let's actually change this backdrop to something a little bit more interesting and I may want to go into a space backdrop and we'll go okay to that and there you have it so let me just click onto my green flag and there you go hope you have fun playing around with your motion blocks
