hi this video will show you how you can share your scratch project onto your seesaw journal as a link so I go to my little top bar and I highlight my twitch project URL which is the web address I rightclick and click copy jump onto my seesaw journal I need to click onto my little green plus bar to create a new node I've got my little options here I'm going to click on to link I'm going to right click and click on to paste and then click onto my little green tick button it will take a couple of seconds for the link to load onto a seesaw journal and so don't be afraid that it might be taking a little bit longer than you might have expected goats um once it loads you will be able to see that the the link has been successfully added then you can click onto your caption and give it a title so it could be in life first scratch project and then click on to this green tick and there you have it how you can create a a seesaw note as a link and copy across your scratch project
