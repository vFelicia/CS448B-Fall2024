hi Jenny from coding workshops for kids this video looks at scratchers directions understanding the directions and degrees when you are programming something in scratch so words like up down right or left a perfectly understood by people but when we are programming the computer needs a number to indicate an exact direction and this is something that we want to explore in this video so all characters or sprites in scratch have their own number directions so you can see that I've programmed a very simple scratch arm project here to say point two mouths point two mouse pointer so as my mouse moves around it points towards the direction of my mouse and you can see that I've programmed for scratch to tell me exactly the direction that my mouse is pointing towards and that's how we can use the code blocks like point two direction ninety degrees so this is point two right or if we want to use a a particular direction where we want the characters to point to left we could use the the code block point two Direction negative nine which in computer terminology it means to point left pointing at 0 degrees up here is telling the computer let's go upwards and pointing down here's some telling the computer to the direction of a hundred and eighty degrees so you can see that when we are learning about programming we are entering into the space of numbers and mats and understanding our degrees in a full a circle and this is how computers understand when we give them instructions to point toward a way or a direction and this simple explanation has been presented by inventor of scratch comm which I'm reposting in this video
