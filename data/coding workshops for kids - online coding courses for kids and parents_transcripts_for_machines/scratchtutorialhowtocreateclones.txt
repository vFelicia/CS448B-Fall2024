this scratch video looks at how you can clone sprites without having to use the duplicate tool so let's jump in and clone my cats right now I'll go into my control setting and I'll go and grab my repeat block then I'll scroll down a little bit further and create clone of myself grab that code block and nest it in between my repeat block what's the event trigger I can use when the green flag is clicked or I can use when this bright is clicked so I'll just go and select when green flag is clicked so basically what I'm saying here is when I click onto my green flag I want you to clone myself ten times so let's go ahead and click my green flag to see alright so can you see the clone of the cat sprite well it's cloned itself ten times so quickly that you haven't had a chance to see it all being cloned but if you go over to your cat and start moving them out you should be able to see ten clones of the cats bright appearing and this is how you can clone your sprites in scratch using the create clone of myself code block
