hi today let's have a look at the forever block if you're not sure of some of the blocks within scratch you can always jump into the tip section and click onto the different blocks er to learn more about all the different blocks that you have now for the forever block is in the control section so let's just open that up and click on to the forever log so the forever block is what it does it in 1 whatever block whatever instructions whatever triggers that you place inside the forever block it repeats that task over and over again so you don't manually have to click on to something for that action to be repeated so the example that they give here is that we've used a move 10 steps wait half a second and then repeat that action over and over again so let's just have a look at how we can apply the forever block for my scratch project that I want to use I've gone into my sprite library and I've grabbed the J little I may actually want to change the color of my earthbrite so I've gone into my looks tab and I might play around with this block today which is a change color effect if I just click on to this lock just to show you how it works you can see that the color changes each time I click onto this block so for the color to change I have to manually click onto this so this is where I could then use the forever block and help to repeat this task of changing the color over and over again without me having to manually click onto this color block so I've placed my change color blocks inside my forever block while some in the control tab I might even grab the weight one second and place it underneath the change color block and then let's have a click onto this to test it and you can see that the color of my J is changing forever over and over again without me having to click onto my change color block all the time and that's how you can apply a forever block in a particular project that you may be working on
