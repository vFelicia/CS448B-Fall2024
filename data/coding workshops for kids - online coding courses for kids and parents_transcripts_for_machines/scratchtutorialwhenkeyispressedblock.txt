hi welcome to a quick tutorial today we'll be looking at the when key is pressed and block as you can see currently in my event script tab and underneath that we can see that this is a block that we'll be looking at today I'm going to click and drag that out to my scripting area so when space key is pressed if I click down onto that little dropdown arrow you can see that there are lots of different events that you can apply so you can definitely use a space key you've got the up and arrow down arrow right arrow left arrow any key and then all the different alphabets on your keyboard so how do we use this when a key press block if we go into our tips tutorial section you can see that this runs our script when I specify key is pressed an example that we can see here is that when we've got when n key is pressed and we've applied a move 10 steps block this will do exactly that so when I press the N key on my keyboard it will actually move 10 steps so let's go ahead and apply this and see how it may work for this particular tutorial I'm going to apply the when B key is print and I might make my write row bigger by changing its costume size so I'm like click and drag the change size by 10 then I might just click onto this script to see how it works oh I'm clicking onto my B key and see how it's getting bigger so it's fantastic how about if I want to do the opposite so I go back into my events I might drag this block out again and instead of the B I might actually go down and try to look for an S key so here we go and unlike do the opposite I might change the size by making it go smaller so instead of the positive I'm going to apply a negative number let's click on to this and see if it works oh I'm pressing my HTML and there you have it when the S key is pressed it's changing the size by 10 and when the B key is pressed its changing the size by 10 I hope this has helped you to understand how to use the wind key press clock
