hi let's have a look at how we can change the the size of our hats price using lots of different armor scripts and different tools for the first thing I'll show you is the shrinkage all at the top if I click onto that string tool once and then click on to the right that we want to shrink and just keep on clicking on to the best right you can see that it's shrink I want to make my side grow I've always got access to the grow tool we want that once again and then click on to this bright and you can see that my cats is growing back inside so that's a couple of the many ways of changing the sizes of your characters or your sprites what's another way if we have a look at the the looks tab and let's have a look at how this particular block works so this change sides by 10 let's just click onto that one to see what happens there you go we can see that my cat is actually increasing its size by 10 as I click onto this block how about if I want to decrease the size of my sprite in this instance I can always change the numbers around so instead of having a positive number we need to put in a negative number to reflect a decrease in their side so now if I click onto these blocks you can see that it is decreasing its size every time I click onto it so that's how you can sort of understand how this change size by block works all right so let's just have a look at some events that we can actually apply but when you're creating a scratch project or a game there are certain events that you may want to trigger so for example arm tab look at this particular event block which is when space keeps change sides by negative tender so let's just change this back to positive and say for example I would like to use my B key so awesome to do that again so here what I'm saying is if I click if I press down on my big here on my keyboard then basically what I'm asking is got to do is to change the size by 10 so now you've got I'm just clicking onto my B key and it seems to be doing what I'm asking too much to do if I want to duplicate this a block script without having to drag everything out again and to change some of my events around so I may want to apply a different scenario where if I press the F key I want to shrink its size by negative 10 so let me just click onto my F key and see what happens and there you go now that I'm clicking on to my FK it seems to be shrinking so that is working quite well so let me just grab my change sides by 10 o'clock again and maybe this time I want to rightclick and to placate that block and I want to apply a negative ten so the next set of instructions that I want to apply is that I want my cats right to grow and shrink grow and shrink grow and shrink so what is the instruction that I need to apply what is the program I need to give to scratch so basically of course you change size by ten then I've got changed sides by negative ten let's click onto that is it doing anything no it's really not doing anything because basically scratch is trying to apply these two different sets of instructions all at the same time so it's kind of doing it but it's doing it so fast that you can't actually see any changes occurring so what we need to do is maybe we need to jump into our control tab and give a second set of instruction to scratch to say change the size by ten just wait one second and then change the size I negative ten so let's see if that works there you go so if I click on to it again you can see that the cat is growing and then it waits one second and then it shrinks back by negative ten so but I want this action to be performed on an ongoing basis I wanted to occur forever and forever so I can drag my forever block out and wrap it around my little set of instructions so anything that captured within my forever block it will perform or run this action on an ongoing basis so let's click onto that it is doing it is performing what is running the script but the action however looked a little bit buggy so let me stop this testing and I may have to apply a wait one second block after the last bit of instructions so I want to change the size by 10 wait one second then decrease the size by ten wait one second and then forever apply this instruction so now let's click onto that and let's see what happens there you go that looks kind of nice and it's running smoothly alright so let me stop that script but when you're creating a game or creating a scratch story or a project you may want to apply a trigger and events so for example whenever I press my green flag to start the game do I want this action to occur well let's just jump into my events block and let's just drag is when green flag clicked and snuff it right on the top and then let's just test it so what I'm doing is when the green flag is clicked forever increase the size by 10 wait a second decrease and then wait a second and forever run this script so let me stop that so that seems to be working now there are different events but you can apply when you are creating different games different situations so let me detach that when green flag is clicked and let's have a look at where you have lots of different characters and lots of different sprites in your scratch game or in your story and nearly what this particular set of actions to occur when a particular sprite is clicked so we can always apply this when this right click blocked right at the top and now they've clicked onto it to test the script it seems to be performing its action quite nicely so I'll stop that at the moment so but how you can sort of change the size of your characters apply different events depending on what type of story or game that you want to create have fun creating your scratch project
