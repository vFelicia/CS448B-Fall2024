hi this quick video tutorial will take you through how we can draw our own a backdrop and create a maze backdrop for our gold maze game they were about to create so I'm in my new backdrops area I'm using my painting new backdrop tool I've clicked onto my rectangular tool and I'll make sure that the shaded part of the rectangular is clicked as well I'm going to go ahead and select a backdrop color that I want to apply so let's just draw a very large rectangle that will probably take up the complete screen so that's done I'm happy with that and now let's start drawing our maze so what we'll do is we'll click onto our rectangular tool again this time we'll select a different color and I might select a like oh well a pink color and let's start drawing our maze so using my rectangular tool let's start drawing some maze shape and make it quite interesting and I'll quickly do this and obviously you can take your time when you are drawing your own maze okay so much do another triangle paste that comes down this way make sure that there are no gap and I'd like to draw another big piece that runs across the bottom like so and you can always vary the thickness of your nave tunnel whichever way you like might have another little peep heading out this way and have another piece might have another piece sort of coming down out of here increase the thickness of that and why don't we get another peep sort of dropping out from this side and let's just continue so that we can make it a little bit more challenging I might have another tool P sort of coming out this way we've got across a little bit and if I could get another little piece sitting on top of that okay we're almost there might have another little angle sticking out here and maybe another long piece sticking out here I have to make sure a little bit wider and then the final page where we need to have a little bit of an opening and this is where we are going to play our goal point so to create a goal point let's click on to my little circle and a select see the cold color that I might want to use and we might just draw two little circles at the end of the maze and these can represent the goal taste it I want to do one more and have another taste of Kenya here and a little bit bigger okay have fun creating your own main backdrop
