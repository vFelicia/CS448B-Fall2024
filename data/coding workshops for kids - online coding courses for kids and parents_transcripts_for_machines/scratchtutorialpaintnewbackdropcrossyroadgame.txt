hi welcome to this scratch video tutorial today we're going to look at how we can um draw or paint our our own backdrop in Scratch by clicking onto this tool here which is a um a way of drawing our um new backdrop so I'm in the uh backdrop area here I'm going to click onto my rectangular tool and click onto my shaded area the first thing that I want to do is basically draw a rectangular shape representing my um concrete pavement or the concrete road part so the bitchman if you like to call that and um there you go so that's my gray area done the next thing I want to do is perhaps put a road going across the rectangular screen so I'll go down here and select a different color and let's just get that rectangular shape drawn onto my gray pavement perfect and the next thing that I want to do is um draw a green grass area right at the top of our um backdrop so I've selected the green and we'll go ahead and draw a grass area there just a bar shape to represent the grassy patch and then the final part of drawing our own backdrop is I might actually use the uh the line tool there there change the color to white and um I might just make the width a little bit wider and start going ahead and drawing some markers on the road so there's one there there's two there okay and I'm making good progress here at the moment so um and don't worry if your lines aren't perfectly straight um it is a drawing after all so let's just get the last marker done and there you have it and this is how you can use your own um paint new backdrop tool and and to create and draw your own backdrops have fun
