hi this sketch video we'll look at a levelone scratch game and the scratch game is called the hungry monkey so let's actually play this game so you can see what it's what it's like oh we can see that um the monkey is hungry the monkey moves and follows my mouse around and as it cuts out a banana it gobbles it up and chomps it up and you can hear the sound effects as well so let's just play this once more oh oh but there you go up top and I'll stop the game so let's just have a quick look behind this gate please and have a look at some of the script blocks that's been used to create eggs up soon for hungry monkey game so I've got my backdrop which gone into my backdrop library and added a suitable for backdrop image that I wanted and I don't really need that sound block so I might just get rid of that now and I'll have a look at my monkey but basically the way that I'm controlling the monkey is you you're the player and you can control the movement of your monkey by using the the point towards mouse pointer and then getting the monkey to move four steps what's on a forever basis where the green flag is clicked if we have a look at the banana you can have a look at that we've used the if then block and a touching block as well so basically what we're trying to say that is if the the banana is touched by the monkey or is touching the market then play the sound chump hide the banana so it looks like these the banana has been eaten by the monkey but when we're starting the game we obviously want to see all the bananas appears we've got the show so to start the game we've got the win that green flag is clicked initially show all the bananas however if the monkey is touching the banana and made a sound chomp Ana so it looks like banana has been eaten by the monkey and run these script on an ongoing basis because we've got the forever block surrounding these on script and I've got several monkeys there and the easiest way of applying the same script to your duplicate scripts if you like so sorry your duplicates price is basically right click and duplicate so it seems you are miss dragging and dropping all this different strip blocks and stack them together when you can just simply duplicate the actual script locks that you want so let me just lay in it once more here we go using my mouth and it's a banana you can bother each of the bananas makes that set and then it disappears so have fun creating your scratch games
