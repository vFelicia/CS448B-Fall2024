hi this scratch video will look at how you can create your own boat and wave sprite and draw your own sky backdrop so let's get started I'm just going to minimize the screen so you have full view of the editing screens that we will start to use so first thing how to draw your own sky backdrop we're currently clicked on to the backdrop area here and underneath that there's all these different backdrop tools what we want to do is click on to the the paintbrush tool which will allow us to draw our own backdrop so let's click on to that and it opens up this drawing screen so how I like to create a backdrop and it's just going to be a very simple sky backdrop the first thing I probably want to do is come and select the different tools I've got here and I'm going to use filled with color so let's just click onto that and what that will do is basically fill up this whole white back screen or backdrop with a color that I choose so I've already gone to my color palette selection and clicked onto the color of the sky which is the blue here and what I want to do is I want to have a bit of a a gradient effect so it's um it's sort of darker on the top and bit lighter on the bottom so I selected this gradient effect tool here and all I need to do now is simply click on to my backdrop and voila that's how you can create a sky backdrop number two let's create a boat sprite so again we're going to come into this section here where this is how we can create a new sprites or select a sprite from our library so now what we're going to do is click on to paint new sprite so let's click on to that and again it opens up a drawing screen where you can start getting creative and draw your own sprite characters for the boat what I'd like to do is I might actually convert to a vector mode so I'll click on to convert to vector and I will click on to convert to vector sorry I'm trying to get used to this screen and I'm going to click on to my pencil which I'm just going to actually draw an outline of the boat first but before I do that let's go back to my colors and select the color of the boat so for the boat I may want to apply a brownish color I can actually change the width of my pencil and let's start drawing a very simple shape of a boat here we go that's good now of course you can take your time and get a bit more creative and make it look really fancy but from now all I want to do is show you how you can use some of these features so there's my outline of a boat shape I may want to fill in the the boat with some color as well so let's go up here and I've got my fill with color or color a shape tool so I'll click on to that and instead of a gradient effect I might just have a solid color so I'll click on to the solid color tool and then simply click inside there and there you go and that's how you can create a a boat sprite I'm going to create a waves right now so similar to how we create at the boat I'm going to go into my sprite area click on to paint new sprite and it will open up a new screen or together now for the wave I'm actually gonna stay in my bitmap mode and what I'll do is I'll use my brush tool so I'll click onto that and again I'll select the colour of the wave so let's make it a nice dark blue and all I want to do is just create a shape that will look like a wave and it will start to look and behave like a wave once we apply some coding so let's just go ahead and make that nice and thick and simply just create a little shape going across the bottom of the screen and I would just don't brush the whole bottom part with my color blue and hopefully this will reflect a wave make sure every little part is filled in there you go and once I'm on to my screen let me just open this up now so you can have a full view I can adjust the shapes around to fit within the screen now I think what I'll do is remove my default cat sprite so I'll click on to my scissors tool which is the delete and then click on to the actual sprite I want to remove and there you go and that's how you can create your own sky backdrop create your own boat sprite and create your own wave sprite
