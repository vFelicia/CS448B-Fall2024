hi it's Jenny from coding workshops for kids today we're going to run through strings the real characters in Python programming so python is great at working with numbers but what about when we want to communicate with people so if we want to write programs that people can use and understand well you really need to use another variable type known as strings and strings are what we call text or keyboard characters in a programming language that could be groups or strings of letters names and symbols so basically your name is a string as is your favorite color so a common way to use strings is to print them and we can even use an input function to ask the user to interact with your program and input their responses to a question that you may ask for example what is your name so a common way to use strings as I said is in printing so we want to have a look at a simple program that asks the user for their name it stores their name as a variable and we're going to ask the program to print their name a hundred times so let's just have a look at this simple program as you know we are using a hash tag which is our way of just creating a note to ourselves called a comment so for me I'm saying that I'm creating a Python program ports say my name and I'm going to create a print where it's um a princess screen full of the user's name basically the first step in my algorithm is that I'm going to ask the user for their name so I've got my program there which is a name variable some say the name should equal the import function of the question what is your name the second step is I want to print their name a hundred times so I now I need to use a loop so this is my loop program here so I'm basically saying for X in range a hundred so a loop and print the user's name a hundred times and the third step is I want to print their name followed by a space and not a newline so what I might do here is actually get rid of this rules and just leave it as print name and ended in a continuously printed the name a hundred times across going across the line so let me just run this module and let's watch this program take place so here we are it says what is your name so I'll just type in my name and enter and there you go so this simple program is basically printing my name a hundred times going across each line and not printing my name a hundred times going down the list a hundred times so that's how you can use strings and variables and the print function in Python see you next time
