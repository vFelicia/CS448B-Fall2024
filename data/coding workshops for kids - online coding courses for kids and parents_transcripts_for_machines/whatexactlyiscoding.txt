hi it's Denny from coding workshops for kids I'm just going to take you through a new workshop that we launched last week touchdevelop it's a programming environment where you can write your own scripts scripts to create your own games and to create your own apps on all devices so whether you're using an Android and iPhone a tablet or a PC within touchdevelop you can create your own games so let me just take you through a couple of the areas that we had a look at so if I click on to edit it shows that it loads all the scripts and this is basically all the different lines of code which instructs the computer to play the the games that you're about to develop and so whilst you're creating and writing your own scripts here you can see the end result of your game being developed so let's actually have a look at a particular tutorial and like to take you through a little video of what coding is all about welcome to hour of code an introduction to the basics of computer programming or as it's commonly called coding code is all around you and the results of coding are everywhere whether you're posting a tweet watching a YouTube video or even swiping a debit card whatever happens happens because of lines of code in fact just about anything with a plug or battery uses code or computer programs to do things lots of everyday items phones watches microwaves cars have computers in them and they all rely on code to make them work so what is code exactly code is a precise set of instructions a computer can understand think of it as a recipe the instructions need to be precise so whatever you're making turns out the way it should and just like people in different parts of the world speak different languages computers understand many different languages too with names like Python C++ Perl and Visual Basic they're all different in their own way and similar to spoken languages we share many of the same basic features today we're going to write some code using a language called touchdevelop but the ideas behind the code applied to any programming language select let's get started to begin welcome to hour of code so if you think that's fun join us and come to our Sunday workshops that we run at Epping North public school and why not develop your own games and apps with your other mates and buddies and have fun doing it at the same time see you soon
