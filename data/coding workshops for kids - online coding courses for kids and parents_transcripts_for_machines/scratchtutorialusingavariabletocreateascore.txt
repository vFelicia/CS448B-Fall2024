hi this scratch video will show you how you can create a variable and a variable to be used as a scoring system when you're creating a game so for this game we're making a find a bone game and we're going to count up to see how many bones our dog will eat so we need to jump into the scripts tab and click on to data because that's where we're going to create your variable click on to make a variable and then it will ask you the name that you want to give to your variable so we will pull this score and simply go okay and that's how you can start a scoring system and really use a variable to create a score and this will make the game a lot more interesting and challenging as you can see the number of points going up by the number of bones that the dog finds and eat have fun creating your own scratch games
