hi welcome to this scratch video tutorial today we're going to look at how we can create um our own gron pre racing game and actually paint our own Sprite so this is the actual um car that we are going to draw and paint using uh scratch's uh paint new Sprite tool there which is a little brush tool so if you click onto that takes you to this uh screen editing space where you can actually draw and uh create your own Sprites so this is what we're going to try to uh create so I'll just jump into costume two where I've got a blank screen and let's see how we can um start to create our red racing car so we've clicked onto this uh paint new costume tool takes us to this uh editing screen here the first thing that we want to do is Click onto our rectangle tool to get the body of our car happening and um we'll click onto to the shadeed rectangle tool down here at the bottom and then we'll choose our color which is red now we're going to fill up the uh the screen as much as possible with the body of our uh car and um when we start programming our game we're going to make sure that we will shrink this to its appropriate size but for the moment we're going to make sure that we can fill up um the size of the screen as much as possible with the body of our car so that's our First Step we've drawn the body of our red car the next thing we want to do is um we want to do a um the gray roof on top of the car so we're still in our rectangle tool but this time we'll choose a gray color down here at the bottom and we will draw another um gray sort of rectangle on top of the red rectangle to get our um shape of the roof happening so that's the gray roof there then what we're going to do is we're going to make some um spaces line spaces in between the corners of our gray box just to get a bit of the roof line happening and so at this point I'm going to click onto my line tool and down here I can adjust the width of the line that I want to use so I'm just going to try to get a thicker width and I'll click onto my red again so I can have a bit of a um a line roof happening with the red and I'll just draw a line to the corners and I'll do the same again and then I'll go to the other corners and I'll do that and there just finish off this corner here as well so now that we've got that I might jump back into my rectangle tool and I'm in my red color there so I might draw another little rectangle shape on the top of my roof just to get the roof line looking a little bit better there you go and then obviously I can just adjust the sizes so in touches the corners of my roof line and um there you go so now the next thing that I want to do is um perhaps I want to put a sort of a a red um a yellow light here on this side of the car just so I know um the direction that the car will be traveling into so um I might choose my little ellipse tool there which is a circle tool um and I might choose a yellow color there and draw a yellow circle sort of towards the top of my car or the front of the car and then obviously I can just expand the sizes out a little bit and this is just to indicate that this is the front of the car and the last thing that you can do is um you can use the ellipse tool again change the color to the uh black and um if you want to get a little bit fancier then you can start drawing some um wheels for your car so I'll do that one there I might do another one here and you can see that as I'm doing this I can adjust the sizes as um as I want them to be so I'll do another one there and I might do another one here so let me just click onto that okay and there you have it and that is how you can draw your own Sprite using the paint new costume tool have fun creating your scratch games
