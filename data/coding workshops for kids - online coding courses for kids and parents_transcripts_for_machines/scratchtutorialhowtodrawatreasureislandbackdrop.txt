so I'm down in the stage area and don't forget that we need to be in the stage area and not in the sprites area so we want to create a new backdrop so we click onto the backdrop and there should be a little paintbrush tool that you click on which will open up this backdrop design area so the first thing that we want to do for our backdrop is we want to choose a green color using our paintbrush tool and what we want to do is draw an outline of our island using this a brush tool so let me just go down here and maybe just change the width of our paint brush tools so it doesn't take me too long I'll choose my color green for my island and let's just go ahead and have fun being creative and destroy an outline of what you want your island to be there you go I'm quite happy with that so the next thing that we want to do is we want to fill this area up with the color green so this time I'm going to click on to my fill with color tool and click on to this the center of my island and there you go it fills up my island with the color green next thing I want to do is I want to fill up the background with a blue color to reflect the blue waters so I'm still on my feel with color bucket tool I've changed my color to blue and I just click on to the white section the background section to fill that up with blue there you go hey my island is starting to look amazing the next thing that we want to do is we want to draw some gold coins to represent the treasure so this time I'm going to use my ellipse which is a circle tool and I might just make sure that the shaded circle tool is selected and I might use yellow to reflect the gold or add my treasure so let's go back to our screen here and perhaps I'll do a couple of gold treasures around here there's one and I might do another one just around here and maybe one more just here now the last thing that you might want to do is click on to your text tool and you may want to add a title using the the text tool and maybe write treasure so let me just change the color into white and I might just do caps and I can just write treasure there and as you know or you didn't know you can change their font styles that's better and there you have it so what we can do here is we can stretch this out a little bit to make it bigger so there you go and we can move this to the corner if you like and that's how you can draw your own Treasure Island backdrop using scratch have fun creating your own games
