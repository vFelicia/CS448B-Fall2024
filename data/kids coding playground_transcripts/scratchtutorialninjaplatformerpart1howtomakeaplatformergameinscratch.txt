00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - hello and welcome back to kiss coding
00:11 - playground today we're looking at a game
00:13 - called ninja platformer I know these
00:16 - tonic m is really popular among kids who
00:18 - was coding in scratch so I thought I'd
00:21 - give it a try
00:22 - and trying to make one myself and teach
00:24 - you guys along the way so this is a
00:28 - simple game where we have a ninja you
00:32 - have control the ninja kind of jam
00:34 - across you can kill the Medusa and get
00:37 - to the box you can get the gym after you
00:39 - get the gym from the box then the portal
00:41 - open up you can go into the portal and I
00:43 - will go to the next stage so I'm trying
00:46 - to get really simple only two stages but
00:50 - as you can see this is just a concept on
00:52 - the platform again you can kind of
00:55 - expand on that and make it even better
00:58 - just a disclaimer this game still have a
01:01 - little bug because of the green green
01:05 - platform here and this ninja here
01:07 - sometime the ninja gets stuck in between
01:10 - the rocks here and the green back home
01:14 - because when we when we do the code that
01:17 - checks the ninja touching the green
01:19 - platform sometimes you know he's had
01:22 - this on top of this and it was still
01:24 - can't get stuck there so that's a little
01:27 - problem we had with the game I mean
01:31 - maybe later I can do a hitbox on the
01:34 - feet of the ninja only and making the
01:37 - ninja follow the hitbox and the player
01:40 - can show the small box so that way maybe
01:43 - it may be better but I think that would
01:45 - require a lot more work and you know on
01:49 - so let me just continue this with this
01:52 - game and just fancies you guys the basic
01:54 - concept of platformer and how we can get
01:57 - started ok so this tutorial we're gonna
02:01 - learn about these farming concept custom
02:04 - block how to use custom block custom
02:07 - sprite how to make custom sprite how to
02:09 - use them and how the link between the
02:11 - sprite of the main sprite
02:13 - where players controlling
02:15 - and how to use variable controlling the
02:18 - game how to do loops touching sprite
02:20 - broadcasting and other stuff so this
02:23 - game is really for advanced kids who has
02:29 - a good understanding of scratch and how
02:31 - it works if you don't have that I would
02:35 - not read and working on this game so it
02:37 - will be really difficult and you will
02:39 - not be able to follow along so let's get
02:42 - started let me demo the game for you
02:45 - guys ok already here ok let me start
02:50 - here so if you can see I'm the ninja I
02:54 - can move back and forth I can use a 1
02:58 - number 1 to attack number 2 to throw the
03:02 - little knife number three I can fly down
03:05 - when I jump up some of jump is up left
03:10 - and right and you can jump and shoot the
03:16 - [Music]
03:18 - hitter 5 time so I come across I come
03:23 - down I got the gym so it open up the
03:27 - corner I can hold the photo once I come
03:31 - to the portal it goes to level 2 this is
03:33 - the timer here kind of to keep track of
03:35 - how long you are doing this stage when
03:38 - you complete the game so this is a
03:41 - multiple jump you can also use w SD SD
03:45 - as well I think
03:47 - like I'd like to use the arrow key here
03:50 - inside general cross okay I can attack
03:55 - them Medusa or I can come down at the
04:14 - gym now the portal comes down so you can
04:18 - also fly down like this with the glide
04:22 - so we were just trying it so the Medusa
04:26 - are still there the game so this is kind
04:36 - of how the game runs so this is a basic
04:40 - demo of the game as you can see you can
04:43 - make it a little bit more complicated
04:44 - and if you drop into the water you'll
04:46 - die I did not show that but or if you
04:49 - hit by Medusa you also die so let me
04:51 - just show you so if I drop underwater I
04:53 - came back to the starting spot and if I
04:56 - get hit by Tommy twosie
04:57 - this you can see I can lay down for a
05:01 - second and then I died the animation
05:03 - blinked okay alright let's stop this
05:09 - game we will start to walk on it before
05:12 - we start the game please like share and
05:15 - subscribe to our channel that will be

07:18 - of different kind you can use the one
07:20 - that I was using this this site so what
07:23 - you can do is you over here the cycle
07:26 - came out to the freebie HTML I'll put
07:30 - the link below and you can download this
07:32 - sprite so what I did was just click on

07:43 - you a zip file you can see that ninja
07:45 - adventure new leave that zip down the
07:48 - left corner right right here in the
07:51 - corner here when I hover my mouse so
07:53 - once you download that you cannot zip it
07:56 - and zip it up and then you can load them
07:58 - up okay so this is the ninja also you
08:04 - can download the platform so this is the
08:07 - tile you need tile set so this is the
08:09 - one die
08:10 - down low earlier the tileset for my game
08:14 - as you can see you can download this one
08:15 - the desert and something else these are
08:18 - free I know you can try it buy them and
08:21 - you know like if you want you can sign
08:24 - up and buy a better one

08:30 - one just to just to play around with it
08:33 - okay alright once you have download all
08:36 - that you have to zip unzip it out okay
08:40 - so once you unzip it you get something
08:43 - like this right the adventure ninja new
08:46 - this is the toy version as you can see a
08:50 - different attack right iffen you have a
08:55 - climbing also so we didn't do you have
08:59 - death that's the one that we used we
09:02 - have the attack we use that we have the
09:04 - kalaiy that is flying down and yet that
09:07 - I don't I mean he's standing there
09:09 - throwing you can use him his heads turn
09:11 - over around I think we're gonna use one
09:13 - of them then you have this jump you have
09:16 - a pack channel attack throw sly you know
09:20 - you're different kinda thing that you
09:22 - can use with this ninja so this is for
09:27 - the ninja so once you get the other one
09:30 - the other one is the let's say I think
09:35 - is the this one cow said yeah so power
09:41 - set here so this is the background it's
09:43 - called the PNG you didn't see background
09:46 - background was the this like a tree or
09:50 - something like that that's what we're
09:52 - using and then you can go to object
09:54 - knocked you get like tree the box the
09:57 - rock was still the sign right and you
10:00 - can go through the tile this is like how
10:01 - you just kind of put them together the
10:03 - water so this is the one that we were
10:06 - using okay so let's go back to our game
10:09 - okay so let's say you have yours cat you
10:14 - can delete this cat you say you can say
10:17 - paint new sprite what you can do is you
10:22 - can say upload
10:23 - here and you go to your costume for the
10:28 - ninja go to PNG you can see this ninja
10:32 - here so far ninja we need different one
10:38 - what we can do is we can use the death I
10:43 - think the death one that one is time or
10:47 - input all of them these cat so this one
10:52 - will give us all the ninja that died
10:55 - right
10:57 - and let's no more to this costume
11:02 - you cannot blow them all but I think you
11:04 - don't need them all and it will be way
11:05 - confusing and you can just take one of
11:08 - the idol let's say with I don't number 5
11:11 - we can say we add that guy in and we
11:16 - need some more we need the who only that
11:20 - half yet use that later now we can use
11:22 - the jump
11:23 - I think the jump we can use for the
11:27 - sprite and to the jump
11:31 - this is jump throw so you know be
11:33 - careful see which one it is the run we
11:36 - also need let's get the run first so run
11:39 - - run - run zero the one run nine okay
11:43 - we got them all
11:44 - okay and we upload some more let's look
11:49 - for the run so which one is wrong
11:52 - let's see run Oh run we got we got we
11:55 - need quit it jump right jump oh here it
11:58 - is jang ok-jung 0 to jump ok alright so
12:06 - this is the basic thing that we have 1
12:09 - inch we have the the one lady time right
12:14 - the one that he has the running and the
12:18 - one he is jumping wait and then there's
12:25 - one for idle I think somewhere let's
12:28 - move them up but I don't want we'll
12:29 - start with that guy ok
12:35 - run run okay here's okay let's move up
12:45 - okay
12:47 - all the way up to our first costume
12:51 - okay so we'll use this guy's our first
12:54 - costume for the ninja what you can do is
12:57 - you can like rename them if you want to
12:59 - show their name like I go to I five or
13:02 - something and this guy you can rename it
13:05 - to like the 0 the 1 and so on and so
13:12 - forth so you can just do more broke it
13:18 - [Music]
13:42 - okay as you can see I'm done with all
13:47 - the naming so let's go back up you can
13:50 - see i-5 is a Idol 5-0 to the nine I
13:57 - believe that's one is time you have a
13:59 - are 0-2 or nine that's running and then
14:05 - J 0 2 j 9 which is jumping so this is
14:09 - our main sprite now we'll name a ninja
14:14 - okay all right we have our ninja what we
14:19 - can do is that we're going to set his
14:21 - size at 25 so this is our ninja a little
14:24 - bit small so this is what we are going
14:27 - to do also we need to set up like the
14:31 - platform the background sending
14:35 - background we can just go to upload the
14:38 - background and you can go back to the
14:41 - way you downloaded the tile go to PNG
14:46 - background and you can select your
14:49 - background so once you send it back okay
14:52 - you have your background here right then
14:56 - you can put in like other stuff you know
14:59 - the platform which will create a sprite
15:03 - okay alright so for the platform what
15:09 - you can do it you can create pain as a
15:10 - sprite and then you can just upload the
15:15 - costume same thing go back down find
15:19 - this tile and then can upload more you
15:22 - want or you can do it one by one let's
15:24 - just say we upload them all let's say we
15:27 - have all this not of water water will be
15:29 - a separate sprite less okay so we upload
15:33 - more as you can see these are different
15:35 - one what you can do is you can convert
15:40 - it to a vector let's say I want to use
15:43 - this one the converted vector select
15:46 - this thing you can select him now let's
15:49 - say I want to kind of change it right I
15:51 - don't
15:52 - this one of trash this so also this one
15:55 - I want to use this one convective vector
15:57 - select him and you can kind of build
16:01 - them next light like let's say this is
16:05 - your platform right so you can make it
16:07 - come on go up and down make sure there
16:09 - or line up nicely okay so as you can see
16:13 - right I can do this out not complete
16:16 - vector again select him and you can fill
16:19 - them out so and so as you can see this
16:25 - is my one of my platform right so you
16:29 - see little gap here in here so you can
16:32 - fix that just move this so you can see
16:35 - so you have a platform something like
16:37 - this right and you can adjust size
16:39 - making it smaller or larger so let's say
16:42 - I want this will be here you know right
16:46 - so it will be somewhere here and then
16:49 - you can fill up the bottom of water and
16:51 - you can also add like let's say this one
16:54 - I want to add some longer one in the
16:58 - bottom then I went to Viktor like this
17:02 - go back to my frost one put this here
17:06 - come on resize it also and you can add
17:10 - it here so as you can see I almost done
17:15 - with my first block right then you have
17:17 - to get this one in the middle
17:20 - convert to vector copy that
17:23 - and you can move them here and you make
17:28 - it smaller a little bit as you can see
17:34 - just child it takes some time to get it
17:36 - all in so let's see okay and we can get
17:49 - the last piece on here convective vector
17:52 - copy this go back make this smaller kind
17:59 - of fit to this right
18:03 - so you can use up an arrow key as you
18:06 - can see this is my first block okay so
18:09 - that's how you make the platform right
18:11 - so in order to make the video shorter
18:14 - what I'm going to do is the upload my
18:18 - platform die alright have with the game
18:20 - I made earlier but for you guys you know
18:23 - if you're doing it for the first time
18:25 - just trying to go through and try to
18:27 - create any kind of level platform you
18:29 - like and once you're done you can just
18:32 - drag this anyway you want right like
18:33 - maybe here or here and then you can fill
18:36 - the water okay
18:39 - alright for now we'll stop here don't
18:43 - want to make the video too long and next
18:45 - time next lesson we'll continue and
18:47 - create our platform for the year for the
18:50 - sprite for the game okay alright see you
18:56 - guys next time thank you for watching
19:00 - [Music]
