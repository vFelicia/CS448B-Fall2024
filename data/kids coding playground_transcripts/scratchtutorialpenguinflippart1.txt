00:09 - hello everyone and welcome back to
00:11 - kids coding playground channel today
00:15 - we'll be making a new game called
00:17 - penguin flip this is more of a
00:20 - advanced uh topic on scratch
00:24 - it will be require you to have a good
00:26 - knowledge of scratch
00:27 - basic scratch programming if you
00:31 - do not have it i would not recommend
00:33 - this game yet
00:34 - you can check out the beginner and
00:36 - intermediate lesson
00:38 - the point of the game is to make the
00:41 - penguin
00:42 - flip up into the air and land it onto
00:44 - the
00:45 - iceberg so every time the penguin lands
00:48 - onto the iceberg
00:49 - you get some points so the skull will go
00:51 - up
00:52 - so we try to get the penguin onto the
00:54 - iceberg without dropping him into the
00:56 - water or hitting the edge
00:58 - if you drop into the water or hitting
01:00 - the edge on the top or the side
01:02 - then the penguin will lose the life here
01:05 - so
01:05 - as you can see right now the penguin has
01:07 - three lives so we want to keep the
01:09 - penguin
01:10 - off the from the water or hitting the
01:12 - edge we want to try to get them flip and
01:14 - then to turn to the
01:15 - um iceberg here to get the point
01:20 - so what will we be learning today here
01:22 - are some of the concepts we'll be
01:24 - learning
01:25 - we'll learning how to calculate the
01:26 - horizontal vertical
01:28 - speed and position so that means how
01:31 - how how far and how fast
01:35 - the penguin will be jumping up into the
01:37 - air and landing to the other side
01:39 - and we will be using repeat until loop
01:42 - um
01:42 - this is just a loop that we can use to
01:46 - make things
01:47 - uh do something over and over again
01:50 - we'll be learning a broadcasting message
01:53 - basically sending message from one
01:55 - sprite to another
01:57 - and also we'll be learning about
02:00 - pointing the
02:02 - object towards something
02:05 - this is basically the object is point to
02:09 - the let's say the penguin
02:10 - the arrows point or the penguin and you
02:13 - can move the arrow or the arrows
02:14 - pointing to the mouse
02:16 - those kind of uh functionality
02:19 - and also we will be learning to use
02:20 - random
02:22 - and we'll be using some custom blocks so
02:25 - this is a
02:26 - user defined code the blocks that you
02:30 - could make up a bunch of different code
02:33 - to form a
02:34 - single function and they could be reused
02:36 - over and over again
02:37 - in the in the in the code and we will be
02:41 - learning about our sensing
02:43 - touching the color uh uh this will be
02:46 - the
02:47 - sensing like the penguin touch the ice
02:49 - iceberg and it will land it
02:51 - so we'll be checking the color and also
02:54 - learning about broadcasting message
02:56 - between the sprite and how to change the
02:58 - broadcast like one
02:59 - broadcast go to the next the sprite will
03:01 - do something it will
03:03 - broadcast something then the other
03:05 - sprite will do something so this is kind
03:07 - of the basic uh
03:08 - the some of the things we'll be learning
03:11 - about the game
03:12 - so uh before i do that let me kind of
03:14 - show you how the game actually works
03:16 - so here is the uh sample game as you can
03:19 - see
03:20 - we i added something else else also the
03:23 - fish that kind of jump up and down
03:25 - between the
03:26 - block the ice block the penguin standing
03:28 - on and the iceberg
03:30 - so the fishes can go up and down the
03:32 - fish is the bonus uh
03:34 - point so you don't actually have to get
03:36 - the fish you can land on the iceberg
03:38 - without getting the fish but if you get
03:39 - the fish
03:40 - then you get more points so as you can
03:43 - see right now
03:43 - ten lives and zero score
03:47 - so as if i move the the arrow
03:50 - um closer to the penguin that means you
03:53 - know the
03:54 - the gap is less right between the uh the
03:56 - penguin and
03:57 - the arrow so the the distance he will
04:00 - jump is less
04:01 - and if i move uh lower the the the
04:04 - height is also less right the gap
04:06 - the vertical height is also less between
04:08 - the penguin and the arrow
04:10 - so it will jump less so i move it higher
04:12 - the penguin will jump higher and if i
04:14 - move further the penguin will jump
04:15 - further so the
04:16 - basically we're trying to find the gap
04:18 - between the arrow
04:20 - and the penguin so let's say if i do
04:22 - this
04:23 - right let's see right here so as you can
04:26 - see
04:27 - so the penguin flips and he landed on
04:29 - the iceberg
04:30 - so once he landed on iceberg he gets
04:32 - some points so uh the fish i think is 50
04:35 - bonus point and if you land on the
04:37 - iceberg you get 10 so it doesn't matter
04:39 - you can
04:40 - have anything you like so let me try
04:42 - again
04:43 - so if i landed you see
04:46 - again i get the fish and the ending
04:49 - point on the uh
04:50 - uh iceberg so let's say if i miss
04:53 - i want to see oh i got it again this
04:55 - cannot okay
04:57 - let me try it harder like if i put here
05:00 - right so the penguin will jump really
05:01 - far
05:02 - and very high so probably he gonna miss
05:04 - this time
05:05 - so let's see you see that so he missed
05:08 - so he missed then you don't
05:10 - get any point let's say do lower here
05:12 - right he fall into the water
05:14 - also you don't get any points and you
05:16 - lose your life
05:17 - so we will try to uh kind of jump the
05:21 - penguin and without losing your life and
05:23 - get onto the
05:24 - iceberg so this is kind of the point of
05:26 - the game
05:27 - so as you can see so every time you make
05:30 - it over so you can see you get 10 points
05:32 - so i did not catch the fish this time so
05:34 - i get 10 points
05:35 - and you want to keep the fish between
05:37 - the iceberg and the
05:39 - the block that the penguin is standing
05:41 - on so we'll be working on this game
05:43 - today
05:44 - all right
05:49 - be sure to click on like share
05:52 - subscribe and click on this notification
05:55 - bell
05:56 - to receive all the latest updates from
05:58 - this channel thank you
06:01 - all right guys so we'll begin the
06:04 - programming this uh
06:05 - game called penguin flip so
06:08 - uh let's rename this
06:14 - okay so this is a penguin flip i'll call
06:16 - it two because i already have penguin
06:18 - flip
06:18 - or i'm gonna confuse that so let me kind
06:21 - of zoom in a little bit here
06:24 - okay so before we begin we need to
06:26 - create some variable to help keep track
06:29 - of this game
06:30 - so we'll creating a total of a six
06:33 - variable
06:34 - each gap so this is the horizontal gap
06:37 - between the penguin and the arrow
06:41 - sprite and then we're gonna make one
06:44 - called each
06:45 - speed so so this one will
06:48 - calculate the speed uh how fast uh the
06:51 - penguin will move horizontally
06:54 - next we'll create one called v gap
06:57 - this is the vertical gap for the uh
07:00 - between the penguin and the arrow sprite
07:05 - and we'll make one more call v-speed
07:10 - so this is the vertical speed that the
07:12 - penguin will be traveling up
07:15 - and we'll make one more call uh
07:19 - lives so this is the number of dive the
07:21 - penguin have
07:23 - let's make one last one this one will be
07:26 - score so we'll keep track of the score
07:29 - for the penguin
07:30 - okay so my variable we don't really need
07:33 - it so we can delete that
07:35 - so uh this one you know you can show
07:38 - click on the checkbox to show up
07:40 - or you can uncheck it to hide it
07:43 - for debugging purposes like let's say
07:45 - you do something wrong in your code and
07:47 - you want to see what's going on you
07:48 - might have to have it checked
07:50 - uh but for now let's kind of remove this
07:52 - for now for us
07:53 - so we actually run into issue we'll try
07:56 - to take a look at that
07:58 - so maybe we'll put the score on this
07:59 - side and the live on this side
08:02 - so we have six of our variable that
08:04 - we're gonna keep track of
08:06 - so next we're gonna draw the backdrop so
08:09 - the backdrop is gonna kind of draw the
08:11 - ocean or something
08:12 - so we'll go to here and then we'll click
08:15 - on this here
08:17 - and then we can check the field uh what
08:20 - we can do is we can use the one here on
08:22 - the
08:22 - middle here this kind of feel like the
08:26 - top
08:26 - is a little bit darker and then bottom
08:28 - will be a little bit lighter
08:30 - so we can do like two sets of color on
08:33 - the same
08:34 - same field so for this uh the left
08:37 - left side will click on the left side
08:39 - first this is the top portion
08:41 - i will try and make it blue so let's see
08:46 - let's see a 60 maybe
08:49 - it doesn't really matter which one it is
08:52 - close enough should be good enough so
08:54 - once you're trying to make this
08:57 - here even number it's kind of hard to
09:00 - get to
09:01 - 60 exactly 62 is fine
09:04 - i will make this brightness
09:09 - about here
09:12 - all right 87. so this is darker blue
09:17 - so and then this side will make it
09:20 - lighter so this will will make it like
09:24 - maybe
09:30 - 57 like this a little bit
09:37 - 35 and 100 so this is a little bit
09:40 - lighter
09:41 - so now we kind of have a dark field in
09:43 - the light field and maybe we'll take
09:44 - this
09:45 - out we don't want the outline so what
09:48 - we're going to do is we're going to draw
09:49 - a rectangular box
09:54 - oops it fills up all my things okay
10:02 - so i made a mistake over here so i
10:04 - should have drawn the box first and then
10:06 - change the color because that kind of
10:08 - messed it up when i moved to the box
10:10 - it's trying to change it to back to
10:12 - solid
10:12 - so that's one mistake i did so hopefully
10:16 - you guys will not make this mistake
10:18 - let's draw the box first actually
10:22 - so we're gonna draw the box we're gonna
10:23 - try to put it all the way on top drag it
10:26 - out
10:26 - so we'll cover the whole screen now
10:28 - we'll fix this
10:29 - now we'll go to the fix the color now so
10:32 - earlier i must kind of mess that up
10:35 - now we will try to fix it
10:40 - i will go 6185.87
10:44 - here we'll use 57 or something
10:54 - it's a little hard to drag this out the
10:56 - way that you want
10:57 - but something close enough should be
11:00 - okay
11:03 - okay all right here we go so now we have
11:07 - this
11:08 - this fill color so you see the top piece
11:11 - is a little bit darker blue
11:13 - and the bottom piece is a little bit
11:15 - lighter blue so it's kind of
11:16 - make it a two two color background
11:20 - like a fill okay so next so
11:23 - we have the color done right so now
11:26 - we're gonna draw the ocean
11:28 - piece in the bottom so make it a little
11:30 - bit darker
11:31 - color so we'll try to use the same color
11:34 - as the uh
11:35 - as this uh this this here this this dark
11:38 - side
11:39 - so 61 85 87 we'll try to do something
11:42 - similar
11:44 - so we're going to draw a little bar down
11:47 - here
11:48 - i'm going to extend this out a little
11:50 - bit
11:51 - so now we can have the ocean floor
11:56 - so we'll have 61.857 you have to
11:58 - automatically select it for us so we are
12:00 - good
12:01 - so we're done with the background with
12:02 - the sky and the ocean
12:06 - okay so next we're gonna have to draw
12:07 - this ice block so um
12:10 - what we can do is we're gonna create a
12:13 - new sprite click here
12:15 - click on this paint this will create a
12:18 - new sprite for us
12:20 - so here uh what we can do is we're going
12:23 - to select the color
12:25 - so for white color we're going to bring
12:27 - this to 0
12:29 - bring that saturation 0 and make that to
12:31 - 100
12:33 - and be sure to click no outline so that
12:35 - you could get the
12:37 - white box so as you can see i'm trying
12:40 - to put it in the middle
12:41 - right here in this little square here in
12:43 - the middle
12:44 - right so now i have my uh white box so
12:47 - this is the
12:47 - ice block that uh we will put the
12:50 - penguin on
12:51 - okay and we can rename this to
12:55 - ice block
12:58 - okay so the penguin has a his block to
13:00 - sit on
13:01 - or stand on we'll move it somewhere
13:03 - maybe here on this side here
13:06 - floating in the water okay
13:10 - all right so next
13:14 - we will work on the iceberg so we're
13:17 - going to draw an ice bucket as well
13:19 - alright so we are going to draw the
13:21 - iceberg now
13:22 - um what we can do is right click on this
13:25 - and duplicate so put it somewhere
13:29 - here okay
13:32 - so this iceberg here will rename it to
13:40 - iceberg now inside this iceberg
13:43 - we are going to change it a little bit
13:45 - make it a little bit smaller
13:47 - don't change the height just changing
13:49 - the width
13:51 - okay one more to the middle here
13:54 - so next we'll draw the line so for the
13:57 - line we're gonna increase this to
13:59 - maybe three and we're gonna
14:02 - we will going to change the color of the
14:04 - line make it
14:05 - um let's say 60
14:10 - and then this is we'll put it at 75
14:14 - maybe
14:15 - 75 76 we'll do 100
14:21 - so now we have this good nice blue line
14:24 - so we will draw the line
14:26 - up and down so every time you draw
14:28 - you'll see a little
14:30 - little dot we're trying to connect those
14:31 - so what we can do is this you start
14:33 - from the base here so you
14:36 - draw the line up
14:40 - you see this little dot connect down
14:42 - down a little bit
14:44 - draw the line up again
14:48 - see little dot connect down again
14:51 - so you try and make a shape of a little
14:54 - eyes
14:54 - it doesn't really have to be perfect and
14:58 - down again and one more
15:04 - and then down again okay
15:07 - so now i'm going to connect this to in
15:09 - here
15:11 - so now we have a little
15:15 - eyes um iceberg kind of thing right i
15:18 - think my line is not really straight
15:20 - so let me see if i can undo that last
15:24 - piece
15:28 - so oops
15:34 - so let's change it back to three i don't
15:36 - know how it changed back to one
15:38 - so sometimes they do mess that up
15:41 - so let me do my line again i'm gonna
15:45 - go on a little bit further a little bit
15:50 - because i did not do it to the end over
15:52 - here
16:00 - okay now if i want to connect these two
16:02 - lines straight you can
16:03 - click on this and hold down the hold
16:05 - down the what you call it the um
16:08 - the shift key
16:11 - and then let's see we can connect this
16:13 - okay all right
16:14 - so good enough right a little bit
16:16 - slanted i think i did a better job on my
16:18 - first
16:19 - uh when i made the game so anyway so as
16:22 - you can see you can
16:23 - kind of connect them all so let's now
16:25 - let's go to fill
16:26 - so we're going to fill it with a
16:28 - different color inside maybe we can fill
16:30 - it with a lighter color
16:32 - inside so here we'll
16:35 - do the fill
16:38 - so maybe we'll do 60 we can just feel
16:42 - solid
16:44 - let's say 60 maybe
16:49 - 60 61 um 75
16:55 - and we'll do 70
17:00 - okay so
17:04 - here
17:10 - okay we can say fill
17:15 - right and
17:20 - the outline we can go back click on this
17:23 - you can change down into a different
17:24 - color
17:25 - but um whatever color you like you can
17:28 - have like two colors as you can see
17:29 - inside darker outside lighter but if you
17:32 - wanted
17:33 - lighter inside we can change that maybe
17:36 - you can
17:37 - do something brighter here
17:41 - this will be lighter right
17:45 - so we'll fill it again so you can see
17:48 - the
17:49 - the so just play around with your color
17:51 - whatever you like
17:53 - so um but uh so we have two colors
17:56 - so this one outside we can click on this
17:59 - and then you can change it to a
18:00 - different color if you want
18:03 - so this one um maybe we can change it to
18:06 - a little bit
18:08 - over here
18:15 - okay i'll go down a little bit
18:19 - okay so we have a darker blue and a
18:22 - lighter blue
18:24 - right okay so now we have done the
18:27 - iceberg so we have both the ice block
18:30 - and the iceberg right
18:34 - so let me um so next we'll go on and
18:38 - work on
18:38 - getting the penguin and the the arrow
18:42 - sprite
18:43 - next so uh we'll stop right here for
18:46 - right now
18:46 - so um we'll continue on the next next
18:52 - [Music]
18:54 - lesson
19:00 - you
