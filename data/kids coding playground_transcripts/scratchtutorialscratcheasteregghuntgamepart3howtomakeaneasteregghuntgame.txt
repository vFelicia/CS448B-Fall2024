00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys the kids coding around
00:08 - here and today we'll be doing the final
00:10 - part of our easter egg hunt game
00:12 - so
00:13 - recap from last time what we did so we
00:15 - did the ground
00:16 - in the last video we did the ground and
00:19 - we also did the background scrolling
00:21 - in this tutorial and the background yeah
00:23 - forgot about that
00:24 - and in this tutorial we'll be working on
00:26 - the eggs
00:28 - and we will also be working on the left
00:29 - and right arrow keys so when you press
00:31 - down the keys it will show which way
00:33 - you're going to make the game look a
00:35 - little bit better so without further ado
00:37 - let's get into the project
00:38 - so first let's get into choose the
00:41 - sprite right we have the arrows so we
00:44 - have the right arrow key so we're just
00:46 - gonna name this
00:47 - right
00:48 - and then we can just uh go to the
00:50 - costumes
00:51 - delete all the other costumes and then
00:54 - we can just import another one another
00:56 - arrows we're just gonna name this one
00:58 - oops
01:00 - and then this one left
01:03 - and then we're just gonna go costumes
01:04 - and delete all the other ones
01:08 - so now we have our right and left arrow
01:10 - keys
01:11 - okay
01:12 - so remember when we broadcasted the
01:14 - message move rights and move left and
01:16 - hide arrow from the player we're going
01:18 - to be using them right now
01:19 - so in the right arrow key we're going to
01:21 - first we're going to get a one grid flag
01:22 - clicked let's go full screen
01:25 - uh we're gonna go zoom in so we're gonna
01:26 - set the position to 200 and then the y
01:30 - would be zero
01:31 - and then we're going to clear the
01:32 - graphic effects in the beginning because
01:33 - we will be using graphics effects in
01:35 - this arrows so when you move it will
01:37 - change color effect
01:38 - so then we're going to hide
01:40 - hide that and then when i receive
01:43 - move right arrow from the player
01:46 - that move right then we're going to
01:48 - broadcast a message we're going to name
01:49 - it hide left so basically we want to
01:51 - make it so you can only have one arrow
01:53 - showing at a time so people can't click
01:55 - both arrows at the same time and have
01:56 - them both show up so it won't look good
01:58 - so we're gonna make a message called
02:00 - hide left
02:01 - and then hide left and then we're gonna
02:03 - go to the front layer
02:06 - go to front layer so we have go to front
02:09 - layer
02:10 - and then next we're going to change
02:11 - color effect by one
02:14 - and then after that we're going to show
02:17 - and after that we're going to do when i
02:19 - receive
02:21 - hide arrow we're going to clear graphic
02:23 - effects that's when it's not moving
02:26 - then you'll get height arrow so i'll
02:28 - clear all graphic effects and then we'll
02:29 - hide
02:31 - now let's move on to our left arrow key
02:36 - so into our left arrow key we're going
02:38 - to get the same thing pretty much the
02:40 - same thing right here so right here
02:42 - drag and drop that
02:44 - uh right here drag and drop that
02:47 - and then right here we can drag and drop
02:48 - that except we have to change some stuff
02:50 - obviously
02:51 - so we're going to zoom in
02:54 - right here we're going to make it go to
02:55 - negative 200 instead because the left
02:57 - arrow key
02:58 - and then when i receive hide arrow this
03:00 - is the same and then instead we're going
03:02 - to do when i receive move left
03:05 - and then we're going to broadcast hide
03:06 - right instead of hide left so when
03:09 - you're moving to the left you're going
03:10 - to hide the right arrow
03:11 - so we're going to broadcast a new
03:12 - message we're going to name it hide
03:14 - right
03:16 - and then we're going to go to front
03:17 - that's the same okay and then right here
03:20 - since uh when you're using the right
03:22 - arrow key you have to hide the left
03:23 - arrow so we're gonna receive when i
03:25 - receive hide left
03:26 - clear graphic effects and hide
03:29 - so oops i meant to duplicate that
03:32 - duplicate that
03:34 - like that
03:35 - and apparently 91.1 percent of you that
03:38 - are watching this video are not
03:40 - subscribed so please subscribe to our
03:42 - channel
03:43 - it really helped to support our channel
03:46 - and leave a like if you enjoyed watching
03:48 - this video
03:49 - alright so we just finished our left
03:50 - arrow key let's move on to the right
03:52 - arrow key so in the left arrow key it
03:54 - broadcasts a message so we're gonna when
03:56 - i receive hide right
03:57 - so when you're using the left arrow keys
03:59 - you have to hide the right one so we're
04:00 - just going to duplicate this
04:02 - and put it there
04:03 - okay so now we'll save it and let's run
04:06 - it
04:07 - so as you can see when you move to the
04:08 - right the arrow is on the right side
04:10 - showing
04:11 - and it's changing color effects and then
04:14 - when you move to the left it's showing
04:15 - on the left side and changing color
04:17 - effect and you can't hold them both down
04:18 - at the same time
04:20 - uh when you press them both down it'll
04:21 - just go to one of them
04:23 - so as you can see it's working
04:25 - now let's go into our backdrop so we're
04:27 - going to get some code in our backdrop
04:29 - so
04:30 - uh in our scrolling platformer video we
04:33 - showed that um when you like want to
04:35 - place like a backdrop i mean not a
04:38 - platform or like some item in a certain
04:40 - position we're gonna put a script so
04:43 - where you press the m button
04:45 - it's going to uh it's gonna like go to
04:47 - that position of your mouse
04:49 - so you know exactly where to place
04:50 - everything so what we're gonna do is
04:53 - when key m is pressed so we're gonna get
04:55 - m
04:56 - so when key m is pressed we're gonna go
04:58 - full screen
04:59 - and then we're gonna set
05:01 - the g mouse position right here so we're
05:04 - gonna basically just join this
05:06 - we're gonna join
05:08 - this with the mouse x plus the scroll gx
05:12 - g scroll x so
05:13 - we're going to join
05:15 - and then we're going to add mouse x so
05:18 - wherever the position of the mouse is
05:20 - plus
05:21 - the g scroll x
05:23 - and then we're just gonna get another
05:25 - join so we're gonna get another join
05:27 - right here
05:28 - we're gonna put a comma
05:29 - comma space
05:32 - and then we're gonna get the mouse y
05:36 - uh and then we're gonna get the
05:38 - uh that's why right here okay that's all
05:40 - you have to do
05:42 - so
05:43 - and then we're gonna show the variable
05:44 - yeah forget about that we're gonna show
05:46 - it
05:46 - so when you go right here you press m
05:49 - it'll go to wherever the position you
05:52 - are is
05:53 - your mouse is
05:55 - so basically it just makes it easier so
05:58 - when you're placing
05:59 - uh things like objects to collect
06:02 - collectibles and platforms you know
06:04 - where to place them so we're going to
06:06 - use this code to like place all of our
06:08 - eggs
06:10 - you can save the project
06:12 - now let's go into our eggs
06:14 - and let's place our clones
06:18 - all right
06:19 - so inside our eggs first we're going to
06:20 - get our one here if i clicked
06:23 - so when green flag is clicked we're
06:25 - gonna set
06:26 - a new variable so we're gonna make it
06:28 - egg
06:29 - found eggs found
06:31 - so eggs found
06:32 - so make it for all sprites so we're
06:34 - gonna set xfound to zero
06:36 - and we're gonna hide
06:39 - and then we're going to copy some of
06:41 - this code from here the place clones
06:43 - we're gonna need that so
06:45 - we can just drag and drop that into the
06:47 - eggs
06:48 - and then the position we'll take that as
06:50 - well
06:52 - uh we also need the reset
06:56 - and i think that's pretty much it for it
06:58 - let me go back to here
07:00 - let's get this all
07:03 - so this part stays the same
07:05 - this is just a scrolling and then right
07:06 - here we have the place clones
07:09 - so we're going to do place clone at x
07:11 - and y so we're going to do instead of
07:12 - multiplying we're just going to put the
07:14 - x and y
07:15 - and then instead right here we're going
07:16 - to take out the go to and then we have
07:18 - this
07:19 - and then we're just going to
07:21 - put that right here create color myself
07:22 - and we're going to change color effect
07:24 - by 25 so all the eggs vary in color
07:27 - so here we have this code
07:29 - and then next we're going to do a when i
07:31 - start as a clone so
07:34 - uh we're going to move this down here
07:37 - so we have now that
07:38 - and then when i start as a clone
07:42 - we are going to go to the x and y
07:45 - so basically we're going to go to the x
07:47 - and y
07:49 - and then we're going to show it
07:51 - show the egg
07:54 - and then we're going to wait until it's
07:56 - touching the mouse pointer and mouse
07:57 - down so basically you just want to wait
07:59 - until you're clicking on the egg so
08:01 - we're going to do wait until
08:03 - and then we're going to use an end
08:06 - so we're going to wait until touching
08:08 - mouse pointer so we're going to make
08:09 - sure it's touching the mouse pointer and
08:10 - you're clicking down on it and then
08:12 - we're going to start a sound pop so
08:14 - we're going to play sound when you click
08:15 - on it and then we're going to change the
08:17 - number of eggs found by one
08:19 - and then after that we're going to
08:20 - broadcast a message we're going to name
08:22 - it check score we're going to be using
08:24 - this later to check your score
08:27 - to see if it's illegible to win because
08:29 - you need 12 eggs to win
08:31 - and then after that we're gonna delete
08:33 - this clone after you click on it
08:36 - all right next
08:37 - we're gonna get a
08:39 - the scrolling so we're going to receive
08:41 - move ground
08:44 - move ground then i'm just going to get
08:46 - the position
08:48 - and then we're going to do that x minus
08:50 - the g scroll x
08:53 - x minus g scroll x
08:57 - and then we're gonna put the y
09:00 - all right
09:01 - and then next we're gonna have to do the
09:02 - clones so we're gonna have to uh place
09:04 - the clones
09:05 - we're gonna do when i receive setup
09:09 - when i receive setup
09:11 - we are going to
09:12 - set x
09:14 - and we're going to set the y set x and
09:16 - we're also going to set the y
09:18 - both to zero and then we're going to go
09:20 - to the front layer
09:22 - make the eggs go to the front
09:25 - put this down here
09:26 - and then we're going to go backwards one
09:27 - layer so we want to make it go to the
09:28 - front and then back so like we want to
09:30 - make it behind some stuff but in front
09:32 - of others
09:33 - and after that we're going to place some
09:34 - clones so what you do is
09:37 - basically you just move around oh let's
09:39 - say you want to put a clone right here
09:41 - for example maybe you want to put a
09:43 - coloner here right
09:44 - so you would put the m and then you
09:46 - would put
09:48 - the place clone and then you would put
09:50 - 92
09:52 - negative 89.
09:54 - oops i wasn't clicking on it 92 and then
09:56 - negative 89.
09:59 - so here we have
10:01 - place the clone so when you play it it's
10:03 - going to place a clone right there
10:06 - so that's what you want to do
10:08 - so basically just repeat this 12 times
10:11 - until you have enough
10:13 - um
10:14 - you repeat 12 times and then place it in
10:16 - places where you want it and that's
10:18 - pretty much it
10:20 - for the eggs i'm just gonna get my own
10:22 - positions and put them in here
10:26 - okay so now we have all my clones placed
10:29 - down so these are the positions i had
10:31 - for my other game
10:32 - so you don't have to make it the same
10:35 - thing as mine
10:36 - but these are the places where i wanted
10:38 - to put my eggs
10:39 - um this is like wherever you want to put
10:41 - it
10:42 - um
10:43 - depends where you want to put it so
10:44 - let's play it so there you have an egg
10:47 - right there egg exit as you can see it's
10:49 - like
10:50 - visible but like it's uh some of it may
10:52 - be a little bit harder to find
10:54 - like the one in the tree like this one
10:56 - right here
10:58 - yeah so this one right there so yes
11:00 - basically where i put all my eggs
11:03 - and next after you do this we're gonna
11:05 - have to hide it
11:06 - and then we're gonna set
11:08 - the x
11:11 - to negative 999 to move it off the
11:13 - screen once you're done
11:16 - all right
11:17 - so
11:18 - let's
11:19 - go back to normal and let's
11:23 - so i just zoomed out these as all the
11:25 - code in the eggs so if you want to take
11:28 - a look at it
11:30 - so we have all these and then here we
11:32 - have all the clone placements
11:34 - okay
11:35 - so next we have to work on our you win
11:38 - so
11:39 - to win you have to get 12 eggs so we're
11:41 - gonna do the code for that
11:43 - okay so in our you win sprite we're
11:45 - gonna first
11:46 - we're gonna get one green flag clicked
11:50 - so when the green flag is clicked we're
11:51 - gonna hide
11:54 - and then when i receive check score
11:56 - remember that so here we're gonna check
11:58 - the score to see if the player is okay
12:00 - to win so basically if you find all of
12:03 - them then they'll let the player win so
12:05 - we're gonna wait until
12:08 - wait until egg found is equal to 12. so
12:12 - we're going to wait until the eggs found
12:13 - is equal to 12.
12:15 - 12 eggs is the maximum amount and then
12:17 - we're going to broadcast a message we're
12:19 - going to name it you win
12:23 - you win
12:24 - and then next we're gonna do make it go
12:26 - to the front layer
12:28 - go to front
12:30 - go to zero zero
12:33 - and then we're gonna show it
12:35 - and then we're gonna stop all
12:39 - stuff all so here we have the uin
12:42 - and then one more thing in the
12:42 - background we're going to make a timer
12:44 - so you can time yourself and you can try
12:46 - to speed run it
12:47 - so we're going to get a when our green
12:50 - flag is clicked
12:52 - when your flag is clicked we're going to
12:53 - reset the timer
12:55 - and then forever loop
12:58 - i'm going to go forever set the time
13:01 - we're going to make a new variable
13:02 - forgot to make it time
13:05 - time
13:07 - and then we're gonna set the time
13:10 - uh to the timer
13:12 - and sensing
13:14 - and then we're gonna when i receive
13:17 - uh you win so when you when i receive
13:20 - you win
13:21 - then we're going to stop other scripts
13:22 - in the sprite
13:25 - stop other scripts in the sprite and
13:26 - then we're going to do an if-else
13:28 - statement so this is a check if you have
13:30 - the fastest time so
13:32 - if the fastest time we're gonna make a
13:34 - new variable that's gonna be a cloud
13:36 - variable
13:37 - so we're gonna make it
13:39 - fastest time so basically this is
13:42 - basically a high score so we're gonna
13:44 - set the if the fastest time is equal to
13:47 - zero then we're going to set the fastest
13:49 - time
13:51 - to the time so basically if there's no
13:53 - fastest time it'll set the next high
13:54 - score i mean the next score to the
13:56 - fastest time
13:57 - and then we're going to get if then
13:58 - cement
14:01 - so if
14:02 - the time is less than
14:05 - so if the timer is less than the fastest
14:08 - time so if you have a faster time than
14:09 - the fastest time then we'll set the
14:11 - fastest time to the time
14:14 - okay so now this is like a high score
14:16 - and then finally we add our music
14:19 - and we're gonna set the volume to 25
14:24 - and the music we're going to add is none
14:26 - other than eggs
14:28 - the song eggs from the stretch
14:30 - library
14:33 - right here this one
14:36 - okay we're using this one all right
14:38 - so eggs we're just gonna get a forever
14:40 - loop
14:42 - and we're just gonna
14:44 - play some
14:45 - eggs until time
14:48 - okay
14:49 - let's save this uh project
14:52 - hide all the variables that we will not
14:53 - need
14:55 - so eggs found we can keep that time put
14:58 - that like right here
15:01 - and the fastest time maybe in the bottom
15:03 - so then it looks better
15:07 - okay let's try it
15:10 - so stop
15:12 - oh yeah and i forgot we can delete the
15:14 - black dot that was just to show you guys
15:17 - how it works like how the scrolling
15:18 - works so we're just going to delete the
15:20 - black dot
15:21 - delete the costume
15:23 - so we just have nothing in the costume
15:26 - and we don't need this at all we can
15:28 - just delete all this delete this
15:30 - alright now let's save it and then let's
15:33 - play it
15:34 - let's turn on the volume a little bit
15:35 - because it's a little bit too loud
15:38 - so
15:39 - scroll around there's an egg right here
15:42 - and we're here i'm just going to try
15:44 - finding all the eggs
15:47 - oh forgot an egg right there four
15:51 - uh
15:52 - five i already got that one six
15:56 - seven
15:58 - eight
15:59 - nine
16:01 - ten
16:02 - [Music]
16:05 - eleven and one in the tree
16:07 - so as you can see when you get all of
16:08 - them you win and right here as you can
16:10 - see right here
16:12 - in the ground
16:13 - uh
16:15 - right here we can just receive the
16:17 - message when i receive
16:19 - the message uh you win we can just
16:22 - delete all the clones
16:24 - so then this will go away
16:28 - so yeah that's pretty much our project
16:31 - the easter egg hunt in scratch
16:34 - um if you enjoyed this video be sure to
