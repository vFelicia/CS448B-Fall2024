01:07 - bad hit
01:09 - you can also play this if you'd like to
01:11 - search up july 4th baseball
01:15 - on google i think they'll show up i
01:17 - think this is a double yeah
01:19 - we got two runs
01:22 - uh white hats these are the probably the
01:24 - easiest to get
01:26 - [Music]
01:28 - oh yellow hat all right there's also a
01:31 - red hat which there's like a really fast
01:32 - ball
01:33 - it's really hard to hit i'm really bad
01:35 - with hitting those
01:37 - alright let's go that's pretty far
01:41 - actually 900 feet
01:45 - blue hat i throw it high boom another
01:48 - home run
01:50 - see how much runs i can get i don't
01:52 - think i'll be beating the
01:54 - uh world record anytime soon but i'll
01:56 - just try to get a high score
01:57 - i guess my personal high score i think
01:59 - my personal high score was like
02:01 - like 40 or 50. i don't really remember i
02:04 - haven't played this game in a really
02:05 - long time
02:08 - got double that's nice
02:13 - all right that's a that's a run
02:14 - definitely that's a run
02:17 - [Music]
02:18 - purple oh i hate these guys the ball
02:20 - becomes invisible as it gets closer
02:25 - 12 runs so far okay
02:28 - high ball oh that's that hit that's a
02:31 - single
02:32 - that's all right
02:38 - all right so next oh no it's a red hat
02:41 - oh let's go we hit it we hit it that's
02:43 - that those are actually kind of hard to
02:44 - hit
02:45 - i didn't think i would hit that thought
02:46 - that'd be now
02:49 - purple one all right got a double that's
02:52 - fine
02:58 - single
03:02 - oh no i i missed time that that was bad
03:05 - okay lettuce and lemonade are lefties i
03:07 - think so
03:08 - oh yeah we have homeroom lettuce
03:12 - oh cherry these guys are good so if you
03:14 - gotta run with them you'll count miss
03:15 - two
03:15 - because there's two of them so if i get
03:18 - her oh there's lemonade
03:22 - [Applause]
03:25 - all right um let's go we got another
03:29 - home run
03:30 - okay three more runs that's great four
03:33 - four runs oh yeah cherry counts as two
03:37 - that's a double
03:43 - haven't got a single out so far i'm
03:44 - surprised i'm doing this green i've
03:46 - played this game in a while too
03:49 - another home run
03:53 - apple wait they gave us a white one
03:56 - actually
03:56 - okay that's that's a home run that's
03:58 - good that's actually pretty far again
04:00 - 900 feet these are probably the easiest
04:04 - to hit the blue hats
04:05 - or the white ones yeah
04:09 - yellow alright we got a couple that's
04:12 - one
04:13 - that's another run purple
04:16 - second that's a double double yeah let's
04:18 - go to second uh

04:48 - probably gonna get an
04:48 - out if they do
04:52 - purple they haven't given me a red hat
04:54 - in a while actually i'm pretty lucky
04:56 - oh there's a red head oh i have to hit

05:01 - i actually hit that those are really
05:03 - hard to hit

05:39 - [Music]
05:41 - [Applause]
05:42 - i i try i'll try not to get out on these
05:46 - ones because like these are probably way
05:48 - easier than hitting the red ones
