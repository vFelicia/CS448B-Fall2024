00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here
00:10 - today we will be making a dodge game in
00:12 - scratch
00:13 - so basically you move use your mouse to
00:15 - move the player around
00:17 - the screen and if it touches the edge
00:19 - then you lose or if it touches
00:21 - any of the enemy blocks moving in then
00:24 - you also lose and it's a timer
00:25 - showing how long you survive so i'm
00:27 - going to
00:29 - put a demonstration of the game so
00:32 - um there's like a little countdown at
00:34 - the beginning
00:35 - so use the mouse pointer to move around
00:37 - the player
00:38 - as you can see and then there's blocks
00:41 - go different speeds
00:43 - it's kind of like the same concept in
00:44 - rock blaster how the rocks move
00:46 - towards the player so let's say you
00:49 - touch the edge
00:50 - it'll say game over and the timer will
00:51 - stop let's say you hit an
00:53 - object so we'll i'll hit object and show
00:56 - you
00:57 - what happened as well so as you can see
00:58 - you hit it you'll see game over
01:00 - and also we can actually make this game
01:02 - over sprite go to the front layer
01:03 - i should have done that earlier but
01:05 - we'll add that in the code as we work in
01:07 - this tutorial so
01:08 - without further ado let's start a new
01:10 - project
01:13 - all right so in the new project i'm
01:14 - going to rename the name of the game to
01:16 - dodge
01:17 - game all right i don't really have a
01:18 - name for it right now but i'm just going
01:20 - to call it dodge game
01:21 - delete the scratch cat we don't need it
01:23 - i'm going to draw my own sprite so you
01:26 - we will not be needing to put any
01:28 - sprites
01:29 - for you to download we're just going to
01:31 - be drawing simple
01:32 - objects so i'm just going to draw a
01:35 - really simple
01:35 - um square hold down shift and you'll get
01:38 - a perfect square remember
01:40 - so we gotta center the sprite i'm gonna
01:42 - hold that alt so i can make it a little
01:43 - bit smaller
01:44 - all right perfect so that's the perfect
01:46 - size
01:47 - like a square like that and then we'll
01:49 - rename the sprite to player all right
01:51 - and then we'll make a new sprite called
01:53 - enemies
01:54 - and it's basically just a long red block
01:59 - maybe that long yeah
02:03 - we can shrink it a little as well
02:08 - let's make it a little bit smaller
02:13 - um maybe a little bit bigger actually
02:14 - because that's a little bit too small
02:16 - okay that's better that size is fine
02:18 - okay you guys can
02:20 - um put it any size you want i'm just
02:21 - gonna do this
02:23 - hopefully it's entered yeah it's
02:24 - centered great
02:26 - all right so next so now we have both
02:29 - these sprites
02:30 - the player and the enemy we're gonna
02:32 - start coding inside
02:33 - the hallway oh there's a small dot right
02:37 - here i got a delete
02:38 - that's why it's looking a little bit
02:39 - weird right there so
02:42 - now we have the two sprites i'm gonna
02:43 - rename this red to
02:45 - enemies and red block and then we're
02:48 - gonna start coding inside the player
02:50 - so inside the player we are going to get
02:51 - a one green flag clicked
02:53 - let's zoom in a little when green flag
02:56 - clicked we're going to
02:57 - make the player go to zero zero
03:00 - and hide all right
03:05 - and then after that we're going to so
03:07 - like
03:08 - in the demonstration i showed you guys
03:11 - that
03:11 - in the beginning there's a little
03:12 - countdown so i'm going to make that
03:13 - right now so i'm going to make a new
03:15 - sprite
03:16 - um do text so inside the text we're
03:20 - going to make three
03:21 - four sprites sorry i'm gonna make it
03:23 - some black text
03:24 - i'm gonna make three so it's gonna be
03:27 - like a countdown so i make it bigger
03:30 - about that big that's
03:33 - fine we can maybe a little bit smaller
03:36 - all right and then we can just duplicate
03:37 - this and then
03:40 - and write two
03:43 - and centered and then we duplicate it
03:44 - again and we write one
03:46 - so it's like a countdown before the game
03:50 - starts
03:52 - uh century it's all centered and then
03:54 - we'll duplicate it one more time
03:56 - and then we'll write start
04:00 - start and then center this i'm going to
04:02 - make it a little bit smaller because
04:03 - it's a little bit too big
04:06 - okay that's that's fine so now we have
04:08 - the three costumes let's rename the
04:10 - costumes this is gonna be three
04:12 - there's gonna be two it's gonna be one
04:14 - and this is gonna be start
04:17 - all right so inside the code for this
04:20 - we are going to get a one green flag
04:22 - clicked
04:23 - we are going to show in the beginning we
04:26 - want to show this
04:27 - we wanted to go to the zero zero that
04:29 - origin
04:30 - as well and then after this we wanted to
04:33 - switch costume
04:35 - to three so we wanted to start from the
04:38 - largest number and then
04:39 - go smaller three two one and then start
04:42 - so we're going to do this wait one
04:45 - second
04:46 - and then and then we're gonna switch
04:48 - costume two
04:49 - wait one second and then we're gonna
04:51 - switch the costume to costume
04:53 - one wait one more second
04:56 - and we're going to switch the costume to
04:59 - start
04:59 - remember start and then wait one more
05:01 - second before broadcasting the message
05:04 - start i'm gonna broadcast a message new
05:06 - message name it start
05:08 - and then we're going to hide after it's
05:10 - done
05:12 - all right so with the start thing we're
05:13 - going to go back to the player
05:16 - and inside the player when i receive the
05:18 - start message
05:20 - we're going to show
05:23 - we're going to show the sprite's going
05:24 - to show and then we're going to get a
05:26 - forever loop
05:27 - forever we're going to make this go to
05:29 - the mouse so we're going to
05:32 - go to uh set a set x
05:36 - to mouse x and we're also going to
05:39 - do set y to mouse y
05:43 - so as you can see when you play it
05:45 - there's going to be a countdown three
05:47 - two
05:47 - one start so now it'll follow
05:51 - the mouse pointer as you can see
05:54 - all right and then next we're going to
05:56 - make a new variable
05:57 - we're going to name it timer timer so
06:01 - it's just the timer running in the back
06:03 - so we're going to do a one green flag
06:05 - click
06:06 - set the variable timer to zero set the
06:10 - variable timer
06:11 - to zero and then we're going to get a
06:13 - forever loop
06:14 - so we're going to make it if the player
06:16 - touches the edge then you lose so
06:17 - forever
06:19 - if touching edge in the player
06:24 - then we will broadcast a message called
06:26 - game over and we'll work on it later
06:28 - once we make
06:28 - a game over sprite so game over
06:32 - and after that we're going to receive
06:34 - one more start so when i receive start
06:36 - we're going to reset timer and
06:40 - we're going to forever because the timer
06:42 - keeps on running so
06:44 - when the game starts we want to reset it
06:45 - again so and then after that we're going
06:47 - to forever
06:48 - set the variable timer
06:51 - to the sensing block timer so that's how
06:54 - you make the timer
06:56 - all right so let's save it let's run it
06:59 - so
06:59 - three two one start
07:03 - so as you can see you can move around
07:05 - the timer is running
07:06 - as you can see and when you hit the edge
07:08 - it will
07:09 - broadcast the message game over we'll
07:12 - make a new sprite
07:13 - and it should say game over when you
07:15 - touch the egg
07:16 - and also we can rename this sprite to
07:19 - timer
07:20 - uh it's not really a timer but i just
07:22 - named that for now and then
07:24 - in the enemies a similar concept to the
07:26 - rocks and rock blaster as i said earlier
07:29 - so inside the enemies we're gonna get a
07:31 - one green flag clicked
07:34 - uh we're going to hide
07:37 - and we're going to repeat three times so
07:39 - we're gonna make three clones
07:41 - three and then we're gonna create a
07:43 - clone of myself
07:45 - all right and then when i receive start
07:50 - then we are going to show the sprite
07:53 - over here
07:55 - we're going to show and after showing
07:58 - we're going to go to
08:01 - x 240 which is the um right side the far
08:05 - right
08:05 - like this time and then we're going to
08:06 - make it go to a random
08:08 - y position so we're going to maybe do
08:10 - pick random negative
08:12 - 150 to 150.
08:15 - so i'm pretty sure 150 is the top and
08:17 - negative 150 is the bottom
08:18 - that's the dimension so we're going to
08:19 - make a new variable for this sprite only
08:22 - select for the sprite only because we
08:24 - want the um uh
08:26 - enemies to move at different speeds so
08:28 - we're going to name the speed
08:29 - and for the sprite only and so in here
08:32 - we're going to set the variable speed
08:36 - to we're going to make it pick a random
08:37 - negative 6 to negative 8.
08:40 - so remember we're going to the left so
08:41 - it's supposed to go to negative speed
08:43 - negative six negative eight and then
08:45 - we're gonna repeat until
08:48 - repeat until touching players so if the
08:49 - enemy's touching the player
08:52 - so we're gonna repeat this until
08:54 - touching the player so inside here we're
08:55 - going to do
08:56 - change x by the speed which is pick
08:58 - random negative 6
09:00 - to plot a negative 8 so we're going to
09:02 - change the x
09:04 - by the variable speed
09:08 - after that we're going to get an if that
09:09 - statement so basically if it touches the
09:12 - left side then we're going to make the
09:14 - blocks go back here to the far right so
09:16 - we're going to do
09:18 - if the x position is less than negative
09:21 - 220
09:23 - x position less than negative 220 then
09:28 - we will go to
09:29 - back to this position so we can just
09:31 - duplicate this trash all this and put
09:33 - this
09:34 - in all right and if it touches the
09:36 - player
09:37 - down here we're going to broadcast game
09:39 - mover
09:40 - all right and then when i receive game
09:42 - over in the sprite we're going to hide
09:45 - and stop all
09:50 - we can also do that in the player so
09:52 - when i receive
09:53 - game over you can hide it
09:58 - all right so now we're going to make the
09:59 - game over text sprite so
10:01 - i'm going to paint a new sprite um make
10:04 - it red because usually
10:06 - game movers usually associated with the
10:08 - red color
10:09 - so we're going to do game over
10:13 - oops game
10:17 - okay increase the size a little
10:20 - uh shrink it a little it's too big all
10:24 - right that's
10:24 - perfect size i'll keep it like that
10:26 - we're going to rename the sprite to game
10:28 - over and then we're going to go to the
10:30 - code and whenever if i clicked we're
10:32 - going to make the
10:33 - game over sprites go to 0-0
10:36 - and hide it
10:39 - and after this we're going to do when i
10:41 - receive game over show
10:43 - since we already stopped all in the
10:45 - enemies then we don't have to stop all
10:47 - here
10:48 - all right and then finally we can add a
10:49 - little music so let's go to sounds
10:52 - i'm just going to pick a random song
10:55 - uh loops oh yeah
10:58 - this one cave is pretty good so i'll
11:00 - keep this one so uh one group my clicks
11:04 - inside the backdrop we're doing this in
11:06 - so we're gonna do a forever loop
11:07 - and put the music all right play this
11:09 - out cave it's hold up
11:11 - all right you can also add a backdrop if
11:13 - you'd like
11:15 - all right so let's turn on the volume a
11:17 - little bit and i can hear the music a
11:18 - little
11:19 - and as you can see around the red blocks
11:23 - come randomly
11:25 - and if you touch a red block then it'll
11:27 - say game over and the timer will stop
11:30 - now i'll touch the edge um i'll show you
11:33 - guys if the touch
11:34 - edge also came over so yeah that's
11:37 - pretty much the tutorial for today a
11:39 - little dodge game
11:40 - so thank you guys for watching don't
11:41 - forget to like share and subscribe
11:43 - and i'll see you guys in the next
11:44 - tutorial bye
