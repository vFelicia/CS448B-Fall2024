00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we're doing the third part for
00:12 - this uh scrolling platformer
00:14 - so i'll just go through what we'll be
00:17 - doing today
00:18 - so today we'll be just doing the jumping
00:21 - moving around now the um platform
00:24 - actually stops you
00:25 - and we will be doing the x scrolling
00:28 - and however there are a couple bugs when
00:30 - you go to the bottom you're not dead
00:32 - we will do that in future videos and you
00:35 - can
00:35 - glitch to the top like that even though
00:38 - you're not jumping
00:39 - so we will do that later
00:43 - so now let's go to our previous project
00:47 - so let's go to our project
00:50 - go to my stuff
00:56 - so i will scroll through the code just
00:59 - to
01:00 - let you guys look at
01:03 - it if you missed anything so
01:08 - just get anything you missed
01:12 - scroll a little slow okay
01:16 - so now let's go to the platforms
01:20 - that's all the code for the platforms
01:21 - pretty simple
01:24 - not too much so now we will be adding
01:27 - the scrolling
01:28 - so let's go to your play game
01:31 - when i receive play game script okay so
01:34 - you want to get the set
01:36 - scroll x to the x position
01:41 - set scroll x to x position
01:46 - so now you have scrolling x scrolling
01:50 - so now we have x scrolling that's cool
01:54 - now we have the scrolling physics down
01:56 - let's go
01:57 - on to the um player so
02:00 - for the player um i believe we have to
02:04 - make a
02:05 - new block let's make a new block
02:08 - so we already have the change player x
02:10 - by now we're going to make the change
02:12 - player y by
02:14 - change player y by
02:18 - change player y by add one input and put
02:21 - s y
02:22 - in there like that press ok
02:27 - so we're going to define this block real
02:28 - quick
02:30 - so we will change the y
02:34 - to whatever parameter is in here so just
02:37 - drag that into here
02:39 - and then we want to call the position
02:42 - so that's just to const position is just
02:45 - to constantly
02:46 - shift it to the scroll so it'll scroll
02:49 - with it
02:51 - go to the position of the scrolling
02:54 - so after that you want to get a repeat
02:56 - until
02:59 - repeat until not touching platforms
03:04 - so repeat until not touching platforms
03:10 - platforms and you want to change the y
03:14 - by one so this is just to make it go
03:16 - back up a little bit
03:18 - so it won't fall through the platform
03:21 - just trying to make it even out on the
03:25 - platform so you want to change the y by
03:28 - one
03:29 - recall the position so it'll keep on
03:32 - positioning it
03:33 - and you want to go to the tick script
03:36 - and you want to change the y
03:38 - player y by negative 8.
03:42 - so now i will show you guys as you can
03:44 - see it doesn't look good it's
03:46 - just falling through the like a little
03:48 - bit
03:49 - and it's keep on bouncing up and down up
03:51 - and down
03:52 - and when you move it's moving very slow
03:56 - and we don't want that
03:57 - so what you want to do is go to the tick
04:00 - click right click click edit and run
04:03 - screen without refresh
04:06 - so now it will not fall through
04:09 - because it's running the screen without
04:10 - refreshing it so you cannot see the
04:12 - movement because it's super fast
04:15 - so now you have the scrolling and now it
04:17 - doesn't keep up bouncing up and down
04:19 - on the platform so let's go
04:23 - to the player y position
04:27 - so in the tick custom block uh we change
04:30 - the instead of this we can change the
04:34 - player
04:34 - s so we can change the s y the speed y
04:37 - by negative two
04:42 - and we can change the player y by the s
04:45 - y
04:46 - speed y so that if you to or
04:49 - to fall to the ground from a higher
04:51 - ground you'll fall faster
04:53 - so like in real life you would fall
04:54 - faster if you fell from a building
04:56 - rather than a house
04:59 - so it's basically saying that if you
05:02 - fall from a higher
05:03 - place like up here then you would
05:06 - go fall faster
05:10 - then we need to change the player y to
05:13 - the sy
05:14 - and then we would need to set the sy
05:16 - back to zero
05:17 - up here in the y position
05:21 - if not if the sprite will not fall
05:24 - through the platform
05:25 - to make the sprite not fall through the
05:26 - platform we want to put the set
05:29 - s y back to zero right here
05:34 - all right so now let's go on to the
05:36 - player position
05:38 - so and right before i continue i would
05:41 - like to show you if you take out the
05:42 - zero what would happen
05:45 - it will fall through as you can see when
05:47 - you move
05:48 - you'll fall through but if you reset the
05:51 - speed y back to zero
05:54 - everything is perfectly fine
05:57 - all right now we have all that down
06:00 - let's go to the
06:02 - uh tick custom block let's get
06:05 - and let's move all this
06:08 - down wait so
06:12 - let's put this under here oops so let's
06:15 - put this up here get an
06:16 - if then statement if
06:20 - the key up arrow i'm just going to
06:22 - duplicate this
06:24 - if the key up arrow up
06:28 - or the w key is pressed so we can also
06:30 - do wsd
06:32 - then we will set the sy the speed y
06:36 - to 16 that's the normal default
06:40 - 16 and then you can just pop that right
06:44 - under here
06:45 - so use this at this code to allow the
06:47 - player to
06:48 - jump set the jump height to 16 pixels
06:52 - but if the player holds up it will keep
06:54 - on jumping you can like double jump and
06:56 - triple jump
06:57 - because this negative two is not enough
07:00 - to override the 16. so i'll demonstrate
07:04 - one time
07:04 - so as you can see you can like jump like
07:06 - flappy bird
07:08 - like when you hold it you just get stuck
07:09 - on top and fall back down it's like this
07:11 - is good for like flappy bird games or
07:13 - something
07:14 - but not for a platform game scrolling
07:16 - platform game like we're doing
07:18 - so we do not want that so we will fix
07:20 - that
07:23 - so let's go back to the player y
07:24 - position this define
07:26 - change player y by block so we're gonna
07:29 - get
07:30 - a we're gonna set the in-air
07:33 - variable we have so the in-air variable
07:37 - it's for the sprite only remember all
07:40 - the lower case
07:41 - ones not in all caps are for the player
07:44 - only so remember to set it for the only
07:46 - for the player so you want to set the in
07:48 - air back to zero
07:49 - and up here you want to change the in
07:52 - air by one
07:55 - so what the in air oops so
07:58 - the in air the longer the player is in
08:01 - the air like when it's jumping
08:03 - um the bigger the value of the in air
08:05 - gets and
08:06 - when it's touching the platforms it'll
08:08 - reset the in air back to zero because
08:10 - it's not true the player is not in the
08:12 - air
08:13 - so next we want to add an if-then
08:16 - statement
08:17 - to the tick go here and an if-then
08:20 - statement wraps around the
08:21 - set s-y to 16
08:24 - so now it will not be able to jump like
08:26 - flappy bird
08:29 - so now just add this
08:32 - if in air
08:35 - is less than four
08:38 - then we can set the sy to 16. so add the
08:41 - statement so if the player is in the air
08:43 - for a bit it will allow the player to
08:45 - jump but if a player is coming down a
08:47 - slope or leaving
08:48 - the platform they are allowed to jump
08:52 - so add that if then statement wrapped
08:57 - around the
08:57 - sy so yeah
09:01 - so now let's play it so that's
09:05 - all the code as you can see now you can
09:07 - jump perfectly fine
09:08 - you cannot jump like flappy bird anymore
09:10 - you can jump normally
09:12 - however there are a couple bugs as you
09:14 - can see i'm not jumping you'll teleport
09:15 - to the top we can fix that in the next
09:17 - video
09:18 - and let me add something in the
09:20 - platforms the costumes
09:23 - so if you i were to draw like a line
09:26 - so like a green color
09:29 - okay so i'm gonna get the oops it's
09:32 - supposed to be
09:33 - like this i'll just draw the line
09:36 - just like get a green color okay maybe
09:40 - five thickness uh actually let's
09:43 - increase it to ten
09:45 - okay so i will zoom out a little bit
09:48 - let's draw
09:49 - oops
09:51 - [Music]
09:53 - let's make green color okay so i will
09:56 - draw like a line
09:57 - from this side let's hold down shift
10:02 - i've done shift i'll just draw it like
10:04 - about this long
10:07 - and i'll show you what happens when i do
10:10 - that
10:12 - so when i play it the player can
10:15 - automatically teleport
10:16 - up like that and go up there we will fix
10:20 - that bug in the next video
10:22 - but when you on top it will stop the
10:24 - player
10:25 - but when it's on the bottom and jumps up
10:27 - it will go through
10:29 - so we will fix that in the next video i
10:32 - will
10:33 - delete this real quick we're not gonna
10:36 - end the video quite yet we can teach you
10:38 - guys how to draw the background
10:41 - so i'm gonna i think i have to import it
10:44 - or i think i already have it oh i
10:46 - i don't have it yet let me just uh oh
10:49 - yeah i have a backpack
10:50 - so i'm gonna drag this one so this one
10:53 - these two we got from online let me just
10:55 - delete this one uh this one we just
10:58 - made ourselves we drew this one so we're
11:00 - going to teach you guys how to draw your
11:01 - backdrop
11:02 - so let's open a new
11:06 - uh backdrop so first i'm going to
11:09 - explain
11:09 - what everything in here is so for the
11:12 - back
11:13 - for the blue sky we made it two
11:16 - different colors so it can like fade out
11:18 - on the bottom
11:18 - so it'll look better and then for the
11:21 - trees
11:22 - we just did uh lines with the thickness
11:24 - of 80
11:27 - it's just like make the trees some of
11:29 - them are 70 when you go up it will get
11:31 - thinner
11:32 - 50 60 and same with the other tree
11:35 - these we put vines on the side that are
11:38 - 20 thickness
11:39 - and then we have a tree branch that's
11:41 - just 60 thickness with the
11:43 - line and then we have a sun that's just
11:45 - a normal plain circle
11:47 - with a yellow color with no outline
11:50 - and then here we just drew some of these
11:53 - uh
11:54 - blocks with the um a square tool
12:00 - like right there so i will show you guys
12:03 - how to draw it
12:04 - so i'm gonna go back drop so first
12:07 - we can get the back the color so we just
12:10 - set it
12:11 - like that just draw a square no outline
12:14 - we do not want any outline
12:17 - so we just drew it like that center your
12:22 - backdrop
12:24 - next we want to draw this and one thing
12:27 - before we do the sun we have to do the
12:28 - double fill
12:29 - like we said like the fade so we're
12:31 - going to make this a light
12:33 - blue color the second one a light blue
12:36 - color
12:39 - like that and then we're just gonna fill
12:42 - the backdrop with that so there's a
12:45 - little fade on the bottom
12:46 - the top is darker and the bottom is
12:48 - lighter
12:50 - so now let's draw the trees
12:53 - so we just got like a um
12:56 - we just got like a thickness of let's we
12:59 - just got the trees as a thickness of 60.
13:02 - we can draw the ground actually it's
13:04 - just a gray color with no outline
13:07 - i'm just gonna go here draw like a gray
13:08 - block
13:11 - just so just like so let's draw some
13:14 - blocks like that
13:17 - just you can randomize them
13:22 - and we have another block on top and
13:25 - then
13:25 - we just got a 60 thickness tree branch
13:29 - and a tree trunk just draw it like that
13:33 - hold down shift so you get a straight
13:34 - line
13:38 - don't forget to hold down shift and then
13:41 - we can hide that with another
13:42 - grey block which make it go to the front
13:46 - make the other gray block go to the
13:47 - front and then we can draw some lines
13:51 - for the tree like thickness of 80.
13:54 - so we're going to get the line hold down
13:57 - shift so you get a straight line
14:02 - for both trees
14:07 - and then you can just stretch it out a
14:08 - little like we're doing
14:14 - and then we can make it like 70
14:16 - thickness now
14:19 - and then hold down shift to get a
14:22 - straight line
14:26 - and then maybe we can do it to 60 this
14:28 - time
14:35 - like that oops sorry about that
14:40 - maybe we can like center that a little
14:44 - do it for the other one and finally we
14:46 - can do a thickness of 50
14:50 - and we'll just finish off the top layer
14:54 - like that hold down shift
14:58 - and finally we can draw like some vines
15:03 - with a thickness of 20.
15:06 - you this is optional if you want it just
15:08 - hold down shift so you get a straight
15:10 - line
15:12 - draw like one longer one shorter
15:16 - just like jazz up your little game
15:20 - backgrounds are very important in games
15:23 - same with music
15:25 - and then we'll add the sun for the final
15:27 - thing
15:28 - for the yellow color we'll just draw a
15:30 - circle
15:32 - with no outline hold down shift so you
15:35 - get a perfect circle
15:37 - since the sun is in front of everything
15:39 - we'll make it go to the back layer
15:41 - but make the blue go to the back
15:44 - the very back layer so select the
15:48 - we'll select the blue background
15:52 - select the tree we'll just group up the
15:53 - tree first
15:56 - let's group up the tree
16:03 - let's make it to go to the forward front
16:06 - layer
16:07 - and there you go so that's how you draw
16:10 - it
16:12 - so we're just going to delete it now so
16:15 - just
16:15 - we just demonstrated how to draw it
16:19 - so that concludes today's tutorial so
16:22 - we're just gonna do a recap
16:23 - we just drew the backdrop now we can
16:25 - jump around
16:26 - there's scrolling physics um
16:30 - there's still some bugs however we will
16:32 - fix that in the next video
16:34 - so thank you guys for watching please
16:35 - like share and subscribe to our channel
16:38 - for the latest uploads on our channel
16:40 - and i'll see you guys
16:41 - in part four for the platformer see ya
16:46 - [Music]
16:48 - guys
16:53 - [Music]
16:55 - you
