00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:11 - another video
00:12 - it's called Treasure Island today we're
00:14 - gonna work on this Treasure Island game
00:15 - so the player controls the sailboat and
00:18 - try to avoid hitting the island so or
00:21 - otherwise the ship will be wrecked the
00:24 - partnership and the cannonball can also
00:26 - hurt the ship you can also get you can
00:29 - find this idea and code your own games
00:32 - book it's a really cool book you can
00:33 - also check out so we'll be learning
00:38 - these following concepts and scratches
00:39 - called Vanderpool's forever loops
00:42 - pointing direction touching color and
00:44 - sprite and broadcasting messages let's
00:47 - get to the project
00:48 - let's go demo the project make it
00:52 - fullscreen and as you can see you can
00:55 - get you get wrecked when you bump into
00:58 - the green land and you'll also have to
01:01 - avoid hitting the pirate ship because it
01:03 - can also hurt you
01:05 - and as you can see the lives are going
01:07 - down
01:08 - you should try me do it and it stops all
01:12 - the music and everything stops so so if
01:15 - you win they'll say you won
01:18 - just way too low
01:20 - [Music]
01:26 - as you can see you can get the yellow
01:28 - treasures dollar treasure on the dots so
01:32 - you one basically goes make a new
01:37 - project so we can delete the cat sprite
01:43 - go to the backdrops control the
01:46 - backdrops get the backdrops um you can
01:50 - turn it to a blue color in the beginning
01:52 - and make it make it not no outline so
02:00 - this is that part is the whole entire
02:03 - screen which I just covered and that is
02:07 - the whole entire ocean basically so
02:10 - let's change the color to green you can
02:12 - also make like little islands on the
02:14 - side like look at that Island but you
02:18 - can you can make like several islands
02:21 - you can also use the reshape tool make
02:23 - it look more like an island you can
02:25 - reshape the tool using the reshape tool
02:30 - to make it look like iron so I have a
02:36 - backpack and it can help and our I
02:39 - already have all the backdrops loaded in
02:43 - so as you can see already have the
02:45 - backdrop we can delete the first one if
02:52 - you don't have a backdrop yet pause the
02:56 - video and make a island like mine so
02:59 - it's three dots of treasure on it so
03:03 - let's also delete the regular backdrop
03:08 - so we can go to the code of this thing
03:10 - and let's loaded our sprites first so
03:17 - first we have to get this sailboat
03:18 - sprite
03:23 - so the sailboats bright you had through
03:26 - the costumes
03:27 - you got a convert to bitnet - confirm -
03:31 - bitmap go to use the eraser and erase
03:35 - the top off to make sure it's not that
03:38 - close and touch the green so easily yeah
03:44 - so we'd also upload some other rights so
03:51 - I already have the pirate ship sprite so
03:54 - I'm gonna drag it in I got it from my
03:56 - backpack you can go to the pirate ship
03:59 - images and search it up on Google and
04:01 - get any pirate ship you want as you can
04:03 - see these are some other demonstrations
04:06 - of examples and uh you if you want to
04:12 - edit it and it has like a backdrop you
04:14 - can watch your video
04:15 - sprite editing on scratch 2.0 because it
04:18 - has a magic one background remover they
04:22 - can remove the background and take what
04:25 - the part you want so you can also rename
04:30 - the project to Treasure Island so we can
04:40 - choose a sprite we can choose the ball
04:42 - sprite so uh we can make it a grey color
04:51 - with the fade in it's on eraser mode
04:55 - right now it's yeah so you can make it
05:05 - like a like a fade in like type of thing
05:08 - and make it like a brown color up gray
05:12 - color goes color right brightness a
05:20 - little bit higher and the bottom the
05:25 - orange part white yeah run that color so
05:32 - that's gonna be my cannonball you can
05:34 - also make it a little darker
05:37 - mmm and let's get to the coding so we
05:46 - have all our sprites here first things
05:48 - first we have to change the size of this
05:50 - so it won't be so big so we got to make
05:55 - a block and that block is called start
06:01 - sailboat so it defines so you gotta put
06:08 - a forever loop better for the forever
06:14 - loop it'll go to your mouse pointer
06:17 - because it says we have to use point
06:20 - towards mouse pointer move three steps
06:25 - to your mouse pointer per second not per
06:28 - second but basically so and then you
06:30 - need a if then statement if it's
06:34 - touching the pirate-ship that means it
06:39 - will make a new broadcast message called
06:51 - and you'd also duplicate that and make
06:57 - and you have to change said using this
07:00 - you have to use the touching color
07:03 - there's something called the eyedropper
07:05 - where you can take whatever what color
07:07 - you want form when it shipwrecks or
07:10 - whatever
07:13 - so let's duplicate this we can take out
07:18 - this saw so if it's touching the
07:22 - cannonball or the ball it will also
07:25 - broadcast shit-brick
07:29 - so we can duplicate this one because
07:32 - this one's similar to touching the
07:34 - yellow color use the eyedropper again
07:37 - and take that yellow color instead of
07:39 - broadcasting shipwreck because you don't
07:41 - want to die when you get your treasures
07:42 - it'll brighten us a new message you can
07:46 - name it
07:58 - so we're still working on the sailboat
08:00 - so when the green flag is clicked it
08:04 - will set the lives just two three you
08:06 - can have as much lives as you want we
08:09 - also have to make the Venerable lives
08:11 - real quick then you have as much life as
08:16 - you want but I'm going to use three so
08:19 - you know go through this position just
08:21 - make it go around up here you can drag
08:27 - this lives thing up there yes we can
08:29 - make a fast move it around here around
08:32 - the middle because that's more better
08:35 - and then I'll define the start silver so
08:43 - when it will call the this script so
08:50 - let's test it real quick as you can see
08:53 - it's following my mouse pointer there's
08:55 - no dangerous yet but so as you can see
09:06 - it's following your mouse pointer and we
09:07 - have encoded everything it so you can go
09:09 - on top of land but when I receive got
09:12 - treasures go to stop all the scripts in
09:15 - this bright other scripts in this bright
09:22 - and then say you've got the treasure and
09:31 - then I'll stop everything control so
09:38 - let's have to work on the shipwreck so
09:41 - when I receive wreck so when I
09:50 - receive the shipwreck thing it will stop
09:53 - other scripts in this right
10:00 - say your ship has been wrecked ship and
10:28 - change lives by minus one
10:36 - she's one second
10:38 - uh-oh go to back to the same position
10:44 - wherever that was earlier wherever that
10:50 - was earlier and if that else not if
10:56 - anything else cuz if then it's less or
11:00 - great if it's equal if it's lives are
11:05 - equal to zero or or if zero is greater
11:14 - than the lives because it could go into
11:17 - the negative and you could still be
11:18 - alive if you don't put this function
11:23 - then stop everything else they'll struck
11:28 - the sailboat again so I'm gonna add the
11:36 - sound for this thing you can make it if
11:41 - then you need a forever look and then
11:43 - you can use whatever sign you want so
11:50 - you go to the loops these are where all
11:51 - the sounds are let me use bossa nova
11:56 - because it just sounds more old-timey so
12:01 - I'm gonna test the game and you can see
12:04 - the music is playing
12:06 - if you bump into stuff ship I'll break
12:08 - you can also gather the treasures and
12:11 - you win so right now we haven't done the
12:14 - ship and the cannonball and all that
12:16 - stuff yeah so in the next part we will
12:19 - see you guys thank you for watching
12:21 - everybody and please like and subscribe
12:24 - to our channels thank you
