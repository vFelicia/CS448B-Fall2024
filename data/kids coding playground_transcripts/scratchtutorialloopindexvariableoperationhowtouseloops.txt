00:08 - hello and welcome back to the channel
00:11 - two kids calling playground so today
00:14 - we're actually walking on a not really a
00:18 - game but uh working on a project that
00:21 - actually teach you some of the basic
00:26 - programming concept regarding loops
00:29 - index variable and operation in scratch
00:33 - with a minute variable so basically this
00:38 - game is this project is that you click
00:42 - on this sprite here nano and then you
00:45 - ask you what's your name
00:46 - and you can put in your name let's say
00:50 - we put in kids coding playground and
00:52 - we'll tell you like how many letters it
00:54 - has comment vowel and how many consonant
00:57 - it has so it looks pretty easy right
01:00 - because let's say we are looking at the
01:02 - name we can count it up right but how
01:04 - would the computer know right so we have
01:08 - to get each letter and in this world and
01:12 - actually combine compare it so it's not
01:15 - that easy I mean it looks quite easy but
01:18 - I know that many kids struggling with
01:20 - this loop index and variable concept in
01:26 - scratch so let's take a look so we'll be
01:30 - actually learning these things today
01:33 - loops index operators so what are some
01:38 - of the operators we will be learning
01:39 - join letter off linked off and something
01:47 - containing something so this is the loud
01:52 - I know a lot of game doesn't really
01:55 - require us to use these but if you're
01:58 - doing some kind of manipulation with
02:00 - word another what game then you
02:03 - definitely need to use this ok all right
02:06 - so let's dive into it I will show you
02:08 - guys how it actually what I'm not there
02:11 - yeah here the one of this game I created
02:15 - so this is nano so when you click on him
02:20 - it will ask you what is your name let's
02:23 - say for instance put something uneasy
02:27 - let's say to say kids coding there for
02:33 - instance so if I put in kids coding you
02:36 - can you can tell that if I'm asking
02:38 - something I answer something it will go
02:40 - to the answer variable right so if I
02:44 - enter it will tell me okay I have ten
02:47 - letters there's three bow and seven
02:51 - consonant let's count this up okay so
02:54 - now let's count the letter we just typed
02:57 - in kids coding right so let's kill the
03:00 - letter one two three four not counting
03:04 - the space five six seven eight nine 10
03:08 - so we have 10 measures and how many
03:10 - about we have one two and three how many
03:15 - constant we have and we have seven right
03:18 - so how do we actually know how to do
03:20 - this using the program how does the
03:25 - computer know I would rather go to a
03:27 - loop and would it get each letter out
03:30 - from the answer and whether check it so
03:33 - before we dive right into the coding
03:36 - please like share subscribe to our
03:38 - Channel and give us some feedback if you
03:41 - like on the comment below alright so now
03:44 - let's get started so how do we actually
03:47 - do this so with the understand them
03:51 - let's say I click on the ice sprite and
03:55 - you know let's say I add this right what
03:59 - is your name I add it to my sprite so
04:03 - this sprite will start talking asking
04:05 - what's your name so will you if you put
04:07 - some weight on right so as you can see
04:14 - in this answer here if we're going to
04:17 - show this answer so you can see that Tom
04:21 - goes to the answer so this is how you
04:23 - ask a question right from the sprite I
04:25 - think everybody might already know this
04:27 - okay all right so what do we need to do
04:30 - first we did two in order to get the
04:33 - the the going through this variable here
04:37 - we need to create some variable that
04:41 - will help us so let's go to variable so
04:45 - we need to know each letters right so we
04:48 - can do is we're gonna create something
04:50 - called each letter I'm using a camel
04:54 - case here so it's easy to see so you can
04:57 - see each letter okay
05:02 - and what I also need is something called
05:04 - index index is a position in the in the
05:08 - in the world
05:09 - so in scratch they always started one so
05:12 - on so remember for that so they to try
05:20 - program they start at zero I got for
05:23 - scratch at the index doesn't one so the
05:26 - index is the position in the loop if we
05:30 - go into a loop let's say we're looking
05:31 - for the word Tom so index one will be T
05:36 - right index two will be O and index
05:39 - three will be M we're going through our
05:41 - loop okay so we have created these two
05:44 - variable what else do we need we need to
05:46 - know the number of consonant and we also
06:02 - want to know and we also need to know
06:13 - number of spaces there you know in case
06:16 - they put a first name and last name we
06:19 - don't want to count the spaces right
06:21 - okay and also number so this is how many
06:34 - wow they have the ABCDEF
06:38 - I mean so how many bow it has like a e i
06:41 - o ye right the bow okay we have these
06:46 - variable that will help us to keep track
06:48 - of the loop and looking at each I'm
06:51 - letters in the loop and we can compare
06:53 - them okay what I'm going to do is I'm
06:57 - gonna give him port my sprite I already
07:00 - created this Nano before for my other
07:03 - games I was just going to reuse him okay
07:07 - so this Nano I will also put a wooden
07:11 - stump tree stump I had it before so let
07:15 - me move it in the center and this way no
07:18 - I want to put him in the front so what
07:20 - we need to do is worth his 8 green black
07:23 - is click one to move into the front so
07:30 - that you know the Nano is standing on
07:31 - the tree so oh I put on the tree I'm
07:39 - sorry
07:43 - I meant to put on Nano okay I think they
07:51 - copy it over let me try it again okay
08:01 - we'll go back to look okay all right so
08:06 - we can see nano cities spending on the
08:09 - trees okay we know a background like
08:13 - this so for one class okay class troll
08:20 - okay all right so we have nano here what
08:24 - we want to do is we are going to a
08:28 - starting it to ask a question for him
08:30 - right so what we want to do is when we
08:33 - click on the sprite someone to ask a
08:37 - question okay what this prize clicked
08:42 - right what do we want to do so before we
08:46 - asked asked the question we want to set
08:49 - the bear
08:50 - for each other variable sort of for the
08:53 - index we are going to set at one
08:56 - so remember scratch the indexes with one
08:59 - right I mentioned earlier a number of
09:02 - consonant so the number of consonant is
09:09 - zero so we want to just initialize it
09:13 - making sure that you know in the
09:15 - beginning everything is set to zero
09:17 - number better I'm just going through the
09:20 - year here number of spaces right so we
09:30 - have numbers number of consonant letters
09:36 - number of spaces and okay so we have
09:41 - everything set reset when we click on
09:43 - this sprite so every time we click on it
09:45 - it will reset all this so what do we
09:48 - want to ask so I want to go back to this
09:51 - or saying what is your name right so
09:54 - click on this sprite we will ask you
09:57 - what's your name as you can see right
10:01 - every time the user type something the
10:03 - name wash equal to this variable called
10:06 - answer which is a default in scratch
10:10 - okay to take the input from the user on
10:13 - the keyboard so what we need to do is we
10:16 - have to go through the letter that the
10:21 - user typed in write is fine now so we
10:23 - will actually have to use some of these
10:25 - variable this operation here so let's
10:29 - take a look at some of the operation
10:31 - we'll be using today so let's look at
10:33 - this and this and this so let's try to
10:40 - understand some of these things what is
10:42 - actually meaning so let's say bye to
10:44 - click on this link of an app of what do
10:46 - you think will happen what would look
10:47 - like I will let you guys kiss you see
10:51 - this five so the length of Apple is 5 y
10:55 - is 5 that's five letters like a PP
10:59 - five so what happened to my click this
11:02 - one what do you think we'll say I'll let
11:05 - you guys guess ok ready ok click on it
11:09 - it says a what is a mean this is the
11:14 - first letter of this board so a as an
11:17 - apple first letter is a if I put 2 here
11:21 - what do you think will happen actually I
11:25 - have what PAP because that's the second
11:28 - letter of this word ok so now you
11:31 - understand the length in the scent of
11:33 - the word right we can control using the
11:36 - index right we have index using this
11:38 - index we can go through this world and
11:41 - we can find out each letter what the
11:43 - user typed in and let's check the last
11:46 - one something called contain so I click
11:49 - on this what you think will happen it
11:51 - will ask if this a is inside Apple it
11:55 - will return one true so a is inside
11:59 - Apple if I put B here what happened B is
12:03 - not inside Apple right so it will return
12:05 - false meaning B is not inside this what
12:08 - Apple so now you have a little bit
12:11 - understanding of these three operations
12:14 - here for these very book we will be
12:18 - playing around with so you can actually
12:20 - do this project so let me throw this all
12:23 - away for now ok so we click on this what
12:28 - is your name what do you think we have
12:29 - to do so what we need to do is we have a
12:31 - call to the name write whatever the user
12:33 - typed in I said I've been Tom weather go
12:36 - through how many time three time right
12:38 - because Tom has three letter right so
12:42 - unless a time so I need to go through
12:46 - the three time so we can use this we'll
12:51 - go to this and there's something called
12:53 - repeat right repeat number of times
12:56 - right here okay this is ten times so
12:59 - what do we have to do we have to get
13:01 - three times so how do we get three time
13:02 - so remember we were using this operator
13:05 - the length right the length of Apple is
13:08 - Phi right so now what happened if I say
13:11 - that
13:11 - Duff answered way then you have will
13:15 - have three right penis comes three so
13:19 - what you do is you put in here so that
13:20 - means it will repeat three times so what
13:23 - I need next okay that I have okay each
13:27 - letter so what I'm going to do is now
13:29 - pick up each letter from this word Tom
13:31 - and I'm going to check it okay so if I
13:35 - say yeah very is a bow or is a consonant
13:38 - or whatever our space right so what we
13:40 - need to do is we set each letter so it's
13:43 - going through a loop one at a time so
13:46 - the first letter of T right so what
13:49 - happened so we want to get the first
13:51 - letter of this one so what do we have to
13:53 - do we'll go back to this why you
13:56 - remember this is the letter of a right
13:59 - so what we want to do is we're gonna use
14:04 - the index so we can increase the index
14:06 - two one two and three
14:08 - so since the indexes start up one we
14:10 - know that one Apple is giving us a so
14:14 - one of answer is going to give us what
14:17 - Tom right tom okay this and put it here
14:21 - so as you can see 71 of answers theory
14:26 - 13 first letter okay so what we want to
14:31 - do is we do not want to put one thing
14:33 - that we want to change this right so
14:36 - what we want to do it we're gonna use
14:37 - this index or this index here so now we
14:41 - understand that the matter in deck which
14:44 - is one right now and of the answer which
14:47 - is T Tom right T the first letter Tom
14:51 - okay so what we want to do after that we
14:54 - want to change what change the index by
14:58 - one so we'll go to the second position
15:01 - which is all right so next time with a
15:05 - loop runs or pickup always the second
15:08 - index okay so let's let me put this up
15:13 - here so when you guys do the buggy you
15:16 - can always put something in here
15:17 - that will help you to debug the code
15:20 - right so that's for instance I want to
15:22 - say each letter here so as you can see
15:25 - we can actually say it each time
15:28 - so let's best go on again we'll click on
15:32 - him and we are going to say Tom so what
15:36 - do you see it you can say t om right so
15:39 - going through each letter in this loop
15:42 - is getting the first letter which is T
15:45 - then it increase the index by 1 which is
15:48 - 2 so the next time it comes around will
15:50 - pick up oh then the last time it comes
15:53 - around will pick up and which is M which
15:56 - is the last letter right so let's run it
15:58 - again so if I click on this let's say I
16:01 - put John right so we'll go through all
16:04 - fine J oh and a J okay chin right so
16:08 - let's enter so john-117 so now
16:17 - understand how the loop is walking
16:19 - correct okay so what we need to do is we
16:23 - have to check if this actually if this
16:26 - letter is belong to the a bow right so
16:31 - what we're gonna do is simply make it
16:34 - simple it's like it was not about Google
16:38 - count it as a consonant okay okay so so
16:44 - what we need to do is we're gonna go to
16:45 - the if condition here okay so we are
16:51 - going to use something called contain
16:53 - you remember we're using something
16:54 - contained so what we can do is we're
16:57 - gonna put in the bow a capital a
17:01 - lowercase a in case they put capital
17:04 - hello Neil okay see right ayeee
17:07 - I know his i/o couple o his own you okay
17:14 - so what we want to say is if a e i o you
17:20 - so this one this is containing this what
17:24 - each letter right so we'll drag each
17:27 - letter in here so if a eio you contain
17:31 - this letter then what we know we know
17:37 - that it is a a bow
17:41 - number one or number bow won't be
17:44 - creased by one so now if we run this
17:48 - again and when it go through it we'll
17:50 - check each letter and you can see the
17:54 - index moving and you'll see each letter
17:56 - moving and then you can see that number
17:58 - of bow will increase so let's try again
18:01 - I'll put Tommy right short name so as
18:05 - you can see they say okay it's moving
18:09 - through the index he found that there's
18:11 - none of out in one vowel because pause
18:13 - in the middle right so we need one Wow
18:16 - okay so now we have when bow also we
18:20 - don't want to count the spaces right
18:22 - let's say you got some spaces in between
18:24 - the word data Tom and then they say yeah
18:28 - let's say Tom Sawyer or Tom whatever
18:31 - right he's laughing then we don't need
18:33 - to count the spaces in between the
18:35 - player put in the spaces right so we
18:37 - will also do this if condition again
18:40 - right what we're going to check this
18:44 - time we are going to put a one space
18:47 - here and if that sorry not the same same
18:52 - condition sorry I was incorrect
18:55 - so will they use this condition
18:58 - so we'll put one space and we can say
19:02 - each letter so if it's a space equal to
19:07 - the letter there was a number of space
19:10 - it changed by one so increasing the
19:13 - space so let's try kids coded so you can
19:23 - see that okay he says number of space is
19:27 - one
19:28 - right number vow is three so I owe and I
19:34 - write plus three so now we have number
19:36 - of Bao and number of spaces right so he
19:39 - knows that space is one so what we can
19:42 - do is this we were going to set that
19:46 - number of letters how do we know number
19:48 - of letter so we will say set after we do
19:53 - all the loop right we know everything
19:54 - now right so what we say is a number of
19:58 - letters is equal to what you go to do
20:04 - you remember we have something called
20:05 - linked off right so what we can do is a
20:08 - link of the answer right so looking at
20:14 - the answers what if we click on this you
20:17 - see is 11 right this is because it's K
20:20 - it's this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 you
20:25 - know and including the space in the
20:26 - middle right so what we want to do is
20:29 - we're gonna subtract the space right so
20:31 - then we'll know how many letters they
20:33 - are right so we'll say using this
20:36 - operator with a subtract here so number
20:40 - of letter is equal to the length of this
20:42 - answer
20:43 - - number of spaces right so number
20:49 - spaces yeah so now you know how many
20:52 - letters they are so I run this again I'm
20:56 - going to put in let's say right so he'll
21:02 - know that okay that's six letter say Tom
21:04 - t om t lamb tongue comma six letter on
21:09 - my space is one space is how many about
21:11 - to wait so we already know that number
21:16 - of letter number Wow and how do we find
21:20 - the number of consonant when you guys
21:23 - think that you guys take a moment to
21:27 - think about that so number of letter is
21:32 - number consonant is so the number of
21:35 - letter -
21:37 - all right okay so we can do that
21:40 - so we're I know right so say go back
21:44 - over here we'll select so number of
21:48 - letter - the number of Wow right then we
21:59 - know the number of consonant so let's
22:02 - try it again
22:04 - so okay so as you can see the so these
22:12 - are the loop that's going through right
22:13 - there look don't worry about that so
22:15 - where I can do that but it'll print
22:16 - going through each time so now you can
22:19 - see the number of consonant yes one two
22:23 - three four one number better one two
22:27 - three four five six number of spaces one
22:30 - number two right so this is for us for
22:35 - making simple was just we just think
22:39 - that okay the users not put it in the
22:41 - name but they could put in a number
22:43 - right the numbers it's not a alphabet
22:46 - letter i we didn't have that check here
22:48 - so if you want to do that you could put
22:49 - it you know check with a number but for
22:52 - simplicity sake no we're gonna just
22:54 - assume that the user don't put in the
22:56 - first name last name we're gonna check
22:58 - how many letter and how many bow and how
23:01 - many consonants out there so this is
23:03 - pretty much it
23:05 - so now we'll finish up the project by
23:08 - adding something for the Nano to say
23:12 - like your name has a number of letter
23:16 - number of Wow and number of consonant
23:19 - okay so let's go back to look here and
23:25 - you can track this in we also need to
23:28 - use something so you join because we
23:30 - actually have to join more than one
23:31 - thing where you have to use to join
23:35 - are we going to do enough for the first
23:38 - one as your name
23:40 - and and we'll put a little space here
23:43 - because we want to put a number here
23:45 - right okay we'll go back to the variable
23:48 - you'll say number of letter or start
23:51 - with that and then open this little
23:55 - space here yet one space and then said
23:57 - letter okay all right
24:00 - what we're going to do that duplicate
24:02 - this one time and then another time
24:06 - so this one will remove this and the
24:23 - last one consumer okay so this is a
24:33 - consonant okay that's the last part I
24:36 - will remove this will add the number of
24:39 - consonant here okay all right so what we
24:44 - need to do is should actually have done
24:48 - the other way but that okay
24:51 - we have everything ready we'll drop it
24:53 - in here and drop it in here then drop it
24:59 - in here okay you know let's test our
25:02 - game one time will save it will stop it
25:05 - will start again
25:06 - okay well click on him Oh ask what's
25:10 - your name let's say we'll put John okay
25:14 - it has seven letter three valve and four
25:18 - consonant as you can see right one two
25:21 - three four not including the space fall
25:24 - are five six seven seven letter one two
25:28 - three four or consonant and one two
25:31 - three three file that's correct
25:33 - right so that's pretty much everything
25:35 - the game is so please like share and
25:38 - subscribe to our channel thank you very
25:39 - much see you guys next time bye bye
