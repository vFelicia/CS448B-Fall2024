00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we're working the second part for
00:12 - the um scratch
00:13 - math game so in the last tutorial uh we
00:16 - learned how to make the addition
00:18 - and we made the audition button so today
00:21 - and the quick button um so we're gonna
00:24 - work in the subtraction button
00:26 - um subtraction um the custom block and
00:30 - we're also going to work on
00:30 - multiplication
00:32 - so i'm just going to drag and drop the
00:33 - multiplication
00:35 - in here as well hold up i don't have it
00:37 - so let me get it
00:39 - okay so now i have the multiplication
00:40 - button i just got it from
00:43 - my other project so now i have the three
00:44 - buttons
00:46 - so let's start out from the subtraction
00:48 - button everyone
00:49 - um so everyone let's go to the
00:51 - subtraction button and let's code on
00:52 - here first let's zoom in a little bit
00:54 - so for addition we can just copy paste
00:58 - everything just drag and drop everything
01:00 - into the subtraction
01:02 - except we just need to change up one
01:03 - broadcast that's
01:05 - pretty much it for the subtraction
01:06 - button so for subtraction button
01:09 - we're gonna get um so we'll separate all
01:11 - this
01:13 - instead of here instead of start edition
01:16 - we have to broadcast a new message
01:17 - called start
01:18 - subtraction
01:24 - so we have broadcast start subtraction
01:28 - so let's go back into our cat we have to
01:29 - define a new custom block
01:31 - so let's go to my blocks and let's make
01:34 - a new custom block and name it
01:36 - subtraction
01:39 - so subtraction click ok
01:42 - so let's define it now so let's get a
01:44 - forever loop
01:45 - [Music]
01:47 - forever loop so in the beginning we
01:49 - always want to set the guess to zero
01:52 - to zero and then we want to set the
01:54 - random number one
01:56 - and the random number two to pick random
01:58 - one to 100
02:02 - and the um subtraction is a little bit
02:04 - different from addition
02:05 - that's why i didn't copy paste it
02:07 - because you need to find
02:08 - if the random number one is greater than
02:10 - random number two
02:12 - because if the random number uh two is
02:15 - smaller than the random number one and
02:16 - you're subtracting it
02:18 - we don't want negative numbers so we
02:19 - have to do that so
02:22 - so if we set the two random numbers pick
02:25 - random one to 100
02:26 - let's get a repeat until so we have to
02:29 - repeat until
02:29 - guess is equal to answer problem so if
02:32 - the
02:33 - guess of the answer is equal to the
02:34 - actual answer
02:36 - so repeat until the guess is equal to
02:39 - the answer
02:40 - problem and then after that we want to
02:43 - get an if density
02:44 - if
02:48 - wouldn't it if then else sorry put an if
02:51 - then else inside this repeat
02:52 - until loop so we wanna if random number
02:56 - one is greater than random number two so
02:58 - this is where you detect if
02:59 - random number one is greater than random
03:02 - number two
03:03 - so if random number one is greater than
03:05 - random number two
03:07 - then we want to set the answer to
03:08 - problem of random number one minus
03:10 - random number two so let's set the
03:13 - answer to problem
03:14 - some random number one minus random
03:16 - number two so
03:19 - uh get a subtraction symbol put that in
03:21 - here
03:23 - random number one subtracted
03:27 - random number two so subtract the first
03:29 - number which is greater than random
03:30 - number two
03:32 - i'll be random number one minus random
03:34 - number two
03:35 - and then we'll ask a question ask
03:38 - we're gonna put two joins
03:42 - put a drawing here and put a join here
03:46 - so we want to say random number one
03:49 - in the first slot which is any number
03:51 - that's from 100
03:53 - then we join it with the minus sign
03:56 - and then we get a random number two
04:00 - and put it in here else if
04:03 - a random number one is not greater than
04:05 - random number two
04:06 - then we want to set the random num then
04:08 - we want to just duplicate this
04:10 - and instead of doing this we can switch
04:13 - them around
04:13 - so instead of putting random number one
04:15 - minus random
04:16 - two it'll be random number two minus
04:18 - random number one so
04:20 - do it the other way around so then it'll
04:22 - always never be negative
04:24 - and then i'll ask and say right here
04:25 - we're gonna switch these two again so
04:28 - we're gonna join random number two minus
04:30 - random number one
04:33 - and then we're gonna set the guess to
04:35 - the answer
04:37 - down here let's set the guess to answer
04:43 - um and then if we're going to get
04:46 - another if then else
04:48 - okay so let's get an if then else and
04:50 - put it right here
04:52 - so if the guess is equal to the answer
04:54 - to problem
04:56 - yes is equal to answer to problem
05:01 - um then we're gonna have to start the
05:04 - sound guitar strum i already have it
05:07 - start sound guitar strum and then
05:10 - we're going to say that is correct so
05:12 - i'm just going to duplicate this
05:13 - right here and then put it down here
05:16 - else
05:17 - we're going to do this string pluck and
05:19 - say that is the wrong answer
05:21 - so as you can see subtraction needs a
05:22 - bit more code than addition because you
05:24 - have to find
05:25 - which number is greater than which so
05:28 - and then finally we have to do a uh
05:30 - we have to um call the
05:33 - function right here so we're gonna get a
05:35 - broadcast
05:37 - when i receive start edition uh
05:39 - subtraction sorry about that
05:41 - we're gonna run the subtraction call
05:43 - this
05:45 - custom blocker here so let's try it out
05:47 - right now
05:48 - so i'm gonna save it and play it
05:53 - let's try it out so
05:57 - okay so at the subtraction button
05:59 - addition button so let's say if i click
06:01 - on subtraction
06:02 - boom now it will not be negative as you
06:04 - can see 90 minus 49
06:06 - is not a negative number so let's say i
06:08 - get right
06:10 - so let's say i get it wrong then i'll do
06:12 - that
06:13 - but if i get it right then don't do this
06:18 - so there was a little bug right here so
06:20 - i got the answer correct which was 41
06:23 - and it didn't work so i accidentally
06:24 - didn't answer the problem right here it
06:26 - should be
06:26 - guess so um you guys have to do guess
06:29 - instead of answering a problem that was
06:31 - a little
06:32 - mistake by me so don't do answer problem
06:35 - you have to put yes that's why it did
06:36 - not work
06:37 - so now let's see if it works now it
06:40 - should work
06:46 - so
06:48 - now let's go to subtraction so i'm just
06:50 - going to click on it 60 minus 1 that's
06:52 - 59.
06:53 - so as you can see now it's correct back
06:55 - then i uh when i got the right answer it
06:57 - still didn't get it right because
06:59 - um there's a little bug in it so um so
07:02 - the answer is 22 for here let's see if
07:04 - it's right
07:05 - okay that's right and gain score and you
07:07 - get it wrong
07:08 - on purpose it'll say that's the wrong
07:10 - answer so now
07:12 - we have the subtraction and addition
07:14 - functioning correctly
07:15 - now we can work on our multiplication
07:17 - button
07:18 - so let's go to our multiplication uh
07:21 - just drag and drop
07:22 - all of this code into the multiplication
07:24 - we just have to change one broadcast
07:29 - um just drag and drop all this
07:32 - and one more
07:36 - let's see if i got it off oops i did not
07:39 - get one of them i think
07:42 - yeah i did not get the one flag clicked
07:48 - uh yeah this one so i'm just gonna drag
07:49 - and drop it here
07:52 - and i don't know where this one went so
07:53 - i'm just gonna give it to here as well
07:55 - so drag it from the front i think that's
07:59 - why
08:00 - so when flying click time yeah okay so
08:02 - now we have
08:03 - the code for the multiplication instead
08:05 - of broadcasting
08:06 - start subtraction we're gonna have to
08:08 - broadcast start multiplication
08:11 - start
08:13 - [Music]
08:15 - multiplication i think that's how you
08:18 - spell it but
08:20 - that's just broadcast that and then
08:23 - let's go back into our cat sprint
08:26 - and then so for the multiplication um
08:28 - i'm only going to do it 1 to 12
08:31 - because um this is like for kids
08:33 - multiplication so i'm not going to make
08:34 - it too hard
08:35 - but you have to use like scratch paper
08:37 - and all that so to make a new custom
08:39 - block
08:40 - it's called multiplication
08:45 - multiplication click ok
08:49 - so we're going to define multiplication
08:50 - so let's get a forever loop
08:54 - um you want to set the guess to zero
09:00 - yes to zero and
09:03 - we're gonna set the random number one
09:06 - and the random number two
09:08 - both to only pick random one to twelve
09:12 - so it isn't too hard so
09:15 - pick random one twelve only you guys can
09:18 - do it any value you want
09:21 - and i'm going to set the answer to
09:22 - problem
09:25 - to um random number one multiplying
09:28 - by random number two so multiply this
09:32 - random number by
09:33 - this random number so random number one
09:36 - times random number two
09:40 - and okay so we're going to get a repeat
09:42 - until we're going to repeat until
09:45 - guess is equal to answer to problem
09:49 - so wait until the correct answer
09:52 - guess is equal to uh answer to problem
09:57 - and then once it is then we want to ask
10:01 - um ask we're gonna ask
10:05 - two joints let's put two joints okay so
10:07 - we're gonna since
10:09 - um you guys can do the star symbol for
10:11 - multiplication
10:12 - um or just use the x symbol i'm just
10:15 - gonna do the x symbol so
10:16 - uh x letter i mean so we're gonna join
10:19 - the random number one
10:21 - x or you can do the star symbol this one
10:24 - i'm just gonna do the x random number
10:27 - two so
10:28 - multiply these two ask what's random
10:31 - number one times random number two
10:33 - and then um we want to set the guess
10:36 - to answer set the guess
10:40 - to the answer put that in here
10:44 - and then we gotta get an if else
10:46 - statement so if
10:50 - if the answer is equal to random number
10:52 - one multiplied by random number two that
10:54 - means they got correctly
10:56 - random number one so if the answer
11:00 - is equal to random number one multiplied
11:02 - by random number two
11:06 - then we can just duplicate this this is
11:09 - just
11:10 - to show they're correct i'll play start
11:12 - sound
11:13 - guitar strum that is correct and then
11:16 - change the score by one and if they get
11:18 - it wrong then we just duplicate this
11:20 - that is the wrong answer so that is the
11:23 - code for the
11:23 - multiplication and of course we have to
11:26 - call the code so
11:27 - i'm going to go here when i receive
11:31 - uh start multiplication we'll want to
11:34 - run this code right here
11:36 - so now we have the multiplication let's
11:38 - try that out so
11:40 - save it go full screen
11:42 - [Music]
11:44 - so let's play a math game answer the
11:46 - following questions
11:48 - press the quick button to stop all
11:49 - questions choose one of the
11:51 - operators are random so i'm going to
11:53 - pick multiplication
11:55 - um so 1 times 11
11:58 - so multiplication is working right now
12:00 - so as you can see when you answer it
12:02 - correctly it will say that is correct
12:03 - your score will go up
12:05 - let's say if i answer it wrong on
12:06 - purpose let's see if it works
12:08 - and they'll say that is the wrong answer
12:11 - so our game is working
12:12 - uh perfectly right now so that is
12:16 - uh i think we'll stop here so today we
12:18 - just worked
12:20 - on the subtraction and multiplication
12:21 - button
12:23 - in the next episode i think we'll work
12:25 - on division
12:27 - and the random so i think that's it for
12:29 - this video
12:30 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
12:32 - to like share subscribe
12:34 - and ring the notification bell and i'll
12:36 - see you guys in the next video
