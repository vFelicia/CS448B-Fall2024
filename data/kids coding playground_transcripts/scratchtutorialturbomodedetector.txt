00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids going
00:08 - playground here today making a turbo
00:10 - mode detection project in scratch
00:13 - so
00:14 - turbo mode is basically it just speeds
00:16 - up the project so it can be used in
00:18 - animations and stuff um so this is a
00:20 - detection to detect if turbo mode is on
00:23 - or off so maybe you want to add this in
00:25 - a clicker game or something so you the
00:28 - player cannot like cheat on the game
00:31 - so here you have a turbulent detection
00:32 - it's really simple to make
00:34 - um so let's play it so as you can see
00:37 - turbo mode is off but if you hold shift
00:39 - and click the flag
00:40 - it will say turbo mode is on
00:43 - and if you should click again it will
00:44 - turn back to turbo mode is off
00:46 - so yeah it's just a simple turbo mode
00:48 - detection project and i'll show you guys
00:50 - how to make it so without further ado
00:52 - start a new project
00:54 - rename the project rename the turbo mode
00:56 - detector we can delete the scratch cat
01:00 - and all you need is one sprite so we're
01:02 - just going to paint one single sprite
01:04 - so we're going to use red for the first
01:05 - one i guess or whatever color you want
01:07 - so the first one we're going to name it
01:08 - off
01:08 - so we're going to name we're going to
01:10 - say turbo mode is off
01:14 - make this bigger
01:16 - center the sprite
01:19 - and then next we're going to and then
01:21 - we're going to duplicate and then we're
01:22 - going to
01:23 - delete this
01:25 - we're going to say turbo
01:27 - mode is on
01:28 - and then we're going to make it another
01:30 - color maybe green or something so we're
01:32 - going to use green
01:35 - center of the sprite and there we go we
01:36 - have our off and on so we're going to
01:38 - read this goes on to on
01:40 - so
01:41 - make sure it's centered
01:43 - centered okay
01:45 - this one
01:46 - make sure it's centered
01:47 - yeah okay it's centered so here we have
01:50 - our sprite so when so in the code what
01:52 - we're going to do is when green flag is
01:54 - clicked
01:57 - we're going to name this detector
02:00 - detector
02:02 - so when grip fly is collected we're
02:04 - going to set the turbo we're going to
02:05 - make a variable we're going to name it
02:07 - turbo for all sprites that's fine
02:09 - we're gonna set the variable turbo
02:12 - to zero and then forever we're gonna do
02:14 - forever
02:15 - we're gonna change the turbo by one
02:18 - change turbo by one and we're gonna wait
02:21 - zero seconds so basically scratch runs
02:24 - at 30 fps
02:25 - 30 frames per second so when it's
02:27 - waiting zero seconds it's actually
02:28 - waiting one thirtieth of a second
02:31 - but when you turn it on turbo mode it
02:32 - actually waits zero second
02:34 - so yeah basically this just basically
02:36 - waits 1 30 at the second
02:39 - and next we're gonna get a one green
02:40 - flag is clicked
02:42 - we're going to get a forever loop
02:44 - forever
02:46 - um broadcast um we're in broadcasting
02:49 - message we're gonna name it check
02:51 - and then we're gonna wait 0.125 seconds
02:56 - and then next we're going to do when i
02:57 - receive variable check
03:00 - check we're going to get an if else
03:03 - so basically we're going to do if the
03:04 - turbo is greater than 100 then we're
03:07 - going to turn it on so
03:09 - um
03:10 - so what we're going to do is this is
03:12 - going to check
03:14 - if the turbo variable has been
03:15 - increasing a lot so we're going to do
03:18 - greater than 100
03:20 - so we're just going to go like 100 turbo
03:24 - and then we're going to go switch
03:26 - costing to on if it's greater than 100
03:28 - else we're going to switch it off
03:31 - and we're gonna have to set the turbo
03:33 - back to zero when when you turn it off
03:36 - so center go back to zero
03:38 - so this is all the code and we're gonna
03:40 - center our sprite to zero zero so we're
03:42 - just gonna go like this
03:44 - now let's run our project let's run it
03:46 - so
03:47 - as you can see it will just keep on
03:49 - going like one two three one two three
03:50 - and go back to zero
03:52 - because it is off
03:54 - but if you turn on turbulent it will
03:55 - increase and mostly turbo motors on
03:58 - off
03:59 - and on yeah so this is our turbo mode
04:01 - detector it's pretty simple there's our
04:03 - turbo detector thank you guys for
04:05 - watching
