00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:11 - another video on scratch and today
00:14 - we're making um a sort of scientific
00:17 - um molecule game called molecules in
00:21 - motion
00:22 - and um it's kind of like science
00:26 - because if you didn't learn this at
00:27 - school yet um
00:29 - let's just start it you start at one
00:31 - molecule
00:33 - you can add molecules it's kind of a
00:36 - scientific
00:37 - science if you're like a teacher oh you
00:40 - can use this material um
00:42 - well not really but like still you know
00:44 - uh you can start at 10.
00:47 - this is one it's really cold and i know
00:50 - there's a fire under it just ignore that
00:52 - and
00:52 - this is like when it's really cold the
00:54 - wall kills move
00:56 - slower like in real life if you're
00:57 - colder you'll move slower
00:59 - um obviously and if it gets
01:02 - hotter it'll get quicker
01:07 - and yeah so
01:12 - uh it can go really really slow like
01:15 - just
01:15 - really really slow this is like winter
01:18 - no this is like fall maybe no this is
01:21 - like fall
01:22 - and then this is like spring and this is
01:25 - summer
01:26 - so it's like um the molecules moving
01:29 - this is probably when you're boiling
01:30 - something like if you're boiling water
01:32 - or like um
01:34 - uh i don't know
01:37 - uh vegetables whatever then the
01:40 - molecules
01:42 - in the water will move
01:45 - and yeah so it's a kind of scientific
01:49 - material you can keep on adding
01:50 - molecules
01:51 - and they range in colors so there's
01:55 - plenty of colors you could choose from
01:57 - so
01:58 - uh yeah anyways let's get started
02:03 - so hey what's up guys i'm back and i
02:05 - just deleted the scratch cat that's it
02:07 - okay
02:08 - yeah you get the point you always have
02:09 - to delete the scratch cat unless if
02:11 - you're making something
02:12 - that concludes the scratch cap and this
02:14 - um
02:15 - we are not so anyways let's just um
02:18 - upload the things from my backpack you
02:20 - can come to my project and export them
02:21 - or you can download them in the google
02:23 - drive
02:24 - and my user's gumball098 so
02:27 - you can come in and um
02:31 - export my sprites so that you can make
02:34 - it for yourself
02:36 - and uh or you can just download it from
02:39 - the google drive
02:40 - and yeah let's just put this in
02:44 - so we got fire this is actually the one
02:45 - from the spring cookout
02:47 - um game not game animation uh so
02:50 - yeah you can get that and this is a
02:53 - little molecule
02:55 - um faster and stuff to make the
02:57 - molecules quicker
02:59 - and this is the molecule itself
03:02 - so the molecule itself is just easy to
03:04 - draw just a circle
03:05 - and then the color for this it doesn't
03:07 - matter what color but
03:09 - you use the swap function over here i'm
03:11 - going to try to draw one on my
03:12 - own just delete this real quick
03:15 - let's draw one of my own let's just oh i
03:19 - should do blue for a swap
03:21 - and then go for like
03:24 - red it's a very interesting color
03:29 - so yeah you basically hold shift
03:32 - and around this size i hope
03:35 - possibly oh maybe a little bit smaller
03:38 - but you get the point guys
03:40 - uh maybe a little bit smaller
03:45 - so yeah you can create customize your
03:47 - own molecules
03:48 - and i hope they all look really good so
03:50 - and next thing
03:52 - i have to draw on this list well you
03:54 - already learned how to draw the fire in
03:55 - the spring cookout animation
03:57 - well it's really hard to draw this thing
03:59 - it's just
04:00 - my dad drew it and so yeah you can just
04:03 - go to my project and export everything
04:06 - so and we have the molecule thing
04:10 - the molecule machine molecular
04:14 - molecular machine so and it's just
04:17 - the same um a circle
04:21 - thing and just paint
04:24 - draw a rectangle or
04:28 - and just reshape it i think that's how
04:30 - you supposed to do it
04:35 - let me try to draw the thing so um so
04:38 - first start out
04:39 - it doesn't matter what color it is just
04:40 - make it a random color
04:42 - and enlarge the rectangle and i'm trying
04:45 - to draw it here
04:46 - and just reshape the sides to make it
04:49 - sort of
04:51 - not a rectangle
04:55 - as you can see um that's actually
04:57 - turning out pretty well
04:59 - it's like one of those index cards
05:02 - or pudding pudding more like pudding so
05:05 - yeah
05:06 - click it and drag it out so yeah it's
05:08 - like make it look like
05:10 - jello maybe so the sides are like kind
05:13 - of circles
05:15 - not really circles like what is those
05:17 - like smooth
05:18 - smooth sides like like a id or something
05:20 - index card
05:22 - and then there we got that and we make
05:23 - the little table under it
05:27 - just brown color and regular fill
05:33 - and drag that thing back
05:37 - and possibly up the saturation a little
05:40 - bit and
05:41 - change this to possibly five
05:46 - as you can see we're putting that in
05:50 - here
05:52 - drag it behind it we're going to use the
05:54 - backwards
05:55 - thing back
06:01 - and we make the two little things
06:04 - other two little things that hold up the
06:06 - table so
06:08 - so we might have to put this thing back
06:09 - in front because i think it looks better
06:11 - originally
06:12 - so yeah you get the point guys and you
06:14 - make the little blue
06:15 - uh uh
06:19 - the little blue rectangles in the back
06:22 - little blue things that hold up it
06:27 - there's also a black line that like you
06:30 - know the back of a table the
06:31 - end of a table has that little thing
06:34 - so why not make it full black
06:41 - you have black
06:44 - there we go
06:50 - and we just extended a little bit
06:56 - blue so the little blue little thing it
06:59 - doesn't matter what color you put it at
07:01 - but the original project was blue so why
07:04 - not
07:06 - make it straight and then tilt it
07:08 - sideways
07:13 - and then tilt done and you just
07:15 - duplicate it
07:16 - make a second one so and you make it go
07:19 - back
07:21 - ctrl c ctrl v
07:24 - flip horizontal and put it on the other
07:27 - side
07:27 - make it back to there we got it
07:31 - our table but i think the original one
07:33 - looks better than this one
07:34 - honestly so let's just delete this and
07:38 - use the original one so remember you can
07:40 - export these sprites in our um
07:42 - my project number09a check out my
07:44 - profile um
07:45 - yeah now let's start coding
07:49 - so the first thing we actually lc'd is
07:52 - um a stop and a button
07:58 - uh adding button and another button this
08:01 - button
08:02 - i think we have to make it a little bit
08:04 - smaller i think it's 50.
08:10 - and we put it around here
08:13 - okay yeah around here and then we put a
08:16 - little
08:17 - edition thing on it
08:21 - so we can oh yeah where's this thing
08:28 - and then we just put shift
08:32 - and we make a line oh
08:36 - and we make another line
08:41 - there we have it we have the
08:45 - uh button the button to add the
08:47 - molecules
08:48 - and now we have to make the stop button
08:51 - so let's just delete this and get a new
08:54 - button
09:00 - and change this thing to here
09:04 - and right we have to change the thing
09:07 - wait a second
09:08 - and put it on black
09:12 - no white white white
09:15 - yes we've got white and then we write
09:18 - stop
09:21 - and yeah we have that we can let's put
09:24 - it in the middle
09:27 - and then yeah we have it
09:31 - and we might actually make the stop
09:33 - larger because it's maybe too small
09:35 - that's around the size and delete this
09:39 - and we're also going to make this 50 and
09:41 - move it somewhere reasonable
09:43 - so
09:46 - here there we have it we have our whole
09:49 - setup
09:50 - done finished and now oh yeah with the
09:52 - backdrop
09:54 - and we have the blue sky too and then
09:57 - finally we start working at on the fire
10:00 - so
10:00 - in my original one we have a fire sound
10:03 - where's the fire sound
10:05 - yeah here
10:09 - so yeah just a fire crackling um and you
10:12 - just have to make it louder
10:17 - so this should be around the good one
10:21 - and you can customize that sound and
10:23 - it'll sound pretty good you know
10:26 - and go forever
10:34 - and make play sound fire until done
10:38 - and then also when green flag is clicked
10:42 - i'll go to
10:43 - x0 negative 155 because i
10:46 - uploaded my backpack doesn't matter
10:48 - where you put it just put it somewhere
10:49 - reasonable
10:50 - and then we have a forever
10:54 - next costume and a weight 0.2
10:58 - for a little weight you know it's better
11:00 - to have a little weight
11:04 - yeah so make it different costumes so
11:07 - look you see
11:08 - fire's moving is making sound and now
11:10 - we're done with that
11:11 - now we just have to work on the molecule
11:13 - generator
11:15 - which should be really simple
11:18 - when green flag is pressed just go to a
11:21 - position
11:23 - and then the molecule itself
11:26 - has the most code in this whole entire
11:29 - script
11:30 - and we might have to use some code that
11:34 - um you might have not used before
11:37 - some operators and i i myself haven't
11:40 - used some of these operators before
11:42 - so let's dive right in so when the green
11:46 - flag is clipped
11:48 - it will clear all the graphic effects
11:51 - because you know
11:52 - um it's just a regular color because you
11:55 - know it always changes color whenever
11:56 - you add a molecule
11:58 - so you want to do a clear graphic effect
12:02 - and set temperature to 20. so this is
12:05 - really tricky you got to make a variable
12:08 - called temp butcher this is how you
12:11 - spell it
12:12 - 10 pair
12:19 - yeah i'm right okay there's the red
12:21 - squiggly line
12:22 - and then for all sprites and then okay
12:27 - and then you see it over here you double
12:30 - click it
12:31 - and you double click it again and then
12:35 - you
12:35 - right click it and you do change slider
12:38 - range
12:40 - so i'm just going to do that again for
12:41 - you i actually want to do that again
12:43 - because
12:44 - so you you know when you make a variable
12:46 - it's always like that
12:48 - double click it double click it
12:52 - right click change slider range and then
12:55 - the minimum you can make
12:57 - 10 or 5 or 1 or whatever
13:01 - and make the maximum 200 or you can do 2
13:03 - 000 but your choice
13:05 - and then okay so you can now increase it
13:08 - and decrease it and the lowest is 10.
13:12 - so now and then you use when the
13:15 - clear graphic effects and you set
13:18 - temperature
13:25 - set temperature to 20
13:30 - and then you create clone of myself
13:36 - and then you'll hide
13:42 - so actually i had a variable this whole
13:43 - entire time called speed because i've
13:45 - done this project before
13:46 - and i actually got it from the old
13:48 - project so
13:49 - i have a variable called speed and i
13:51 - will delete it and show you how to make
13:53 - it
13:53 - and do not make it yet because it's only
13:55 - for the sprite only so i'll show you
13:57 - in a moment once we get to that point
13:59 - and then when i start as a clone
14:00 - it'll go to x00 and then
14:04 - it will and then no point in direction
14:09 - um
14:09 - [Music]
14:12 - pick random so it'll like
14:15 - range
14:18 - so so when it starts they'll either
14:21 - bounce up on the
14:22 - left side or the right side so that's
14:25 - why we have
14:26 - negative 89 to 89
14:31 - yeah so and it will bounce either
14:34 - left or right left or right
14:38 - left or right and then we have go to the
14:41 - front layer
14:45 - and then it will set color effect
14:50 - where's the set i barely use the set
14:52 - color effect
14:53 - uh um block because i always use the
14:55 - chain color effect so
14:57 - pick random 0
15:00 - to 300 and it will show
15:06 - we also have a forever loop next
15:10 - and this is where it gets really tricky
15:13 - you add a set speed variable so let's
15:17 - make a
15:17 - let's just delete this variable right
15:19 - now delete and then make a new variable
15:23 - speed spent speed
15:27 - and then for this sprite only
15:31 - i'm using clone so that's why we only
15:34 - make it for
15:35 - this sprite only so okay and we have the
15:38 - set speed
15:41 - to temperature divided by 10.
15:44 - let's get the divide
15:55 - just close this real quick and then next
15:58 - we have to do
15:59 - if then
16:03 - um that you have you need a
16:07 - so you have this is the trickiest part
16:10 - of this whole entire place
16:12 - so first you need one of these blocks
16:15 - and then you put x position
16:19 - right in front of it and then
16:23 - oh at least i can never ride is that
16:25 - wrong you keep the exposition though
16:27 - and then you use abs and your abs means
16:31 - absolute value so
16:33 - if there's negative 100 what's the
16:35 - absolute value 100
16:36 - so abs of x
16:40 - position is
16:43 - greater than 150.
16:51 - so put that in
16:56 - so the reason why you need 150 is
16:58 - because
16:59 - actually varies of how big your box is
17:02 - so if your box was bigger
17:03 - that means you need a maybe a larger
17:06 - number or a smaller number if your box
17:08 - was smaller
17:08 - so and the reason of this is because if
17:11 - you use a line
17:13 - and you put it so i'm gonna paint a line
17:18 - maybe like 10 thickness um
17:22 - and you put a line
17:27 - well shift it
17:34 - and then i'm going to get a line shift
17:38 - oh straight so and you move this to the
17:40 - molecule thing
17:43 - so side what is the position of the line
17:45 - negative 166.
17:48 - so that means you got a minus around 10
17:51 - because of the um yeah you have to minus
17:54 - around 10
17:56 - on both sides which is 169 the other
17:58 - side is negative 160 something
18:01 - so and that's why you minus 10
18:04 - for the sides and so i'm going to delete
18:08 - the line sprite
18:10 - that's why you use absolute uh i that's
18:13 - how you use 150 so
18:14 - i'm going to delete this line sprite
18:17 - real quick
18:19 - go back to the molecule
18:22 - and let's keep let's continue and you
18:25 - need
18:25 - inside that you need a point in
18:28 - direction
18:34 - you need to multiply
18:37 - you need one direction negative one
18:43 - direction because it'll turn it negative
18:48 - i'll turn it to the opposite side
18:51 - because if it was
18:52 - this side it would go this side and it
18:55 - goes this side
18:58 - yeah so it'll point in direction
19:01 - negative one times direction because
19:05 - if you had 90 then it'll go negative 90.
19:09 - so it will just move around the molecule
19:11 - generator
19:13 - and then you have another if then
19:15 - statement
19:19 - if then um so it's the same thing as
19:23 - this except a hundred and
19:25 - and this is x y position so this is y
19:28 - position
19:31 - and then you have a hundred
19:35 - so abs of y position is greater than 100
19:40 - and then you have to point in direction
19:48 - 180 minus direction
19:56 - minus direction and then
20:01 - so small numbers are up and big numbers
20:03 - are down so if you had the point in
20:05 - direction
20:06 - that means you had to go up so
20:09 - because look zero right and then you go
20:13 - back down that's 180
20:15 - so you have that in 180
20:18 - minus direction so it's something random
20:21 - and you have the one
20:22 - like up here it'll go back down
20:26 - and then if it's down it will go up
20:29 - so that's the um basically what this
20:33 - means
20:34 - oh yeah and it's a hundred because you
20:36 - have to draw a line and
20:38 - i'll show you this you need a ten
20:44 - and then you move it up 112 so minus 10
20:49 - so it's 102. so about that
20:51 - uh size and look there's 114 so you
20:54 - minus
20:54 - the 10 and you'll make it to negative
20:57 - 110.
20:58 - now a hundred so yeah so that's that's
21:01 - the meaning of
21:03 - the molecule and now you go to the
21:06 - molecule
21:07 - and you'll give a little bit code left
21:10 - and it's move speed steps
21:16 - because i'll move the amount of
21:19 - the temperature so that means yeah
21:22 - because of this
21:23 - if it's higher it will move quicker
21:27 - and if it's lower it'll move slower so
21:30 - and then when i receive
21:33 - delete oh yeah yeah we have to finish
21:37 - something before we do that i literally
21:39 - forgot
21:39 - and then we haven't finished this
21:42 - when this sprite is clicked create clone
21:46 - of
21:46 - molecule that's all you have to do for
21:48 - this because
21:49 - you have to create a clone of molecule
21:54 - because you're creating another of these
21:55 - molecules so the
21:57 - button three and you have
22:00 - when this sprite is clicked and button
22:02 - three is the stop button so
22:04 - when this sprite is clicked
22:07 - it will broadcast delete all molecules
22:10 - and that's what leads back
22:12 - to that broadcast delete all molecules
22:20 - and we have that and go over here and
22:23 - when i receive delete all molecules
22:26 - if i'm not mistaken it will delete this
22:29 - clone
22:32 - and that is the game
22:35 - so yeah here's a minimize to rev up
22:39 - under code so
22:40 - here we go fire sound check
22:43 - uh molecule temperature
22:47 - slower quicker slower
22:50 - slower and we have another one another
22:54 - one another one another one another one
22:55 - another one so
22:56 - you can just spam this and it's like if
22:59 - it's 61 it goes at this pace
23:02 - but it feels like 200 would be whirring
23:06 - all over the place but if it was like
23:08 - 10 let's click the stop button there all
23:11 - the volunteers then you add one
23:13 - and it's a peaceful boy 200 yeah
23:17 - and you know
23:20 - there we have it so like
23:24 - you could like play around with this uh
23:27 - molecule uh thing and
23:31 - accelerator so you can like
23:34 - get a bunch of molecules
23:38 - and have some fun
23:41 - so yeah that's basically what this game
23:44 - is about it's scientific it's science
23:46 - and
23:47 - please like share subscribe and comment
23:49 - in the comment section below
23:51 - other games you want to see on our
23:52 - channel so that we can make it for you
23:54 - guys
23:55 - so anyways um oh yeah one more thing
23:58 - uh so if you guys comment like really
24:00 - hard things i cannot do it like
24:03 - what if you like said a scrolling cloud
24:06 - platformer
24:07 - a maze whatever and i i cannot do that
24:11 - honestly so maybe one of you guys can do
24:13 - that and
