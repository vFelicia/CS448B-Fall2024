02:07 - you can get that in the studio really
02:09 - quickly so anyways let's just move on to
02:12 - our family break scheme
02:14 - [Music]
02:16 - okay before i start please like share
02:19 - subscribe and comment in the comment
02:20 - section below for what else content you
02:22 - want
02:23 - and plus i will share this project so
02:26 - do you can actually check it out if you
02:29 - have any problems and you can look
02:30 - review the code on your own so if you do
02:33 - not have this code
02:35 - right here for the player then
02:39 - you are incorrect
02:43 - so okay um i just fixed that so let's go
02:46 - to the obstacles we have not done that
02:47 - yet
02:48 - trees power rug
02:54 - laser pause whenever you need to so
02:58 - yeah you can pause right now if you want
03:00 - to
03:02 - and we're going to work on the obstacles
03:06 - so anyway we have to make a my block
03:10 - called obstacle hp
03:21 - i think it's high school obstacle
03:24 - yes let's say obstacle and
03:31 - technical difficulties so that did not
03:35 - work
03:37 - the scratch could not save the project
03:39 - so
03:40 - i actually did all this so um we have to
03:43 - make on my block
03:44 - and make it obstacle
03:47 - hp
03:53 - and then you get um a variable so there
03:56 - already is one
03:58 - and set obstacle hp to
04:01 - one so i have one hp and just shoot it
04:04 - once with a laser
04:05 - well some things have more hp than
04:07 - others so you need a defense statement
04:11 - if then the um the
04:15 - the costume the costume number
04:20 - [Music]
04:23 - equals rock one
04:27 - costume name rock
04:30 - one because that's the first rock right
04:32 - here
04:34 - rock one rock two yeah we'll discuss
04:38 - these two later
04:40 - and then or it's the
04:44 - rock two then i have two
04:48 - hp so about two hp instead of one
04:52 - and then it'll set obstacle hp to two
04:57 - else if it's not one of these
05:00 - then it's then it's another um
05:03 - it's only one hp so you can also do
05:06 - costume name we should
05:07 - duplicate this change the wall the one
05:10 - to three hp
05:12 - a motorcycle
05:15 - i want a three hp and then instead set
05:18 - the
05:22 - last
05:24 - wall motorcycle
05:26 - [Music]
05:29 - make sure you match the name of the
05:31 - things or else it will be incorrect
05:34 - so we have this done and there's also
05:37 - some other
05:38 - code we have to work on like when the
05:40 - green flag is clicked
05:42 - it will go to x
05:45 - 200 so it'll be near
05:49 - this side and
05:53 - and it'll pick random the y so we can do
05:57 - that so pick
05:57 - random
06:01 - negative 115
06:07 - to positive 50.
06:14 - so it's somewhere over here and then you
06:16 - can also define obstacle hp
06:18 - also show more than this
06:23 - there's also there's barely any code
06:25 - left so
06:26 - you can just finish this quickly in a
06:28 - slam
06:29 - so when i receive when i receive
06:33 - an obstacle destroying
06:36 - that i'll hide when i receive
06:40 - start game edit it will go forever
06:48 - change x by minus one so it'll be moving
06:51 - to the left
06:53 - [Music]
06:58 - minus five sorry and you need
07:01 - if then statement
07:06 - uh if the if
07:09 - the x position is less than negative 240
07:16 - x position is less than negative 240.
07:21 - then so
07:25 - this um exposition thing
07:28 - so when the motorcycle is driving down
07:30 - the lane and it hits this place
07:32 - it'll go back up here the teleport
07:34 - behind here
07:36 - so yeah and it'll also
07:40 - go to 200
07:44 - y pick random
07:49 - negative 115 to 50
07:53 - and switch costume
07:57 - to
08:01 - it's a pick random costume so i'll pick
08:04 - random one to five because there's five
08:07 - costumes
08:09 - but i pretend you add another costume
08:12 - then you will have to
08:14 - add six costumes uh my my bad there's
08:17 - actually six costumes not five
08:19 - costumes and if if you were to add
08:23 - another costume like
08:27 - like a nina pop
08:30 - then you'll have to change it to seven
08:32 - clusters
08:35 - and also they'll also do the block
08:38 - obstacle hp
08:41 - so we can also do
08:45 - so it will send this message and
08:49 - to here so then um it will pick from a
08:52 - crate a ball a rock a rock two
08:54 - a wall
08:58 - and this will set its hp or what it is
09:02 - so you also need if then statement if
09:04 - then it's touching the player
09:10 - it will hide so it blew up and the
09:12 - player killed it but it loses hp
09:15 - it'll go to
09:21 - you just duplicate this
09:22 - [Music]
09:24 - go to this
09:28 - and broadcast lose hp
09:34 - player will lose hp when it hits it
09:43 - and also i'll wait one second
09:47 - switch costume to pick random one to six
09:56 - [Music]
10:01 - okay so um you need
10:05 - obstacle hp down here and
10:09 - show we're almost done and then when it
10:12 - receives
10:16 - obstacle destroy and it will
10:19 - hide
10:23 - and start sound pop
10:31 - and also change score by five
10:39 - [Music]
10:42 - and i'll wait one second
10:46 - also go to this position
10:55 - go to x 200. big random
11:01 - negative 115 to 50 next costume
11:07 - obstacle hp so send that again
11:12 - and so it should be working
11:15 - so let's test it out so we have not
11:19 - coded the loose hp
11:20 - so you're not completely invincible so
11:23 - you can also change this
11:25 - to pick random so it's more fun
11:29 - [Music]
11:33 - so let's try the game and i will i'll
11:35 - code the loose hp
11:37 - and show you that let's pick
11:40 - purple so as you can see it breaks the
11:43 - motorcycles correctly
11:46 - and the crates and the soccer ball
11:49 - i do not have that and then this
11:52 - so we will actually be coding the
11:56 - um the player and lose hp
12:00 - so when i receive lose hp
12:05 - it will change hp by -10
12:16 - so change hp by minus 10
12:20 - and then you need if then statement
12:28 - if then statement so i'm just going to
12:31 - adjust those
12:32 - and then you if then statement if then
12:35 - the hp
12:40 - equals zero
12:44 - so we oh i'll just get this one because
12:46 - i already have it the hp is
12:48 - equal zero or less than zero so let's
13:00 - the no point in direction negative 90.
13:08 - it'll flip over that's basically what it
13:10 - is and then i'll
13:12 - also code the music real quick
13:16 - backdrops when green black clicked
13:20 - forever you can do
13:23 - any sound you want i'm using i think i'm
13:26 - using
13:27 - dead space
13:34 - [Music]
13:36 - and also um i'll set volume
13:41 - to 25
13:45 - [Music]
13:47 - so we're fixing the left and right arrow
13:49 - keys
13:50 - so as you can see the thing
13:53 - it goes the car goes all the way down
13:57 - into the um the
14:00 - road and it does not look good so we
14:02 - will be changing
14:03 - that so as you can see um
14:07 - it's the key you just have to duplicate
14:09 - this and change it
14:10 - slightly but this one inside
14:17 - instead you're in x position
14:28 - 165 and then you take
14:30 - that it depends for you
14:33 - [Music]
14:37 - negative 165
14:40 - and then i i'll just put that inside
14:42 - when i make the second
14:44 - script
14:47 - and then i just gotta change that to
14:48 - right arrow
14:52 - and that's
14:55 - you need x position
15:01 - in negative
15:03 - [Music]
15:05 - positive 165 and i'll just throw this
15:09 - all the way
15:14 - [Music]
15:17 - so i'll just play the game so i'm gonna
15:21 - take
15:21 - yelp as you can see
15:27 - [Music]
15:28 - so sorry about that that was not working
15:31 - we could not
15:32 - move um right or left so
15:35 - i'm just going to change that up a bit
15:39 - so if the x position is greater than
15:42 - negative 165
15:48 - then then and this is a hundreds of
15:52 - positive
15:59 - so this is basically the um
16:03 - the this is like a basically a boundary
16:05 - so
16:06 - um basically uh
16:09 - this boundary does not uh it stops you
16:12 - from
16:13 - uh getting on the right too far
16:18 - and it's optional for you i guess if you
16:21 - don't
16:22 - want it it's fine with you but
16:25 - some people want it i guess and as you
16:28 - can see the crate takes one hit to break
16:31 - um the rocks take two hits
16:35 - [Music]
16:47 - this is
16:51 - [Music]
16:58 - so we're going to change up the code a
17:01 - little bit to
17:03 - show you the loss to make it lose
17:11 - okay um so
17:19 - as you can see die
17:23 - i think we actually have rotation style
17:25 - left right on
17:26 - so we can change that to not left right
17:29 - on so we put that
17:35 - well you can actually make it 10 hp if
17:37 - you wanted to be more challenging
17:39 - but a soccer ball just broke my car
17:42 - so let's just change the hp back to a
17:45 - hunter
17:47 - so if you have any vlogs or problems
17:49 - message me i'm gumball0098
17:52 - and you can also join our studio
17:55 - so as you can see i do have we do have a
