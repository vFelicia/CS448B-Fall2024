00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's
00:08 - kidscodingplayground here and today
00:09 - we're back for another video
00:11 - and this video and we're doing the
00:13 - two-player dodgeball game
00:15 - today we will we are working on this
00:18 - two-player dodge blocking the objective
00:19 - of the game is
00:20 - not your opponent's hp to zero players
00:22 - must avoid getting hit by the balls
00:25 - only two balls can be thrown at the same
00:27 - time
00:29 - to play dodgeball game we'll be learning
00:31 - these following concepts in scratch
00:33 - variables forever loops broadcast
00:35 - message touching other sprites
00:37 - controlling sprite with keys so i'm
00:40 - going to demo the game
00:42 - so i have my dad with me to play hello
00:56 - yeah so so there's music and i'm the
00:59 - blue dude
01:00 - and then i use the right arrow to shoot
01:03 - uh the left arrow to shoot and for the
01:07 - red dude the red picot he uses um
01:11 - d to shoot so that's nice so
01:16 - you can throw two balls at this given
01:18 - time at the same time
01:25 - so so as you can see i once has played
01:29 - two wins
01:30 - so we will be making this project
01:34 - yeah so let's make a new project
01:39 - thank you before i start please like
01:42 - share
01:42 - subscribe and comment in the comment
01:44 - section below what else content you want
01:47 - so first i'm going to take out the
01:49 - sprite
01:51 - i'm going to sprite library i think it's
01:53 - called pico
01:56 - yes pico pico walking because he's
01:58 - supposed to be walking
02:00 - up and down so we have pico walking
02:05 - you can also duplicate this dude but
02:07 - first let's get the
02:09 - beach ball and we're only doing one and
02:12 - then we'll duplicate it afterwards
02:14 - so let's just do the variables so
02:17 - you gotta make a variable called player
02:23 - one hp
02:28 - and then player
02:33 - one ball counter
02:40 - you also need player 2 hp
02:50 - player 2 hp and
02:54 - also player 2 ball counter
03:04 - also need speed the speed
03:08 - is real this is really important so it's
03:10 - not for all sprites if you click this
03:11 - it's going to be wrong if you click the
03:12 - ok button
03:13 - for all sprites it's going to be wrong
03:14 - you have to do it for this right only
03:19 - so there we have it but we have to hide
03:22 - some variables
03:23 - right now and these three
03:29 - so you can also um change the backdrop
03:33 - the backdrop is we can also we can
03:36 - change to a basketball
03:38 - a gym that's called
03:42 - gym no pass
03:46 - basketball one so there we have it and
03:50 - for the code we need to get the sound
03:54 - first
03:55 - i i did dubstep so let's just search up
03:57 - dubstep
03:58 - yep dubstep and when the green flag is
04:01 - clicked
04:04 - it will forever
04:08 - play sound dubstep until done
04:12 - so until done and
04:15 - you also have to work on pico and
04:18 - first you need when the green flag is
04:20 - clicked
04:25 - um set player
04:28 - 1 hp to 100 so i'll have 100 hp when you
04:33 - start
04:34 - a point in direction 90 because it's
04:38 - facing right go to
04:42 - this position but i'm going to make it
04:44 - go to more in the middle
04:46 - so maybe here
04:49 - maybe let's do negative 180
04:54 - 0. and then um
04:57 - set rotation style left right um so one
05:01 - will not flip around we'll want flip
05:03 - over
05:04 - and i'll set speed to zero
05:10 - speed speed
05:17 - so i made a mistake and i put speed
05:19 - inside the beach ball
05:20 - so i'm gonna delete the speed variable
05:21 - from the beach ball
05:24 - and go make speed for pico
05:28 - for this spider-man only the speed
05:32 - so and then it'll set speed
05:35 - to zero go forever
05:41 - change y not set y change y
05:45 - by speed
05:49 - and if on edge it will bounce
05:55 - so this is pretty simple um
05:59 - when the when the w
06:02 - key is pressed www
06:06 - w key is pressed i'll set speed to three
06:18 - you just have to duplicate this
06:21 - and it's still set speed to three but
06:23 - it's set minus negative three
06:25 - so it's s negative three
06:31 - so as you can see i'm just to try it
06:34 - it's w and d
06:38 - so right now we haven't coded everything
06:39 - yet as you can see
06:41 - it's it's working correctly it's going
06:44 - up and down once we click it once
06:46 - so there okay so so when the green flag
06:50 - is clicked
06:52 - it'll go forever
06:55 - next costume
06:58 - like it'll forever change costume and
07:01 - 0.1 seconds for
07:02 - until changing back to the same next
07:05 - question so 0.1 second
07:08 - so we do not want to do it inside here
07:11 - because it will mess up the code
07:12 - and it has a weight so it will mess up
07:14 - the code very
07:16 - and it'll injure the code basically so
07:18 - let's just
07:19 - keep on going so when the green flag is
07:21 - clicked
07:22 - it'll go forever if
07:25 - then touching tennis ball we do not have
07:28 - the tennis ball yet but we can get
07:30 - it from the sprite library right now
07:32 - that's the tennis ball that the other
07:34 - dude throws
07:36 - so if then touching tennis ball
07:42 - tennis ball then it will broadcast
07:52 - player one got hit
08:04 - so we'll be still working on player one
08:07 - so when when i receive player one
08:10 - got hit it will change
08:17 - player 1 hp by
08:21 - -7 and if then
08:28 - player one hp
08:33 - equals zero that means it'll broadcast
08:36 - player two win because player two killed
08:39 - player 1.
08:40 - so i'm gonna just do this real quickly
08:42 - broadcast
08:45 - player 2
08:48 - win
08:51 - and then when i receive
08:56 - player 1 got hit
09:00 - it will say
09:06 - ouch
09:09 - for one second
09:14 - so we put the ouch in a separate thing
09:17 - because um if you put it here it will
09:20 - mess it up
09:21 - and if you get hit twice it'll only
09:22 - register only once so
09:24 - that's why we need it in a different um
09:28 - broadcast so i'll show you later so
09:31 - we're gonna work on the beach ball
09:36 - so when the green flag is clicked
09:41 - um it will set
09:47 - player one ball counter to zero
09:51 - you know hide
09:55 - when when i receive
09:58 - no when the key d is clicked because
10:02 - press you will press yep
10:06 - if then
10:09 - the player one ball counter
10:12 - is less than two player one ball counter
10:17 - then i'll create clone of myself
10:22 - because we don't want to spam and like
10:23 - keep on clicking the d key and drink so
10:25 - much balls everywhere
10:27 - so yeah and then another thing for the
10:30 - code for
10:30 - the beach ball is when i start as a
10:32 - cologne
10:37 - change player
10:40 - one ball counter by one
10:44 - you i'll go to player
10:47 - go to play
10:51 - go to the pico
10:56 - so i'm gonna change him to player one
11:01 - i'm gonna change his name to player one
11:02 - so go to player one
11:04 - it will show
11:08 - and point towards player two because
11:10 - you're basically hitting player two so
11:13 - point towards player two we do not have
11:16 - player two yet
11:18 - but we can so i will duplicate this
11:22 - duplicate and here's player two
11:26 - they will not have the same code but i
11:27 - will do that later
11:29 - let's go back to the beach ball and
11:31 - point towards player 2.
11:34 - repeat until
11:39 - you need an or statement no or operator
11:42 - function
11:43 - touching player two so that's when it's
11:45 - touching the player two
11:48 - or touching edge
12:01 - so not there
12:04 - but duplicate and then
12:08 - more touching player or touching the
12:10 - edge
12:11 - it'll move six steps
12:18 - change so after this not inside
12:22 - it will change player 1 ball counter
12:26 - by -1
12:30 - and delete this clone
12:36 - so to disconnect this code right over
12:38 - here or else it will not work right now
12:40 - so
12:40 - i will disconnect that and i will
12:42 - replace it later and fix it
12:44 - so so our beach ball is
12:47 - all done
12:51 - and our player one is all done too
12:56 - so yeah i'm gonna test it
13:00 - let's click save now and
13:03 - as you can see his balls out
13:07 - and yeah so yeah so we just have to
13:11 - fix the player two code so
13:15 - when the green flag is clicked they'll
13:17 - set player two hp and set player one hp
13:20 - to 100 point in direction negative 90
13:27 - point direction negative 90
13:32 - set rotation center left right set speed
13:34 - to zero forever
13:35 - change y by speed and if on edge bounce
13:39 - so that's we we need that so instead of
13:42 - touching tennis balls touching beach
13:43 - ball
13:44 - then broadcast player two got hit
13:54 - player two got hit and
13:57 - instead of w it's up arrow
14:00 - instead of s it's down arrow
14:05 - and then when i receive player two got
14:07 - it
14:08 - change player
14:12 - two hp by negative minus ten and then if
14:15 - player
14:21 - player 2 hp equals 0
14:24 - then broadcast player 1 win
14:28 - complete opposite
14:37 - so i'm going to change this to player 2
14:40 - got hit
14:44 - and and then i'll broadcast
14:49 - player one win because
14:52 - so we'll be working on the tennis ball
14:53 - now so
14:55 - when the green flag is clicked you might
14:57 - have to change the size of this
15:02 - so i'm going to change it to 215.
15:05 - yep that's around the same size and then
15:08 - beach ball
15:12 - um you just have to drag everything
15:16 - into the tennis ball and then you just
15:17 - have to change it up a little bit so
15:20 - just drag everything i hope that's
15:21 - everything yep that's everything
15:26 - you go here so one two three okay
15:29 - there's three scripts
15:30 - that's correct and then instead set
15:34 - player two ball counter to zero
15:37 - and then instead of d it's left arrow
15:41 - and then and then i'll change this to
15:44 - player two ball counter
15:46 - and so i just did this player two goals
15:49 - i just change it
15:50 - you have to right click the variable and
15:51 - then you can change it and then
15:53 - over 2 and create call myself that's
15:55 - correct and then when i start as a clone
15:57 - change player 2 ball counter by 1
16:01 - go to player 2
16:04 - show point towards player 1.
16:08 - repeat until touching player one
16:12 - or touching edge move six steps and then
16:15 - change this to
16:16 - player two ball counter so i might
16:19 - change the color of
16:20 - player so costumes
16:23 - i'm going to change all of his co um
16:25 - costumes to blue
16:28 - maybe this one
16:31 - and then i'm going to use the fill
16:34 - change this
16:35 - this this
16:38 - this this and this right
16:43 - and i'll have to do it for all of them
16:53 - so i'm almost done
17:02 - please
17:05 - ctrl c and i'll just change this to the
17:08 - eyedropper
17:11 - and do that and pick a walk for
17:24 - and yep we have it and yeah we also have
17:27 - to do that you win spread
17:29 - so i have it inside my backdrop right
17:32 - here
17:33 - so i have the player two wins
17:36 - so the one sprite so i have all the
17:39 - costumes here so
17:40 - the first costume is player one was
17:42 - second couplers player two wins
17:44 - so yeah so when the green flag is
17:46 - clicked
17:48 - it will hide
17:52 - when i receive
17:55 - player one win oh show
18:02 - and switch costume to costume one
18:06 - which is the player one win this one
18:09 - because player two wins second costume
18:11 - and
18:12 - stop all you have to duplicate this and
18:16 - change this
18:17 - a little bit
18:22 - player 2 win instead
18:25 - or show and switch costume your costume
18:27 - too and also stuff all
