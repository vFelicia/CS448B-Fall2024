00:06 - so imagine you're in a garden so this
00:09 - game the objective is to catch a mouse
00:12 - so you imagine you see a mouse in your
00:14 - garden you want to catch it you want to
00:16 - catch the mouse before it moves away it
00:18 - disappears every time you click on the
00:20 - mouse which is basically catching it you
00:22 - get one point see as you can see when I
00:25 - click on it the variable score goes up
00:28 - by one place like share and subscribe
00:33 - and bring the notification bell to
00:36 - receive the latest updates from this
00:38 - channel you've seen the demo of the game
00:42 - catching the mouse like we showed
00:44 - earlier so now we're gonna be working on
00:47 - the game catching the mouse so in
00:51 - catching the mouse we'll be learning
00:52 - these following concepts in scratch
00:54 - broadcasting messages using pick random
00:57 - variables using if-then-else statements
01:00 - now let's get started okay so that as
01:04 - you can see we have a new project first
01:07 - let's rename it to catching the mouse
01:12 - okay so we'd really don't need to
01:15 - scratch cat right now you can choose the
01:18 - mouse pray we can also rename the mouse
01:24 - just regular Mouse and we might want a
01:28 - background to garden rocket as a
01:31 - background we chose so first we want to
01:35 - make two variables the two variables
01:39 - wanna make is catch and score cache is -
01:43 - is for the catching the mouse and score
01:47 - is to count the score every time you
01:49 - catch the mouse so cat and you want it
01:54 - for all sprites and we want to make
01:58 - score and this one's also for all
02:02 - sprites and we want to keep the check
02:05 - for score so then it'll show up on there
02:08 - but since we don't want cash to show up
02:12 - we can uncheck it
02:13 - and you'll be gone and can move the
02:15 - score up here next we'll be making the
02:20 - code for the mouse so we always need a
02:24 - wonderful I clicked we always want to
02:27 - set the variables to zero in the
02:31 - beginning so you won't have like a
02:33 - scorned in the beginning so when set the
02:37 - score to zero and we also want to set
02:40 - the cache to zero next we want the code
02:44 - for the mouse again okay so this time
02:46 - well I don't wait for point five seconds
02:48 - to give a game a small pause then we
02:51 - will bring in a forever loop everything
02:53 - inside the forever loop will go on
02:55 - forever until the stop is clicked so we
02:59 - want to wait point five seconds to let
03:02 - the player know the game has started and
03:05 - we don't also want the forever loop and
03:08 - now we want we want to code for the
03:12 - mouse so we need to if-then-else
03:15 - statement does anyone know to if then
03:17 - else statement is I gave you some time
03:22 - to think of what if then else statement
03:24 - is you can pause if you want more time
03:25 - so since it's kind of hard to see the
03:28 - point five I'll add the zero to make it
03:31 - zero point five so it's easier to see so
03:36 - is anyone order if then else statement
03:38 - is if you know if you guessed it right
03:40 - and if then condition if then else
03:44 - condition means if the condition in here
03:46 - matches then it will execute the code
03:49 - right here if it doesn't then it'll
03:52 - execute the code over here so now we'll
03:56 - move on to some more code for the mouse
04:01 - so we'll need to go to the operators
04:03 - will be picking the pick at random and
04:06 - the you will need this operator the pick
04:09 - random one to ten and also the equal
04:13 - condition operator so next we want to we
04:18 - want to bring in the condition the equal
04:20 - one insert here so we also want to use
04:24 - the variable catch so if
04:27 - cat is equal to 0 which means hasn't
04:31 - catched and that means it will go to
04:34 - this random position maybe we can go to
04:38 - this position we need the pick random we
04:41 - can go to we can go to maybe negative
04:48 - 116 and to 160 and for the lie we can
04:55 - also go to negative 160 160 okay so next
05:06 - we will be adding some more code to the
05:09 - else statement and the if-then statement
05:11 - so if it goes to that random position it
05:15 - will show so you can see it then it will
05:18 - wait 1 second so you can have a chance
05:20 - to catch the mouse and then it'll hide
05:22 - again and go to a new random position
05:27 - else if they catch it then wait one
05:30 - second so next well 1 Oh if the sprite
05:37 - is clicked this is the command so if you
05:40 - click the mouse this is what will happen
05:42 - under ok so if you click the mouse it'll
05:46 - change the score by one so the score
05:50 - will go back up by one if I click on it
05:53 - it'll change the catch by one letting
05:55 - them know that you've caught them you
05:59 - can set the catch to one so I set the
06:01 - catch to one letting them know that you
06:04 - caught it and it can say you got me for
06:07 - one second to let you know that you got
06:11 - it
06:18 - and we can hide after that and then
06:24 - broadcast a new message may be called
06:26 - show again next we want to who else are
06:45 - there what else is in the code what is
06:48 - the difference between jinx score by one
06:51 - and set catch two one I'll give you some
06:53 - time to think about that cushion time's
06:57 - up
06:58 - so a change score change means it'll go
07:02 - up by how much number you put into here
07:05 - and set is how well set to right here
07:10 - that's the number it will set to in here
07:14 - in this variable so finally we need to
07:18 - add we need let it receive the show
07:21 - again message wait one second we can set
07:27 - the score I mean the catch back to zero
07:33 - now after you're done with the code
07:36 - please click the green flag so you can
07:39 - you can start the game you can try out
07:42 - your game and you can add some
07:44 - sound-effects other sprites in the game
07:47 - to make it more fun as you can see when
07:50 - you run it I guess you got me hides show
07:53 - again and the score goes up back up by
07:59 - one every time this function right here
08:05 - is restarting the catch so then it will
08:08 - disappear and come back again
08:11 - and it will go set it back automatically
08:14 - set it back to zero and this part of the
08:16 - code so thank you guys for watching and
08:20 - please like share subscribe and bring
08:23 - the notification bell to see all our
08:25 - latest uploads and thank you for
