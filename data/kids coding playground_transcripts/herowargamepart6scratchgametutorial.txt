00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's K playground here
00:09 - and today we're back for another video
00:10 - on Scratch and today we will be coding
00:12 - the sixth part of the hero war game so
00:16 - this is the sixth part so if you not
00:17 - seen the first second third fourth fifth
00:19 - part it's all on our Channel and you can
00:21 - go watch that to get caught up to
00:24 - now so when I exported the backdrop in
00:27 - part one I used this backdrop so I
00:30 - actually have another backdrop that you
00:31 - can use so I use this for the original
00:34 - game but I honestly like the green grass
00:37 - backdrop too but um this one honestly I
00:40 - think it looks better cuz it looks more
00:42 - dead and gives more vibe to it so I'm
00:44 - actually going to switch backdrop to
00:47 - backdrop two which is this one I'm
00:50 - probably not going to use this one but
00:52 - you can if you want uh doesn't really
00:54 - matter but I'll just have both of those
00:57 - over
00:58 - there and now I'm let's get started and
01:03 - we're going to start with our first boss
01:04 - today which is The Siege
01:08 - monster so The Siege monster has similar
01:12 - code to the armored dude we just need to
01:16 - drag most of it into
01:18 - here so on the green flag click let's
01:20 - just drag all this in here and we'll
01:23 - just and there is no clone for this one
01:26 - so we'll alter it
01:28 - later
01:30 - oh
01:33 - no okay there we
01:36 - go so we got everything over here so
01:40 - this is how it's going to
01:42 - work another one yeah so when the green
01:44 - flag is clicked switch one hide and then
01:47 - we have a variable which is this is
01:51 - Siege monsters armored HP but we're
01:52 - going to rename this to Siege HP because
01:55 - we copied all of them over there so it's
01:57 - going to have armored HP Siege HP h p i
02:00 - Chang Siege monster whatever doesn't
02:02 - really matter oh typing's really bad
02:05 - Siege monster
02:07 - HP so it's going to hide Siege monster
02:09 - HP because the siege monster doesn't
02:11 - come after 250 score so hide variable
02:14 - Siege monster
02:16 - HP so there's no when I start as a clone
02:19 - so let's just change this so we
02:24 - need when I receive first we need to
02:28 - make the broadcast that spawn The Siege
02:30 - monster so let's make a
02:33 - broadcast so broadcast new
02:36 - message
02:38 - Siege Mon oh my
02:43 - Siege monster
02:47 - spawn so it'll broadcast Siege monster
02:49 - spawn so in this start game thing
02:52 - forever if then not creating clone
02:56 - that'd be really deadly if you created
02:57 - clones of 1 million Siege monsters ERS
03:00 - so if Siege monster I mean score is
03:03 - greater than 250 so that's when it comes
03:06 - out it will
03:10 - show and broadcast Siege monster spawn
03:14 - then it'll stop the
03:19 - script so that's spawning The Siege
03:23 - monster so now we have more Siege
03:26 - monster stuff so when I started clone
03:30 - nope when I receive Siege monster
03:36 - spawn so when I receive Siege monster
03:38 - spawn it will
03:41 - set Siege monster HP to 10,000 so Siege
03:45 - monster has bunch of
03:48 - HP in our P until touching player wait.
03:52 - 5
03:53 - seconds so instead of we have to make it
03:58 - walk right so so when I receive Siege
04:01 - monster spawn when I receive Siege
04:04 - monster spawn so we can keep this the
04:06 - same but it's not going to move five
04:08 - steps that's too quick for The Siege
04:09 - monster instead we're going to make it
04:11 - move 0.1
04:15 - steps great now we're going to have this
04:18 - other part which is summoning the peons
04:22 - well actually we'll work on the peon
04:24 - last so let's actually um do this part
04:29 - over here
04:30 - when as I start as a clone which is not
04:32 - when I start as a clone it's when I
04:35 - receive Siege monster
04:37 - spawn forever if touching projectile her
04:39 - select one heal water minus 180 and then
04:43 - if Siege moner HP is equals z or less
04:44 - than zero change score by
04:47 - 500 and then instead of deleting this
04:50 - clone because we're not even using
04:51 - clones it
04:53 - will broadcast Siege monster
04:56 - dead broadcast oops Siege monster dead
05:02 - Siege oh my
05:05 - monster
05:07 - dead sieg monster dead and if it section
05:11 - projectile here selected two minus 250
05:14 - delete Arrow change score by
05:18 - 500 broadcast Siege monster
05:23 - dead then same with the third one so
05:27 - actually um the fair Qui really strong
05:29 - against bosses so it's a boss sluger so
05:31 - instead of 60 damage it be
05:33 - 350 and it'll broadcast delete arrow and
05:37 - then change score by
05:41 - 500 and broadcast each monster
05:50 - dead so we can keep the spectral Arrow
05:52 - part the same because okay actually I'm
05:55 - just gonna broadcast this I'm gonna
05:56 - duplicate this Siege monster dead thing
05:58 - a few times so I have plenty of space Oh
06:01 - so I have plenty of them to use so let's
06:04 - just do that so um and put them off the
06:07 - side so if it's touching the first
06:08 - ability he s is one since it touches it
06:10 - multiple times the special Arrow um
06:12 - you'll keep it the same and then
06:14 - broadcast so each monster
06:16 - dead and then if it's touching the
06:18 - second ability and hero select the two
06:19 - which is the death Arrow then it will
06:22 - not die from the death Arrow so let's
06:24 - actually just duplicate this over
06:27 - here let's throw away this this oh we
06:30 - still need to delete Arrow but yeah
06:33 - let's put this in here and then it'll
06:35 - change Siege monster HP so the death
06:37 - Arrow does a th000 damage to boss is
06:39 - really strong and then uh when it's like
06:42 - that yeah that's right okay so we can
06:46 - literally take out the first ability
06:48 - hero selected is equal to two cuz the
06:51 - Wizard's ability of the not teleport
06:53 - back does not work on The Siege monster
06:55 - or any boss of that
06:57 - fact so let's just try this back over
06:59 - here so if it's touching the second
07:01 - ability and hero select is equal to two
07:03 - it'll change uh Siege monster HP by -6
07:06 - because it'll pass through it multiple
07:08 - times and if it dies from that let's
07:11 - just duplicate this actually and drag it
07:14 - in here so if it's equal Z or less than
07:16 - zero she 500 broadcast each monster dead
07:18 - it's kind of repetitive but yeah so but
07:21 - it's searching appren star he will
07:22 - select equal two change sieg monation
07:25 - 400o to the star change score by five 00
07:30 - broadcast sieg monster
07:33 - dead there we
07:36 - go if a second ability in here selal to
07:40 - three um it won't die from that
07:43 - so it will
07:46 - instead let's duplicate this it will
07:48 - change Siege monster HP by negative
07:51 - 00 the broadcast no no delete prcess a
07:55 - star just throw it over
07:58 - there and
08:00 - yeah keep
08:01 - that and then if it's touching the third
08:03 - ability which is The Shield it'll move
08:06 - 255 steps so The Shield is really strong
08:08 - against The Siege monster
08:11 - um it's just so strong take out the
08:14 - switch costumes cuz we're not switching
08:15 - the costum it's so strong because it
08:17 - would just move negative 25 and it just
08:18 - do another 400 damage to it so and then
08:22 - change score by
08:24 - 500 change code by 500 broadcast each
08:28 - monster dead
08:30 - and if it's touching the player you'll
08:33 - broad set oh once he touches you you're
08:35 - basically dead so hit player
08:42 - Siege to
08:44 - Y hit player Siege to Y broadcast hit
08:47 - player and then move negative 10
08:50 - steps so we basically coded this whole
08:52 - hunk of code so its special ability is
08:55 - to summon these little pods that will
08:57 - chase after you and do
09:00 - astronomical
09:01 - damage
09:03 - and that's basically how it is
09:08 - so um when I receive Siege monster dead
09:12 - so let's just code the Death part first
09:14 - so when I receive Siege monster
09:17 - dead Siege monster dead it will start
09:20 - sound boom
09:22 - Cloud you could uh you can get it from
09:24 - the spite Library you'll hide varable
09:27 - Siege
09:28 - monster
09:30 - hide variable sieg monster HP switch
09:34 - costume to costume
09:36 - three it will stop other scripts in this
09:38 - Sprite so no more peons will spawn any
09:42 - of that it'll wait 3 seconds and hide so
09:46 - wait three
09:48 - seconds and then
09:51 - hide that's a
09:53 - death and now let's look at the um
09:58 - summon peon script script so when I
10:03 - receive Siege monster
10:07 - spawn it will show variable Siege
10:10 - monster
10:11 - HP show variable Siege monster
10:16 - HP it will repeat eight so it'll have
10:19 - the capability to summon eight waves of
10:21 - peons you can put more if you want it
10:23 - more challenging or put less if you want
10:24 - it more easy you'll repeat eight times
10:27 - you'll wait 8 Seconds
10:31 - um this is my recommended amount cuz I
10:34 - tested it out many times so switch
10:35 - costume costume 2 which is the summon
10:39 - peon high high summon peon this is the
10:42 - dead summon peon and then
10:44 - regular switch costume to costume two
10:47 - it'll wait one second then it'll switch
10:50 - costume to
10:51 - costume one sorry yeah one and then
10:55 - broadcast summon
10:58 - peons
11:04 - peons broadcast summon
11:07 - peons so I'm going to go see if we have
11:10 - every code okay now we coded the whole
11:12 - entire Siege monster we're going to
11:14 - weake got the work on the peons but
11:16 - first let's add the um damage of The
11:18 - Siege monster to the player
11:21 - so let's go
11:23 - here all
11:26 - right so we need an if then
11:29 - if then hit
11:31 - player Siege
11:33 - monster hit player Siege equals to
11:38 - Y then it will change lives intive - 350
11:42 - such a strong
11:44 - boss and then I hit player Siege monster
11:47 - to
11:50 - end and that's the siege monster
11:54 - edition so let's add the uh peon now
12:00 - now
12:05 - peons so this is going to be a clone as
12:07 - well so and its closest relation is the
12:10 - enemy so let's actually drag all of the
12:14 - enemy regular zombie one into
12:18 - here huge
12:21 - hunk well it's only four
12:24 - okay let's put
12:27 - these
12:30 - let's take a look at the
12:31 - peons
12:34 - so let's when I receive instead when see
12:37 - start game when I see summon peons
12:39 - because this is peon
12:41 - only no forever not forever because
12:45 - that'll just be crazy it'll repeat
12:49 - four I'll create CL myself and wait one
12:51 - to 2.3
12:53 - seconds and then now we're going to
12:57 - have
12:59 - okay um I forgot to add one thing for
13:02 - the second ability Sprite so
13:05 - since I just tested it out the death
13:08 - Arrow can go through enemies so when I
13:11 - receive delete Arrow just inside the
13:13 - second ability just do hide and then go
13:16 - to player that's
13:18 - it so that's a needed change
13:21 - for the second ability I'm sorry for
13:24 - that cuz I forgot to do
13:26 - it and um
13:30 - let's continue on the
13:35 - peons
13:36 - so when I start as a clone instead of
13:40 - set Instead This zombie HP right this is
13:44 - actually going to be peon
13:47 - HP set peon HP to 200 so peons have 200
13:52 - hp and then it'll repeat until touching
13:55 - player and wait. 5
13:56 - Seconds so when I receive something suon
13:59 - beon that's correct and
14:01 - then instead I make it so the x is also
14:05 - the same as the Y so it's just 100 to 25
14:08 - so it spawns closer to the player which
14:10 - is annoying and it moves three steps
14:12 - instead of two
14:14 - steps so yeah let's do
14:17 - that
14:19 - so so when I when I start as a clone
14:22 - forever if it's sear projectile and here
14:24 - select is equal 1 minus 180 broadcast
14:26 - delete Arrow just like that
14:30 - just like that see p on HP is equal to
14:34 - zero or less than zero change score by
14:36 - five so that's the same so it's like the
14:38 - closest
14:40 - right so since the projectile of the
14:43 - Mage can kill it in one shot we're going
14:44 - to change score by one by five delete
14:47 - arrow and then delete this clone there
14:50 - we go so if it's touching the projectile
14:52 - hero select is equal to three it change
14:54 - P by -60 broadcast delete arrow and yeah
14:58 - same as that that as you can
15:00 - see over
15:03 - there now let's see the first ability uh
15:07 - change score by five delete this clone
15:09 - second ability change score by five proo
15:11 - this delete Arrow delete this clone
15:13 - first ability of hero select equal to
15:15 - two the switch costume to costume 2
15:17 - which is the peon
15:19 - stunned wait .1 seconds move NE 150 STS
15:23 - wa. 3 seconds one so it's the
15:26 - same so and now we have the second
15:29 - ability in hero select is equal to two
15:31 - which is the lightning H beond
15:34 - h60 and then uh yeah same as
15:39 - that just like
15:42 - that okay now let's continue so second
15:45 - ability here just like go to two yep oh
15:48 - just like that and then now if touching
15:50 - apprentices star and equal to it's the
15:54 - exact same as the zombie
15:57 - BL and now we have the second ability
15:59 - and here like equal to three change
16:01 - score by five it'll delete this
16:03 - clone and if it's touching the third
16:05 - ability and here'll select these go to
16:07 - three it'll actually change score by
16:09 - five and delete this clone so it'll die
16:10 - by the defender chip no matter
16:12 - what and then this is the same and
16:15 - instead of sit set hit player zombie hit
16:19 - player Pon so new variable hit player
16:25 - Pon set hit
16:27 - player
16:30 - Pon y so if you touch the player all
16:33 - right all right since now we coded on in
16:36 - all that let's actually add the damage
16:37 - to the bomb and all the siege monster
16:40 - death things so let's go to the
16:44 - enemy so when I receive bomb which is
16:47 - the what the Griffin drops nukes the
16:50 - whole thing it'll wait one second and
16:52 - then High delete this
16:55 - clone and then this is the same for The
16:58 - Siege monster
17:01 - dead so we're going to duplicate this so
17:04 - when Siege monster is dead Siege monster
17:07 - dead not Siege monster spawn Siege
17:09 - monster dead then it'll also die so you
17:12 - get a little
17:13 - break and now we'll add that to the
17:15 - Speedy
17:17 - enemy We'll add that to the armored
17:20 - [Music]
17:21 - enemy and the
17:26 - peons so let's just see if it went
17:31 - through oh there we
17:34 - go then on the armored enemy Siege
17:37 - monster dead Siege the bomb and then the
17:40 - peon Siege monster dead and then when I
17:42 - receive bomb okay that's the siege
17:44 - monster all right so now I'm going to
17:46 - see how the game works and I'll show you
17:48 - through it my first I'm going to close
17:50 - the backpack and hide all the variables
17:53 - that are not needed so let's go to the
17:56 - hide uh hit player C on hit player Siege
18:00 - p on
18:01 - HP um let's add The Siege monster is
18:06 - that here already hidden okay great
18:08 - let's move the power up one two three
18:10 - we'll have the icons and it will look
18:12 - better later but just for now we're
18:14 - going to keep it like that so I'm going
18:15 - to uh I'm going to show you it all right
18:18 - so now let's I'm going to show you how
18:19 - it works so I'm at like 228 is score uh
18:24 - I'm about to get
