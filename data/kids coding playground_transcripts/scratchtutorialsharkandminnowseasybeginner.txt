00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back to another scratch
00:09 - tutorial from
00:10 - kids coding playground today we'll be
00:12 - doing a video
00:13 - on making a game called sharks and
00:14 - minnows this is how it looks like
00:17 - so the objective is to you're the shark
00:20 - you control it with the mouse pointer
00:22 - and you try to eat as much fish as you
00:24 - can
00:25 - and there's a score tracking right here
00:28 - so
00:30 - in sharks and minnows you'll be learning
00:31 - these following concepts
00:33 - understanding broadcast messages using
00:36 - variables
00:36 - using the random operator block custom
00:39 - blocks
00:40 - and we'll need the and we'll also be
00:42 - using the touching color block
00:44 - so without further ado let's get started
00:47 - on the video
00:48 - so i would like to show a demo of how
00:51 - the game looks
00:54 - so you move with the mouse pointer try
00:57 - to eat the fish
00:59 - as you can see the you can only eat the
01:01 - fish if it touches the mouth of the
01:03 - shark
01:06 - some fishes travel faster than others so
01:09 - yeah that's
01:10 - our demo let's get on to our project let
01:13 - me make a new project right now
01:17 - okay so first we won't need the scratch
01:20 - yet we can rename
01:21 - this untitled project to maybe
01:24 - sharks
01:26 - [Music]
01:28 - okay so next we might need to pick a
01:30 - backdrop
01:34 - choose spectrum i would choose the
01:36 - underwater
01:38 - one under water
01:42 - yeah underwater too then we'll need to
01:45 - pick our sprites
01:47 - we obviously need the fish and sharks
01:50 - we'll need four sprites for the fish
01:53 - because we can add different types of
01:55 - fish at different
01:56 - at different speeds so first let me find
01:59 - the shark
02:03 - shark two and we will need the
02:08 - fish
02:13 - we can duplicate duplicate duplicate
02:17 - okay well all the fish will have the
02:19 - same code
02:20 - okay for the shark first we need to
02:24 - work on the artwork first we will need
02:26 - this c
02:27 - we only need these two costumes okay
02:30 - so let me zoom in
02:34 - and i have to fill up all the white
02:37 - teeth with red so the fish can sense
02:40 - the red and the fish will disappear
02:43 - because there might be some white in the
02:44 - background
02:45 - which could just can make the fish
02:47 - disappear even though it's not
02:49 - in contact with the shark i also don't
02:51 - want to use the if
02:52 - touching shark block because what if a
02:55 - shark
02:56 - the shark is touching a fish and the
02:58 - fish hit its tail
03:00 - that doesn't necessarily mean the shark
03:02 - ate the fish so
03:05 - let me work on the shark's teeth i'll
03:07 - just pick a red color
03:18 - [Music]
03:25 - so this is my shark i colored the teeth
03:27 - red
03:28 - so i also have to do it for this one too
03:31 - so
03:33 - [Music]
03:42 - okay now i'm done with the two costumes
03:44 - with the t
03:45 - let's move on to the code so first we'll
03:48 - need it
03:49 - if one flag clicked we need to set this
03:53 - we need to make a variable called score
03:56 - so we need to keep track of the score of
04:00 - the
04:00 - shark eating the fish so we can show the
04:03 - variable
04:04 - set the score to zero in the beginning
04:08 - obviously
04:10 - we can change the size to 150 in the
04:14 - beginning
04:15 - set the size to 150
04:18 - so it could be a bit bigger than the
04:20 - fish
04:21 - we have to set the rotation to left
04:23 - right because
04:25 - if you don't then the shark can turn
04:27 - upside down if you move the mouse
04:28 - pointer up
04:30 - so you want to set the rotation style to
04:33 - left and right
04:34 - sorry okay next you want to switch
04:38 - costume to sharp
04:39 - to a which is the the
04:42 - regular one and then just the opening
04:44 - mouth one we want to keep it on the
04:46 - first
04:46 - costume shark a we'll need to drag a
04:50 - forever loop
04:52 - and it'll point towards mouse pointer so
04:55 - that means the shark will follow
04:57 - wherever
04:57 - you're not your mouse is see it's
05:00 - turning towards the mouse
05:02 - we'll need to add a next costume so
05:05 - it looks so looks like it's eating by
05:08 - opening and closing its mouth
05:10 - we'll need to move 10 steps because you
05:13 - want the
05:13 - shark to move around rather than
05:18 - rather than just look pointing to the
05:20 - mouse pointer and
05:22 - you need to wait 0.1 seconds so
05:25 - it won't look like this see look how
05:28 - fast it's opening smell
05:30 - it makes it not look that great so you
05:32 - want to add
05:33 - the weight 0.1 seconds right here so now
05:37 - if you move the shark it's a bit more
05:40 - smoother
05:42 - okay so now let's move on to the code
05:46 - for the
05:46 - fish so we'll need a custom block
05:50 - with the fish
05:53 - so we'll make a custom block called new
05:56 - fish
06:02 - we will not need to add any inputs
06:05 - boolean
06:07 - number text or labels for this
06:11 - so we need the fish to go to random
06:13 - position
06:15 - this is defining the movefish
06:18 - function this is not starting the game
06:21 - this is not one click
06:22 - you have to call the function in the
06:25 - beginning
06:25 - after this i've defined this so we need
06:28 - a show so the fish will show in the
06:30 - beginning because when the shark eats it
06:32 - it'll hide
06:33 - so we can make it switch costume
06:36 - pick random one to four because it has
06:40 - four costumes
06:42 - yeah so it can show up as different fish
06:44 - every time
06:45 - it generates a new fish we'll need to
06:48 - drag a forever loop
06:51 - this one can move five steps you can
06:53 - make it move however much steps as you
06:55 - want
06:56 - but i'll make it five so if on edge
06:58 - bounce that means if the fish hits the
07:00 - edge it'll
07:01 - bounce off of it and then
07:05 - we need an if-then statement sorry
07:09 - if then statement if then
07:12 - it's touching the color of the red teeth
07:17 - we want to make the shark bigger a
07:19 - little bit so you can do this
07:21 - set it to like maybe 300 size for now
07:25 - we'll reset later so if you want to
07:28 - capture a color
07:29 - just press this button and then you can
07:32 - capture the red color
07:33 - because you want the fish to touch the
07:35 - red so
07:36 - let's touch and color that red so next
07:39 - you want
07:40 - if you touch the color red then you
07:42 - change the score
07:45 - by one we can start the sound
07:49 - chomp do we have chomp in here
07:53 - nope so
07:56 - we need the chomp sound so it'll make it
07:59 - look like the shark ate it
08:01 - with the chomps down so let's go to the
08:04 - sound
08:06 - gonna do sound chomp should be somewhere
08:12 - here
08:17 - you know i'm just going to search it
08:19 - chump
08:21 - it's like this so we can
08:24 - place the sound chomp and then it'll
08:28 - hide
08:28 - because the shark ate it
08:31 - then we can wait three seconds and then
08:33 - regener generate
08:35 - another fish after three seconds has
08:38 - passed
08:39 - we need to broadcast a message called
08:41 - fish
08:42 - start over
08:54 - fish start over so now we need to call
08:57 - the function
08:58 - to start this so we need a one clicked
09:03 - show in the beginning you can set the
09:07 - size to 50
09:08 - so it's not that big
09:12 - then we can set the rotation to left and
09:15 - right
09:15 - so it won't flip over
09:19 - like the shark and then we can
09:22 - call the function bluefish and then when
09:25 - the fish start over
09:26 - when it receives the message
09:30 - then you can also
09:33 - call the move fish okay so now all you
09:36 - have to do is duplicate this code to the
09:38 - other fishes
09:40 - so if you wanted to duplicate it you
09:42 - drag it down here
09:44 - if you see a wobble then you can drop it
09:46 - it'll duplicate it to the other sprites
10:12 - now let me check if the other fishes
10:14 - have it
10:25 - yes and now we are all set
10:28 - now let's try out the game
10:36 - so i found out my error so the color
10:39 - wasn't
10:39 - exact to the shark so that's why
10:43 - the shark wasn't eating it eating the
10:46 - fish
10:47 - so you have to put it on here to get the
10:49 - exact color it wasn't it was like
10:51 - slightly off
10:53 - in it and it didn't and it didn't call
10:56 - us the same
10:57 - color even though it looks similar
11:01 - so you have to remember to select the
11:03 - same color
11:07 - like this okay
11:10 - so now after select this the game
11:14 - should work
11:26 - see
11:30 - so yeah it's pretty much sharks and
11:33 - minnows
11:34 - so don't forget to save your project and
11:37 - thank you guys for watching
11:38 - see you guys next time in the next video
