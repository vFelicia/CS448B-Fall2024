00:02 - [Music]
00:11 - all right guys welcome back
00:13 - to the channel so uh this will be the
00:15 - last tutorial
00:17 - uh for the penguin flip game
00:20 - if you have not done the uh the
00:23 - the first one in the second one so i
00:26 - suggest you to do that first
00:29 - so after you work on the first one and
00:31 - the second one you can work on this last
00:33 - one
00:34 - this is the last uh and final change to
00:37 - the penguin game what we are going to
00:39 - make is we gonna make a
00:40 - fish that will fly up and down
00:44 - in here between the ice block and the
00:47 - iceberg here
00:48 - and the penguin can jump over while the
00:51 - fish is up in the air he can
00:54 - catch it if you catch it then you get
00:56 - some extra points so
00:58 - this is what we're going to be working
00:59 - on today
01:01 - all right let's get started so today
01:04 - so we're gonna add a fish first so we'll
01:07 - look for fish here
01:10 - so we'll type fish
01:13 - so we can take this fish actually this
01:15 - fish actually have a couple of different
01:17 - costumes
01:18 - we are going to use the uh costume
01:22 - number three here i mean this looks like
01:24 - he has some wings that he could fly
01:26 - up in the air so we'll be using this
01:28 - fish
01:29 - all right so we'll set up the gear
01:33 - the fish right now so uh
01:36 - we'll go back to the coal
01:40 - we'll drag in the event when start
01:44 - we always did that when the green flag
01:47 - is clicked
01:49 - we'll set the fish around 50
01:53 - so this fish is a little too big make it
01:56 - fifty percent and then we will point in
02:00 - direction
02:01 - um point in direction
02:04 - zero meaning that the fish will be
02:06 - pointing up
02:07 - so the fish will be rotated and then
02:10 - pointing up
02:12 - and if i run this you can see the fish
02:14 - is pointing up
02:15 - right that's how it will look like so
02:18 - you see the fish is pointing up with
02:20 - these two coat
02:21 - so next i will say hi so we don't want
02:24 - to show the fish
02:26 - when the game begin
02:29 - okay and we have to define a new uh
02:32 - function for the fish so what this do
02:36 - function we can use it um
02:38 - to uh to call the uh um
02:42 - different block we put different blocks
02:44 - in here and then we can make a call
02:46 - later on so we're gonna
02:49 - fish
02:53 - jump so this function is called fish
02:56 - jump so uh what we do is we
03:00 - will make the fish jump up into the air
03:02 - and then come right back down
03:04 - so we will need a loop here
03:07 - so repeat uh 20 times
03:12 - then we have to go into here say move
03:16 - random step basically we want to kind of
03:19 - make the fish kind of go
03:21 - higher or slower and we can use a uh
03:25 - operator here let's say pick a random
03:29 - we'll put 10 to let's say 15
03:32 - steps and then we will add this
03:36 - weight condition here 0.1
03:40 - so kind of make the fish
03:43 - slow down a bit when it's moving up
03:46 - then we have to change the direction
03:48 - again we want to point
03:50 - to 180 meaning the the fish is going
03:53 - back down
03:56 - so i will point downward so we'll repeat
03:59 - it again
04:02 - duplicate this code put this over here
04:06 - so now uh we'll do the same thing right
04:08 - so that
04:10 - it jumped all the way up into the air
04:12 - and then it turned around and then come
04:14 - back down
04:15 - that's what this code will do okay
04:19 - now that we have the code done here
04:23 - be sure to click on like share
04:26 - subscribe and click on this notification
04:29 - bell
04:30 - to receive all the latest updates from
04:33 - this channel
04:34 - thank you okay we'll make the fish
04:38 - jump by broadcasting uh some messages
04:42 - so that the fish once the fish receive
04:44 - some stop
04:45 - uh this message will start um
04:49 - making the jumping action so let's add
04:51 - this
04:52 - here so we'll add the broadcast message
04:55 - here
04:58 - at the end and we make it a new message
05:02 - called setup fish
05:06 - so this is setting up the fish for the
05:09 - for the for the
05:10 - game so what do we want to do when this
05:13 - uh setup fish
05:14 - is called i'll move this over here a
05:16 - little bit
05:20 - so we'll say when i receive
05:24 - set up when the fish is getting set up
05:26 - what i want to do
05:28 - i want to go
05:31 - here say uh go to a random
05:35 - call the x and y position so the y
05:39 - uh we will put it as negative 150 kinda
05:43 - a little bit in the bottom so as you can
05:46 - see if you move the fish you can see
05:47 - right
05:48 - what what it is so you can see this is
05:50 - negative 154 we put it around
05:52 - 150 right so and then we'll put a x
05:56 - position
05:58 - so what we want to do is we want to set
06:00 - up the fish between the
06:01 - ice block and the iceberg here so
06:05 - we'll have to to look into the position
06:08 - of the x of the iceberg
06:10 - okay so what we can do is this what is
06:13 - the way random
06:16 - we'll say pick it random instead of a 1
06:19 - to 10 will to change this to a negative
06:22 - 50.
06:22 - so negative 50 is somewhere around this
06:26 - area here so this is like kind of zero
06:29 - right so negative 50 is somewhere here
06:31 - so we want to
06:33 - keep the fish between here and somewhere
06:35 - here so we're gonna
06:36 - we will take the x position of this ice
06:39 - block
06:40 - and we will subtract some
06:43 - some some x value here so that make get
06:47 - between this
06:48 - this and this so what we have to do is
06:51 - we go to sensing
06:54 - uh we have to take this one
06:58 - and then we will have to also use
07:00 - operator
07:01 - uh minus so we'll drop this in here with
07:05 - the select the
07:07 - iceberg first and we'll say the
07:10 - exposition of the iceberg
07:11 - so you run this this explicit is 174.
07:16 - so you say okay i want a minus maybe 70
07:19 - right and then this whole thing
07:22 - if you do that minus 70 you see this 104
07:25 - so we'll
07:26 - pick a random between negative 50 and
07:28 - 104 that's what it means
07:30 - so oops
07:31 - [Music]
07:33 - so i am going to either zoom back out i
07:36 - think i zoomed in too
07:37 - much with a little bit more complex code
07:40 - here
07:41 - so we'll put this over here so i have
07:45 - this right now
07:46 - so it will be a no between this negative
07:48 - 50 and whatever the
07:50 - x value of the iceberg minus 70
07:53 - and the y is always in the bottom when
07:55 - the setting of the fish
07:57 - so we also have to say point the fish to
08:00 - the
08:01 - 90 degree just in case the fish is up in
08:03 - the air
08:04 - and the fish have to restart again with
08:07 - make sure to point the fish back up
08:10 - and then we have to say show
08:14 - showing the fish and we have to call our
08:17 - block called
08:18 - jump so when we call this
08:21 - a setup fish we'll call this method this
08:24 - method we'll call setup fish again so
08:26 - basically
08:27 - it's kind of like an infinite loop right
08:29 - so this calls this
08:30 - this one called stats and then we can
08:32 - trigger the setup fish
08:34 - broadcast somewhere else too so that
08:36 - when it start
08:37 - it can keep on going so the fish will
08:39 - kind of come up and down up and down
08:41 - here so we also have to set up another
08:46 - um event here
08:50 - so when um
08:54 - okay when i receive
08:59 - with another one set up fish what we are
09:01 - going to do is we're going to put
09:02 - another forever loop here
09:04 - so what we don't want to do we don't
09:06 - want to combine this together we don't
09:08 - let this do its own job and this one can
09:10 - also do its own thing because it's a
09:12 - forever loop here
09:13 - we don't want to cause any problem for
09:16 - this right we have to put it
09:17 - under inside underneath right it won't
09:19 - make sense so we'll
09:20 - keep it as a separate one so um we'll
09:23 - need an if condition here
09:27 - okay now if the uh if the fish
09:30 - uh touch the penguin or you said say
09:33 - penguin touch the fish is the same thing
09:35 - basically if the if they touch then
09:38 - you know we want to make him disappear
09:40 - and we're going to give some points to
09:42 - the uh
09:42 - to the player so we'll touch the penguin
09:46 - so we can say change the score
09:51 - so we will say change the score by let's
09:53 - say 50 points so we get 50 points to the
09:55 - player
09:57 - then we'll hide the fish
10:01 - so that after you catch the fish the
10:04 - fish disappear
10:05 - then it can the fish can come up again
10:08 - so because okay
10:12 - all right that's done for now um
10:15 - so what we need
10:18 - to do
10:24 - okay so we will actually have to wait
10:27 - until the
10:27 - iceberg finish setting the position
10:31 - then we have to set up the fish right
10:33 - because we don't know where the iceberg
10:35 - is going to
10:36 - uh generate so we have to wait until
10:39 - that's done
10:39 - first before we can set the fish so we
10:41 - have to go back to iceberg here
10:44 - so after the iceberg received get ready
10:46 - from the penguin right
10:48 - so it will set the position uh somewhere
10:51 - here
10:52 - so after this we have to call
10:55 - um broadcast a message say
11:00 - set up the fish so once this is done
11:03 - you the event will go back to the fish
11:06 - here
11:06 - so the fish here will have will run
11:09 - these two coals so we will find the
11:11 - position of the iceberg
11:13 - uh subtract uh 70 um
11:17 - because uh the when you find the percent
11:19 - iceberg is probably here in the middle
11:20 - right so you have to subtract 70 you
11:22 - kind of move it somewhere here
11:24 - so between that and and then 50 uh
11:28 - between somewhere here and here so we'll
11:30 - generate the fish
11:31 - after that cause the jump the jumbo call
11:34 - this set up fish again so it kind of the
11:36 - fish will jump up in the air down
11:38 - up down up down like this right so
11:41 - now that we have it ready let's uh kind
11:44 - of test this out and see how it works
11:47 - so let's start so as you can see the
11:50 - iceberg
11:51 - generated and then you see the fish
11:53 - coming down
11:55 - and the fish is coming back up so the
11:58 - fish should never uh you know kind of
12:00 - touch the iceberg
12:01 - so you see it's generating between here
12:03 - and here
12:04 - right so uh let's if we stop it again
12:09 - we'll stop it again we'll start again
12:10 - the iceberg will come in different
12:12 - locations
12:12 - and you can see the fish is kind of
12:14 - between that
12:16 - so you see the fish is between the
12:18 - iceberg and the
12:19 - in the penguin so he's always between
12:22 - that
12:22 - those two points so this gap here so
12:25 - because of this
12:26 - function here we're trying to find the
12:28 - position between the iceberg and the
12:31 - and the and his block here so the fish
12:34 - is always between that so we can jump up
12:36 - and catch the fish so let's see what
12:37 - happens if we
12:38 - jump up so you see we get the 50 points
12:42 - and then 61 because we landed on the ice
12:45 - block
12:46 - iceberg here so let's try again
12:50 - so so we got him so we got 54 for the
12:54 - fish
12:54 - and then 10 points for the uh the uh the
12:57 - iceberg here so total
12:59 - 60 and then so that's why you get 120.
13:02 - so you see we missed it we still got the
13:04 - fish
13:05 - but we did we missed the iceberg so only
13:07 - 50 points
13:10 - so um okay i'm
13:14 - not doing well in this game
13:17 - okay it's all right so game over
13:20 - so you see how we came over the fish is
13:23 - still kind of moving
13:24 - that's not what we want right we wanna
13:26 - when it's a game over the fish should be
13:28 - stopped moving right so we have to uh
13:32 - make some cool change too to fix that
13:35 - so what we have to do is we're going to
13:36 - go back to the penguin
13:39 - so here we see right touching blue color
13:43 - right so either he's standing on this
13:45 - eye block or he's
13:46 - hitting the edge we want to stop the
13:48 - fish so what we can do is broadcast
13:53 - a new message you say stop
13:57 - fish okay
14:01 - so when you do this it will it will
14:03 - broadcast the message and we can stop it
14:04 - so we will need this something similar
14:08 - so we will also want to touch the edge
14:11 - we also want to stop it
14:14 - say stop the fish all right
14:18 - so now we have the uh both the uh
14:22 - the fish um getting stopped here
14:26 - and then also here if it's touched the
14:29 - blue
14:29 - basically this iceberg here or if i
14:31 - touch the edge basically if it hit the
14:33 - top here the bottom of the c
14:36 - it will call this broadcaster's message
14:38 - so now we have to go back to the
14:42 - penguin
14:45 - so in the penguin so when we are not
14:47 - opinion so whether go back to the fish
14:49 - so when we go back to the fish
14:51 - um when we receive
14:55 - stop fish so we have to say um
15:00 - stop let's go back to control
15:04 - so what we want to do is say stop
15:07 - other script in the sprite basically
15:09 - we'll stop everything here
15:11 - or this guy here and then when the
15:14 - penguin get ready to launch again the
15:17 - fish will start again
15:18 - so let's try this now
15:22 - all right so the fish is up in the air
15:26 - so we catch it as you can see the fish
15:29 - didn't come out right
15:30 - until until i started back over here so
15:33 - let's say if i
15:34 - kind of lose on purpose
15:38 - right so you see the stop the fish
15:40 - stopped moving right until i
15:41 - started again right so
15:45 - so no more game over the fish stop
15:47 - moving right
15:48 - it should not be stop still moving right
15:50 - because we have this so we can stop the
15:52 - fish
15:53 - from moving or you can say you can also
15:55 - add here after this say hi to spry or
15:58 - something like that
15:59 - but that's up to you uh so pretty much
16:03 - this is how the game works so
16:05 - um so i think we got everything
16:09 - the penguin right we got the penguin
16:12 - the code for the penguin again i can
16:14 - show you here
16:15 - so we can go through it a little bit so
16:18 - you have the code here to
16:20 - to make the finger and flip this is
16:21 - making the pigment go back to the start
16:24 - this is the the green flex click we want
16:26 - to do something like this
16:27 - um what what we want to do with the
16:29 - penguin right we can
16:31 - go to the start position and this is
16:33 - when we receive the jump
16:35 - what are we doing here checking if it's
16:37 - touching here or touching the edge right
16:39 - and then we have pretty much uh then you
16:43 - understand this if you don't go back to
16:45 - the
16:45 - previous two video and trying to
16:47 - understand uh
16:48 - listen on it again basically this is
16:51 - kind of touching the
16:52 - blue color basically this uh spike here
16:55 - if you touch that you want to give them
16:58 - the point right
16:58 - making the position of the the penguin
17:01 - standing on top of the iceberg and
17:03 - all that and playing the sound and
17:05 - moving the finger back to the
17:06 - starting position if we touch the edge
17:10 - you stop the fish and then we minus the
17:13 - light right
17:13 - same thing here then the ice block is
17:16 - pretty simple right not
17:18 - much coal here we just kind of put them
17:20 - in the position
17:21 - iceberg we have one added one coal right
17:23 - this one is after the iceberg is
17:25 - generated we want to broadcast a message
17:28 - to tell the fish to be set up
17:30 - before that we don't want to set up the
17:31 - fish because we don't know where the
17:33 - iceberg will be
17:34 - generating from so after that
17:37 - then the arrow the arrow is pretty much
17:39 - the same as the
17:40 - before right we didn't change much uh
17:43 - when the when you click on the screen
17:44 - they will broadcast this jump
17:46 - which calls the penguin uh jump message
17:49 - here
17:49 - which will launch the penguin in the air
17:53 - and then the fish is uh the same
17:56 - we did that today for this lesson so
17:58 - this one is when the fish
18:00 - we created the uh the uh
18:03 - the definition of fish jump here uh
18:06 - we make the fish going up and down
18:08 - pointing zero
18:10 - uh when we point zero meaning it's
18:12 - pointing up
18:13 - uh 180 meaning pointing down right and
18:16 - then we have these two uh
18:17 - condition m2 event here what we want to
18:20 - do is calculate the ice bark
18:23 - iceberg and the position here between
18:25 - that before when the fish to move why
18:28 - this is setting up the fish to
18:29 - see if it catch it touch the penguin if
18:32 - it
18:32 - touch the pink when you give 50 points
18:34 - to the player
18:36 - so this is just making the fish uh
18:38 - smaller right in the beginning
18:39 - and this is stopping the fish basically
18:41 - once you catch the fish
18:43 - and you land it on here or the ocean you
18:45 - have to stop the fish
18:46 - from moving right so this is pretty much
18:50 - uh the video so uh please
18:53 - like subscribe to the channel and we
18:56 - will create more
18:58 - fun video alright thank you everyone
19:01 - have a good day bye
19:13 - you
