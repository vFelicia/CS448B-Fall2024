00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video called tunnel
00:12 - today we're working on this game in
00:13 - scratch the objective
00:15 - of the game is the player is is to
00:17 - control the beetle
00:18 - to dig a tunnel and get the goal
00:23 - total of gold we'll be learning these
00:25 - following concepts in scratch
00:27 - variable loops pen and broadcast message
00:35 - so i'm going to show you a demo
00:38 - it's a game for some music playing in
00:41 - the backwards
00:42 - use arrow keys to control the beetle as
00:45 - you can
00:46 - as you can see you're the other person
00:48 - you're
00:49 - you're supposed to dig with d you're
00:51 - just keep on digging
00:53 - and mix like this pink color and then
00:56 - you can't get inside
00:58 - like the dirt if you don't dig
01:02 - so rocks also pump you backwards so
01:06 - that that could be a problem for you
01:10 - and there's also a timer and you can
01:12 - also i got the gold
01:14 - it'll stop everything so before i start
01:18 - please like share subscribe and comments
01:21 - in the comment in the comment section
01:23 - below
01:23 - to see what videos you want next
01:27 - so i'm gonna be a new project
01:30 - we don't need the scratch cat
01:33 - so let's get the beetle sprite
01:38 - and sprite right here
01:42 - um
01:45 - so i already have some things in the
01:47 - backpack for me
01:48 - like the sprite the dig sprite
01:52 - you can just draw these really easy to
01:54 - draw um
01:56 - at the start area
01:59 - and the in the background
02:06 - okay so i'm also draw the gold
02:15 - and you just need some circles
02:24 - so let me do that um
02:28 - get the no outline
02:32 - that's correct um and also
02:35 - uh gold
02:40 - [Music]
02:49 - i'll adjust that let's make that bigger
02:55 - so here we are you have a piece of gold
03:01 - um i might adjust it a little bit
03:13 - so we got that piece of gold
03:17 - all right so we can also change the name
03:21 - of it to gold and we also can change
03:24 - this
03:25 - to uh the name of this thing
03:28 - to tunnel of gold
03:32 - or gold digger
03:41 - i'll show you how to draw the backdrop
03:45 - so let's just go back drop one
03:48 - it's easy just a gigantic square
03:54 - it can be any colors
04:00 - yes it's 96 color 60 saturation
04:03 - and 56 brightness
04:08 - yes delete it okay so
04:14 - i'm gonna go start on the code
04:17 - first let's draw the start area that's
04:20 - to teach you how to draw that
04:23 - same thing it's just a rectangle same
04:25 - thing
04:26 - it has to be sprite 96 color 42
04:28 - saturation and 81 brightness
04:32 - you can also adjust it
04:38 - the starting area is bigger than the dig
04:40 - and we're going to make the beetle
04:41 - smaller so the
04:42 - starting area is bigger than the um
04:46 - beetle so
04:50 - i have to make these two variables
04:54 - timer
04:59 - and digging
05:08 - i also have to work on the backdrop
05:09 - backdrop's um
05:11 - really simple we already showed you how
05:12 - to draw it and
05:15 - we just can uh get some sounds
05:18 - we can use the cave sound that's what i
05:21 - used earlier
05:32 - so the cave sound
05:36 - i think it's up here yep place down cave
05:38 - until done
05:40 - so there we go so we also have to work
05:43 - on the starting area the start area is
05:45 - really simple
05:49 - we can also add the rocks
06:04 - so oh my gosh it's so small around this
06:08 - size i hope you guys can see this
06:10 - um i'll go to
06:18 - beetle
06:22 - beetle so
06:26 - we can move on to the date sprite the
06:28 - dig sprite
06:29 - so there's this new type of block right
06:31 - here
06:33 - called pen no i already have it up
06:36 - if not you you can just go here click on
06:38 - the pen and there you go
06:40 - i already have it so
06:43 - if green flag is clicked
06:48 - green flag is clicked it will erase
06:51 - all
06:54 - hide
07:00 - i'll go forever go to beetle
07:06 - so we can use this to take later
07:14 - and then go so we're going to work on
07:16 - the gold
07:20 - so when green flag is clicked
07:25 - um reset timer because there's a timer
07:28 - that we're using
07:30 - reset timer right there
07:33 - it'll go to x y
07:37 - whatever but it's going to be a pick
07:39 - random so
07:41 - it can be anywhere
07:45 - so we have to pick random 80
07:49 - the 225 and negative
07:53 - 160 to
07:56 - 160.
08:00 - then it'll go up and down
08:06 - i'll generate around this area
08:10 - and just keep on working so then
08:15 - so you have to make a new broadcast
08:17 - called
08:18 - set up rocks
08:26 - so so you want to set up the rocks be
08:29 - at the gold before the rocks or else the
08:33 - rocks might generate on top of the gold
08:36 - so we can go forever
08:40 - and then set timer
08:44 - to timer
08:51 - this will keep track of the time so we
08:53 - can also work on the rocks
08:54 - right so
08:58 - when i receive set up rocks why is
09:00 - everything so small
09:02 - i receive set up rocks repeat
09:06 - three times i'll create a clone
09:09 - of myself it'll hide
09:17 - oh wait one second
09:21 - and broadcast a new message called
09:25 - start game
09:34 - starting
09:41 - start game and when i start as a clone
09:48 - yeah so this will call this oh it'll
09:50 - create three rocks since it has a repeat
09:52 - three
09:53 - it'll go to it's another random
09:56 - it'll go to pick
09:59 - random and another pick random
10:03 - pick random negative 200
10:07 - to positive 200 and
10:10 - negative 150
10:15 - to positive
10:20 - little show
10:24 - a repeat until
10:30 - not touching gold so won't ever touch
10:33 - the gold
10:34 - so it'll be like not
10:38 - you also need a ore so let me
10:41 - go inside there not
10:44 - touching gold
10:49 - or touching
10:52 - beetles it won't spawn on top of the
10:54 - beetle
10:58 - and then so you can just duplicate this
11:01 - one because it's literally the same
11:03 - thing
11:04 - delete this put it inside here
11:08 - so there we go this is the rox code
11:12 - that wasn't working correctly because i
11:13 - made a mistake so
11:15 - the or statement right here is
11:18 - not supposed to go outside it's supposed
11:21 - to even not going outside
11:22 - then you put the or
11:26 - you guys throw away this knot put the
11:28 - ore inside the knot
11:30 - and then put the touching gold in
11:33 - touching beetle
11:35 - so that's the correct code
11:39 - let's try now
11:51 - [Music]
11:52 - as you can see it's not touching the
11:54 - rocks like the gold or the beer
12:03 - okay so um
12:07 - we'll continue next video so thank you
12:10 - for watching everyone
12:11 - see you guys
12:24 - you
