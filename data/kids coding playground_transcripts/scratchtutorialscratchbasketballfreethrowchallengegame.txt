00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back everyone to kids coding
00:09 - playground
00:09 - today we'll be making a basketball free
00:12 - throw challenge
00:12 - two player game so as you can see my
00:15 - brother made
00:16 - a uh another basketball game um we
00:19 - posted this tutorial a few days ago
00:21 - but instead um of using video we're
00:23 - going to be using
00:24 - just the mouse so like the last one like
00:27 - you use your
00:27 - video you try to like use your body
00:30 - parts to knock
00:31 - the ball into the goal well this time
00:33 - it's gonna be different so i'm gonna
00:34 - demonstrate the game so let's play it
00:36 - so player one starts out so however
00:39 - strong you
00:39 - however you hold the ball as you see the
00:43 - power is going up
00:44 - as you can see i miss so usually around
00:47 - 50 to 60 power
00:48 - it will make it in as you can see
00:51 - i made it in and i gained one score in
00:54 - the right side
00:55 - you can see and let's see uh
00:59 - i missed that see
01:02 - around from 50 to 60 it will
01:05 - make it in all right let's say you don't
01:08 - make it yeah just
01:09 - switch to the next player yeah so it's
01:12 - basically kind of like a basketball free
01:13 - throw each person gets five throws
01:17 - all right let's finish this game real
01:18 - quick
01:21 - all right okay so as you can see
01:24 - player two had three score and player
01:27 - one had zero score
01:28 - so player two won so it will display
01:31 - player two wins
01:33 - so that's pretty much the game let's
01:35 - create a new project
01:39 - all right so we'll start out with
01:40 - renaming the project
01:42 - let's name it the basketball free
01:45 - throw through all right
01:49 - and then we would not use the scratch
01:51 - cap we i'm pretty sure they have a
01:53 - basketball spread in here
01:55 - yeah we'll just take this basketball
01:57 - sprint um
01:58 - we'll name this p1 which since we're
02:01 - clear one
02:02 - we can duplicate it and then we'll just
02:05 - p2 yeah we'll just basically recolor it
02:08 - let's make it look a blue color boom
02:12 - so we just recolor this p1 is
02:15 - um just the normal basketball and then
02:18 - for p2 we will do
02:19 - just a blue basketball all right
02:23 - so for the code we are also going to uh
02:26 - for the backdrop i mean we're also
02:27 - getting a backdrop so i'm pretty sure
02:29 - that's a basketball backdrop
02:31 - basket yeah we're here we'll be using
02:34 - this one i guess
02:36 - okay so now we're going to make the
02:38 - target sprite
02:39 - um inside the game so we're going to
02:40 - know the backdrop and we're only going
02:42 - to take this basketball hoop
02:44 - we're just going to copy it and then
02:45 - we're going to make a paint and do
02:47 - spring
02:48 - paste it here or to ungroup this thing
02:51 - so that we can get only the white part
02:53 - we just need the backboard that'll be
02:55 - our target
02:57 - so we're just gonna delete all of this
03:00 - and leaving us with this and you can
03:01 - just drag it
03:03 - on top to fit it like that
03:07 - now we're going to rename the sprite to
03:08 - target
03:11 - okay
03:15 - target so inside the target and then we
03:19 - inside the target we'll just put a
03:20 - simple piece of code when greenfly
03:22 - clicked
03:23 - inside the target we're just going to
03:24 - make it go to the back layer
03:26 - all right that's it go to back layer
03:31 - that's it and then for the player one
03:33 - ball we're going to
03:34 - start off with make getting a one green
03:36 - flag clicked so
03:39 - inside the player one ball one green
03:41 - flag clicked
03:42 - we're going to show
03:45 - and then we're going to set the size to
03:46 - 100 because um
03:48 - as you saw in the demonstration the ball
03:50 - gets smaller as you get closer the goal
03:52 - is to simulate that it's
03:53 - going further away from you and for the
03:57 - old project i made it go
03:58 - to x zero and then the y is negative
04:01 - 110 all right and then we're going to
04:04 - make two variables
04:05 - for all sprites one is called
04:09 - p1 uh score
04:12 - and then the other one should be called
04:14 - p1
04:15 - ball count so this is the amount of
04:19 - balls
04:20 - the player has all right
04:23 - and then um we'll need to make two more
04:25 - variables for this sprite
04:26 - only so you have to click the for the
04:28 - sprite only we'll name it
04:30 - counter so this is to count how many
04:32 - times you'll go through the loop
04:34 - and then we will make another for the
04:36 - sprite only and will be
04:37 - power power so it's how much power you
04:40 - throw the ball at all right so
04:43 - first we will get a when this sprite is
04:46 - clicked
04:47 - so as you can see we use the mouse so
04:49 - we're going to use
04:50 - sprite clips um also after this we have
04:54 - to set the p1
04:55 - score to zero and set the player one
04:58 - ball counts oops ball count to five so
05:01 - i'll give them five shots
05:03 - and then when the sprite is clicked we
05:05 - are going to set the power to zero in
05:07 - the beginning
05:08 - and then we're going to point direction
05:10 - of zero which is pointing up
05:15 - and now we're going to get an if then
05:17 - statement so if
05:20 - if the player ball count is greater than
05:23 - zero
05:24 - so if they haven't ran out of tries then
05:27 - it will uh repeat until not
05:32 - mouse down so you'll keep on repeating
05:36 - this
05:36 - until not mouse down so not
05:40 - mouse down mouse down
05:43 - put that in here and then we're gonna
05:46 - basically when you're clicking on it
05:47 - we're gonna change the power by
05:49 - uh pick random one to ten to give it a
05:51 - little bit variability
05:53 - just make it a little vary a little bit
05:55 - so we're going to
05:56 - change the power by pick
05:59 - random one to ten right
06:04 - and then right here we're going to get
06:05 - an if then statement inside this repeat
06:07 - loop so we're going to get an if
06:10 - if the power is greater than or equal to
06:13 - zero
06:14 - i'm 100 equals 100 greater than
06:17 - or equal to 100 so basically
06:21 - once you hold on the ball too long and
06:24 - the power exceeds 100
06:25 - we're basically just going to make it go
06:27 - start back from the beginning so
06:30 - so if the power is greater than 100 or
06:33 - equal to 100
06:34 - then we're going to set the power back
06:35 - to zero so
06:37 - it'll keep on looping around right and
06:41 - then we're going to make it wait
06:42 - 0.01 seconds
06:48 - let's give it a little bit weight and
06:49 - then we're going to broadcast a message
06:51 - called shoot
06:53 - so this is the shoot the ball
06:58 - all right so inside the same sprite
07:00 - we're going to
07:01 - want to receive shoot
07:04 - um we can
07:08 - uh set the counter to zero so the
07:10 - counter will be zero i
07:12 - actually could have done all the code in
07:13 - player one and then do and then just
07:15 - duplicated the sprite
07:17 - um but i guess that's okay because some
07:19 - of the code is different from
07:21 - player one and player two all right when
07:23 - i receive shoot set counter to zero
07:25 - and then we're going to repeat until the
07:29 - counter
07:30 - is greater than power or that it's
07:32 - touching the edge
07:35 - all right so we're going to repeat and
07:36 - again or
07:39 - let's move this to the side of it or
07:42 - um counter
07:46 - greater than power
07:49 - um counter
07:52 - power the counters just like to count
07:55 - how much times
07:56 - it loops and then we're going to if it's
07:59 - touching the edge
08:00 - as well touching edge
08:03 - and then after this we're going to make
08:04 - it move five steps so it's going to be
08:06 - five steps towards the goal
08:08 - so move five steps and we're going to
08:12 - change the counter by one
08:15 - all right and then we're going to move
08:18 - but we're going to set the size to 100
08:20 - and then we're going to go back
08:22 - to the original zero negative 110
08:25 - after you've shot the shot shot the
08:28 - ball all right and then we're going to
08:31 - broadcast
08:32 - player 2 ready the player 2 will be
08:35 - ready once
08:36 - the player is done one is done shooting
08:38 - so
08:39 - to ready and then we're going to hide
08:43 - this ball once it is done once you're
08:46 - done
08:46 - all right
08:50 - so what else do we have to do oh yeah
08:54 - and when i receive shoot remember we
08:56 - broadcast here we have to receive
08:57 - something else
08:58 - when i see the message shoot now we're
09:01 - going to change
09:02 - the um p1 uh ball counter by
09:05 - negative one
09:10 - and we're going to repeat 20 times so
09:12 - it's just to make the ball smaller
09:14 - so it will look like it's going away
09:16 - from you
09:17 - repeat 20 times and then we're going to
09:20 - change the size by two
09:22 - negative two all right
09:27 - okay so and then
09:30 - we will get another one green flag
09:32 - clicked so i'm gonna fly clicked
09:36 - forever so if the power is between
09:40 - 50 and 60 then and touching the target
09:42 - then we'll change the score
09:44 - so if so we're going to need two and
09:47 - statements so
09:48 - and and operators put them like that and
09:51 - so
09:51 - if the power is greater than
09:55 - 50 and
09:58 - the power is less than 60 so it's
10:02 - between 50 and 60 because it's around
10:05 - the near the goal that's why we're doing
10:06 - that
10:07 - power is less than 60.
10:11 - then and touching the target so if it
10:13 - require if it's within all these
10:14 - requirements
10:16 - then we'll broadcast a message
10:20 - um called score and wait
10:24 - it used to wait oops
10:28 - all right and then when i receive score
10:30 - inside the player
10:32 - player one i receive score we're going
10:35 - to hide
10:38 - change the p1 score by one
10:43 - and then we're going to wait a point two
10:45 - second
10:48 - all right okay
10:53 - let's try it out for player one so
10:56 - so as you oh wait let me show the
10:58 - variable first show the variable
11:01 - power all right let me change it to
11:04 - slider
11:05 - all right let's play it in so
11:08 - as you can see when you hold on it the
11:10 - slider will continue
11:12 - um going back and forth and listen
11:15 - uh 61 that's a miss as you can see
11:22 - 46. so yeah that's
11:25 - um kind of what it is let's try overtime
11:28 - let's try again
11:29 - something within 50. oops
11:34 - as you can see that is score because
11:36 - it's touching the target and it's
11:37 - between 50 and 60.
11:39 - all right so now let's work on player
11:43 - two
11:45 - in player two we are going to just drag
11:48 - and drop all this code we'll have to
11:49 - change some of it obviously
11:56 - drag on the screen here
12:03 - all right i think we have all the code
12:05 - inside player 2.
12:07 - let's just split some of this code out
12:12 - all right so up here first of all we're
12:16 - going to make some new variables
12:18 - so we're going to make a new variable
12:21 - oh wait i think i made the player um
12:24 - power
12:26 - thing uh i made the power for
12:29 - um did i make it for all sprites
12:33 - i think i did because it's showing up
12:34 - right here
12:36 - so i think we're going to have to um
12:39 - delete power
12:41 - and then we're going to have to make it
12:43 - again we just forgot to set it
12:46 - for the sprite only sorry about that so
12:49 - power we'll just put this back
12:54 - power equal to 100 um
12:58 - so yeah you always have to remember to
13:00 - set this to
13:01 - um this sprite only set
13:05 - power to zero right where else do we
13:08 - oh we're using power right here as well
13:13 - where else do we have using power
13:20 - i think that's it checking
13:24 - uh all right i think that's all the uses
13:28 - of power
13:30 - oh yes and i forgot you also have to set
13:32 - the power to zero in the beginning
13:35 - that's one more
13:38 - and we have to um change the power by
13:42 - pick random
13:44 - change power i pick random one to ten
13:48 - give you a little theory all right i
13:51 - think that's
13:52 - all of it sorry about that i forgot to
13:54 - change it to this right only
13:57 - so inside here the variables
14:00 - what's oh wait it's already made for us
14:02 - oh okay
14:05 - i think i think when i um had this it
14:07 - was already with it
14:08 - so player two also needs a variable
14:12 - called power
14:13 - but you also have to set it to the
14:14 - sprite only so you just remember that
14:17 - i will also make another variable inside
14:19 - player two
14:21 - so we're going to we're just going to
14:23 - name it uh counter
14:24 - again but for the sprite only
14:28 - for this right only and then we're going
14:30 - to make some new variables
14:32 - called p2 ball count and p2 score
14:39 - for all sprites this is for all sprites
14:44 - uh score yeah there you go
14:48 - um
14:51 - okay so inside the player two we are
14:52 - going to change up some variables
14:54 - instead of p1 score we're going to do p2
14:56 - score
14:57 - and p2 ball count and right here
15:01 - um power 0 this is all the same except
15:05 - variables power p2 ball count
15:10 - and right here same
15:14 - instead of shoot we're gonna broadcast
15:16 - shoot two because shoot is already in
15:18 - use
15:19 - so we're gonna make a variable shoot two
15:21 - because if we get a broadcast shoot from
15:22 - player two it's gonna
15:24 - use what player one is doing so we're
15:27 - gonna have to broadcast shoot two
15:30 - and right here player two score we're
15:32 - gonna change the player two score
15:34 - and then right here we're gonna do the
15:36 - player two ball count change that
15:39 - all right um anything else
15:43 - okay i think this power has to be for
15:47 - this sprite only the power for this one
15:53 - yeah so power already there
15:56 - all right so now
16:01 - what else do we have to do all right
16:03 - yeah and we also have to do this so
16:04 - in here remember
16:09 - i also forgot to drag and drop one more
16:11 - piece of the code
16:12 - so remember to get all of your code in
16:15 - here so let's zoom back in
16:16 - you guys have to change this one the
16:19 - counter is the same
16:20 - yeah uh counter um
16:24 - and then set size 100 go to that yeah
16:26 - and then
16:27 - instead of player two ready we're gonna
16:29 - um
16:32 - yeah so right now we're gonna do player
16:35 - one ready we're gonna make a new
16:37 - message called player one ready because
16:40 - the player
16:41 - two has already gone so we're gonna be
16:43 - player one ready
16:45 - all right so and then right here
16:49 - we're going to receive a message when i
16:50 - receive player 2 ready from the
16:52 - player 1 we're going to show this one
16:57 - and also we're going to just drag and
16:59 - drop this into the player 1
17:01 - and player 1 instead of player two ready
17:03 - we're gonna do player one ready
17:05 - then we'll show and then also in player
17:08 - two we're gonna add one more piece of
17:09 - code
17:10 - so right here instead of shoot we're
17:11 - obviously gonna have to
17:13 - um broadcast shoot two same with
17:16 - all of this one this has to be shoot too
17:19 - and right here we're gonna have to make
17:21 - a new variable called score
17:22 - that new message called score two so
17:26 - uh where did we do the score
17:30 - um all right so down here we're going to
17:34 - have to broadcast a new message called
17:36 - score 2
17:37 - and wait remember that and so then right
17:40 - here we're going to do score 2
17:42 - and wait all right
17:47 - all right i think everything is now fine
17:51 - all right okay so inside
17:55 - the shoot 2 we're going to get an if
17:57 - then
17:59 - so what this does is like
18:03 - so since player two goes last we're
18:05 - going to have to
18:06 - put an if-then statement inside of here
18:09 - so
18:10 - we're gonna get an if that statement so
18:12 - if we're gonna wrap it around
18:14 - this one and put the hide back at the
18:16 - bottom so
18:18 - if the player ball count is greater than
18:21 - zero
18:22 - then we're going to broadcast player one
18:24 - ready
18:26 - since player two goes last player
18:29 - one counts p1 ball counts
18:34 - all right now we can
18:37 - work on like the flashing thing as you
18:39 - can see in the beginning
18:41 - like when we in the demonstration like
18:43 - it'll say player one ready player two
18:45 - ready so we're gonna do that stuff
18:47 - so we're just gonna paint some sprites
18:49 - all right so let's get the text bright
18:51 - um
18:51 - just make it green i don't know just
18:54 - right um
18:56 - player when ready
19:00 - just to like let the players know that
19:02 - player one
19:03 - is going right center sprite and then
19:06 - we're just gonna duplicate this one
19:10 - let's just make it another color
19:14 - oops let me duplicate it again
19:18 - i have to change the color first that's
19:20 - my mistake
19:22 - player two ready
19:26 - okay now now i can highlight it
19:31 - and turn it right all right so we have
19:33 - player one ready player two ready and
19:35 - then we're
19:35 - gonna let's say both players tie so
19:38 - we're gonna duplicate this
19:39 - and we're gonna context and right it is
19:42 - a tie
19:44 - because it is still possible to tie in
19:45 - this game if
19:47 - both players get the same score well
19:49 - let's make it like a yellow color
19:51 - orange color you know yellow is kind of
19:53 - hard to see
19:54 - it's got a dark orange color all right
19:57 - so now we have our costumes let's go
19:59 - into our ready spray so let's rename it
20:01 - to ready
20:03 - okay so inside the ready spray we're
20:05 - going to make a block
20:08 - and the block is going to be named uh
20:10 - blink so we're going to make it like
20:11 - blink a little bit
20:13 - like flash so instead of having to
20:17 - redo the code over and over again we're
20:18 - just going to use a custom block to
20:19 - define it so we can repeat two times
20:23 - repeat two times wait point one second
20:28 - 0.1 seconds show
20:32 - wait just duplicate this and then right
20:34 - here at the end where it's gonna hide
20:37 - and then we're gonna also put a hide at
20:39 - the bottom like that okay
20:41 - and then when green fly clicked we're
20:44 - going to switch the costume to costume
20:45 - one
20:46 - which is the this one
20:50 - the player one wins and then we're going
20:53 - uh player one ready so
20:54 - and then we're gonna put the blink
20:56 - custom block under it
20:58 - and then when i receive
21:02 - player one ready just duplicate this
21:05 - and then when i receive player two ready
21:09 - oops we're just gonna use the same thing
21:11 - but we're gonna use costume two
21:12 - instead which is the player all right
21:17 - so that's pretty much it
21:21 - let's go to the wind spread so
21:24 - we're gonna make a new sprite let's make
21:28 - it like a blue color i guess
21:31 - dark blue color and then we're gonna
21:32 - write you win
21:35 - player one wins player one wins
21:40 - all right and then we're also gonna do a
21:42 - player two wins
21:44 - and so on
21:49 - actually wait the it is a tie is
21:51 - supposed to be in here
21:53 - it's my mistake player 1 wins and then
21:56 - we're going to switch this to player two
21:58 - wins
21:59 - and then it is a tie should be inside
22:01 - this one
22:04 - okay and then we're gonna write is a tie
22:12 - if the tie has to be in the you win um
22:17 - uh sprite so that's what we're going to
22:20 - do
22:21 - all right so inside the wind sprite
22:22 - we're just going to rename this sprite
22:23 - to win
22:24 - in the code we are going to um when
22:27 - green fly clicked
22:28 - hide and right now we're gonna have to
22:31 - wait one second
22:33 - so the reason for uh so we're gonna wait
22:35 - one second right here okay
22:38 - and then after this we're going to
22:40 - forever loop
22:41 - and then if
22:44 - the um player ball count is equal to
22:47 - zero
22:48 - and the player two count is equal to
22:51 - zero
22:52 - so we're going to put an and equal
22:58 - zero zero player one ball count
23:04 - player two ball count is equal to zero
23:06 - we're gonna wait two seconds
23:08 - and the reason for waiting two seconds
23:10 - is
23:11 - so the last player can finish shooting
23:16 - before all right so after you finish
23:19 - this code i'll show you
23:20 - why we will need to wait because
23:22 - sometimes if you do if you don't wait
23:25 - the player might be the player two might
23:27 - be like halfway done
23:29 - with shooting but it'll end the game and
23:31 - say player one wins
23:32 - even though player two could have
23:34 - probably tied up the game
23:36 - or something so after this we're going
23:39 - to get in
23:40 - if else so if
23:44 - put that if else in here so if
23:47 - player 1 scores equal to player 2 score
23:51 - so that means if they're both equal then
23:53 - we're going to
23:55 - make it tie so player 2 score then we're
23:57 - going to switch the costume to costume 3
23:59 - which is the tie oops which is the thai
24:04 - um
24:05 - costume yeah all right
24:09 - and after this we're going to get
24:10 - another if else statement so if
24:14 - inside the else we're going to put
24:15 - another if else so if the player one
24:18 - score is greater than the player two
24:20 - score
24:22 - player one is greater than player two
24:23 - score then we're going to switch costume
24:25 - to costume one
24:26 - which is the costume for player one
24:28 - winning else we'll switch to costume two
24:30 - which is player 2 winning
24:33 - and then after this we're going to show
24:36 - and we're going to stop all
24:41 - all right now we're finished the code i
24:44 - will show you
24:46 - exactly why we would need that okay so
24:48 - let's move
24:49 - all the player two uh stuff onto one
24:51 - side and all the player one stuff onto
24:53 - one side
24:54 - so the player two power well i'll put on
24:56 - slider
24:57 - right so that's player two power player
25:00 - two score i'll just do it like that
25:02 - player one ball count player one power
25:08 - all right player two score
25:12 - and put this on top
25:17 - all right now we have both sides
25:20 - okay let's test out the game
25:25 - so as you can see i didn't i'm not
25:28 - making any of these shots right now
25:31 - yeah yeah so that should be a shot as
25:34 - you can see
25:34 - player 2 now has one point i overshot
25:38 - that one
25:40 - over shot this one too 59 that's a shot
25:47 - this might end up as a tie actually yeah
25:50 - so it's a tie
25:52 - so it will say it is a tie and obviously
25:55 - you can make these sprites go to zero
25:57 - zero
25:57 - if you want so in the beginning you can
26:00 - just make it go to
26:01 - zero zero so it's even and also for here
26:04 - you can also
26:05 - white green plug plates zero zero
26:08 - all right so i will remove this
26:12 - um wait two seconds and show you what
26:14 - will happen now
26:20 - okay so let's quickly finish this game
26:34 - all right so right now i made one with
26:37 - player two
26:38 - so as you can see player uh two has one
26:41 - more shot left
26:44 - player two has one more uh two more
26:46 - shots left player one has one more shot
26:48 - left
26:50 - player one will go one more time as you
26:52 - can see look
26:54 - in the middle of shooting player two
26:57 - will already stop
26:58 - even though player one already lost but
27:00 - player one
27:01 - could have had a chance to win so you do
27:03 - not want this to happen
27:04 - you don't want it to just randomly stop
27:07 - the action before the polish being shot
27:09 - so we always have to make it wait two
27:11 - seconds
27:12 - before we do it
27:15 - all right so that's that's why the wait
27:17 - two seconds is necessary
