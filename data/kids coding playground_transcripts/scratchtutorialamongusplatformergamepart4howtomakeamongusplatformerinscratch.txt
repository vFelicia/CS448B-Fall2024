00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hey guys welcome back to kids calling
00:09 - playground
00:10 - so today we will work on the among us
00:14 - platformer
00:15 - part 4 of this video okay so
00:18 - um just go over the code if you missed
00:21 - anything
00:22 - so this is the main character which is
00:23 - the black box um
00:25 - so here's the code on the control here
00:28 - on the left where the green flag is
00:30 - clicked and then they have all these
00:31 - different
00:32 - uh custom blocks so i think
00:35 - there was some question on the video
00:39 - they were saying that the character kind
00:41 - of slide down from the top is slowly
00:43 - coming down it's not hitting the bottom
00:45 - so make sure you guys have select this
00:47 - one run without refresh
00:50 - for the custom block okay so for the
00:52 - movement one you have to do that
00:54 - for this one the jump control you have
00:56 - to do that as well
00:58 - uh for this one hit ground check same
01:00 - thing run without refresh so we're
01:02 - important there
01:04 - and move hitbox okay run without refresh
01:08 - okay make sure you guys have that
01:09 - okay so this is the code for the uh the
01:12 - main character
01:13 - okay you can zoom in one more so
01:17 - here it is okay move it over
01:20 - to this side so this is the jump control
01:25 - and here's the hitbox and uh checking
01:27 - the ground
01:28 - okay all right so this is for this one
01:32 - this is for the animated character
01:35 - okay so this is like no button press we
01:38 - put in idle
01:39 - this is making the animated character to
01:41 - uh to
01:42 - uh run okay
01:45 - okay and this is the sound for the
01:48 - footstep
01:49 - and jump okay all right and then we did
01:52 - the
01:53 - trampoline i guess
01:58 - so that's the code for that
02:02 - okay uh one thing i made a mistake on
02:06 - the trampoline i forgot to add some coal
02:07 - here
02:08 - so what i show you is this i'll show you
02:10 - when i run this you can see
02:13 - so um when you run it you see how you i
02:17 - pull this out i can
02:18 - see you see there's another trampoline
02:20 - under there so we can fix this actually
02:23 - so in order to fix this uh what you have
02:25 - to do is
02:26 - you have to move the trampoline uh to
02:29 - uh some other place after you uh you
02:32 - place it down move the original clone
02:34 - so you have to put that over here in the
02:36 - setup so let's just put this over here
02:39 - put this here and here you say um
02:43 - look here say hi
02:46 - and then you want to do something like
02:48 - this set the x
02:53 - um let's just set it to like negative
02:56 - 9999 whatever something like that
02:59 - so now let's save this one and i'll run
03:01 - it again
03:03 - so you can see there's only one
03:04 - trampoline okay
03:06 - so that should be correct now okay
03:09 - so that's the one of the bug i think i
03:11 - forgot to add that code when i was uh
03:13 - doing it yesterday
03:15 - all right so let's move on so now that
03:17 - we have the first stage what i'm going
03:20 - to
03:20 - show is how can we make it to the second
03:22 - stage
03:24 - okay okay we'll come back to the main
03:27 - character here
03:28 - uh what we're going to do is we are
03:30 - going to start a new podcast
03:32 - actually uh to fix this so let's look
03:35 - for our code okay here it is
03:37 - so we want to put it over here actually
03:41 - okay so we want to get a new one say
03:44 - broadcast
03:47 - and we want to call it
03:51 - check
03:54 - player position
03:58 - so
04:00 - so while i type this a capital you know
04:02 - like each letter does
04:04 - that's a capital word so separated so
04:07 - easy to see this is called a camel case
04:09 - uh when you type in chemical case and
04:11 - programming variable it's easy for
04:14 - people to see
04:14 - okay all right so it says check
04:17 - player position that is my broadcast
04:20 - message
04:21 - so what i want to do is i am going to
04:24 - start this one
04:25 - here when i receive a
04:30 - check player position
04:33 - we want to go get the forever loop
04:38 - and we want to check the get the
04:41 - condition here if
04:44 - let's zoom in a little bit
04:48 - okay and then we are going to get the
04:51 - um here this one
04:56 - and we are going to get the x position
04:59 - of this
04:59 - uh player uh we're gonna put a
05:03 - 255 so somewhere here so if you move
05:06 - this
05:07 - guy here you can see right 209 so when
05:11 - you get to
05:12 - say 2 29 220 at five those up so when i
05:15 - get the shorter 25 we want to change the
05:18 - new stage so that's what we're doing
05:20 - so go back to your main character so
05:21 - when it goes past
05:23 - 225 what we want to do is uh
05:27 - change the level
05:30 - change the level by one okay
05:34 - and then we can say
05:40 - broadcast
05:44 - um start level okay
05:48 - and then also we want to add like um
05:51 - later we can add like when the player
05:53 - die
05:53 - or something we can add it to this check
05:56 - so for now we don't have it yet
05:58 - so we'll leave it blank for now later we
06:00 - can add that
06:02 - okay so now we move to the grounds right
06:05 - here
06:07 - because it's this and then we want to
06:10 - make it go to the
06:12 - zero zero uh let's see how many sprite i
06:15 - have for the ground
06:17 - so you don't want the ground to uh go
06:20 - back to the first stage
06:21 - what you can do is you want to say you
06:24 - know
06:24 - um you can get this forever
06:28 - so and then you can get this if so
06:31 - basically we want to go keep
06:34 - whenever you go on to the next stage
06:36 - just switch to the next stage
06:37 - and then when you get to the end of the
06:39 - stage it will just stop there won't come
06:40 - back around
06:41 - so what you have to do is you have to
06:43 - check the level
06:46 - so you say if
06:49 - [Music]
06:51 - uh level is less than
06:55 - you know we're doing one right so start
06:57 - with one right two three four
06:58 - five so we say less than
07:02 - five or less than six sorry
07:07 - so we want to switch to number five
07:09 - right so less than six
07:11 - and we say
07:15 - switch the costume to
07:19 - the level so level will be one so it
07:21 - will go to
07:23 - one two three four five
07:26 - okay so that's what we have
07:29 - now let's add the some background music
07:32 - or space sound we have um
07:36 - so what we can do is go start
07:39 - and the sound we can add the space cell
07:42 - so you say search sound so you say
07:45 - space noise space noise with space noise
07:51 - okay so we are going to select this
07:53 - space noise
07:55 - space noise here so you can play that
08:00 - so it's like uh in the space
08:04 - uh what you can do is maybe input like a
08:06 - sound
08:08 - volume at like 50 if you want so not so
08:12 - loud
08:14 - and then you can say forever
08:19 - sam please sound until done
08:23 - so let me try this out okay before we
08:27 - can move forward we have to make one
08:30 - more change to the main sprite
08:32 - uh so we say broadcast numerous new
08:35 - level right so
08:36 - what we need to do is
08:41 - we have to take this as well let's put
08:44 - it over here
08:47 - and we are going to call the
08:52 - custom block reset
08:56 - and then say new game start game
09:00 - so we can even put it up to this also
09:02 - that's fine but i
09:03 - want to do it two different places so
09:06 - that way you know won't block this
09:07 - because this ever wait here
09:09 - so we want to start doing this without
09:12 - waiting on this so that's why i create
09:13 - two
09:14 - different message
09:18 - so uh let me take the other one um
09:21 - actually i wanted to just say broadcast
09:24 - and not broadcast
09:25 - yeah broadcast the stock game we don't
09:28 - have to wait
09:28 - actually this is fine here okay so let's
09:32 - just check it out
09:33 - see if it works so we have this
09:36 - guy we'll jump up and we'll move on to
09:40 - the next stage you can see
09:42 - that's the next stage now i move so as
09:45 - you can see number three we don't have
09:46 - any jump pad he cannot get up
09:49 - so as you can see it seems to be working
09:51 - fine
09:52 - also the jump pad i forgot to mention i
09:55 - added a little weight here
09:56 - so that you know it looks a little bit
09:58 - better on the costume
10:00 - so uh before i didn't have a weight then
10:02 - you don't see a little bounce hill so
10:04 - this is actually better you see
10:06 - it bounce up pounds so it's a little bit
10:08 - better so put out zero
10:09 - zero zero point zero five here and the
10:11 - weight okay
10:15 - okay so um let's so let's say for
10:19 - platform i mean for level three we want
10:21 - to put another jump pad over there
10:24 - so what we can do is this is level three
10:26 - let's say we want to put a jump pad here
10:28 - and we don't know the x and y position
10:31 - right
10:32 - so what we can do is we can call
10:35 - this on here let me stop this here
10:40 - what we can call is um take this one
10:45 - when t press where is that
10:48 - okay when okay let's take this
10:52 - so we'll say when m
10:56 - m keys press i will make a new variable
11:02 - you can use g for global
11:05 - oh it doesn't matter mouse
11:09 - position we're not gonna really use this
11:13 - one
11:14 - uh just for the show
11:17 - for us to look at it um so we're gonna
11:20 - say
11:20 - set
11:24 - the mouse position we're gonna use the
11:28 - join
11:28 - operator here
11:32 - and then we're gonna put another joint
11:36 - and then we're gonna put a comma here
11:39 - put a space
11:41 - and we're gonna take the mouse x
11:45 - and mouse y here and then we will
11:49 - [Music]
11:51 - show the variable
11:55 - all right so now let's save it
11:59 - so let's push m with where our mouse is
12:02 - you can see it's around
12:04 - 114 and 97.
12:07 - so let's say we want to put another one
12:09 - here cody here
12:12 - and then we just duplicate this code
12:14 - here
12:15 - without this part of course put this
12:18 - under here
12:19 - put this like level three since we're at
12:22 - level three here and we are going to put
12:25 - let's say
12:26 - negative r114
12:29 - negative 97 just check it out see how
12:31 - that
12:32 - feels okay so let's run this again
12:36 - let's run it again let's see
12:40 - so second stage
12:43 - third stage yep uh so third stage
12:47 - yeah so if you want a little bit further
12:50 - here then you can say maybe negative 110
12:55 - okay and let's say you want to you know
12:58 - uh
12:59 - the one you don't want you want to play
13:01 - you can test the code right here right
13:04 - level three all the time and you don't
13:05 - want to start from like you know one and
13:07 - go to three
13:08 - then what you can do is just set your
13:11 - character right how you want to start
13:13 - the level
13:14 - right here just set it to three or
13:16 - something like that
13:18 - so when you run it will be on level
13:20 - three already okay
13:21 - so that way you can like kind of test
13:23 - your stuff
13:24 - and if you're done with the mouse you
13:25 - can just take that out
13:28 - so level three good see level four we
13:32 - have
13:32 - laser stuff we can walk on and you see
13:34 - when we die
13:35 - it doesn't die yet so you see that's not
13:38 - dying right now
13:38 - so we have to fix that so let me start
13:41 - on level four
13:42 - let's change it to number four we'll
13:44 - work on the
13:45 - that player falling off the stage and it
13:48 - will die
13:49 - so let's do that
13:52 - okay so we'll go back to the code that
13:55 - we just recently made for the checking
13:57 - player position
13:59 - we can put it on this one let's move
14:01 - this over here actually
14:04 - [Music]
14:07 - so okay so let's put it
14:10 - further away
14:14 - okay so here what we can do is this
14:18 - um we're gonna put another if statement
14:20 - on top
14:23 - okay put another statement on top
14:28 - see this is a little bit weird so i did
14:30 - like that
14:32 - okay and then we can check
14:35 - the y position so uh when it falls down
14:39 - it will be like maybe
14:40 - i don't know 120 or 150 or something
14:43 - like that see 150
14:45 - so like when it hit 150 we want to we
14:47 - wanted
14:48 - we don't want the cam we want the
14:50 - character to die
14:52 - so we say um if it's less than
14:56 - 150 so i'm getting like
15:01 - negative 160 117 or whatever right
15:05 - so you're gonna take the y position
15:09 - of the main character okay
15:12 - and you want to broadcast the event
15:18 - okay die
15:23 - so here what we can do is we are going
15:26 - to
15:27 - um say when i receive
15:30 - player die so what we want to do is
15:34 - we're going to set this
15:35 - variable
15:39 - uh global variable player display that
15:44 - set it to true okay so this will
15:47 - actually
15:48 - come over here we had earlier right with
15:50 - the true
15:52 - so it will repeat until it's true then
15:54 - it will stop
15:55 - okay so let's try it out okay
15:59 - all right let's see what happens so
16:02 - let's see
16:03 - i'm on number four i fall down not
16:06 - walking in
16:07 - so there's some cold error let's fix
16:09 - that
16:13 - okay so the uh when the dye didn't work
16:15 - yet right so
16:16 - let me fix that um
16:20 - let's stop this here
16:23 - okay so that did not work yet right so
16:25 - we need we're
16:26 - still missing some code uh so when we
16:29 - have player that
16:30 - broadcast this to true then this will
16:33 - stop right wait until this is true
16:36 - so that is all fine so one thing we need
16:39 - to do is
16:39 - we need to add another condition here
16:43 - um go get this um
16:47 - oops then go get this if condition here
16:51 - and then we're gonna go operator and we
16:54 - are
16:55 - going to check sorry keep dragging it
16:58 - wrong
16:59 - uh my mistake okay so i'm gonna get this
17:03 - one
17:03 - and then we're gonna check for the true
17:06 - okay and now what we want to do one wait
17:09 - a little bit
17:10 - uh before we send the player back to the
17:13 - uh
17:13 - original position so 0.1 so kind of you
17:17 - can see that it died here
17:19 - just showing to the player now what we
17:21 - can do is take this
17:24 - and then put it inside here okay
17:27 - all right let's try and run it again now
17:30 - so when
17:31 - level four you jumped
17:34 - and we died you see that it kind of
17:36 - stayed there a little bit
17:37 - zero point one second and then come back
17:39 - over here okay
17:41 - all right so so level five i guess
17:46 - i think this is the last one so i can't
17:48 - jump on it
17:49 - so that's level five so um let's say i
17:52 - remove this box right let's see if it
17:54 - actually
17:55 - uh able to to get to level six
17:58 - okay so let's say by delete this costume
18:02 - right you shouldn't be able to because
18:04 - we have the if condition there
18:06 - so let's take this out right so let's
18:09 - run it again i'm on level four
18:12 - jump across when level five
18:17 - you see uh it kind of it doesn't go
18:20 - anywhere so when you go to the next
18:21 - stage
18:22 - you come back to this last stage or what
18:25 - you can do is you put a block here don't
18:27 - go forward here or whatever that's right
18:30 - so that would be your end game or you
18:32 - can have another condition saying hey
18:35 - if it's level five six or seven or
18:38 - whatever
18:39 - that matter so this should not increase
18:42 - anymore actually so we can try to
18:44 - change that as well so to fix that
18:47 - just similarly like what we have here
18:49 - right less than level six so we actually
18:51 - need this
18:51 - kind of condition here so similar
18:55 - condition we need to have that on the
18:56 - main
18:57 - character okay so what you can do is uh
19:00 - change this one where we're increasing
19:02 - the position
19:04 - we're gonna say get another n operator
19:07 - here
19:09 - and you will say like um the uh
19:12 - very uh the level
19:16 - uh variable level
19:20 - is less than six so since we only have
19:23 - five costume
19:24 - right on the on the ground so we'll say
19:27 - less than six
19:28 - so make sure that if you actually uh
19:31 - create
19:31 - increase the level later on you have to
19:33 - make sure you change this
19:35 - and you have to change this as well so
19:37 - let's just test it out
19:39 - let's start from level one and see how
19:41 - it looks
19:43 - okay let's put back on level one
19:48 - okay let's run this again
19:49 - [Music]
19:51 - okay run okay so we have to jump
19:56 - this is level one it's level two
20:00 - so all working fine three
20:04 - four okay and then
20:10 - five so six so
20:13 - so you can't go anymore so so that's it
20:16 - okay
20:18 - there you go so the level is not
20:19 - changing anymore
20:21 - okay so only you can go up to five
20:25 - that's it and then um
20:29 - um what you can say
20:32 - is uh if you want the variable to be
20:36 - actually more precise actually you need
20:38 - to change this to
20:38 - five so we don't want to increase
20:41 - if it's uh or uh at level five so only
20:44 - if level four you can increase
20:46 - since you're five level so that was uh
20:49 - my mistake on that
20:50 - so you you don't want to have to
20:52 - increase the level right so you put it
20:54 - less than five
20:55 - but this one you have to say less than
20:57 - six okay or you know
20:59 - for easy say just put up one large block
21:02 - over here not
21:03 - allowing them to go past it so you know
21:06 - your condition will be easier so anyway
21:08 - so
21:09 - so five level you have to say less than
21:11 - five and then um
21:13 - here you're the same less than six okay
21:14 - i hope you guys understand that
21:16 - so this is actually increasing the level
21:18 - this is actually setting the level
21:20 - costume so you did six here okay all
21:23 - right so maybe we can add the uh
21:25 - depth uh when the player falls down to
21:27 - the uh to the little
21:29 - uh place where we want to have the depth
21:32 - count
21:33 - so we can add that you can do it in here
21:35 - either way
21:37 - so here when the uh
21:40 - event right when we say receive death
21:44 - die what we can do is we can add a
21:48 - sound maybe
21:51 - the alien sound
21:54 - [Music]
21:56 - quick sound so
22:00 - let's see let me turn on the sound a
22:02 - little bit more you can hear
22:05 - so this one so
22:08 - something like that so we'll put that
22:10 - and then we we put all the sound on the
22:12 - main character so that's why i move the
22:14 - code here
22:15 - so and then you say play sound
22:19 - until done oh and you can
22:23 - increase the depth
22:27 - change the depth by one you can put that
22:29 - before that
22:30 - okay all right so let's run it again
22:36 - so players able to jump across
22:40 - yeah the footstep the jump sound
22:45 - and then let's see if i die
22:47 - [Music]
22:49 - oh one how come this is two
22:52 - okay so because that this is falling off
22:56 - too much okay let's change this around
22:58 - let's see how this
22:59 - will work i think this will work better
23:00 - let's see
23:03 - because the uh the loop is too quick
23:05 - over there
23:07 - the broadcast so let's try this i think
23:09 - this will work better
23:10 - so let's see so one deficit
23:13 - so this is working fine so because uh
23:17 - the
23:18 - we had it the other way the multiple
23:20 - broadcast
23:21 - is now waiting for this so that's why it
23:23 - was going up more than it needed to be
23:25 - so switching this around will have a
23:27 - little weight right because it's play
23:29 - until done
23:30 - so that you will not have this multiple
23:32 - cap count
23:34 - on the depth okay so i guess i hope you
