00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here today we'll be making a
00:10 - fruit ninja game in scratch so
00:12 - um fruit ninja is probably one of the
00:14 - oldest mobile games there is on the app
00:16 - store um i still remember playing this
00:18 - game as a child so we have recreated it
00:21 - in scratch for you guys to play
00:23 - um
00:25 - so basically it's pretty much like the
00:26 - original one
00:28 - um
00:29 - there's the begin button so you can
00:30 - slice as you can see you slice the begin
00:32 - button you go into the game so you slice
00:35 - the fruits
00:37 - and when you hit a bomb then you lose
00:39 - and
00:40 - um
00:41 - also
00:43 - if you uh let the fruits go then you'll
00:46 - lose lives as you can see you're gonna
00:48 - lose lives and when you lose all three
00:50 - of your lives you will also
00:52 - lose so
00:53 - there's two ways to lose hitting a bomb
00:56 - and also letting three fruits fall
00:59 - so yeah that's pretty much the game we
01:01 - have
01:02 - and then so now let's go start a new
01:04 - project
01:06 - okay so in our new project we're
01:07 - deleting our scratch cat obviously
01:09 - and i have some sprites so we have the
01:11 - lives so these are the x's and we have
01:13 - the fruits
01:16 - and then we have the costumes for the
01:17 - backdrop
01:19 - so we have the
01:21 - this
01:22 - backdrop like the loading the main menu
01:25 - and we have the game screen which is
01:26 - like the cutting board
01:30 - and we just got these images from online
01:32 - on google you can just download your own
01:34 - on google or you can just export it
01:36 - straight from my project i have it
01:37 - shared
01:38 - or you can uh use our google drive
01:41 - but if you don't know how to use your
01:43 - google drive just go to our project
01:45 - and one last reminder for google drive
01:47 - uh don't use your school account and
01:49 - you'll never need to request access for
01:51 - a google drive you'll always be able to
01:53 - use it for sprites okay
01:56 - and then
01:57 - that's it for the sprites
02:00 - and
02:01 - let's go start in the backdrop so in the
02:02 - backdrop we have a few lines of code so
02:04 - let's go to the code so one green flag
02:06 - clicked we are going to
02:08 - once again so we're going to make a new
02:10 - variable we're going to name it score so
02:12 - we'll need to score also um i don't know
02:15 - why the pen is already here
02:17 - um but to get the pen extension you have
02:20 - to click that button down there and
02:22 - click the pen
02:23 - um
02:25 - because i started the game with that so
02:26 - that's why the pen is there
02:28 - um so just remember to click the
02:30 - extensions to get the pen
02:32 - okay and so we're gonna set the score
02:35 - to zero in the beginning and then we're
02:37 - gonna switch the backdrop
02:39 - to the start screen which is our first
02:41 - one this one so we're gonna name it
02:43 - start screen
02:44 - and then we're gonna
02:46 - broadcast the message and we're gonna
02:48 - name it start screen so this is the
02:50 - beginning
02:51 - starting of the game
02:53 - and then uh we're going to go to our
02:56 - so now we are going to get our begin
02:57 - button so we're going to just get the
02:59 - button one
03:00 - use this
03:02 - and then send the costume we're going to
03:03 - use
03:04 - this text i guess whatever and then
03:06 - we're going to write begin
03:08 - so then you can just use the select tool
03:11 - put it right here shrink it a little bit
03:13 - maybe that's the perfect size
03:15 - and then we just copy paste it
03:17 - up there and then
03:18 - we can just
03:20 - oops
03:21 - we can just take this and then we can
03:23 - just use the rotate you hold down the
03:25 - shift so you can get a perfect rotation
03:27 - and put it like that
03:31 - so that you've got yourself a basic
03:32 - begin button
03:34 - and we're going to group it so then
03:36 - it'll all be together the center
03:39 - okay
03:40 - so we have our begin button let's go
03:42 - code in it so inside the code it's just
03:44 - gonna be pretty simple
03:47 - so when green if i click we're going to
03:48 - go to this x and y position i'm going to
03:50 - pick 0
03:51 - uh negative 120 that's what i had before
03:54 - and then we're going to
03:56 - go to the events when i receive start
03:57 - screen
03:58 - we're going to click the show so in the
04:00 - beginning it's going to show up and then
04:02 - forever
04:04 - it's going to go turn 2 degrees
04:06 - so we're going to make it just basically
04:08 - keep on turning
04:10 - in the beginning so we're going to turn
04:11 - 2 degrees and then if
04:14 - and then uh we're going to get a new
04:17 - sprite so basically
04:18 - um we want it so if you cut like slices
04:22 - it will begin the game so we're going to
04:24 - get a we're just going to like draw a
04:26 - box this is just so we can select the
04:28 - tool use the select tool to select the
04:29 - color
04:30 - so this will be the like the trail of
04:32 - the slice
04:33 - so i guess we can get like some light
04:34 - blue color doesn't really matter or
04:37 - maybe like that
04:39 - like that color that color looks fine
04:42 - um and then we're going to just no
04:44 - outline just draw
04:47 - a regular square hold down shift if you
04:49 - would like
04:51 - center it
04:53 - and there you go you've got the square
04:55 - so we're just going to rename this to
04:57 - the slice
04:58 - and so next we're going to go back to
05:00 - the button and then inside the button
05:02 - we're going to let's hide this right now
05:04 - i actually know we have to show it to
05:05 - select it so um we're going to
05:09 - if touching so we're just gonna use this
05:11 - thing
05:12 - get the color so if it's touching that
05:14 - color then we're going to hide the
05:15 - button because
05:17 - you're basically slicing it and then
05:19 - we're gonna broadcast a message called
05:20 - start game which starts the game so
05:22 - we're going to make a new variable
05:24 - and name it start game
05:27 - start the game
05:28 - and then we're going to stop the script
05:30 - once um you've entered the game so stop
05:32 - the script
05:34 - okay so now we have the begin button
05:37 - let's
05:38 - hide this
05:41 - and obviously we have to
05:44 - click this a green flag and then
05:47 - and right now it will not work obviously
05:49 - because we have to
05:51 - make the trail for the mouse as you can
05:53 - see there is no trail
05:55 - so we have to make the trail so
05:57 - inside the slice let's hop into the
06:00 - slice
06:01 - sprites
06:02 - and then we're going to start coding in
06:03 - here so
06:05 - we're going to have to make two lists
06:07 - just for the sprites one for the slice x
06:09 - and one for the slice y so slice x for
06:12 - the sprite only
06:14 - and slice y
06:16 - for the sprite only as well so basically
06:18 - this will keep track of where the x and
06:20 - y position of the mouse is so it can
06:22 - create a trail
06:23 - so we have the two lists let's get a one
06:25 - green flag clicked so
06:27 - when preflight clicks we are going to
06:28 - delete all of both
06:31 - delete both all of both slice x and
06:34 - slice y
06:35 - and then forever
06:37 - we're going to get a forever loop
06:39 - so if we're going to get an if so if
06:41 - mouse down
06:44 - if you're clicking down mouse down then
06:45 - we're going to add
06:46 - um
06:48 - we're going to add a mouse x
06:51 - to the list
06:53 - so it's going to add mouse x to the
06:55 - slice x list
06:57 - and then we're going to add another one
06:59 - add instead of slice x we're doing slice
07:01 - y
07:03 - so we're going to instead when this is
07:06 - that then we're going to get a mouse y
07:08 - so add mouse y to the list so now
07:11 - when you like mouse down it will add
07:13 - something to the list as you can see it
07:15 - will add as much to the list
07:18 - so yeah
07:19 - basically when you're slicing it will
07:20 - keep track of where
07:23 - your mouse is so it will create another
07:24 - trail
07:26 - okay and then if we're getting another
07:28 - if
07:30 - if
07:31 - um length of slice x is greater than
07:33 - four or not mouse down so we're going to
07:36 - get this or and then so if it's greater
07:38 - than four so we're only going to limit
07:40 - to so it's only going to be
07:42 - four x and y values at a time so we're
07:46 - going to use the
07:48 - greater than
07:49 - so if the length
07:52 - of the
07:54 - length of
07:56 - slice x is greater than four
07:59 - uh
08:00 - or not mouse down
08:03 - then we're gonna delete so basically if
08:04 - you're not mouse down it will also
08:06 - delete so
08:08 - mouse down then we're also going to
08:10 - delete one of both so
08:13 - delete
08:15 - one of slice x and one of slice y
08:17 - so we don't need to make another whole
08:19 - script for this for slice y because
08:21 - we're already doing this
08:22 - so we just delete one from both
08:24 - so as you can see it's empty you click
08:27 - it'll only limit you to four
08:30 - but
08:30 - as you can see when you click randomly
08:32 - the x and y values change
08:34 - and if you let go it will delete so
08:36 - that's what we want we only wanted to
08:38 - limit to four
08:40 - and then
08:41 - we're going to get another one green
08:42 - flag clicked and then we're going to get
08:44 - a hide
08:46 - so
08:46 - when it's in the beginning we're going
08:48 - to hide and then inside the pen
08:50 - remember at the extension we're going to
08:52 - erase all in the beginning and then
08:54 - we're gonna set the pen color
08:56 - to the slice so we're gonna show the
08:58 - slice
08:59 - and select the color
09:01 - and then we're going to set the pen size
09:03 - to six so the slice will be
09:06 - six thickness and i'm gonna make a new
09:10 - my block so we're gonna make it my block
09:12 - we're gonna name it draw slice
09:16 - okay and click okay
09:18 - draw slice
09:19 - and then basically we're to define it so
09:22 - basically it's going to basically like
09:23 - when you like drag it will draw the
09:25 - slice
09:26 - so we're going to just erase all in the
09:28 - beginning
09:30 - if
09:32 - so if
09:33 - the length of slice x is greater than
09:35 - zero so that means there are something
09:37 - inside the list of slice x
09:40 - so we're gonna get a greater than zero
09:42 - if the length of slice x
09:47 - and the slice x is greater than zero
09:50 - then we're going to pen up
09:53 - and then we're going to set the x and y
09:55 - values
09:56 - to the slice x and slice y the item one
09:59 - the first item so wherever they first
10:01 - start dragging it's going to set it to
10:04 - the x and y value so we're going to go
10:06 - to
10:08 - so we're going to go to
10:10 - um
10:12 - item
10:14 - we're going to get the item
10:16 - item 1 of slice x and we're gonna get
10:18 - item one of slice y
10:20 - so we're gonna use the first two and
10:21 - then we're gonna pen down so we're gonna
10:23 - start drawing after that
10:26 - and then we're gonna set the index to
10:27 - two so we're gonna make a new variable
10:29 - we're gonna name it index
10:30 - so basically the index is it'll keep on
10:33 - going up the list
10:34 - through the list um
10:36 - and it'll keep on
10:38 - adding the x and y values so
10:40 - basically f this is index one so we're
10:43 - going to set the index to two because
10:44 - this is the first one
10:46 - setting next to two
10:48 - and then we're going to repeat until the
10:50 - index is greater than slice x
10:54 - and repeat until the index is greater
10:56 - than slice x
10:59 - index is greater than slice x
11:03 - bigger than
11:05 - where it's not
11:09 - length of slice x sorry um
11:10 - that took a while
11:12 - all right so index has to be greater
11:14 - than length of slicex and then we're
11:15 - going to go to
11:19 - we're going to go to the item
11:21 - index of slice x and we're going to go
11:23 - to the item index of slice y so we're
11:26 - going to go to wherever the index is
11:29 - during in the slice x so
11:31 - basically it's going to repeat until the
11:33 - index goes over four and then because we
11:36 - limit it to four
11:38 - so we're gonna go to the item
11:42 - of slice x and item of slice y and reset
11:45 - the index
11:48 - like that
11:50 - and then we're going to change the index
11:51 - by one so you will go through the list
11:54 - change index by one and then we're going
11:56 - to pin up
11:58 - i feel like we're going to pen up uh
11:59 - stop drawing
12:01 - i'm going to pin up and then right here
12:03 - we have to obviously
12:05 - um oops we have to
12:07 - like call this function
12:09 - for it to do something so we're going to
12:10 - use forever
12:13 - control slice
12:15 - all right so now we can play
12:17 - as you can see
12:18 - the y and x values have been changing
12:20 - and now you have like a trail
12:22 - so you can see and when you slice it
12:25 - the begin button hides see that
12:28 - and now you have a simple trail
12:31 - okay so we have our slice
12:36 - let's move on
12:37 - to our fruits
12:38 - so basically in our fruits in the
12:40 - costumes what we did
12:42 - was we
12:43 - got the fruits from the sprite library
12:45 - the bomb bushes from online just
12:46 - downloaded random bomb from online
12:48 - doesn't really matter so all these
12:49 - fruits are from the sprite library and
12:52 - this has to be in order so as you can
12:53 - see one two three four five and then we
12:55 - go back to the apple so you see that
12:58 - go back to the apple banana orange
13:00 - watermelon it has to be in the same
13:01 - order and i'll explain why after okay so
13:04 - just put them in order and basically for
13:06 - the apple what we do is we convert to
13:08 - bitmap and we use this tool
13:11 - like drag so okay let me just like
13:14 - duplicate this to show you so what we do
13:16 - convert to bitmap use this tool
13:19 - and we do that
13:21 - and then we just remove it and maybe
13:23 - like rotate it a little bit and boom now
13:25 - you've got yourself a sliced apple so i
13:27 - think you guys get the idea so basically
13:28 - that's what you do for each one of them
13:31 - um until you get to the last one don't
13:33 - worry about the bomb
13:35 - but just do all of that
13:37 - um
13:38 - it has to be in order just remember that
13:40 - okay
13:40 - and then so basically in the fruits
13:42 - we're going to
13:43 - start with the one group like clicks
13:46 - and green black we're going to hide
13:48 - and
13:49 - we're going to want to receive start
13:51 - game so when you like slice the begin
13:53 - button
13:54 - then you're going to get a forever loop
13:58 - forever
13:59 - wait one second and then we're going to
14:00 - set the number of roots quick random one
14:03 - to four so the maximum amount of fruits
14:05 - you can have
14:06 - on the board is four four or less so
14:09 - we're gonna get a new variable
14:11 - let's make a new variable
14:13 - um and we'll just name it number of
14:15 - fruits
14:18 - and it's for all sprites let's find
14:23 - number of fruits
14:25 - and num number fruit we're going to do
14:27 - pick random one to four
14:31 - and a four
14:32 - and then we're going to repeat the
14:34 - number of times the number of fruits so
14:36 - we're going to repeat
14:38 - the number of fruits
14:40 - and then we're going to set the x
14:43 - position to negative 200 to 200 so we're
14:46 - going to set it to pick a random
14:47 - somewhere on
14:49 - here from like here to here
14:51 - so we're going to
14:52 - set
14:53 - uh
14:54 - the x
14:58 - to pick random negative 200 to 200
15:05 - and then we're going to
15:07 - set the y to negative 170 so it starts
15:09 - down here so the fruits will start all
15:11 - the way in the bottom
15:14 - and then it will try to like it will
15:16 - come up and then stop at one point and
15:18 - go back down like an upside down
15:19 - parabola so it will go like boom and
15:21 - then it'll go back down so
15:23 - it'll be like that and we're gonna make
15:25 - it some new variables we're gonna name
15:27 - them
15:28 - x velocity so
15:30 - you need to make this with the sprite
15:31 - only so
15:33 - for the sprite line
15:35 - make another one y velocity y
15:38 - velocity for the sprite only as well
15:41 - so we're going to set the x velocity so
15:44 - basically
15:45 - we're going to set
15:47 - x velocity
15:50 - all right so we're going to get a
15:52 - negative one multiplied
15:54 - so the negative one is to make it so
15:57 - let's say the fruits on this side it
15:58 - comes up it's going to end up on the
16:00 - other side to make like a little arch
16:02 - parabola so that's what we want we want
16:05 - it to be like that
16:06 - so we're just going to put the negative
16:08 - 1 in there and then we're going to
16:09 - multiply it so we're going to addition
16:11 - sign
16:12 - multiply addition and then we're getting
16:14 - the x position divided by 50. so what
16:16 - this does is give it a little more
16:17 - variability so let's say you get
16:20 - uh
16:21 - so we could just set so 200 divided by 5
16:24 - is 4 50 is 4 sorry so we could set this
16:27 - to negative 4 to 4 but we want to make
16:29 - it vary a little bit more so we're going
16:31 - to do the exposition divide by 5.
16:34 - so
16:36 - x position divide by five so we could
16:38 - have some decimals like
16:39 - maybe like a
16:41 - 3.563 or whatever it could be something
16:43 - like that
16:44 - so we just want to make it vary a little
16:46 - bit so
16:47 - it'll be a little bit more randomized
16:48 - you know
16:49 - it'll make the your overall game look
16:51 - better so we're going to do the x
16:52 - position divide by
16:55 - this position divide by 50
16:58 - and we're going to add it to pick random
17:00 - negative two to two so we're going to
17:02 - add another negative 2
17:04 - to 2 piconet
17:08 - even give it more variable like vary so
17:11 - vary even more
17:12 - um
17:14 - and then next we're going to put this
17:17 - all into here
17:19 - so we get this one big chunk of code and
17:21 - then we're going to get this set the y
17:23 - velocity
17:26 - and then we're going to set it to pick
17:27 - random 22 to 25
17:30 - grand 22 to 25
17:34 - and then we're gonna make another
17:36 - variable we're gonna name it rotation
17:38 - speed so this is how the
17:40 - fruits are gonna rotate and it has to be
17:42 - for the sprite only as well
17:44 - so we're gonna make the fruits rotate as
17:46 - they come up so
17:47 - so we're gonna
17:48 - set rotation speed
17:52 - rotation speed and then we're going to
17:55 - pick random negative
17:58 - three uh to three
18:01 - so it's gonna
18:02 - rotate speed negative three to three
18:04 - we'll have to plug in somewhere later
18:07 - and then we're gonna set the uh random
18:10 - fruit uh we're gonna make another
18:12 - variable just name it random fruits
18:14 - number
18:20 - random fruit number
18:21 - um
18:22 - random fruit number uh will be for this
18:26 - for all sprites actually so
18:28 - you can just keep it for all sprites
18:31 - and then
18:32 - with the random fruit number we're going
18:34 - to set random fruit number
18:39 - and then we're going to make it pick
18:40 - random one to five
18:44 - and then we're gonna switch the costume
18:46 - to random fruit number so basically
18:47 - it'll just switch from one to five so
18:50 - it'll be random fruits every time so
18:53 - we're gonna switch the costume
18:55 - switch costume
18:56 - random fruit number
19:00 - and then we're going to create a clone
19:01 - of myself
19:04 - there we go
19:07 - and next we're going to when to start as
19:09 - a clone
19:10 - so we're going to set our size to 100
19:12 - because we have a bomb so basically if
19:14 - you cut a bomb will like make the bomb
19:16 - big to make it look explode in your face
19:18 - so that's why we're going to make it set
19:19 - to 100 in the beginning
19:21 - so and then we're going to make it show
19:22 - after that and then repeat until
19:28 - repeat until
19:29 - uh y position is less than negative 170.
19:32 - so you have to repeat until the fruit
19:33 - goes under here
19:35 - so repeat until
19:37 - it's less than
19:39 - so y position
19:43 - is less than negative 170
19:47 - and we're going to change the y velocity
19:49 - by negative one
19:51 - so it will go down
19:53 - our velocity by negative one
19:56 - and then after that we're going to
19:57 - change the y by y velocity and we're
19:59 - also going to change the x by x velocity
20:03 - change x
20:04 - so the change in x and change in y will
20:06 - be based on the y and x velocity so
20:09 - we're going to get the y velocity and
20:11 - the x velocity right there so now we
20:13 - have both of them and we're going to use
20:15 - the rotation speed now so we're going to
20:16 - make them turn
20:18 - the rotation speed
20:21 - rotation speed
20:23 - and then next we're going to make it so
20:25 - if it's touching the color of the slice
20:29 - so we're going to get if then statement
20:30 - so if
20:33 - if it's touching the color
20:37 - we're going to show this again once
20:39 - again we're going to show it
20:40 - and we're going to select the blue color
20:43 - so if it's touching that's then we're
20:45 - going to get an if
20:46 - else
20:48 - if
20:52 - if a
20:54 - constant number is equal to 5 which is
20:56 - the bomb
20:57 - so if the costume number
21:00 - is equal to the five which is the bomb
21:03 - then we're going to start sound we're
21:06 - gonna make us let's see alien creek yeah
21:08 - we have to start this sound just sounds
21:09 - like this
21:11 - so we're gonna put that in and then
21:13 - we're gonna repeat 10 times so that's
21:14 - where we make it change size and make it
21:16 - like explode in your face
21:18 - repeat 10 times and change the size
21:23 - by
21:24 - 30 so it'll sum
21:27 - sum up to 300 in size so we get that and
21:30 - then we're going to broadcast a message
21:32 - and we're going to name it end game so
21:34 - basically if you cut a bomb then you
21:36 - lose
21:38 - end game
21:40 - and then next if the cost number is less
21:43 - than five
21:44 - meaning you did not slice a bomb
21:47 - so we're gonna get else
21:50 - if
21:51 - inside the l so if
21:54 - positive number is less than five
21:58 - costume number less than five
22:01 - then we are going to start some pop
22:05 - with the pop sound
22:06 - i think everyone has the pops on yeah
22:08 - there it is pop
22:10 - we're gonna use the pop sound and then
22:11 - we're gonna change the score by one
22:14 - change score by one and we're going to
22:17 - switch the costume so yeah this is what
22:19 - why we need it in order so let's say
22:22 - the random fruit is banana so
22:24 - basically we're going to make it so we
22:26 - switch the costume to the costume number
22:28 - plus five so let's say the costume
22:30 - number is two we're gonna plus five one
22:32 - two three four five so we're gonna end
22:33 - up in bananas with the cut so it works
22:36 - for any of them let's say you pick
22:37 - watermelon one two three four five
22:40 - you also end up there so this is why you
22:42 - need an order
22:43 - so we're going to switch the costume
22:47 - switch costume to costume number plus
22:50 - five it'll make it much easier that's
22:52 - why
22:53 - so you make sure to do that
22:55 - that's fine
22:58 - and next
22:59 - we're going to get an if then statement
23:01 - so if the costume number
23:03 - under everything so if
23:05 - cost new number is less than five we can
23:08 - just copy that
23:09 - then we're going to
23:11 - broadcast missed fruit
23:19 - new message i'm gonna name it missed
23:21 - fruit
23:24 - and we're going to delete this clone at
23:26 - the end
23:27 - so basically
23:29 - cost a number less than five
23:32 - any of these
23:33 - and it's not cut
23:34 - at all then we're gonna broadcast missed
23:36 - fruit
23:37 - so i'm gonna zoom out and show you guys
23:39 - the whole code
23:41 - make sure you have all of this
23:46 - pause if you'd like to see all the code
23:48 - okay so we have all the fruits code now
23:52 - let's go on to our lives
23:54 - so our lives basically it's like fruit
23:55 - ninja you know how they have the x's so
23:58 - we have like three blue ones
24:00 - and then when you one fruit falls to the
24:02 - bottom we're gonna make one red
24:04 - two falls to the bottom we get two red
24:06 - and then if all of them fall then all of
24:08 - them some bread
24:10 - so we're going to wanna when i receive
24:14 - start game
24:16 - so let me you start game we're going to
24:18 - switch the costume
24:19 - to three lives which is the first one
24:22 - and we're going to show so in the
24:23 - beginning you'll have all your lives and
24:26 - in the beginning we're going to hide
24:29 - and when i receive start get start
24:31 - screen sorry uh start screen we are also
24:34 - going to hide so start screen
24:38 - we also want to hide it so
24:39 - there we have it
24:41 - and then when i receive mist fruit so if
24:43 - you miss a fruit
24:46 - then we will next costume so it will go
24:49 - to the next costume meaning that you
24:51 - lost life
24:52 - and if
24:54 - the costume number is equal to four
24:57 - meaning that you have no lives left then
24:59 - we're gonna end the game so
25:01 - if costume number is equal to four
25:05 - get the costume number
25:07 - equal to four then we're gonna broadcast
25:09 - endgame
25:12 - all right
25:13 - and then finally we have the white fade
25:16 - background so let's say you lose it'll
25:18 - just fade into white
25:20 - so
25:21 - first let's hide all of these variables
25:24 - and just hide everything for now except
25:26 - for the score and
25:29 - let me hide the
25:31 - list as well
25:33 - we can keep the score okay
25:36 - and you'll hide that
25:38 - okay now we have one more
25:40 - basically it's just a white square we're
25:42 - gonna make it real quick
25:43 - so basically when you lose it'll just
25:45 - show up make the game look much better
25:48 - so we're just gonna draw a white
25:50 - rectangle i guess
25:53 - that just
25:55 - like that white rectangle
25:56 - so when i receive
26:00 - when i receive start screen we're going
26:02 - to hide
26:03 - in the beginning
26:06 - and when i receive end game so when you
26:08 - lose
26:09 - at any point we're going to make it go
26:10 - to the origin which is zero zero
26:14 - and we're going to set the ghost effect
26:16 - to 100
26:17 - and
26:19 - accept the ghost effect
26:24 - my brightness goes to 100
26:28 - so ghost effect to 100 and we're going
26:30 - to make it go to the front layer
26:33 - and show so then we're going to show it
26:35 - and then we'll repeat 10 times and then
26:37 - we're gonna decrease the ghost effect
26:38 - until it becomes zero
26:40 - and then you can see it so
26:42 - we're gonna
26:43 - do that and then we're gonna change the
26:45 - ghost effect
26:47 - by negative ten
26:48 - ten times
26:50 - and then we're gonna wait one second
26:55 - and we're gonna start do start screen
26:57 - again so once you die it'll bring you
26:59 - back to the
27:01 - main screen
27:02 - okay
27:03 - okay so i forgot to add one last bit of
27:06 - code here so inside the fruit
27:08 - you have to want to receive end game
27:11 - we're going to stop other scripts in the
27:12 - sprite
27:16 - stop other scripts in the sprite
27:19 - and we're going to delete this clone
27:21 - this part is
27:23 - what when we uh it's basically when you
27:25 - switch when you get to the begin when
27:27 - you slice the begin button it'll switch
27:28 - to another screen the game screen which
27:30 - is this one
27:32 - uh so it's just a cutting board and the
27:33 - other one's like the loading screen i
27:35 - guess like the main menu so we're gonna
27:37 - add that real quick so let's go in here
27:39 - and then
27:40 - right here when we start game when i
27:43 - receive start games when the game is
27:44 - starting
27:45 - then we're going to switch the costume
27:48 - to the game screen
27:50 - so we're going to save the project and
27:52 - we'll go full screen
27:54 - so as you can see start on the fruit
27:56 - ninja main menu
27:59 - so slice the begin button as you can see
28:01 - the fruits pop up
28:03 - and if you have more if you lose all
28:05 - your lives and the game ends
28:08 - i'm also going to slice a bomb
28:11 - that happens then you also lose
28:15 - also we want to change something up here
28:17 - because as you can see when you um like
28:20 - when you lose
28:21 - just the fruits um it doesn't go back to
28:24 - the main menu it just stays on the game
28:26 - screen
28:27 - so what you can do is just switch to
28:29 - take this out and when you broadcast it
28:31 - you'll just do that so if you want to do
28:33 - that that's fine if you want to do
28:35 - either one and right here we're gonna
28:37 - have to do search into the start screen
28:40 - and we have to receive start screen as
28:43 - well
28:44 - and then basically and then we just
28:46 - duplicate this again
28:47 - we also have to keep the old script so
28:49 - we get to start game
28:50 - and the game screen so we also have to
28:52 - keep that
28:53 - so
28:55 - basically this is just so if you want to
28:57 - keep making go back to the main menu
28:58 - after you lose
29:00 - you can it's fine as either way it's
29:02 - still fine
29:04 - so as you can see when you lose you go
29:06 - to the main menu with the fruit ninja
29:08 - and all that
29:10 - so we're missing one last thing which is
29:12 - the high score so we can add high score
29:14 - into this game um it's fairly simple so
29:17 - we're going to make a new variable and
29:19 - we're just going to make it for all
29:20 - sprites cloud variable and we're going
29:22 - to name it my score
29:24 - high score
29:26 - and then with the high score we're going
29:27 - to get an if then statement
29:30 - under here
29:31 - we're going to get if
29:33 - high score is less than
29:37 - uh score so if the high score is less
29:39 - than the score
29:40 - or the score is greater than the high
29:41 - score then we're going to set the high
29:43 - score to the score
29:46 - so we're going to do the high score look
29:47 - right here
29:48 - okay
29:49 - save and let's go
29:55 - so i just say the bomb let's just try
29:58 - again i just want to get some score
30:00 - as you can see
30:05 - when you lose it'll set this your
30:07 - highest score to the
30:09 - uh high score as you can see yeah okay
30:11 - so that's pretty much it thank you guys
30:13 - for watching don't forget to like share
30:15 - and subscribe and ring the notification
30:18 - bell and i'll see you guys in the next
