00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back to kids cooking playground
00:09 - today we'll be making a tutorial on how
00:11 - to make the rain effect in scratch
00:13 - so let's show you guys how it works
00:16 - so you can see that the rain is just
00:19 - coming down and then it just splashes
00:21 - onto the ground and disappears so we're
00:23 - gonna make something like this today in
00:25 - scratch so let's start a new project
00:28 - new projects and let's paint a Sprite
00:34 - so what we want to do is keep a one
00:37 - outline White
00:40 - box
00:42 - so it's easier to see so what we're
00:43 - going to do is get the box one outline
00:46 - I'm gonna draw the box like this
00:49 - and then what we want to do
00:52 - what we want to do is draw a one outline
00:56 - for the ring
00:58 - about this long
01:01 - that'll work
01:02 - all right and then after that we can
01:05 - delete the box I mean duplicate this we
01:07 - want to duplicate this and then we can
01:09 - delete the Box
01:12 - all right so once you've duplicated it
01:14 - you want to get the line again
01:16 - don't connect it but draw a little bit
01:19 - above because if you connect it will be
01:21 - in the same line and you don't want that
01:22 - so we're going to draw a little bit
01:24 - above
01:25 - and what we can do is we can trash
01:28 - the line and then we duplicate the
01:32 - costume and then delete the Box
01:35 - and then the next costume we just repeat
01:38 - this process uh we go a little bit above
01:41 - above this circle Dot and then we go
01:45 - draw a line
01:47 - we can delete the line above it
01:50 - duplicate the costume
01:52 - and we can delete the Box
01:55 - oops wrong wrong password delete it from
01:58 - this one
01:59 - and this one what we're going to do is
02:01 - select the line
02:03 - and again we just repeat this like
02:06 - six seven times
02:09 - until we get to the bottom
02:11 - [Music]
02:13 - so we delete this
02:14 - [Music]
02:17 - duplicate yeah so we just repeat this
02:20 - process
02:25 - [Music]
02:28 - so again
02:30 - draw a line delete this
02:32 - duplicate delete the Box
02:37 - [Music]
02:48 - foreign
02:58 - so once you've reached the bottom
03:01 - um to your desired location we can draw
03:04 - three
03:06 - uh three small marks to in to like show
03:10 - that the rain has touched the ground so
03:12 - that's what we're gonna do right here
03:13 - we're gonna draw one
03:14 - [Music]
03:16 - two
03:18 - [Music]
03:19 - three
03:21 - and then we're going to delete this
03:26 - duplicate it
03:28 - and then this time we're just going to
03:29 - do the same thing
03:31 - but we're just going to make the lines a
03:33 - little bit bigger
03:35 - to show the splashes got bigger
03:43 - [Music]
03:45 - actually we can
03:46 - delete that
03:52 - it is bigger
03:59 - okay so now we have all our costumes
04:03 - as you can see we have one two three all
04:07 - the way up to eight so these two are
04:09 - like to show that it's touched the
04:10 - ground and splashes
04:12 - and these are from falling up and down
04:15 - so next let's go into our code
04:21 - so our code we're gonna do
04:23 - it's in the Sprite we can rename it to
04:25 - rain
04:26 - we're gonna get l135 glitch the code is
04:29 - really simple
04:30 - and your thoughts clicked we are going
04:32 - to switch costume to costume one
04:35 - switch cost me plus one
04:38 - then we can set the Y to zero
04:44 - and then uh we're gonna get a forever
04:47 - Loop so forever
04:49 - and then we're gonna go to
04:52 - we're gonna set the x
04:54 - set X to pick random negative two forty
04:56 - two forty so it falls from a random
04:58 - position up there
04:59 - take random negative 240.
05:04 - 40 to 240.
05:06 - and then next we're going to repeat
05:07 - seven times
05:09 - because we have seven costumes for the
05:12 - rain
05:13 - we'll give eights but
05:15 - um seven of them are like falling
05:18 - so we got repeat seven
05:20 - it's gonna use next costume
05:24 - next costume and then after that we're
05:27 - gonna switch the costume back to the
05:28 - First costume so it's gonna loop back to
05:29 - the beginning
05:31 - special custom bags cost one right here
05:35 - and next all we need is a dark backdrop
05:38 - I think there's like a one that's like
05:40 - stars or something
05:43 - it's pretty dark as you can see you can
05:44 - see the rain so let's run the project
05:48 - as you can see
05:49 - the rain effect is working
05:51 - what we can do if you want to make it
05:53 - lower is you can change the set why
05:56 - so like negative 50.
05:59 - and this way if you're making like a
06:01 - platform or something and the platform's
06:02 - like down here you can just adjust this
06:04 - to however you want to make it look like
06:06 - it's hitting the platform and then it's
06:07 - splashing save the rain see now it's
06:10 - lower
06:12 - so yeah that's pretty much it for
06:14 - today's tutorial on the rain effect if
