00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - hello
00:09 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:11 - playground so
00:12 - today we'll be finishing up the center
00:16 - run platformer game
00:18 - finally it's been a long long one for
00:20 - this one
00:22 - so this is the last episode
00:25 - of this uh game uh in in this episode
00:28 - we'll do the high score
00:30 - just simple high score and maybe a
00:32 - thumbnail
00:33 - drop down in the snow that's about it
00:37 - so um next time maybe i have some time
00:41 - i'll do like a table you can actually
00:43 - see like
00:44 - what is the high score of the uh people
00:47 - who got the
00:48 - lowest time or whatever maybe later when
00:50 - i have some time
00:51 - pretty busy right now so let me finish
00:54 - this uh
00:55 - this last episode for the center
00:57 - platformer game
00:59 - okay so i think you guys have probably
01:01 - if you have already watched the
01:03 - video from the first one to the ninth
01:05 - episode
01:06 - so this is the 10 one so this will be
01:08 - the last
01:09 - so in here we'll quickly go through how
01:12 - we're gonna do the uh
01:13 - snow effect and then the thumbnail and
01:15 - then high score
01:18 - okay real quick we will paint a new
01:21 - sprite
01:23 - oh yeah also i changed the sound i think
01:25 - got one of the
01:27 - kids who's playing he didn't like this
01:28 - ouch sound i made
01:31 - so i actually download i'm going to
01:32 - delete it i download a new one
01:34 - actually so i'm going to delete it
01:38 - i'm going to upload this one here uh
01:41 - so i don't know if this maybe it sounds
01:43 - better i don't know
01:45 - like that like like a chrome sound
01:48 - like that so i'll change it out i think
01:51 - the kids like
01:52 - doesn't sound good so
01:56 - let me just switch it out just reset
02:00 - this
02:01 - making sure so let's just test it out
02:05 - so let's see yeah
02:09 - so okay maybe it sounds better than what
02:11 - i'm recording
02:12 - so anyway okay so let's work on the snow
02:15 - um so that with that out of the way
02:18 - let's paint so painting news right
02:21 - really simple
02:22 - uh which is one white color so
02:26 - and then we don't want any outline
02:29 - i just kind of zoom in a bit
02:33 - oops sorry select the circle
02:36 - you can hold it so that way you know it
02:40 - kind of paint a perfect
02:41 - uh sprite uh you want to maybe make it
02:45 - smaller a little bit
02:47 - i think originally i have like around 12
02:50 - or 11 or whatever
02:53 - so you can see while moving you see like
02:55 - 13 out of 13.
02:57 - so let's see so this is 11 now 11.
03:02 - i think it's 11 out of 11 that's still
03:03 - enough
03:05 - uh maybe you can rename it to snow
03:08 - doesn't matter okay so let's go
03:13 - uh click on the green flag
03:16 - okay when green black is clicked uh what
03:18 - we're going to do is we're going to set
03:20 - the ghost effect
03:22 - looking at light uh making it uh um
03:25 - appear
03:28 - okay so we're going to set it make it
03:30 - disappear for the ghost
03:32 - effect so if you click on this you'll
03:35 - see this white dot disappear
03:36 - when you set it goes effect to 100 see
03:39 - it kind of goes away
03:41 - so to reset that you can always use this
03:43 - clear graphics effect
03:44 - right so i'll come back
03:48 - okay but uh for now we just don't need
03:50 - that we're just gonna go with the codes
03:52 - effect
03:53 - uh then we are going to make it
03:57 - go to it doesn't really matter i think i
03:59 - have it like 220
04:02 - so we can go to the center on the top
04:06 - next we'll use the forever loop sorry
04:12 - okay we need to make a variable so make
04:15 - a variable
04:16 - uh for this sprite only called wind
04:20 - so this is the wind speed for the
04:22 - snowflake
04:24 - uh you can set
04:28 - set win
04:33 - okay and you can say pick random
04:37 - [Music]
04:38 - negative one to one
04:43 - then you seems called uh
04:45 - [Music]
04:47 - create a clone myself
04:51 - and do a weight sorry wait
04:56 - then use the operator again
05:00 - just pick a small number here
05:04 - 0.005 to
05:08 - 0.001 so fraction of a second
05:12 - okay next we will
05:15 - say um when i start as a clone with this
05:18 - column the clone right so
05:20 - you are going to have to say when i
05:23 - start as a clone
05:27 - okay it's in this control block
05:33 - okay so here we will set the size of the
05:37 - snowflake so whenever create one we can
05:40 - make a random size
05:44 - so you can say set size
05:48 - and you can pick a random
05:52 - i did like 60 and 100 i mean you can
05:56 - make it a little bit bigger a little bit
05:57 - smaller
05:58 - depend on you okay and then
06:01 - i will say go to
06:06 - all right so i can go to the top
06:11 - uh but uh i'm gonna pick a random here
06:15 - so uh negative 240
06:20 - to 240 so basically when they create a
06:23 - clone it will be like
06:24 - between 60 to 100 percent so either
06:27 - bigger or smaller somewhere on the top
06:29 - here
06:30 - for the win variable we can kind of hide
06:33 - that we don't really need to show that
06:36 - what we're going to do is we're going to
06:38 - repeat
06:38 - [Music]
06:40 - to a repeat loop
06:43 - four let's say
06:47 - change the ghost effect here
06:50 - by negative 20
06:54 - okay so a little bit brighter
06:58 - and then we are going to use this repeat
07:01 - do it two times so what happened is i'm
07:03 - gonna make it go
07:04 - down first a little bit before i start
07:07 - the loop actually make it touch and
07:08 - disappear
07:09 - because if i don't do that uh if i have
07:12 - something called touch edge it will just
07:14 - get stuck here and then
07:15 - disappear immediately so what we do is
07:18 - repeat two times i'll make it go down a
07:20 - little bit
07:21 - so to go make it go down say change y
07:24 - okay don't make
07:25 - don't use the set y okay make sure you
07:27 - change y
07:29 - change y by minus five
07:33 - and then we say change x
07:36 - by the wind speed okay this is the wind
07:40 - speed of the snow
07:42 - make sure it's for the sprite only
07:45 - and then here move over here uh what we
07:48 - do is we're going to use a repeat until
07:51 - loop
07:52 - so making sure when it touch the uh the
07:54 - santa claus
07:55 - or the the ground or the
07:58 - the enemy it should disappear so what we
08:01 - want is we're gonna touch the virtual
08:03 - ground not the ground okay because the
08:04 - ground with the tree in the back you
08:06 - don't want it to touch the tree and
08:07 - immediately disappear
08:09 - we want it to kind of go through all the
08:11 - way you know to the bottom
08:13 - sorry clicked on it all the way to the
08:15 - bottom of the ground
08:16 - then disappear um so
08:19 - what you can do is get this repeat two
08:24 - uh we're gonna use a couple all operator
08:27 - uh one it depends on which one you want
08:30 - so let's say we wanted this guy to
08:32 - you know touch this it should disappear
08:34 - this guy i don't really
08:36 - think you need this guy because this guy
08:37 - and this guy will probably the same
08:39 - right because this is on top of this so
08:42 - you might need like animated character
08:45 - virtual ground right background you
08:47 - don't need
08:48 - you need the spike you need this and you
08:50 - need
08:51 - maybe the snow or snow pod you don't
08:53 - need you like let that fall through
08:55 - and then the igloo right so whatever you
08:57 - want
08:59 - okay so what i'm going to do is
09:02 - um so i'm going to create more of this
09:06 - duplicate
09:11 - and then duplicate hopefully you have
09:12 - enough if not we can create one more
09:15 - okay so first we'll put
09:20 - the anime character
09:23 - okay next we'll put the
09:27 - virtual ground okay
09:30 - next we put the enemy
09:35 - okay which is the uh the tiger
09:38 - okay uh next we'll
09:42 - put the uh we can put the spike in the
09:45 - igloo
09:46 - and then we buy the edge so we're gonna
09:48 - do one more actually
09:51 - so next
09:54 - i'm gonna go with the spike
10:01 - and then we'll say igloo
10:06 - and then last one water edge
10:12 - okay all right so let's zoom back out
10:17 - so we have these main character virtual
10:20 - ground
10:21 - enemy spike igloo and edge
10:24 - okay so what i want to do is when they
10:27 - keep i will make them keep going down
10:29 - until it touch until you touch this so
10:32 - what you need to do is
10:34 - kind of same thing over here um
10:38 - going down until i touch it okay
10:42 - and then we're gonna grab another repeat
10:44 - loop here
10:47 - and we can say make it go lighter
10:51 - okay say change the ghost effect
10:58 - okay change the close effect by 10
11:05 - after that we say we can delete it
11:08 - okay so delete this clone
11:12 - okay let's test it out see how it looks
11:15 - save it
11:17 - so you can see the snow kind of fall
11:20 - when it touched the the ground it kind
11:22 - of disappeared
11:23 - or touch the santa claus you can see
11:26 - when it touched the
11:27 - santa claus it kind of faded and then
11:28 - goes away so that's how this is
11:31 - used this to look okay so you can see
11:35 - if you touch the spike it also goes away
11:39 - if you touch the tiger let's see so you
11:41 - can see the tiger
11:43 - so the snow will touch the tiger right
11:46 - and
11:46 - it goes away say same thing so whatever
11:49 - you want it to go away
11:51 - you have to make sure that you know you
11:52 - you have that so you see it touch the
11:54 - edge
11:55 - using that and touch the edge over here
11:56 - and it also went away
11:59 - okay so that's about for the snow
12:04 - okay all right um what we can do is we
12:08 - can do the thumbnail next
12:10 - okay so the thumbnail i already have
12:13 - something in my backpack
12:14 - but uh you know you guys can come do it
12:17 - yourself as well let me just
12:18 - say painting this right and then i'll
12:21 - drag this costume here okay so
12:25 - what i did was pretty simple right just
12:27 - take the background
12:28 - so uh let's say if you're gonna do the
12:30 - thumbnail all by yourself
12:32 - just say control a copy
12:36 - oop sorry why while i click that so i
12:38 - just go to here
12:39 - go to my costume right this is my own
12:42 - one so what you can do is just go to the
12:44 - new one you copy from that
12:46 - group it together so that this is your
12:50 - thumbnail right because i i put a couple
12:53 - of them of them together so that's why
12:54 - you have this line
12:55 - so what you can do is you can convert
12:57 - the bitmap and then convert back to
12:59 - vector
13:00 - so now it's one big file so you see one
13:03 - big file
13:04 - so now if you want to make a thumbnail
13:06 - right you can
13:07 - look at these right so you can just copy
13:09 - it from like the ground right
13:11 - whatever it is so let's say you take
13:14 - this whole thing
13:15 - ctrl a will select all control c
13:18 - copy and then you go to your thumbnail
13:21 - go back over here
13:22 - you can just put it here so something
13:24 - like this
13:26 - then you can stick your santa claus guy
13:28 - you know find the one that you like
13:30 - maybe the running one ctrl a because
13:32 - ctrl c
13:34 - go back over here kind of adjust him a
13:36 - little bit
13:38 - you know and then if you want the tiger
13:43 - ctrl a copy ctrl c
13:47 - control v so now the tigers here you
13:49 - want to make them bigger
13:50 - if you have them bigger you want to flip
13:52 - them around click on this flip
13:54 - horizontal
13:55 - then you know you can add some something
13:57 - else at the rock or whatever you like
13:59 - right just like how i did here
14:02 - so i added a rock uh added some gym
14:05 - added a rock i had a ice block
14:07 - out of the snowman and then out of the
14:09 - text
14:10 - so that's how you would do it for the uh
14:13 - you know a thumbnail
14:14 - so let's just trash this for now
14:18 - okay so what we're going to do is we
14:21 - want to make the thumbnail glide down i
14:22 - think we have shown that many times
14:24 - on our channel how to do that um
14:28 - so what you want to do is so since this
14:31 - uh
14:32 - this one use a timer itself so we cannot
14:34 - really use that
14:35 - timer uh like uh using when timer
14:38 - greater than the timer plus one so what
14:40 - we have to do we're gonna have to create
14:41 - a new variable
14:44 - for this okay so you can
14:47 - make it for another variable or you can
14:50 - say
14:50 - stop timer
14:54 - right you can create any way you want
14:57 - but i just use all cap
14:59 - so this is not really used for me just
15:01 - for the
15:02 - s making it you know uh for the
15:05 - for calculating the thumbnail to go down
15:08 - so what you can do is go
15:09 - r1 green flappers click okay
15:14 - so say look we'll hide it
15:19 - and uh you can go so what i'm going to
15:21 - do is going to set it to the top
15:23 - say 0 let's say 300
15:28 - and then i will say
15:31 - go to front
15:34 - layer okay
15:39 - then i will have um set
15:44 - the stop timer to 0.1
15:49 - and then grab a forever loop here
15:55 - and then we're going to duplicate this
15:57 - actually
16:00 - okay and then here we will
16:03 - use operator add
16:08 - we're gonna get the timer
16:12 - oops sorry my bad
16:15 - and then say plus zero that one
16:20 - okay
16:22 - okay so all right so after that
16:27 - you're gonna go create another block
16:29 - here
16:31 - there's a block say loudness right
16:33 - select timer here
16:34 - drag it over here and then drag this
16:38 - variable
16:39 - timer okay so when you stop the screen
16:42 - you want this thing to drop down
16:44 - okay so what we want to do is when this
16:47 - thing
16:47 - drop down you want to highlight level
16:50 - score
16:51 - live whatever right so you can do that
16:54 - so what you can do is say hi
16:59 - oh no i need to save it what happened
17:03 - oh something's from scratch oh good i'm
17:07 - able to save it
17:08 - so high the level
17:13 - so hi the life
17:18 - hide the score
17:23 - hide the time to have the time
17:27 - oh i didn't even have time okay so we
17:29 - want to see how fast you you go right so
17:31 - we're gonna start the time
17:34 - okay so what we can do is we can add or
17:37 - create another vehicle called time
17:41 - uh this is for orders right so we're
17:43 - gonna add the time somewhere on top here
17:45 - as well
17:47 - um so let's continue with this thumbnail
17:49 - we're gonna get the time later so let's
17:52 - do the time
17:55 - and then if you want the fastest time
17:58 - create another one
17:59 - let me get the cloud variable
18:02 - fastest time
18:06 - okay got it
18:10 - so crowley will only support letters and
18:12 - number
18:14 - i know that number but not better that's
18:16 - why sometimes you cannot create like a
18:17 - table easily
18:18 - with like like who's the first winner
18:20 - you know the name of the person
18:22 - so but i can show you next time how to
18:24 - do that actually there's a way to do
18:26 - that
18:27 - okay so let's say set
18:33 - so we'll hide this so i'm not set sorry
18:36 - let's
18:36 - hide it
18:42 - okay where's my cloud variable on top
18:44 - okay
18:46 - okay so we hide all this for a timer
18:49 - when uh you know when the game
18:51 - stops and then what we can do is
18:54 - make this go to the top
18:58 - 0 300
19:02 - and then we'll say show
19:06 - and then we'll use this glide
19:13 - 0.5 to 0
19:16 - 0 so i do 0 0 because my
19:20 - actually my costume actually cover the
19:22 - whole screen right
19:23 - so zero zero will be good enough for me
19:28 - okay so i also need that when i start
19:31 - the game i need to show it again right
19:32 - so when i start
19:34 - the game start
19:38 - game uh we want to show all these
19:41 - variables or i can
19:43 - just copy that so show
19:47 - our level
19:51 - life
19:55 - score
20:00 - time
20:03 - and fastest time okay all right so we
20:06 - have all of them
20:07 - let's just check it out so we probably
20:09 - have some more bulk i'll show you how to
20:11 - fix it so let's say
20:13 - we stop this you see how the santa claus
20:15 - is still in the front
20:16 - so we need to hide this guy right
20:21 - okay so what you do is you go to the
20:23 - center
20:27 - go here um
20:31 - drag this thing can zoom in a little bit
20:36 - okay and then select the variable
20:41 - and then you say hi
20:45 - okay okay so when you have high make
20:48 - sure you have show
20:49 - so yes i have show should be good so
20:52 - let's try it again
20:54 - i start the game so i was playing let's
20:56 - say i'm playing him
20:58 - and then i say stop so you see this
21:01 - drops in and hides it
21:02 - okay all right
21:08 - so actually when i converted this thing
21:10 - it did not cover
21:11 - everything you see there's some
21:13 - background there
21:15 - so probably not a good idea when i
21:17 - converted the bitmap earlier
21:20 - so what you can do is go back in here
21:22 - actually make this a little bit bigger
21:25 - okay drag this guy a little bit bigger
21:30 - out a little bit
21:36 - okay make sure you cover everything okay
21:40 - i think maybe i accidentally moved it so
21:42 - let's try it again
21:45 - stop so cover everything for the
21:48 - thumbnail
21:48 - okay start so you can start so you can
21:52 - see score here
21:55 - maybe you can put a time i don't know
21:57 - this
21:58 - seems like there's a lot of stuff on
21:59 - here
22:01 - maybe the fastest time you can pin the
22:03 - bottom here
22:05 - okay so what we want to do is
22:09 - you know we're going to have to start
22:10 - the timer right the timer has not
22:12 - started yet
22:12 - so let's do that so uh what you can do
22:16 - is you can do it on any of the sprite
22:19 - uh you can do it in the thumbnail or
22:20 - anything that matter background
22:23 - um in my old game i actually did it on
22:26 - another sprite
22:27 - um but we can probably do in the
22:30 - thumbnail of the background doesn't
22:32 - matter let's just do in the thumbnail
22:33 - here
22:35 - okay so uh get another green flap is
22:38 - clicked
22:41 - okay we're going to set this variable so
22:44 - make sure we reset the variable so set
22:47 - timer
22:47 - to zero time okay
22:52 - what i'm going to do is um gonna make
22:54 - this a little bit of weight
22:56 - before it's count the game because uh
22:58 - we're gonna set it up right so we'll
23:00 - go away for a half a second
23:04 - and we can use a forever loop
23:10 - and what we do is we're going to set
23:15 - time to this timer variable
23:20 - so this timer variable will keep on
23:22 - going we'll set the time
23:24 - and then what you need is you can use
23:27 - another operator
23:29 - if
23:32 - okay and then you can use operator say
23:34 - um
23:38 - equal so i what i did was i did it at
23:42 - the level three so basically when the
23:44 - user got to level three that was the end
23:46 - of my game
23:48 - and then i will check if the fastest
23:50 - time is uh you know um
23:52 - it's uh it's good it's greater you know
23:55 - the time
23:56 - actually is less than the fastest time
23:57 - then we'll set it so what we do is
24:00 - we are going to set the to the if's
24:03 - condition here
24:07 - okay but whether set the fastest time to
24:09 - something first
24:10 - in order for this work because we're
24:11 - doing fastest time not more score right
24:14 - so
24:14 - because we have the fastest time set at
24:16 - zero then 0 is always less than the time
24:19 - so it won't work right
24:20 - so what you can do is this
24:23 - you can say
24:26 - take this one less
24:30 - so take this variable
24:35 - time fastest time so if your time is
24:39 - less than the fastest time
24:42 - then we want to set the fastest time
24:46 - to that time okay and then we also want
24:50 - to
24:50 - stop the script so whenever you don't
24:52 - need the script to run
24:53 - anymore make sure you stop it that way
24:56 - it will help your game
24:57 - you know not too laggy okay
25:01 - all right so this is how to have so what
25:04 - i'm going to do is gonna
25:05 - set the fastest time to something so
25:08 - that way
25:09 - you know something high in the beginning
25:13 - maybe let's set it to you know um
25:18 - 50 right but for me actually for this
25:21 - game i only had
25:22 - two level but on my original m3 level
25:26 - so i'll set it to like let's say 60
25:28 - seconds
25:29 - i should be able to complete within 60.
25:32 - right
25:32 - so let's say i'll say save right
25:36 - so now if i say run so you see fastest
25:40 - 160
25:41 - so you see my timing running so i just
25:43 - have to complete the first stage
25:47 - oh okay before 60 seconds i guess
25:53 - oh man
25:57 - okay got it
26:02 - oh almost died there
26:11 - okay so i got it so you see the timer
26:15 - stop because this is level two right we
26:17 - say if it's equal to level two
26:19 - and the time is less than that we'll set
26:22 - the fastest time to that so now the
26:23 - fastest time is
26:25 - 33 seconds 0.101.101
26:30 - see so that's the fastest time so
26:34 - so for me actually if my okay i'm
26:36 - actually level three
26:38 - so level two you can play and then level
26:40 - three just one small stage
26:41 - and that's it okay so we can throw this
26:45 - away this code
26:46 - so now the game works perfectly
26:50 - uh should be so you run you see all the
26:52 - snow is fall falling down correctly
26:55 - right so there you go so this is the end
26:58 - of the uh
27:00 - the tutorial uh for this game
27:03 - i really hope you guys uh like it and
27:05 - enjoy the video and actually learn
27:07 - something from this video
27:09 - so if you don't like the center guy
27:11 - right you can always replace it with
27:12 - someone
27:13 - something you like like mega man on
27:16 - mario or whatever
27:18 - so you can make your own sprite as well
27:20 - right doesn't matter
27:21 - so i just teach you guys the concept
27:24 - here how to do the
27:25 - scrolling uh for this game so that's
27:28 - about it so um
27:30 - please give us a thumbs up on the video
27:32 - that will really help us
27:34 - and uh yeah if you have any questions
27:35 - just look at the uh
27:37 - the game uh uh the video description i
27:40 - have the link to the
27:41 - actual game and you can check out the
27:43 - code there
27:45 - okay all right so uh let's rename this
27:48 - project i think we cannot
27:51 - send a run
27:54 - teaching okay all right so this was my
27:57 - teaching project so i had to make it
27:58 - again after i made a real one
28:00 - all right guys see you guys next time
28:04 - have a have a good day bye
