00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys and welcome back to
00:09 - another video and today we're doing
00:11 - another video it's called tower Smasher
00:14 - today we will be making this game the
00:17 - objective of this game is to launch the
00:19 - ball to hit the blocks that are stacked
00:20 - together the less launches you use the
00:23 - more points you will get tower Smasher
00:30 - you can find this game idea and the
00:32 - books called code your own games 20
00:36 - games to create with scratch it's a very
00:40 - cool book that you can use so you can
00:44 - absolutely check out the book so we will
00:51 - be learning these following concepts in
00:53 - scratch there is variables loops
00:55 - touching color pen and broadcasting
00:58 - messages so before I start please like
01:04 - share and subscribe to our channel to
01:09 - support us if you did thank you for your
01:13 - support so I mean and you can also share
01:18 - it with your friends that'd be awesome
01:19 - so I'll just demo the game right now
01:24 - let's put a full screen as you can see
01:27 - when I started has some music and then
01:31 - you have a ball and an arrow and like
01:35 - the arrow there's like a pen surrounding
01:38 - it and then you supposed to shoot the
01:41 - ball and collects 19 score Nobi
01:44 - for the next shot and Sabatini and so on
01:48 - obviously as you can see I was 18 and if
01:51 - you run out of watches which I'm 20 so
02:01 - much I'd get all these
02:04 - [Music]
02:09 - so
02:18 - [Music]
02:31 - as you can see I scored 116 let's stop
02:34 - the project and let's create a new
02:39 - project so I already have things built
02:49 - for me like the blocks in the backdrop
02:51 - and stuff so it's right in the backpack
02:54 - I can load the sprite
02:57 - I just forgot something a block block
03:01 - and then we can also load the backdrop
03:05 - in so there you go we can also delete
03:10 - the cat before we go on so I'll
03:13 - demonstrate how you throw the backdrop
03:20 - so um we can check this one out I'm
03:25 - gonna try to draw it for you guys
03:27 - so first we got to make the square I
03:31 - mean the rectangle you can drop whatever
03:34 - you want
03:35 - I'm gonna enlarge it and Center it so we
03:38 - can also change the feel of it to fade
03:42 - in or out whatever you call it and then
03:46 - the green spots can be white that look
03:51 - pretty well so as you can see all you
03:56 - can look at the backdrop it's white on
03:58 - the bottom and blue on the top so you
04:02 - can also add the grass and the dirt
04:04 - third
04:15 - so I had the dark green color so I'm
04:30 - gonna draw the earth next the dirt mound
04:34 - so we can duplicate it ctrl-c and ctrl-v
04:38 - like a normal copy paste and then we can
04:42 - also put it down then we can just change
04:44 - the color so I just zoomed in for better
04:46 - so you can see it better we can take the
04:51 - fill or we just use whatever that color
04:57 - is the brown color so I just did that we
05:02 - don't need the fade in and out for this
05:04 - one we can just do the normal deal then
05:11 - we can just take that so as you can see
05:18 - there's two colors green and brown so if
05:21 - there aren't that I'm good looking you
05:23 - can also use the group tool it's all the
05:26 - way up here and you can group these two
05:29 - together as you can see it moves both of
05:31 - them but normally it would not let's
05:37 - delete on this one because we already
05:38 - have this one already out and uh you I
05:48 - didn't teach you how to draw the block
05:50 - it's just easy it's just two rectangles
05:54 - basically you can just group them and
05:56 - you can make them more closer to each
05:57 - other that's basically how you do it
05:59 - also I'm gonna get my sprites you know
06:03 - so paint and you paint a new one i'ma
06:08 - show you
06:14 - take the eyedropper see if you did not
06:21 - know that you can actually think
06:22 - eyedropper type of thing then I can make
06:26 - like a small block well it's really
06:28 - small right now to make it larger and as
06:34 - we did we can do control C and control V
06:36 - to make the other shulk you just put
06:42 - this on the bottom or top doesn't matter
06:44 - and then change the color of the top one
06:48 - you use the arrow keys to move adjust it
06:55 - [Music]
06:56 - you can change the color of that as you
06:59 - can see it's pretty even gonna change it
07:01 - to a lighter green it's around the same
07:05 - color yeah so as you can see there's two
07:12 - blocks and then you can also group them
07:14 - together and make them more easier to it
07:17 - can group them to make it easier to move
07:19 - since I already have one I can delete
07:21 - this one okay so let's get our sprites
07:25 - you need the arrow arrow and we're gonna
07:44 - make eight variables Bob we can make the
07:50 - variable block count all speed each gap
08:08 - HP launches score V that and V speed but
08:34 - we can just rename this one these so
08:43 - these are all the things we can hide all
08:45 - of them except or we don't have to hide
08:49 - them right now but we can hide them
08:50 - later um those and these are all our
08:52 - variables so as you can see this sprites
08:58 - at a hundred percent I might turn it to
09:01 - fifty if that's too big s key so let's
09:09 - work on the grass block or the block we
09:14 - have to put the wall make a block create
09:28 - so let's zoom in set block count to zero
09:37 - in the beginning but we'll repeat 10
09:40 - times create clone of myself I think
09:45 - it's actually in this one so I'll make
09:48 - up duplicates of itself and I'll change
09:50 - the block out by one for each one and
09:53 - then I'll hide and then when you start
09:59 - one flag is when the green flag is
10:03 - clicked that will show you know create
10:07 - the pile around this code so we're still
10:14 - in this code so when I start as a clone
10:16 - I'm
10:17 - that one can't move so let's move that
10:26 - up there that's right here so you can
10:28 - see it better
10:29 - it will set a little set fall speed to
10:37 - zero it'll go - you need this one go -
10:43 - and then pick random to pick randoms
10:48 - pick random 180-200 and negative a
10:56 - hundred seventy and you need the vision
11:05 - so I'm sorry oh it's actually not pick
11:08 - random it's actually an ad negative 170
11:15 - and this is actually a multiplied and
11:19 - multiplied not divided
11:21 - and then block count 35 so this pick
11:33 - random 188 200 is for like if it stacks
11:37 - like here and here and here and here
11:39 - announcer and then this is for making
11:43 - the bottom one is negative 170 and each
11:48 - other creates a block it will add 35 so
11:52 - we need a repeat until people sign a
12:00 - block out equals zero that's when
12:03 - basically win Locka equals zero
12:08 - they also needed if and then statement
12:12 - it's touching the ball because that's
12:15 - where the light used to person launch
12:17 - the ball at it and then hide
12:23 - Oh change the score by lunches so that's
12:28 - why you're supposed to you get more
12:35 - points if you get less lunches so
12:38 - lunches and then change the block count
12:43 - to minus one
12:49 - we'd also start the sound pop it you can
12:52 - is optional the binos is set the
13:01 - horizontal speed which is basically H
13:03 - speed horizontal speed a horizontal
13:06 - speed to multiply multiply negative zero
13:13 - point eight to eight speed horizontal
13:19 - speed and we need another if-then
13:22 - statement if not you need or touching no
13:35 - I mean no I mean no
13:37 - you also need I'm not in front of that
13:39 - it's not and you also you're watching
13:47 - color so you actually have to select the
13:53 - bottom and the top color so let's use
13:55 - this one to talk to color and touching
13:59 - color I think this one's the same color
14:01 - I'm pretty sure she's a double check
14:04 - okay
14:05 - touching both of them and then it will
14:10 - change the full speed by zero negative
14:19 - Xue
14:23 - also change the why by all speed change
14:35 - Y by fall speed makes the blocks drop on
14:38 - top of each other and then we need a
14:40 - broadcast message all the way in the
14:44 - back okay assess it let's see what we
14:57 - got as you can see the blocks are
14:59 - falling on each other
15:00 - correctly but if they aren't falling on
15:02 - each other correctly it's probably
15:04 - because of the size or or the besides
15:10 - being adjust the size or the Y position
15:16 - because it's like 35 basically so if you
15:19 - turn it to 40 some light gets stuck in
15:21 - on tops let's see what happens
15:26 - see as you can see some got stuck on top
15:29 - so we can change that back to 35
15:34 - depending on the block you either have
15:37 - to change the size or this in this so
15:40 - anyways thanks well we were working on
15:43 - the ball and the arrow on the next part
15:45 - so thanks for watching everyone and see
15:48 - you guys next time
