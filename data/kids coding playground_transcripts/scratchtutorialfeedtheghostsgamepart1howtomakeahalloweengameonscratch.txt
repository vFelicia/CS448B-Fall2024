00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's kingston
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:09 - another video
00:10 - called be feed the ghost game so we are
00:13 - making another halloween game because
00:14 - it's almost halloween
00:16 - this time you're the player who tries to
00:18 - throw candies and feed the ghosts
00:20 - if you are able to feed 10 ghosts with
00:22 - 20 candies
00:23 - that you have then you win the game else
00:25 - you will lose
00:30 - feed the ghost game we'll be learning
00:31 - these following concepts in scratch
00:33 - variables broadcast messages loops
00:36 - switch costume
00:37 - learn to get x and y position for sprite
00:39 - and touching sprite
00:42 - so i'll be demoing this game let's full
00:44 - screen it
00:46 - so i play some music in the background
00:48 - and as you can see there's like a little
00:49 - um bullseye thing
00:51 - that moves around and that glides around
00:53 - and there's ghosts always flying around
00:55 - and you try to feed the ghost and it
00:57 - says got it if you
00:59 - feed a ghost and says got it and then
01:00 - makes like a chomp noise
01:02 - and then if you miss it says it laughs
01:04 - at you like it's
01:06 - um laughing at you because you missed
01:08 - and
01:10 - and you just keep on feeding them until
01:12 - you get ten
01:13 - and then you win
01:18 - or you lose yeah
01:32 - so i'm gonna try to lose here
01:40 - i actually might win i see it
01:43 - when you get 10 um it says you won so
01:47 - yeah if you run out of candies and you
01:50 - don't score
01:50 - 10 points you lose obviously so
01:54 - let's start a new project
02:00 - so before i start please like share
02:03 - subscribe and comment in the comment
02:04 - section below for what else videos you
02:06 - want
02:07 - so i do have some things in my backpack
02:09 - let's just first delete this
02:10 - scratch cap i have some things in my
02:12 - backpack so there's
02:14 - um backdrop i got online
02:20 - so it's called halloween bg3 and it's
02:23 - from free pick so
02:24 - links in the description you can
02:25 - definitely check that out this is a
02:27 - really cool website where you can get
02:29 - backdrops and sprites for things so yeah
02:32 - it's really cool it's called free pick
02:33 - so
02:35 - you can go there so i already have the
02:39 - backdrop done for myself so i'll
02:42 - actually show you how to do it
02:43 - so you just have to um put hover your
02:46 - mouse here gotta
02:47 - upload backdrop then you gotta
02:50 - click this
02:55 - and it'll open as you can see it's not
02:57 - big enough so you gotta convert to
02:58 - vector
03:00 - and you can make it larger how large you
03:02 - want it to be
03:03 - so
03:08 - so we can make this larger as you can
03:10 - see that's basically how you do it but
03:12 - i'm just going to delete this
03:13 - so anyways um let's get to the code
03:17 - so we will have the candy and bullseye
03:19 - it's in the links
03:20 - in the description so i'm gonna drag the
03:22 - candy
03:24 - and i'm gonna drag the bullseye
03:28 - and let's get coding so first i'm just
03:30 - gonna go to the backdrop and
03:32 - do the sounds that's simple enough and
03:34 - green flag is clicked
03:37 - forever loop
03:40 - and you gotta choose your sound so sound
03:43 - and i use dance snare beat so you can
03:46 - use any sound you want if i use dance
03:48 - snare beat
03:52 - i think it's called dancing beat yep and
03:54 - um
03:56 - play sound dance snare beat until done
03:59 - so the sound
04:00 - is done so i'm going to work on the
04:02 - bullseye
04:05 - next so i'm going to work on the
04:08 - bullseye next
04:11 - um so when the green flag is clicked
04:15 - so i'm gonna zoom in a little bit when
04:16 - the green flag is clicked
04:18 - it will set size to a hundred percent
04:21 - it already is a hundred but it will go
04:24 - to the front layer
04:27 - so you can see it in the front it'll
04:30 - show
04:34 - and it'll go to a position
04:37 - so let's just make it go to
04:42 - maybe let's keep it here
04:45 - but let's go forever
04:49 - glide one second
04:54 - two have to glide somewhere so let's say
04:58 - around here
05:03 - so um the bullseye sprite you could just
05:06 - make
05:07 - the bullseye sprite around the moon like
05:10 - here
05:10 - here here here and the ghost is always
05:12 - flying around so
05:13 - you can like glide to wherever you want
05:15 - your bull's eye
05:16 - like up here all the way here so i
05:19 - already have the written coordinates
05:21 - for myself so it's glide one second
05:24 - to x 110 and
05:28 - y eighty i also have another one
05:34 - glide one second to
05:37 - negative 110 and
05:40 - positive 45 and then
05:44 - glide one second to 110
05:48 - 45 so you can you don't have to follow
05:51 - the exact
05:52 - coordinates it'll just zigzag around
05:54 - like around here
05:55 - you'll keep on zigzagging and then i
05:58 - also have
06:00 - glide one second to negative 110
06:05 - and positive 10 y
06:09 - also i also have glide one second
06:13 - to x 110
06:16 - y 10 and also
06:20 - um last one
06:23 - glide the x
06:27 - negative 110 and you can change this one
06:30 - to 0.5
06:31 - 0.5 seconds and
06:35 - eighty so those are my written
06:37 - coordinates so yeah
06:39 - so i'm just gonna close down the
06:42 - backpack right here
06:43 - and i'm gonna show it to you as you can
06:45 - see there's like the bullseye
06:47 - zigzagging all around the moon
06:50 - and yeah so when i'm gonna make some
06:54 - variables
06:55 - so i have to make variable
07:00 - candy
07:02 - the variable
07:07 - mist so it will tell if you missed one
07:10 - of the ghosts
07:12 - a variable
07:18 - another variable x
07:22 - and the last variable y
07:27 - so the x and y variables are for when i
07:30 - fire my candy it'll go to that position
07:33 - x and y so of the bullseye so yeah
07:36 - um and we also need to code a little bit
07:39 - so when the green flag is clicked
07:41 - clear graphic effects
07:44 - i'll go forever
07:49 - set x
07:53 - set x to x position so it's in sensing
07:57 - x position right here
08:02 - that's actually in motion sorry x
08:04 - position
08:05 - and um set
08:10 - y to y position
08:17 - and also change color effect by 20. it's
08:20 - actually optional but if you want to
08:22 - make it change color it'll flash and
08:24 - flash and flash so
08:25 - change color effect by 20. so i'll just
08:27 - show it to you
08:28 - as you can see it's moving and it's
08:30 - changing to beautiful colors
08:34 - so yeah so in my backpack i also have
08:39 - the cloud so there's actually um some
08:42 - details in the background
08:43 - if you did not see earlier there's
08:45 - actually some clouds
08:46 - going around up and down around the
08:49 - place
08:50 - so yeah so we're going to coat the
08:53 - clouds next so
08:54 - it has a hunk of code so we can code
08:56 - that
08:57 - so when the green flag is clicked i have
09:00 - a
09:01 - go to negative 50 y
09:05 - 129 so and i have written coordinates so
09:09 - so it is precise so forever
09:13 - repeat twice
09:18 - and wait 0.4 seconds
09:25 - and i can also change this 130 because i
09:28 - have written coordinates
09:29 - so and it's also even so
09:33 - and wait 0.4 seconds change y
09:36 - [Music]
09:38 - by negative one
09:45 - and also you need to repeat duplicate
09:47 - this but it's just a little bit
09:48 - different
09:49 - so you gotta put this under not inside
09:51 - or also will not work under that thing
09:53 - but still in the forever loop
09:54 - so it's two 0.4 seconds
09:57 - and it's positive one instead so it'll
10:01 - just go up and down so i'll show you
10:03 - see it's going up and down it's a really
10:05 - good detail
10:07 - so yeah and also
10:12 - we can also code the ghost so i think we
10:15 - do have time for the ghost so
10:16 - ghost is actually in the sprite library
10:22 - ghost and
10:25 - when the green flag is clicked so i'm
10:27 - going to set his rotation style to left
10:29 - right
10:30 - right here click on this and when the
10:33 - green flag is clicked
10:35 - set size to 45
10:39 - because i think he's a little bit too
10:40 - big so it's too easy to get the score
10:43 - and then switch costume to ghost d
10:47 - so i'm pretty sure ghost d is this
10:50 - costume of him running around
10:52 - so yeah and it'll go to
10:56 - i do have coordinates so i'll go to 0
11:00 - 20.
11:04 - it really doesn't matter actually but i
11:06 - do have coordinates so i was using them
11:08 - so
11:08 - anyways it will repeat 5 times
11:13 - so it'll create five ghosts so there's a
11:16 - create clone of myself oh repeat it five
11:18 - times so there's gonna be five
11:20 - different ghosts and then oh hi
11:24 - they'll hide the original ghost because
11:26 - the original one will be still there and
11:28 - the clones will be moving around
11:30 - so when i start as a clone
11:33 - it will go to random position so
11:38 - right here oh show because it
11:42 - is probably hidden it might be hidden
11:45 - and
11:46 - it will go forever
11:50 - if then and you hit and
11:54 - operator
11:58 - touching candy
12:04 - candy so
12:08 - the end so i'm gonna move a little bit
12:10 - to the right and then and
12:12 - me equals operator and then
12:15 - do miss so misses for later use and then
12:18 - ready to end
12:19 - because when you throw a candy and it
12:21 - actually misses a ghost and a ghost just
12:23 - passes by
12:24 - the candy and it will still count points
12:26 - so this is how you control it and it
12:27 - will not count points
12:29 - so and then no switch costume to go see
12:32 - so the ghostie is going to be like
12:35 - eating the candy
12:37 - let's see go see silk eating the candy
12:41 - and wait one second
12:46 - it'll hide
12:50 - and do not put it here and put it inside
12:52 - here it'll wait another second
12:57 - and i'll switch costume
13:00 - to the running ghost so ghosty
13:03 - it'll show
13:08 - so you remember it's hiding your show so
13:13 - not inside the block you need a point in
13:15 - direction
13:19 - so the next script of code we're doing
13:21 - is making um
13:23 - the ghost fly around so then it'll point
13:25 - to the left or point to the right
13:26 - and it'll fly around in that direction
13:28 - so point in direction
13:30 - pick random
13:33 - negative 90 to
13:38 - 90. it will also
13:41 - glide
13:47 - so this next script of code is to make
13:49 - the ghost
13:50 - and so it won't fly everywhere and only
13:52 - fly around the moon
13:53 - so pick random
13:58 - 0.5
14:00 - and one second
14:04 - to x pick
14:07 - random
14:13 - negative 125
14:16 - to 125
14:20 - okay so and also you also need another
14:23 - pick random
14:25 - 110 to
14:32 - negative 110 i know if
14:35 - if it's on edge if it's on the edge
14:39 - go about i don't think we actually need
14:42 - the if on edge bounce because it's not
14:44 - even gonna be on the edge
14:45 - so i'm gonna show you the game
14:50 - so i'm gonna show you the game as you
14:52 - can see there's uh the bulls eyes flying
14:54 - everywhere the ghosts are flying
14:55 - everywhere
14:56 - that's really cool so we will be doing
14:58 - the candies
14:59 - later so in part two so there will be a
15:03 - part two
15:03 - [Music]
15:05 - so yeah please like
15:08 - share subscribe again and comment in the
15:10 - comment section below
15:12 - and also see you guys next time
