00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - thank you
00:10 - hello welcome to kiss calling playground
00:12 - channel so today we'll be introducing a
00:15 - brand new game called Bubble tea maker
00:16 - in this game the player will get a
00:19 - chance to run their own bubble tea shop
00:21 - creating and serving variety of
00:23 - delicious string to a customer and
00:25 - player will learn about different
00:26 - ingredients and recipe and art making
00:29 - bubble tea
00:31 - um so get ready to become a bubble tea
00:33 - Master okay all right so I guess you
00:36 - guys have seen the demo that we did last
00:38 - week so today we're gonna start doing
00:40 - the coding for it okay without further
00:42 - Ado let's go and start making our game
00:45 - okay so you can go to this uh uh game
00:49 - here this is like a template game but we
00:52 - doesn't have any code and you can just
00:54 - remix this game okay I will have all the
00:57 - links in the below in the description of
00:59 - the video so for now let's get on to the
01:02 - project so for me since I'm on my own
01:04 - account I will not be able to remix it
01:07 - what I will do is I'm gonna say save as
01:10 - a new copy all right so I am going to
01:14 - change it to maybe called teaching
01:18 - two okay okay so we have to uh start
01:21 - with creating some variable first so
01:24 - some of the variable we need uh so for
01:27 - this game so make sure this one is for
01:29 - all Sprite so we're gonna say uh change
01:32 - change color
01:37 - okay and then next one we are going to
01:41 - use a create as a customer
01:43 - counter so the first variable change
01:47 - color is for us too when we make
01:48 - different drinks for the different
01:50 - customer we can change the costume with
01:52 - color without drawing more costume okay
01:55 - these are the two variables you will
01:56 - need for now
02:00 - and also let me go through some of the
02:03 - Sprites for you guys so we want to
02:05 - custom here you have the standing that
02:07 - the cat this is like turn one turn two
02:10 - like the cat turn and this one is like
02:12 - give one so where we move the hand of
02:15 - the cat so that they can give the bubble
02:16 - tea to the customer later okay and we
02:19 - have the second costume we have the uh
02:22 - first customer second customer third
02:25 - fourth fifth so basically I just took
02:27 - the uh sprite from the backpack I mean
02:30 - from the library and copy and paste it
02:31 - here the third one is the uh this is
02:34 - like the tapioca scoop so here I
02:37 - actually uh draw this one so we have the
02:40 - wooden handle here if you break this
02:42 - apart and group you can see there's a
02:45 - just this is a lighter color brown I put
02:47 - it on top of here and then this is just
02:49 - a connected and then you have little
02:51 - little Black Pearl here and these are
02:54 - the uh you know just line that I drew
02:56 - and then using the uh reshape tool to
02:59 - reshape it you know in the you know the
03:02 - little
03:03 - scoop okay all right so you guys
03:06 - understand this part so next part this
03:08 - is the tap yoga Pearl so this is just a
03:11 - little black uh or a round circle I drew
03:15 - next is the cup so we have to custom the
03:18 - cup so the first cup is without any
03:20 - bubble and then second third fourth and
03:23 - fifth and sixth costume and then you
03:26 - have the tea pot so the teapot is from
03:28 - the online uh downloaded to the PNG file
03:31 - remove the background
03:33 - and we have the teacup so the tea cup is
03:36 - uh when we after when we start filling
03:38 - the tea we can fill up the cups and then
03:41 - we can change costume each time and make
03:43 - it go up you know to different costume
03:46 - right and then at the very end here we
03:49 - can start filling up the uh the syrup
03:52 - and then at the very end we have the
03:54 - cover on top
03:55 - and this is the tea
03:57 - [Music]
03:59 - so this is a tea Sprite so basically a
04:02 - 10 and then the same color as the tea
04:04 - and then we have the syrup surface the
04:07 - picture here I just added this little
04:09 - orange to the to the to the syrup and
04:12 - then we have the syrup as well this is
04:13 - also a little like a line 10 with a
04:18 - colored zero then I have a straw so the
04:21 - straw I drew the straw uh as a kind of a
04:24 - little bit sharp with the straw and you
04:27 - can see the rounded um in the reshaped
04:30 - to the arrow and then you can see that I
04:33 - made it go down a little bit so from top
04:35 - to down and then look like we can poke
04:39 - the hole through the bubble tea right so
04:42 - that's for that and then we have the
04:43 - table table just a table uh also I got
04:46 - it from online uh just remove the
04:49 - background and then I just draw another
04:51 - uh like a square box with a gray color
04:55 - kind of thing in the back so for that
04:57 - look like it's insane something like
04:59 - that up for the cat to stand on and then
05:01 - this is the icon so basically I just
05:03 - took the cup tea put it here and then
05:05 - we're gonna use that for the icon and
05:07 - then the rain so the rain part is uh
05:09 - it's like this so we just let me show
05:12 - you real quick so you have the color
05:14 - let's say I made I made this um blue you
05:18 - can see
05:19 - I go back you can see that line starts
05:22 - here and then in the second one costume
05:25 - you go back you can see that it's in the
05:28 - next line so basically we do one line so
05:31 - let's say we copy this line
05:33 - uh here
05:35 - and then I put paste it here you can see
05:37 - that okay the first line is like this
05:39 - the second line kind of a little bit
05:42 - overlaps the first line and continue
05:43 - basically uh keep going down down until
05:46 - we get to the very end so um let me
05:49 - delete the this one so at the very end
05:53 - you know we can actually see so here you
05:56 - have the uh
06:01 - and then the last one you see the three
06:04 - little longer dots so basically we drop
06:07 - down and we create a splash for the ring
06:09 - so we probably have a video later on to
06:11 - do like how to do the brain effect so
06:14 - you guys can learn from that all right
06:17 - okay so I I hope you guys understand all
06:21 - the uh subscribe for this game and then
06:23 - in the background
06:24 - the backdrop is just like the different
06:27 - let me just duplicate I don't want to
06:29 - mess up the one so here I just have like
06:31 - some bamboo I got from online so here
06:34 - you can just paste the bamboo like this
06:36 - just kind of designed it the the one on
06:39 - top I just rotated on top you know just
06:42 - rotate this like this and then just just
06:45 - drag it and place it in here okay so
06:47 - that's how I did it I made a little
06:49 - stand for the for the backdrop and
06:52 - that's everything we have okay all right
06:54 - let's start coding foreign
06:58 - first
07:02 - so here we will do uh when green flag is
07:05 - clicked
07:06 - so this is going to be a couple of
07:08 - series for this uh game so it's a little
07:10 - bit more complicated so I do a couple of
07:12 - series for this and I will say set the
07:15 - change color to zero so first I don't
07:17 - have to change any color so we're gonna
07:19 - go with the uh you know orange color
07:21 - with the flavor and then next one we'll
07:24 - change different color next uh we'll
07:27 - have something called
07:28 - um we switch to the stand so we'll
07:32 - switch to the First costume where he's
07:34 - standing then next we'll put in the
07:37 - syntax
07:40 - less like some bubble tea okay and you
07:45 - can do two second or three seconds I
07:47 - think original game I have three seconds
07:49 - so that you can see and then next I just
07:53 - say hey clicked
07:56 - to feel increase okay
08:01 - so this will click and then you have to
08:03 - fill the ingredients and then it will be
08:05 - able to make the bubble tea
08:06 - next will you broadcast a message called
08:11 - foreign
08:15 - [Music]
08:17 - so this one is where the customer walks
08:20 - in so we'll go back to the next we'll go
08:22 - to the customer Sprite
08:24 - [Music]
08:25 - so in the customer Sprite we just
08:27 - broadcast customer walk-in so we're
08:29 - gonna make this customer can't walk
08:31 - inside so before we do that let's make a
08:34 - my block
08:35 - so make a new block called move customer
08:39 - so we use this my block so that we could
08:42 - use it later again so um when we use
08:45 - this
08:47 - in the next uh after the first Sprite
08:50 - you know that the drinks the next
08:52 - customer come in we can recreate this
08:54 - you know call this block again to do the
08:56 - same thing all right so next we say go
08:59 - to
09:00 - pack layer so basically we want the
09:03 - customer the behind the table and
09:05 - everything right so we say go to back
09:06 - layer then we say set the customer at
09:10 - this location we'll say negative 200. so
09:14 - negative 200 is somewhere like right
09:16 - here in the back here okay
09:17 - then we say show
09:19 - so we're going to hide the customer in
09:21 - the beginning so that's why in this show
09:22 - so let me create that first let's do
09:25 - this so switch so we're going to move it
09:28 - to the First costume first so when green
09:31 - practice click I do this and we'll say
09:33 - hi so we'll probably do this one first
09:35 - so sorry about that I got this one here
09:38 - first and after that we have something
09:40 - called we're gonna Glide the customer
09:42 - say Glide uh two seconds and we go to
09:47 - negative 50 and 25 so it will come like
09:50 - somewhere right here okay then next
09:53 - we're gonna broadcast a message
09:57 - call
09:59 - stop so this will actually start our
10:02 - game
10:02 - okay then
10:04 - you remember we broadcast a message
10:06 - earlier say what customer walks in so
10:08 - we're gonna have to do that so when
10:09 - customers walks in we're gonna broadcast
10:12 - we're going to call this method so now
10:14 - if I actually run this game you can see
10:16 - that the cat is talking say let's make
10:18 - some bubble tea let's click click and to
10:21 - fill the ingredients and then you'll see
10:23 - the customer walks in so you can see
10:25 - that right all right so that's what we
10:27 - have so far
10:29 - foreign
10:31 - [Music]
10:37 - [Music]
10:39 - flag is clicked
10:42 - we're gonna hide this one so we're gonna
10:44 - hide this
10:46 - uh Sprite in the beginning
10:50 - and then we we broadcast earlier we
10:52 - broadcast start right so we're gonna say
10:54 - when I receive start
10:56 - uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to
10:58 - hide again so that later I can use this
11:01 - to reuse took uh for the next custom so
11:04 - and then next I'll say wait one second
11:08 - and then I will say put down point in
11:12 - Direction 90 so that you know when the
11:14 - scope comes up you know how we have the
11:16 - scoop you know later down we will turn
11:19 - the scoop so in the beginning we'll do
11:21 - 90 so that way the scope is kind of
11:23 - horizontal and then later we'll we'll
11:25 - rotate it to the top to drop the bubble
11:28 - okay
11:29 - so that's why we need that then we'll
11:32 - say go to
11:34 - we're gonna go to 180 and 40y so
11:37 - somewhere in the right side around here
11:40 - next we're going to say show
11:44 - okay
11:46 - and we're gonna Glide in so we're gonna
11:49 - say Glide one second
11:51 - two zero and forty so basically this
11:55 - this little scoop will kind of Glide in
11:59 - from here it will glide into here okay
12:04 - then we have something called we can use
12:07 - this block called wait until so
12:08 - basically you're gonna wait whatever
12:10 - condition is here until that is
12:12 - satisfied and it will move on to the
12:13 - next block so we're going to say wait
12:15 - until
12:16 - Mouse down so basically when the user
12:19 - click on the mouse and hold it a little
12:21 - bit and then this thing will run
12:23 - then what we're going to do is we're
12:25 - going to move back a little bit like one
12:27 - second
12:28 - and we'll move it back to 65 and we'll
12:31 - keep it around 40 so that's where the
12:34 - wire is so we'll we'll go when you click
12:37 - on it it will move back a little bit
12:39 - then we're going to rotate It To The Top
12:42 - then
12:43 - I'm gonna say rotate repeat 10 times
12:48 - and then here what we're going to do is
12:50 - we're going to rotate to the left
12:52 - and we'll say rotate 5 degree
12:55 - okay then after that click on broadcast
12:58 - a new event so this is more of an
13:00 - animation kind of thing and some
13:02 - interaction but you have to keep all
13:04 - your events straight if not you don't
13:06 - have a lot of trouble so we're gonna say
13:07 - drop tappy oh okay so be sure you give a
13:12 - good name for all your events okay so
13:15 - now let's run it again so we don't
13:17 - actually have to run the whole code
13:19 - again we can just click this when the
13:21 - screen flag is start then we'll click
13:23 - this and just test our code you can see
13:26 - that
13:27 - the club the mouse down is waiting for
13:29 - Mouse sounds not doing anything so when
13:31 - I click on it you see it move back and
13:33 - it kind of rotate to the top all right
13:36 - so that's what we have so far
13:39 - okay next we'll move to the uh tapioca
13:42 - so for the tapioca we're going to start
13:44 - with when green flag is clicked okay or
13:47 - for this one we're gonna have to create
13:49 - a new variable so make sure you select
13:51 - for this Sprite only okay that's why
13:54 - important I make a lowercase so that I
13:55 - know it's for the Sprite only so this is
13:58 - where we use the counter
14:00 - so we can count how many of this little
14:02 - uh top yoga we're gonna drop so and then
14:05 - we can use that counter to do something
14:07 - later so we're going to say set the
14:09 - counter to zero we're gonna hide this
14:11 - right now and then we are going to hide
14:14 - the
14:15 - this type yoga Pro so earlier we have
14:19 - something called drop top yoga right
14:21 - from this scoop when we receive drop
14:23 - tapioca we're gonna set the counter back
14:26 - to zero as well
14:27 - and then we'll start the game so to zero
14:31 - so we always need this because later on
14:34 - when we call the game to we do
14:36 - everything We're not gonna call this
14:38 - anymore so that's why we need to reset
14:40 - it here so reset
14:42 - then we are going to say repeat 10 times
14:49 - create a column myself
14:52 - and then I'm going to do a little weight
14:54 - so that you can kind of see each little
14:56 - uh little top yoga drop down and we're
14:59 - going to increase the count so change
15:01 - the counter by one
15:04 - next uh we're going to do we're going to
15:06 - add an if condition here
15:09 - so in this if condition what we want to
15:11 - do is we're going to start when the
15:13 - counter gets to three we're gonna start
15:16 - broadcasting a message to change the cup
15:18 - and start filling of the tapioca okay so
15:22 - we're gonna say counter is equal to
15:24 - three
15:25 - then we broadcast a new message
15:29 - called field
15:32 - tab
15:34 - okay and then we're gonna broadcast a
15:38 - new message called
15:40 - start t
15:43 - okay and next we'll since we create a
15:46 - clone myself so I will need something
15:48 - say when I create when I start as a
15:50 - clone so when I start as a club I'm
15:53 - gonna go to zero zero
15:55 - so what the tapioca is zero zero
15:59 - next I'm gonna say show
16:01 - [Music]
16:04 - next I'm gonna say repeat until
16:06 - [Music]
16:08 - and then I'm gonna say touching cup
16:14 - so here make sure we're touching this
16:16 - cup and not the teacup so the teacup
16:19 - let's just hide the teacup for now and
16:21 - the cup let's open it up okay
16:23 - all right so we're gonna say change y
16:29 - five minus five so this will make the
16:32 - tapioca fall down
16:34 - and then when they touch the cup we're
16:36 - gonna start a sound pop
16:39 - to delete the Clone so whenever you use
16:42 - the Clone you have to delete the clock
16:44 - okay all right so now let's just try it
16:48 - out uh in a bit so we still have to fill
16:51 - the cups right so let's finish the cup
16:53 - and then we'll try it out so
16:56 - in the cup
16:57 - so let's go to the cup
16:59 - [Music]
17:02 - and then we're gonna stop the video
17:04 - later and then we'll continue next time
17:06 - so in the cup say when green flag is
17:09 - clicked
17:10 - we are going to hide the cup so I'm not
17:13 - sure the cup in the beginning uh and
17:16 - then we're gonna create a new block my
17:18 - block so cup setup so this will set up
17:21 - the cup every time you know uh the game
17:23 - start we'll have to call this and also
17:26 - when the new customer come with the call
17:28 - so for the cup setup I'm gonna say
17:31 - um go to front layers and the cup is in
17:34 - front of the table
17:35 - and we are going to switch to costume
17:38 - number one which is the cup without any
17:41 - bubble this one okay
17:43 - and then we are going to put it at this
17:46 - location
17:48 - and then we're gonna add the word show
17:51 - okay and then when I receive start so
17:55 - you remember we have an event called
17:56 - start in the beginning when the customer
17:58 - walks in and we have start then we have
18:02 - we call this cup
18:04 - set up okay
18:07 - now that we we had something called
18:09 - field tapioca here right field tapioca
18:12 - we haven't do start T so that's for you
18:14 - next time so fill tap yoga so when the
18:16 - little tap you could drop to the third
18:18 - trap you're gonna start broadcast how it
18:22 - feels happy yoga so here what we're
18:24 - going to do is when I receive
18:27 - Phil tapioca here I'm gonna switch to
18:30 - costume number one
18:34 - uh next I'm gonna say show
18:39 - and then I will say repeat
18:43 - five times
18:46 - and then next costume
18:49 - and then move to a weight
18:52 - uh 0.27 so I repeat five times because I
18:56 - have six costume one two three four five
18:59 - and then six so I start in here I report
19:02 - five times
19:03 - okay all right so let's try this out
19:05 - again let's run this again real quick so
19:07 - I'll say make some bubble tea
19:09 - let's click click to fill the
19:11 - ingredients so first the customer walks
19:14 - in and you see the cup comes here then
19:17 - you see the
19:18 - scoop here we'll click on this
19:21 - so you can hear that it dropped the cup
19:24 - I will drop the bubble and then start
19:26 - filling the cups so this is where we are
