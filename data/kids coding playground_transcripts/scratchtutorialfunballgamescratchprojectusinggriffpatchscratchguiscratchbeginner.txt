00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys this is kids from
00:08 - playground here
00:09 - and today we're back for another video
00:12 - and
00:13 - this is not the same as normal in any of
00:15 - our videos it's not scratch actually not
00:18 - python either
00:19 - it's grip patch scratch so if you didn't
00:21 - know
00:23 - gross batch made his own scratch and
00:26 - it's
00:26 - in his video and links in description
00:29 - you can go to this channel
00:30 - and you can and we have um the link for
00:32 - the scratch
00:34 - and this is not made by us we the chris
00:36 - patch made it so
00:37 - he's a very very good coder if you
00:39 - haven't seen any of his games
00:40 - you can actually see them uh they're
00:42 - really fun he's a yeah he's pretty he's
00:44 - really good
00:46 - uh so let's get into griff
00:50 - patch scratch um
00:53 - uh let's get there so
00:57 - so okay so this is the game that i made
01:00 - it's very similar to um
01:04 - so it's um
01:08 - so if it's a scratch game
01:11 - [Music]
01:19 - [Music]
01:23 - so kick that ball
01:26 - and then remember kids don't try this at
01:28 - home it's very dangerous don't
01:30 - dance in the middle of the road kicking
01:32 - buses and
01:33 - kicking balls so
01:38 - so as you can see it's just for you to
01:40 - bounce around the ball
01:43 - and it's kind of satisfying if you get a
01:44 - good kick or something
01:46 - where you knock down the tours or
01:48 - something
01:50 - it's very satisfying
01:53 - so anyways let's start it's already made
01:56 - a new project
01:57 - the first thing i'm going to do is ask
01:58 - you to share
02:00 - like and subscribe this video that's the
02:02 - first thing i'm going to ask you to do
02:04 - yeah do that please so anyways let's
02:08 - just name this
02:09 - um uh ball game
02:14 - so so there's a new physics extension
02:19 - over here so when you click this
02:21 - expansion where you normally get your
02:23 - translate text to speech
02:24 - or pen or any of these things
02:27 - um there's a new thing physics box 2d
02:31 - grip patch
02:32 - physics so you can get the physics
02:37 - and we're going to have the physics over
02:39 - here there's a bunch of physics and a
02:41 - bunch of new blocks
02:43 - so that's very cool so um
02:46 - i'm going to show you some things that i
02:47 - tried i mean like i didn't try
02:49 - everything so you guys can go to
02:51 - griff patch scratch and
02:55 - go there and like try anything you want
02:58 - there's a bunch of new physics blocks
03:01 - and
03:02 - uh so if you if you if you know
03:06 - if you know this place and you've been
03:07 - here before and you've tried all the
03:09 - physics box
03:10 - comment in the comment section below so
03:13 - yeah uh
03:14 - anyways let's start so first thing we're
03:17 - going to get
03:18 - so we're going to be the beach ball and
03:19 - the city watch bus
03:25 - let's get those two
03:29 - i'm also going to change the backdrop
03:31 - this colorful city
03:33 - that's the one that i used and i'm gonna
03:37 - get some sound on this thing
03:44 - i think i'm probably gonna get is uh
03:48 - [Music]
03:50 - the video game number one number two
03:53 - we're both gonna
03:54 - find the number one for this one because
03:56 - you know it's just good music
03:58 - and then go forever and play sound
04:02 - video game one until done
04:06 - next thing we're going to code up is the
04:08 - scratch cat so these are one of the
04:09 - things i experimented with
04:11 - so when the green flag is clicked
04:15 - there's a new physic block and i mean
04:17 - pointing direction 90 so you want to
04:19 - point on the right side
04:21 - and then i'm going to get the physics
04:23 - blocks so there's a physic block called
04:26 - go to x
04:29 - y in world i don't normally
04:32 - know what is it's basically is i think
04:35 - it's
04:36 - the same thing as this but you have this
04:38 - in world and you can change this a
04:39 - little bit
04:40 - so i have a coordinate so it's negative
04:43 - negative 60 and zero
04:46 - so there's also an enable thing so you
04:49 - can do it for everything
04:50 - so so you can enable
04:54 - for all sprites and they'll make
04:57 - everything have the physic
04:59 - and then normal and you need normal you
05:01 - can i don't know what precision does but
05:04 - you can you can try that out we've got
05:07 - the forever loop
05:08 - and then step simulation
05:13 - so there's a bunch of new blocks yeah
05:15 - like what i said
05:17 - so that's it for the scratch cat
05:20 - and i mean that's not it for the scratch
05:22 - cat there's still a little bit more code
05:23 - this is
05:24 - going to be a very simple project so
05:27 - when this when this sprite is clicked
05:29 - the most key part
05:31 - it'll push with force
05:34 - with force you can do
05:38 - any force you want you can do one
05:39 - bajillion i don't really care but you
05:41 - can if you want to
05:43 - and then you can just make the scratch
05:44 - must fall but i'm doing 75 and 45.
05:48 - make good numbers of that and
05:51 - next thing we're going to work on is the
05:52 - beach ball
05:54 - it's very simple as well and then when
05:56 - the green flag is clicked
06:00 - it will go to the position
06:04 - 75
06:06 - 0 and they'll go forever
06:09 - [Music]
06:12 - if then if that is touching sprite 1
06:16 - which is the scratch cat
06:19 - you see over here um it'll spin with
06:21 - force
06:23 - to make the ball have like a little spin
06:26 - with force like
06:28 - like a little spin like if you ever play
06:30 - tennis and sometimes when you hit that
06:32 - ball
06:32 - it spins that's basically what the spin
06:35 - is
06:36 - and then change velocity let's change
06:39 - velocity
06:41 - by s x
06:44 - 10 and this by 20.
06:48 - and the city bus
06:52 - all you need for this is when the green
06:54 - flag is clicked and go to a position so
06:56 - that's all you need
06:57 - really simple i made it go to 129
07:02 - x and negative 120
07:05 - why i can do 130 actually that's better
07:08 - number
07:11 - and i'm a point in direction 90. so
07:14 - let's
07:17 - [Music]
07:29 - been
07:30 - [Music]
08:05 - so yeah this is basically the game so
08:09 - that ball went up with
08:14 - [Music]
08:20 - because i wanted to see the the
08:22 - differences from scratch
08:24 - so there's a bunch of different
08:25 - differences and griff patch coded a
08:27 - bunch more blocks in
08:29 - so that's very cool anyways
08:32 - please like share subscribe and remember
08:34 - we have a gaming channel links in the
08:36 - description
08:37 - so please up to that we might be posting
08:41 - some other videos i mean like
08:43 - i haven't been posting much because i
08:45 - like
08:46 - this i just like the uh how the griff
08:49 - patch made this app
08:51 - so really cool get that
08:54 - links in the description or you can go
08:56 - to griff patch's video and find that
08:57 - video and then get it in
08:59 - so it's really cool i love it so
09:02 - fun video overall i'd like to try
09:04 - something new so anyways
09:06 - bye
