00:00 - thank you
00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's kids doing
00:09 - playground here and today we're going to
00:11 - embark on a fascinating Journey as we
00:13 - create a scratch project with the help
00:15 - of open ai's chat GPT technology get
00:18 - ready to witness the power of AI as we
00:20 - explore the capabilities of this Cutting
00:23 - Edge technology in a fun and educational
00:25 - setting so uh that is our introduction
00:28 - for this video and if you do not notice
00:30 - this statement was actually made by chat
00:32 - gbt and today we'll be using chat gbt to
00:36 - actually ask them
00:38 - for a scratch project and we're gonna
00:41 - make it into scratch to really see the
00:43 - true knowledge of this robot so if you
00:47 - don't know what chat GPT is it's really
00:49 - popular you might already know what it
00:51 - is but it's a bot where you can ask it
00:54 - questions like all sorts of questions
00:56 - and it can respond with answers
01:00 - which may or may not be right but most
01:03 - of the time is correct unless if the
01:05 - topic is very unpopular so
01:09 - before we start asking them what like
01:11 - scratch projects we should make I'm
01:13 - actually going to ask them like if they
01:15 - know kids playing playground
01:17 - who is kids coding
01:21 - playground oops on
01:24 - YouTube let's see if they know who kid
01:26 - sounds like runners
01:28 - kids Tony playground is a channel on
01:29 - YouTube that provides educational
01:30 - content for children who are interested
01:32 - in learning about computer programming
01:33 - technology the channel features videos
01:34 - and tutorials that aim to introduce so
01:36 - it basically just gives us like an
01:38 - explanation
01:40 - about what who kids for the playground
01:42 - is
01:43 - so anyway
01:45 - uh we shall ask
01:47 - tragedy PT
01:52 - okay so let's ask them create me a
01:57 - simple scratch
01:59 - project so let's see the true knowledge
02:02 - of chat JBC sure here's a simple project
02:04 - blah blah blah blah I start a new
02:06 - project at scratch
02:09 - Sprite section choose to Sprite you can
02:12 - use default Sprite or upload uh add a
02:14 - background
02:15 - in the script section add a new script
02:17 - for this right let's click and then
02:19 - clicking on new script button when the
02:21 - flag is clicked this block will be
02:24 - triggered when the green flag is clicked
02:26 - move 10 steps
02:28 - I turn 15 degrees
02:31 - Okay add a repeat block okay rapid 72
02:36 - repetitions that's interesting
02:39 - um 700 degrees or one full circle
02:43 - to make the add a forever block around
02:46 - the repeat look all right so this is
02:48 - pretty simple
02:50 - and we're probably going to be coding
02:51 - this so let's see if
02:54 - if this project is any good
02:56 - so we're going to be following the
02:59 - steps so I already created my new
03:00 - scratch project
03:01 - First Step start a new project in
03:03 - scratch I already did that from the
03:05 - Sprite section choose a Sprite for your
03:06 - project you could use one of the default
03:08 - Sprites or you can upload them so I'm
03:10 - just going to use the cat and then next
03:12 - you can add a background to your project
03:15 - or backdrop you can choose from one of
03:17 - the default backgrounds or you can
03:19 - upload your own image okay so let's see
03:21 - what can we choose
03:22 - uh let's just choose something
03:27 - how about a forest so we just chose this
03:30 - random background and then
03:32 - um in the script section so we're gonna
03:35 - obviously go back to the Sprite in the
03:37 - script section add a new script for your
03:39 - Sprite by clicking on the Spritz scripts
03:41 - tag okay we already did that it's
03:43 - basically the code tab and then add when
03:46 - a FL when green flag is clicked so we're
03:49 - gonna put that right here
03:53 - um
03:54 - this block will be triggered when the
03:55 - green flag is clicked and we'll start
03:57 - your program okay next add a move 10
04:00 - steps block to your script
04:02 - move 10 steps okay
04:05 - uh this block will make your Sprite move
04:06 - 10 steps in the direction it's facing at
04:09 - a turn 15 degrees
04:12 - block to your script this block will
04:14 - make your Sprite turn 15 degrees to the
04:16 - right okay
04:17 - add a repeat block to your script
04:19 - so repeat block
04:21 - and then set the repetitions to 72.
04:28 - interesting this will make your Sprite
04:30 - move and turn a total of 720 degrees or
04:32 - one full circle
04:34 - to make the Sprite move in a circle and
04:36 - definitely add a forever block
04:39 - around the repeat block okay
04:42 - click the green flag to start your
04:44 - program and watch your Sprite move in a
04:46 - circle
04:50 - oh
04:52 - so this is obviously very simple game
04:55 - and
04:56 - this is just nothing to it it's just
04:58 - let's just rename it it's a spinning cat
05:01 - made by chat
05:06 - so that's just really that's it if you
05:09 - ask it to make a simple scratch project
05:11 - so now we're going to ask it to make us
05:13 - a platformer game on scratch so create
05:16 - me uh
05:19 - platformer game
05:22 - on scratch
05:29 - sure here's a basic platformer game okay
05:32 - start a new project
05:34 - okay
05:37 - I think it's gonna take a while
05:39 - next add platforms we can choose default
05:42 - shapes or upload your own strip section
05:45 - click on the scripts tag and then
05:48 - clicking my new flag this will so this
05:51 - might take a while so I'm just gonna
05:53 - pause it real quick so it's finally done
05:55 - generating all the steps
05:58 - so I don't think this is gonna work
06:01 - as a platformer game
06:05 - but we should give it a try so let's
06:07 - create the project
06:09 - so I got my new project here and
06:13 - I'm gonna try to make this platformer
06:14 - game that chat GPT asked me to make
06:17 - foreign
06:29 - so I finished the project what chat gbt
06:32 - told me to make and I'm pretty sure this
06:34 - is not what I was expecting and this is
06:37 - definitely not gonna work in any way
06:40 - this is not gonna work there's no
06:41 - forever Loops there's no function
06:43 - there's nothing you can't even move like
06:46 - it doesn't work it doesn't work
06:49 - there's no way this works and it says
06:51 - move 10 steps and there's just like
06:53 - blank inside the touching color blanket
06:54 - here and then this Defying Gravity has
06:56 - nothing under it this says whatever this
06:58 - is up Arrow Press do nothing so this
07:01 - can't even this game
07:03 - uh
07:04 - GBC has failed us on making a platformer
07:07 - game on Scratch and this is just not
07:10 - gonna work out I don't think this is how
07:11 - you make a platformer game
07:13 - to actually learn how to make a
07:15 - platformer game check out our platformer
07:17 - um
07:18 - games on our YouTube channel we have
07:20 - plenty of Platformers that you can watch
07:23 - and learn through and these are actually
07:24 - made by actual humans not whatever this
07:27 - is so
07:30 - uh go check out our other platformer
07:33 - videos if you're interested so I think
07:35 - chat gbt is better at doing other stuff
07:37 - like writing essays and writing papers
07:40 - or whatever and not doing like scratch
07:44 - projects or any coding functions and I
07:46 - think it's not ready for this leap into
07:51 - coding
07:53 - I think Chad GBC is better than other
07:55 - stuff like write me uh one page essay on
08:01 - advances in human civilization
08:06 - I think it's better at doing that
08:07 - instead of
08:09 - whatever coding it's really good at
08:13 - writing essays by the way
08:15 - so yeah so this is what they wrote us
08:19 - advances in human civilization has
08:21 - greatly impacted and they literally
08:23 - wrote us a one-page essay on advances in
08:25 - human civilization
08:27 - but they can't code
08:30 - anything so
08:31 - I think it's a lot better for doing this
08:35 - anyway chat gbt did not work out the way
08:38 - I planned it to work out because I
08:40 - really expected it would do a little bit
08:42 - better than that but I guess you can't
08:44 - expect much from a robot
08:46 - humans are a lot smarter so anyway
08:49 - please like share subscribe and comment
08:52 - in the comment section below what else
08:54 - videos you want this is more of an
08:55 - entertainment video so if you like these
08:58 - type of videos you can tell us to make
08:59 - these type of entertainment
09:01 - um
09:02 - experimental videos rather than coding
09:05 - videos also um in the comment section
09:08 - below uh tell us if you've used chat gbt
09:11 - and tell us how you use it and what you
09:13 - used it for so anyways see you guys next
09:15 - time
