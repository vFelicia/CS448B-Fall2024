00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so
00:07 - welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground today we'll be
00:11 - finishing up
00:12 - the saving the turkey game so
00:15 - we'll be working on the coin and the
00:17 - baby turkey and the you win sprite today
00:20 - so before we move on i'm just gonna like
00:24 - um go through these two sprites the
00:25 - target and the bat we did in the last
00:27 - video
00:28 - so this is the code for the target and
00:31 - this is the code for the back
00:34 - so i'm gonna scroll up but slowly
00:42 - this
00:45 - and that
00:49 - okay so this is the bat code and today
00:52 - we're working on the coin so
00:53 - let's rename this right to coin
00:56 - and now we're going to work on the coin
00:58 - so let's uh remember we had the variable
01:00 - coin shot so we're going to finally use
01:02 - it right now
01:03 - so that's a detect if the coin's being
01:05 - shot so
01:06 - what the coin is supposed to do is like
01:08 - when you shoot the coin um
01:10 - it's supposed to give you points so
01:12 - we're gonna start
01:13 - in the coin by getting it when green
01:14 - flag is clicked we're gonna get a set
01:17 - the coin shot to zero
01:19 - and then after setting the coin shot to
01:21 - zero get a forever loop
01:24 - if the coin shot is equal to zero that
01:27 - means it's not being shot
01:29 - so queen shot right here queen
01:32 - shot is equal to zero we're going to go
01:35 - to random position
01:37 - and we're gonna switch the costume to
01:40 - pick random one to five
01:41 - since we have five costumes so let me
01:44 - show you real quick
01:45 - so right here one to five
01:48 - costumes we have the one one point coin
01:51 - the two points coin three points coin
01:55 - five points coin and eight points so
01:57 - these different coins can give you
01:59 - different values of score
02:00 - so um we're gonna make this swish
02:04 - costume one to five and then we're gonna
02:05 - show it
02:09 - and after that we're gonna wait two
02:10 - seconds before doing it again
02:12 - so wait two seconds for good measure
02:16 - and then after that we're gonna do
02:18 - something here so let's go to the top
02:20 - um so get a um broadcast message right
02:24 - here
02:24 - when i receive shot fire
02:27 - so this is when you shoot a bullet if
02:31 - the coin shot is equal to zero meaning
02:33 - it is not being shot yet
02:36 - so coin shot equal to zero
02:40 - coin shot right here and then and if
02:44 - if touching if
02:47 - touching mouse pointer
02:51 - and if mouse down
02:55 - if mouse down
02:58 - so if the mouse is on the coin plus
03:01 - clicking it then we will set the coin
03:04 - coin hit uh coin shot to one
03:08 - set the coin shot um
03:11 - coin shot to one i'm sorry not q
03:15 - one and after that you want to broadcast
03:18 - another message
03:19 - we're going to call it hit coin
03:22 - hit hit
03:26 - so and then after broadcasting the
03:28 - message we want to receive it right here
03:31 - so when i received coin hit coin
03:34 - then we're gonna um start a sound so i
03:37 - just got this
03:38 - just play the pop sound i guess start
03:41 - the sound pop
03:42 - hide then get an if-then statement so if
03:48 - the costume number is equal to one
03:51 - costume number is equal to one so
03:55 - costume number equals to one
03:58 - then we're gonna change the score by one
04:01 - we're going to change it to the
04:03 - appropriate uh costume so the
04:08 - um score what is it right here so score
04:11 - to one you can
04:12 - just duplicate this put it under here
04:15 - if the costume number is equal to 2
04:17 - we're going to change it
04:18 - we're going to change the score by the
04:20 - appropriate 2
04:21 - 2 score and then let's duplicate all of
04:24 - this again
04:26 - so okay so
04:29 - if the cost number is equal to three
04:32 - then we're going to change the score by
04:33 - three if the cost number is four
04:35 - we're going to change the score by four
04:37 - and then
04:38 - oh we don't have a four i think we have
04:40 - like a five so we have
04:42 - one two three and five so one two three
04:44 - five and eight
04:45 - so after the five we're going to
04:47 - duplicate this one last time to get the
04:49 - eight the costume number equals eight
04:53 - we're gonna change the score by eight
04:57 - so this is the code for the hit coin
05:00 - after that we want to broadcast another
05:02 - message
05:03 - we're gonna name it check the score
05:05 - check school
05:07 - let's name it check the score
05:10 - and after that we want to wait two
05:12 - seconds
05:14 - and then after that we want to broadcast
05:16 - another message called create coin again
05:18 - so you're gonna wait two seconds before
05:20 - creating a new coin create coin
05:24 - again create the coin again
05:27 - so this is the code for the hit coin and
05:29 - then we're gonna receive
05:31 - the message create coin again
05:35 - create coin again we're gonna set the
05:38 - coin
05:38 - shot to zero meaning it is not being
05:41 - shot at so
05:42 - coin shot to zero okay so now we are
05:46 - finished with the coin
05:49 - so now when you shoot the coin you'll
05:50 - get the appropriate score so
05:53 - as you can see i am getting score every
05:56 - time i'm shooting the point
06:00 - uh and shooting backs will still work so
06:02 - eight score as you can see i got eight
06:04 - score
06:04 - so yeah so the coins are working now so
06:08 - let's work on the um baby turkey now so
06:11 - let's go to the baby
06:13 - turkey spray so i'm gonna get one green
06:15 - flag clicked
06:17 - i'm gonna go i'm gonna zoom in a little
06:19 - bit i'm going to go to
06:21 - negative i'm going to go to 10
06:25 - 10 negative 85 that's what i did on my
06:29 - other project
06:30 - so we're going to wait two seconds
06:32 - before starting and then
06:34 - so this weight is like prevent the bat
06:37 - it's like
06:38 - let's say you shoot the bat and then
06:40 - it's dead already but it's going to hit
06:42 - the turkey
06:43 - we don't want it to take any damage so
06:45 - you don't lose any score
06:47 - so that's what we're going to do wait
06:48 - two seconds and then we're gonna put a
06:50 - forever loop
06:52 - if the bat shot we need to end
06:55 - so if the bat shot is equal to zero
06:59 - that shot equals to zero
07:03 - uh and touching that
07:06 - so if it's touching the bat and the bat
07:08 - is still alive
07:10 - then we won't broadcast the message
07:13 - we're
07:14 - touching back then we want to broadcast
07:17 - a message
07:17 - and wait wait until the action is
07:20 - finished that's why we need to wait so
07:21 - we're gonna
07:22 - broadcast turkey hit
07:26 - hit turkey i guess hit turkey and then
07:30 - right here we're going to get
07:31 - when green fly clicked again so that
07:33 - we're going to make the turkey glide
07:35 - around randomly so we're going to get a
07:37 - forever loop
07:38 - glide um we're going to keep that
07:42 - y y axis the same but we're gonna make
07:45 - it glide three seconds
07:47 - and we're gonna make it glide from
07:48 - negative 170 to 170 so pick random
07:52 - negative 170
07:56 - to 170. like that
07:59 - so next we want to uh receive the hit
08:02 - turkey so
08:04 - when i receive
08:05 - [Music]
08:07 - hit turkey then we're going to say
08:11 - ouch for like one second letting the
08:14 - player know
08:15 - the turkey is being hit so
08:19 - let's say after one second could get an
08:22 - if-else statement
08:24 - if the score is greater than three
08:29 - if the score is greater than three
08:33 - the score is greater than three we're
08:34 - going to change the score by negative
08:36 - three
08:38 - else we're gonna just set the score to
08:40 - zero
08:41 - because if you have less than um three
08:44 - points we don't wanna
08:45 - go negative points so that's why i'm
08:46 - going to just set the score
08:48 - to zero in the house
08:52 - set the score to zero and i'm gonna wait
08:54 - another two seconds
08:55 - down here okay
08:58 - so after you're finished with that let's
09:00 - work on the winning and losing
09:02 - so for the winning and losing let's go
09:04 - here gonna win green flag plates
09:09 - [Music]
09:11 - and we have two costumes one that says
09:13 - you win and the other one says you lose
09:16 - so let's see um so when let's go to
09:19 - events
09:21 - from the coin we have the check score we
09:23 - broadcast the check score here
09:25 - so we're gonna finally meet it right
09:26 - here so
09:28 - when i receive check score if
09:31 - the score is greater than or equal to 20
09:34 - so you only need
09:35 - 20 points to win so if the score
09:39 - is greater than equal to so variables
09:43 - score score score is
09:46 - greater than 20 or equal to 20
09:50 - exactly you want to switch the costume
09:53 - to the winning costume
09:56 - this one and then after that we're going
09:59 - to make it go to the front layer
10:02 - and then we're going gonna show it and
10:04 - then stop
10:05 - all just because they would okay so
10:10 - when i receive shot fire we're gonna
10:13 - go over here when i receive shot fired
10:16 - so like when you're shooting
10:17 - and if the bullet counter is equal to
10:20 - zero that means you ran out of bullets
10:24 - equal to zero so the bullet
10:27 - [Music]
10:29 - counter is equal to zero then we want to
10:30 - switch the costume to lose
10:32 - so once you lose all your bullets you
10:34 - will lose
10:35 - we're gonna make it go to the front
10:37 - layer
10:37 - [Music]
10:39 - and show and then
10:42 - go to control get a stop up okay so now
10:45 - we have the winning and losing
10:47 - okay and for these two
10:51 - we're just gonna add a little bit code
10:53 - so for this one
10:54 - the score we're gonna go to one green
10:57 - flat clicked we want to hide it
11:00 - we want to make it go backwards eight
11:02 - layers so it'll go behind
11:05 - the um the mouse pointer
11:09 - and everything so i'll just make your
11:12 - game look a bit more cleaner so go
11:14 - backwards eight layers eight layers
11:18 - and we want to show and same thing for
11:21 - the
11:21 - other one bullet thing just
11:25 - drag and drop this into here like that
11:27 - so now you have the two things
11:29 - okay so now let's play the game
11:34 - [Music]
11:35 - and when the bat touches it as you can
11:37 - see we lost some score
11:39 - okay see ouch and we lost all of our
11:41 - score
11:42 - [Music]
11:44 - see as you can see the game is working
11:47 - so i'm going to try to win right here
11:52 - as you can see it's not as easy as you
11:55 - would think
11:56 - because the bats keep on spawning right
11:58 - here
12:00 - it can be quite annoying we only have 9
12:03 - volts left
12:04 - now
12:05 - [Music]
12:08 - get these points okay as you can see
12:09 - when you get 20 score it says you win
12:12 - and right here we can actually set it to
12:15 - go to zero
12:15 - zero so then we'll stay in the center of
12:18 - the screen
12:19 - i forgot to do that so there you go
12:22 - um and let's say you just waste all your
12:24 - bullets
12:26 - so i'm just going to waste all the
12:27 - bullets real quick okay so i just wasted
12:30 - all my bullets so let's just watch the
12:31 - rest
12:32 - and they'll say you lose as you can see
12:34 - so yeah so that's pretty much
