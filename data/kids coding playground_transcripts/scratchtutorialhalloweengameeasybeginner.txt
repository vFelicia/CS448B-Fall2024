00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to the channel
00:08 - today we'll be making a Halloween game
00:11 - so I know it's not Halloween but this is
00:14 - still a very fun game to make so this is
00:18 - how the game should look like so in this
00:22 - Halloween game we'll be learning these
00:23 - fallen concepts and scratch using
00:26 - broadcast messages variables random
00:28 - operator clones and point and direction
00:32 - so I'll show you how the game plays so
00:40 - keys and you press the spacebar so when
00:57 - you get their life is zero you loose so
01:00 - without further ado let's start our
01:03 - project so let me go here so I imported
01:11 - the witch so this which is no longer
01:14 - available in 3.0 so you can use the
01:17 - substitute this is from 2.0 so first I
01:21 - need to leave the scratch cat and then
01:24 - this may be to all bean game so
01:32 - Halloween game so now we need to import
01:35 - all our sprites in a bathroom so our
01:37 - backdrop will pick like maybe the wood
01:39 - spectrum that one looks the best for
01:42 - this theme the woods
01:44 - yeah and then we can add some sprites we
01:53 - need the ball sprite that can act like
01:55 - the fireball we'll need the ghost break
02:04 - I can use this ghost um we need the bat
02:14 - sprite get out of that so this is all we
02:22 - need
02:23 - oh yeah and can enter lady bucks right
02:27 - that's like an alien do they still have
02:31 - it I'm not sure if they have it yeah
02:35 - yeah they still have it okay so with
02:41 - which ball we can renew justifier ghost
02:46 - bat and lady book okay
02:48 - so first we'll start out the code for
02:50 - the backdrop we can do when clicked
02:53 - forever
02:56 - change color effect by one you'll make
03:01 - I'll give the the spooky appearance to
03:03 - the game as you can see when you play it
03:06 - background will change color making it a
03:09 - little cool but you don't want to do 25
03:12 - or anything that's a big number because
03:15 - the blinking will make it not look great
03:17 - so I suggest you stick with the change
03:21 - color effects by one so now since we're
03:27 - done with that let's move on to the
03:28 - fireball sprite so when clicked you want
03:31 - to set the size to 20% because you want
03:35 - a small fireball so set size to 20 so
03:47 - next we'll hide let me drag a one
03:56 - clicked forever forever loop forever
04:03 - loop so we'll need it if then space so
04:06 - it will activate the fireball shooting
04:09 - out so if then key space pressed then
04:14 - create cloning myself that means you'll
04:15 - make a duplicate of itself
04:19 - so we need to wait until wait until not
04:23 - keep key space for us so then they can
04:27 - trap in rapid shoot so let's say if I
04:30 - take this out let's say later if I take
04:34 - this out then that means um this will a
04:39 - rapid shoot and it will not have no
04:41 - pause so if I add this not key space
04:46 - pressed next we all need to move on to
04:52 - the start as a clone part okay so for
04:57 - all clones this is the code for the
04:58 - clones so you need to get this block
05:00 - when I start as a clone you'll go to the
05:03 - which the which go to the which point in
05:16 - direction pointing direction point get
05:28 - the sensing and you need the direction
05:31 - of the witch so you want to click this
05:33 - one first this one first so you can get
05:37 - the which direction not the witch so it
05:41 - will go to the direction of the which
05:43 - will move 50 steps so move out a little
05:47 - bit show so we'll need a repeat until
06:00 - repeat until it's touching the edge so
06:03 - it will hide so repeat until touching it
06:13 - then move ten steps to move out and then
06:19 - we'll delete the clip so the clone will
06:21 - disappear so this is the code for the
06:24 - fireball so before we can keep on
06:29 - continuing to the bat
06:30 - actually I want to see a demo of how it
06:33 - works right now
06:34 - so the fireball will keep on moving ten
06:37 - steps until it's touching the edge as
06:39 - you can see and this wait until not
06:42 - keypress makes it so you cannot
06:44 - rapid-fire so if I take this out you can
06:47 - rapid-fire as you can see see so now
06:52 - let's move on to the back okay so for
06:57 - the bat we want a one clicked one flag
07:00 - clicked
07:03 - we need a win flag click block drag it
07:07 - then
07:09 - then we'll need a for every drag forever
07:14 - okay go to a random position so it will
07:18 - appear anywhere so you need an if-then
07:21 - statement if then x position is less
07:26 - than zero that means somewhere on the
07:28 - left side x position is less than zero x
07:34 - position then set X to pick random 0 to
07:43 - 200 so be somewhere around here set X to
07:50 - pick random or okay pick random 0 to 200
08:02 - this part is so it will generate
08:05 - somewhere on the right side so it won't
08:08 - be touching the wish that's fun
08:11 - so then next we'll need a show then we
08:21 - near repeat 15 repeat repeat loop so
08:26 - maybe 15 15 times next costume so make
08:32 - it look like it's flapping its wings and
08:34 - we don't need this one and we don't need
08:37 - this one we only need these two so make
08:41 - it look like it's flapping its wings
08:43 - so next costume and weight to 0.1
08:46 - seconds so it won't be flapping very
08:48 - fast so next we'll need an if-then
08:57 - statement
09:06 - so if then touching fireball oops
09:18 - fireball then place on pop until done we
09:25 - half the topic No then we have to choose
09:28 - it pop pops leave the pop until done oh
09:43 - yeah and we'll need a score variable so
09:46 - let's make it their variables we need a
09:48 - life and score we have it as you can see
09:51 - so we'll need to be change to score by
09:55 - one and hide once it's hit then we'll
10:05 - need the another density then we need a
10:13 - touch of which so if the best touching
10:15 - the wish hi we needed to go to another
10:22 - random position then we can broadcast a
10:29 - message called lose a lot
10:38 - so lose life okay so then we'll need a
10:46 - hide down here okay me zoom out so you
10:52 - can see the whole chunk of code so now
10:56 - as you can see the bat is generating and
10:58 - random areas every few seconds and if I
11:03 - hit it this way until it comes down here
11:06 - if I hit it it will disappear and play
11:08 - the pops up okay next we'll need to go
11:13 - to the ghost that goes through so when
11:18 - your one clicked set rotation style -
11:23 - left and right so it will not flip
11:27 - upside down hide will need a forever
11:32 - loop so everything inside here we're
11:35 - building forever until the stop button
11:37 - is pressed we need to wait wait one
11:41 - second book will need to use a pick
11:43 - random operator three to five seconds so
11:45 - they'll generate a clone in that time
11:50 - range so create a clone of myself and
11:58 - then you also need to when it receives
12:01 - to lose a life then delete this clone so
12:05 - if it touches it it'll make which was a
12:09 - life but I'll also disappear okay when
12:14 - it starts as a clone we zoom in when it
12:18 - starts as a clone you want to point in
12:20 - direction of ninety point in direction
12:25 - of ninety go to a random position so go
12:29 - somewhere random set X to 240 so it be
12:34 - somewhere up here somewhere right here
12:38 - to the right so I won't hit the ghost I
12:42 - mean the witch sorry
12:45 - let's spawn it we show show point
12:52 - direction of the witch so we'll follow
12:54 - this one is kind of like a homing
12:56 - they'll follow the witch put towards
13:02 - which so next we'll need to repeat until
13:08 - repeat until it's touching the witch so
13:19 - it'll move ten steps and at the speed of
13:22 - ten steps towards the witch so then
13:26 - we'll need a weight zero point three
13:27 - seconds to give a little delay every
13:30 - time so it'll be a bit slower zero point
13:34 - three then we'll need it if then
13:39 - statement so if it's touching the
13:46 - fireball then we will if it's touching
13:56 - the fireball then we will play the sound
13:59 - pop until it's on you know pop so when
14:03 - you get this air you don't need this
14:11 - okay code place on pop until done we
14:16 - need to change the score by one when you
14:22 - kill it with the fireball and don't
14:25 - delete the clone then finally we need
14:30 - one more if then statement and this one
14:37 - we'll need an and in an operator so what
14:44 - this basically means is if the x
14:46 - position x position is less than
14:53 - negative 240 i mean it's less than
14:56 - negative 240 92 for
14:57 - so we're here then negative 240 and
15:01 - touching edge touching the edge of the
15:07 - map then you'll delete the clone so if
15:16 - it's touching the edge at spawn it will
15:18 - delete this clone and if it's less than
15:22 - this exposition name 240 then it will
15:25 - also delete the clip so when you know we
15:28 - no need to broadcast illusive life
15:32 - forecast lose the life and delete this
15:36 - clip okay so let's move on to the witch
15:43 - code now okay so now we're gonna move on
15:47 - to the witch so for the witch code we
15:53 - will need to do it when clicked this is
15:58 - the movement area so for every new
16:01 - forever loop we need for if-then
16:04 - statements and you need upward sensors
16:21 - sensing so we need a key Takia up arrow
16:28 - is pressed then change the Y by 10 I
16:32 - guess and if the down arrow is pressed
16:39 - the bottom arrow and then change Y by
16:43 - negative 10 negative okay next we'll
16:50 - need a the left and right arrow keys so
16:53 - let's do the right right here for the
16:59 - right arrow will change the X by 10
17:06 - next we'll need the left arrow instead
17:09 - of 10
17:10 - we need to change it by negative 10 as
17:13 - the left arrow so change X by negative
17:19 - 10 negative 10 negative 10 so now with
17:28 - the movement so we need to receive the
17:31 - when I lose a life thing when I lose a
17:35 - life then change the life by negative
17:38 - one and I'm gonna start this on screech
17:44 - I think we have it in here yes
17:48 - so and then we need if-then statement so
17:53 - we need an or operator so what this code
17:57 - means is if the life is less than or
18:02 - equal to zero so the life is less than
18:06 - or equal to zero
18:08 - life is less than or equal to zero then
18:14 - I'll stop all let me so I end the game
18:16 - pretty simple and then finally we need
18:19 - to if blacklick set the score it's a
18:26 - zero in the beginning set the life to
18:30 - five so you get five lives in the
18:32 - beginning and for a builder you can do
18:37 - play the sound cave until done so get a
18:41 - little music in the game it sounds wait
18:46 - we already have cave okay
18:48 - please have cave tilta okay so now we
18:56 - are done with everything except for the
18:57 - ladybug finally we have the ladybug code
19:00 - then click we wanted to go to a random
19:03 - position it will set X to 240
19:13 - two-forty is somewhere right here and
19:18 - then we'll need a one clicked and
19:20 - plucked legs zoomin and flag clicked so
19:26 - we get forever loop so in the beginning
19:32 - change X by negative five so leave this
19:36 - way no move continuously this way so
19:41 - change X by negative 5 so negative 5 so
19:49 - we need to extend statement if then the
19:54 - x position is less than negative 240
19:57 - just like that ghosts so if it's less
20:01 - than is negative 240 and it will go to a
20:08 - random position after so first let's put
20:11 - the X negative 240 then go to random
20:17 - position set X to 240 so go back to
20:22 - right here somewhere the x position to
20:29 - 40 so next we'll need another if-then
20:33 - statement if it's touching the fireball
20:41 - will you get to play the pop sound so I
20:44 - don't know if we have it yeah we do okay
20:46 - so we'll play the pop sound until dawn
20:48 - change score by one so change the score
20:52 - by one chase where by one hide we'll
20:59 - need to hide hide it once it's hit okay
21:04 - so you go to another random position go
21:09 - to another random position set to X 2 2
21:14 - 4 D so 240 set it in the wait two
21:19 - seconds you'll get a little delay
21:24 - so then we'll need another fine
21:28 - statement
21:31 - so if then touching the which if it's
21:39 - touching the which we you know so if
21:45 - it's touching the which then you want it
21:47 - to hide
21:49 - obviously touching which sensing
21:55 - touching which and go to her in a
22:01 - position like the other sprites set the
22:09 - X to 240 so we'll be somewhere right
22:12 - here right there
22:14 - 240 broadcasting his life
22:21 - wait two seconds give it a little delay
22:26 - so now we are finished let's try it out
22:33 - we have an effort on the show the period
22:39 - shut these two variables so you can see
22:42 - them okay stop it
22:46 - [Music]
22:48 - the game is pretty well-functioning
22:53 - background makes it a very good scenery
22:57 - like a very eerie beam I guess okay so
23:05 - that concludes our video for today thank
