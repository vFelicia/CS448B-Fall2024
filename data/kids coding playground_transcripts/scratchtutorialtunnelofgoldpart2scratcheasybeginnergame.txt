00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hey guys welcome back to part two of
00:08 - tunnel of gold
00:10 - so today we'll be working on the beetle
00:14 - so um we can just
00:17 - um put this thing in
00:20 - the if green flag is clicked
00:24 - it will set gigging to
00:28 - n which means no so go to front layer
00:36 - i'll set size to 50 because i think the
00:38 - beetle is honestly way too
00:39 - big um a point in direction 90
00:46 - and it'll go to this position
00:51 - so that's just part of the beetle code
00:55 - there's still a lot to go
00:58 - so bl code so
01:01 - you also have to do so we have to do the
01:05 - movement for the beetle
01:06 - so if when i receive start game
01:10 - it'll go forever
01:15 - and go forever
01:22 - go forever in an if then statement
01:31 - the key up
01:34 - arrow is pressed it'll go up
01:39 - so it's going to point in direction zero
01:42 - which is up
01:47 - and i'll go to the next we don't have a
01:50 - costume right now
01:52 - but you can draw one if you want to so
01:55 - if
01:55 - so if you wanted a costume i'll show you
01:58 - how to draw one
01:59 - you just duplicate the next costume you
02:01 - can just move its
02:02 - legs a little bit you know that stuff
02:05 - like turn it a little bit like all his
02:07 - legs
02:07 - not all of them but just some of them
02:10 - just move them
02:14 - just turn them a little bit
02:22 - so yeah right now i'm turning them
02:30 - and then you can um
02:34 - keep on working on so you can also do
02:36 - next costume
02:39 - um move 10 steps
02:43 - and wait 0.1 seconds
02:50 - i will i'm not put 2.01 seconds yet
02:54 - i'll show you what's going on
02:56 - [Music]
03:01 - i'll finish the up arrow down here or
03:03 - everything and then i'll show you
03:05 - so that's so wait 0.1 seconds
03:15 - let's actually take this out because i'm
03:16 - going to show you later and we can just
03:18 - duplicate this it's simple
03:20 - um do the down arrow instead
03:25 - um and set a point in direction 180
03:28 - which is
03:29 - pointing to the bottom if you didn't
03:30 - know um
03:33 - i'll go next costume same thing and then
03:35 - weigh 0.1 seconds but we're not doing
03:37 - that yet
03:38 - and then we can also code the next one
03:40 - it's a bit different because it's for
03:42 - um right and left arrow key so
03:46 - let's change this to right arrow
03:49 - i'll point in direction 90 next costume
03:53 - move 10 steps
03:54 - that's it and we can do this again
04:00 - then we can do the left arrow and there
04:02 - you go
04:03 - so this is also not point ninety
04:07 - point negative ninety so that's
04:12 - it's pointing to the left i'm gonna demo
04:15 - it for you
04:16 - as you can see we can like walk through
04:19 - like everything
04:20 - and that's not good that's not how it's
04:23 - supposed to go
04:24 - it's it's because you can just hold down
04:26 - the arrow key and you just
04:28 - go through everything so you need the
04:31 - point 0.1 second
04:39 - so i'm gonna work on another type of
04:42 - code first
04:43 - before i do that and then when i receive
04:46 - start game
04:49 - it will
04:52 - it'll go forever this will prevent the
04:56 - bugs
04:57 - for from moving out of the light area so
05:00 - we can do that down here
05:01 - um if
05:05 - and then you need a if then statement
05:22 - and
05:24 - so we can put this like that
05:30 - so we'll go to a sensing
05:33 - touching
05:37 - if then punching
05:42 - rocks and you need the touching collar
05:45 - one
05:46 - you can go see if that's the right color
05:48 - first
05:51 - eyedropper that color so i think that
05:54 - was a little bit different
05:56 - and then we can also use
05:59 - and then equal sign
06:04 - digging equals
06:07 - n that means no so you can't dig
06:11 - when you're um
06:18 - when you're um doing that so you just
06:22 - move that
06:23 - right there and then
06:26 - you need another thin steep
06:32 - if then equals
06:39 - this is the direction of the bug so
06:42 - direction
06:45 - equals 90 which is right side
06:48 - and then he'll change x
06:51 - by minus five so go back
07:07 - so you can also do the left side
07:11 - it will change x by five
07:15 - and then you're not gonna do um
07:19 - uh down
07:22 - you know but instead it's changed y
07:25 - so we can to zero which is
07:29 - pointing to the top and
07:32 - instead of change x it's change y
07:36 - by minus five
07:42 - just put this inside but then this one
07:50 - put that right there actually um
07:53 - and then we put that to 180
08:01 - change y by five
08:06 - and then possibly if then statement
08:11 - that's under all of this under all of
08:13 - this
08:15 - ill and touching the gold color
08:23 - it's gold color that means it'll
08:25 - broadcast
08:27 - a new message called
08:31 - you win
08:38 - and then beetle we're still working on
08:40 - the beetle
08:41 - and then when i receive
08:44 - you win say
08:48 - stop other scripts in sprite
08:54 - you'll say i got the gold
09:03 - two seconds and i'll stop all
09:08 - so we can add the a digging
09:12 - so when
09:16 - d is pressed so where's that when
09:20 - key d is pressed
09:24 - stop other scripts in this fight i i
09:27 - mean
09:27 - um digging set digging
09:32 - to why
09:35 - broadcast
09:43 - broadcast and wait a new message
09:46 - called dig
09:50 - and then set
09:53 - digging to end
10:02 - after done digging and set it back to
10:04 - end now we're going to the digging
10:05 - sprite we'll work on this later
10:07 - we'll add that later so the dig spray
10:11 - so you don't have any code actually we
10:13 - do have a little bit code in here
10:15 - so when i receive
10:18 - dig the point in direction
10:24 - direction of the beetle
10:30 - you also have to change the back first
10:33 - the direction of the bead
10:36 - and then it'll move 20 steps
10:44 - so i'll dig in the where the beetle is
10:48 - stamp
10:52 - and then when i receive you win
10:57 - then stop other strips in this spring
11:04 - as you can see i'm using this to do it
11:07 - and then you can dig
11:10 - it's bringing it upside down and you got
11:13 - the gold and let's see if the rocks work
11:15 - so as you can see they're digging to end
11:20 - so so i'm gonna also add the
11:23 - stuff other scripts in this uh sprite
11:26 - into the gold so the timer will stop
11:28 - is it there
11:33 - why is it not going in there probably
11:35 - somewhere
11:37 - there it is there's two of them so there
11:40 - we go
11:40 - um and then um
11:45 - i'll show you the book as you see if you
11:47 - can if you hold the thing
11:49 - it'll let you go through the um the dirt
11:52 - so you need to wait 0.1 seconds
11:58 - right here
12:13 - so i'm just gonna do that
12:22 - so i'm gonna try it as you can see you
12:24 - can't i'm holding it right now
12:27 - um and you cannot go through you can dig
12:30 - too
12:30 - see and then the rocks block you from
12:34 - exiting right now
12:36 - and then you got the gold and the timer
12:39 - will stop
12:39 - so i got i took me 12 seconds to beat
12:42 - this game
12:43 - so anyways um please like
