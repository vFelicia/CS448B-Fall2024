00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello guys welcome back to kids cooling
00:10 - playground
00:10 - so uh yesterday we did our first
00:14 - platformer for the uh among us so uh
00:17 - please
00:18 - like uh share subscribe to our channel
00:20 - and give us a thumbs up on the video
00:22 - uh so far we already have two thumbs
00:24 - down on the video
00:25 - not sure why so please guys if you enjoy
00:28 - this video give us a thumbs up on all
00:30 - the
00:31 - all our video so that was a great way to
00:34 - support us
00:35 - okay all right so let's get to it
00:38 - so this is what we have for the code for
00:40 - the main character yesterday
00:42 - so you uh miss anything kind of stop
00:44 - here and then um
00:45 - uh get it down uh what we can do is um
00:48 - probably put all the uh custom block on
00:50 - the left and then go on the right or
00:52 - whatever you guys like
00:53 - you can do that so i did not give out
00:55 - the main character yesterday the sprite
00:57 - is pretty easy to draw just just
00:59 - black box right so then you guys did
01:02 - that already
01:03 - and then we have this one uh let's put
01:05 - this idle costume on the last one
01:08 - for here and set in the first because we
01:10 - are going to use it to run
01:12 - so we're going to make it in the last
01:14 - costume okay put it in the end
01:16 - 13 okay all right so for now
01:19 - let's get to it
01:22 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
01:24 - going to create some platform
01:26 - for the game so that's that way you guys
01:28 - can start learning it
01:30 - i think everybody really liked the
01:31 - platform uh so
01:33 - i can upload the backpack here but i'm
01:35 - going to show you guys how to do that
01:38 - okay so platform i will provide some of
01:40 - the platform sprite for you guys and
01:42 - then you guys can change it the way you
01:44 - like
01:44 - so let's say this is our first one uh
01:47 - let's
01:47 - just do something simple for now uh
01:51 - so let's let's just remove all
01:54 - these guys for right now okay uh we
01:57 - don't need any
01:59 - maybe one of these okay okay let's have
02:01 - first three
02:02 - first floor okay i think that's good
02:04 - should be good enough
02:05 - so we trash only the other one
02:09 - okay so we're the first four we're gonna
02:11 - even delete this
02:13 - just like that so
02:16 - i'm gonna provide the sprite for the
02:19 - first
02:19 - four level and then you guys can change
02:21 - it the way you want
02:22 - so these are just blocks right make sure
02:25 - that when you are
02:26 - creating the block let's say you need to
02:28 - make a new platform
02:30 - but you can take this base one take all
02:32 - this copy it
02:34 - make a ping a new sprite and then put in
02:36 - the bottom
02:37 - and then what you can do is uh you can
02:40 - say uh
02:40 - ungroup all this and let's say you want
02:43 - to just take this box out
02:45 - so make that as group okay it's already
02:48 - grouped
02:48 - okay copy that you can move them on top
02:51 - let's say you want to put another box
02:53 - here
02:53 - right so you can do that or you can put
02:56 - another box here
02:57 - which you can do that so you can have
02:59 - like multiple box right for the for the
03:01 - sprite to jump up
03:04 - okay as you guys can see we created two
03:06 - little box here
03:07 - it's pretty easy so um i already did
03:10 - most of the hard work here while
03:11 - creating those uh image for you
03:13 - and you can just take it and then just
03:15 - kind of mix and match it like you know
03:18 - you have the
03:19 - rectangular box you have the bowl like
03:22 - the laser
03:23 - so something similar to like that you
03:25 - can however design your screen
03:27 - you know you can have upper
03:30 - top or lower top i mean upper here you
03:33 - have something on the top
03:34 - you can have something on the bottom and
03:36 - make some gap here so that you know it
03:38 - can fall off and die
03:39 - so this is kind of how it looks like and
03:42 - you know just different thing that you
03:43 - can put
03:44 - and if you want something on the top you
03:46 - can say like this
03:48 - copy this control paste uh
03:51 - group them all make sure you cook them
03:53 - all and then you can just flip it
03:55 - and then you can have it on the top so
03:56 - you can set it like here
03:59 - something like this like that
04:02 - so you can delete that you know anything
04:04 - you like right so this is like a
04:07 - a stage like this now you can have boxes
04:09 - here
04:10 - you know stack another one or you can
04:13 - put
04:14 - one of these right
04:18 - on here you can put them like this for
04:21 - them to jump on
04:23 - and if you want to add a laser you can
04:25 - add this guy
04:28 - so this is my laser well you can add it
04:31 - over here
04:32 - let's say you wanna the laser coming
04:34 - down here
04:36 - right and this bottom you want the
04:38 - different laser
04:39 - side and you want something else here
04:43 - or you can move these two blocks and
04:46 - group this
04:48 - and group you can delete these
04:54 - and then you can put the laser on top
04:56 - oops
04:59 - so however you want to do okay and then
05:02 - you can like
05:03 - take one of these from the bottom here
05:07 - and you can put it here somewhere like
05:10 - this right so you have a laser coming
05:11 - down something like that
05:12 - okay okay now let's go back to the code
05:17 - color variable uh we are going to add
05:20 - more variable to this
05:21 - um you can say um what else
05:25 - what do we have okay player dead and
05:26 - then speed right we have that
05:28 - uh you can say uh
05:32 - global variable so we can put them all
05:34 - having a g in the front
05:36 - is good so that we can have everything
05:38 - together
05:39 - uh this is the velocity okay
05:43 - uh for all the sprite
05:46 - okay pick another variable
05:50 - on ground so this will test if the
05:53 - sprite is on the ground
05:56 - and we're gonna make another variable
05:59 - uh gravity
06:03 - so we're gonna use a variable we can
06:05 - change it later you know how
06:07 - fast or whatever you need or you can you
06:09 - don't need it
06:10 - to do that also that would be fine but
06:12 - for now we just use this gravity
06:14 - okay and let's make one more
06:17 - call jumping so this one is not a global
06:21 - variable i did not put a g in the front
06:23 - make sure you select for the sprite only
06:27 - okay all right let's go back to our main
06:31 - character
06:32 - we have the reset here so what we're
06:34 - going to do is we're going to reset some
06:36 - of these variables
06:37 - that we just created so that you know
06:40 - when the game start you know we can
06:42 - make sure we're going to reset it so
06:44 - this reset the velocity to zero
06:49 - i'll reset the underground to zero
06:53 - [Music]
06:55 - reset the gravity let's gravity gravity
07:00 - okay we're gonna do negative one for
07:01 - grab
07:04 - and then we'll have one more
07:08 - oh i should then decrease this guy i
07:11 - accidentally created jump on the ground
07:13 - okay delete that sorry about that delete
07:16 - this guy
07:16 - let's go back to the main character okay
07:19 - i'll create over here my mistake i think
07:23 - i forgot when i was creating the
07:24 - variable when i was playing with the
07:26 - platform and i forgot about that so
07:28 - great jumping
07:29 - uh variable on this this sprite only for
07:32 - the for the main character not the
07:33 - ground
07:34 - okay uh you say jumping
07:37 - we'll set this to zero
07:42 - okay all right let me uh
07:45 - take out all these we'll keep this i
07:48 - guess we can
07:49 - yes we can take it out or leave it but
07:52 - let's just take it out a little more
07:53 - space on the screen to see
07:56 - i will leave this on and this is on okay
07:59 - so we are going to
08:00 - take a look at this okay
08:04 - all right so we'll make the main sprite
08:06 - jump as well
08:08 - and walk so uh what we're going to do is
08:11 - create another block
08:14 - called jump control
08:17 - and make this run without screen refresh
08:20 - okay all right so we'll put this over
08:24 - here we'll put this on top here so the
08:27 - move controls here
08:28 - jump controls here okay so for the jump
08:31 - control what we're going to do is
08:34 - we're going to put the if statement here
08:38 - and then we're using sensing block
08:42 - okay uh if up arrows press
08:46 - so we are going to check if the player
08:48 - is on the ground or not
08:49 - um and if it's jump so we need to have a
08:54 - another if condition inside here
08:58 - okay so let's put this in here
09:02 - and then we're going to get the n
09:03 - operator
09:05 - put that here well you guys can see
09:09 - okay and then we're gonna say
09:13 - [Music]
09:15 - so on the ground we'll call it greater
09:17 - than zero so we'll use
09:18 - one z zero for the ground testing it
09:21 - okay we're just gonna say
09:23 - if the on the ground
09:26 - is greater than zero and
09:32 - it's jumping where's the jumping
09:36 - okay we're gonna use the variable
09:38 - jumping
09:40 - if it's equal to zero so this
09:43 - uh is on the ground and then it's uh
09:45 - it's jumping is zero that means not
09:47 - jumping then you can jump
09:49 - so what we're going to do is we're going
09:50 - to set
09:53 - so set
09:58 - so we're going to set the on the ground
10:01 - to zero
10:02 - because it's not on the ground anymore
10:05 - and we are going to set the
10:07 - jump to one that means it's jumping
10:12 - and we're going to set the gravity
10:14 - [Music]
10:17 - g velocity i'm gonna set it 15 to 15
10:21 - height you'll jump
10:22 - okay okay so we're gonna have to call
10:25 - this jump block over here in the all
10:27 - control
10:29 - have this away after the movement the
10:31 - jump block
10:33 - and we are going to change out this a
10:36 - little bit
10:40 - so we will say if
10:43 - and else okay we're going to check the
10:46 - arrow
10:48 - key again here
10:51 - if the up arrows press
10:57 - we're going to say change
11:00 - uh the velocity by the gravity so the
11:03 - gravity right now is negative
11:05 - one that we set up here right here
11:08 - on top okay so else
11:12 - we'll change it to two so we're gonna
11:15 - use a multiply
11:17 - so we can use the operator multiply
11:20 - the g gravity by two so it will be
11:22 - either negative one or negative two
11:24 - so it's jumping up then it's one
11:26 - negative one falling down
11:28 - if it's jumping on uh it's on the top
11:30 - falling down with big of negative two so
11:32 - it's faster you're
11:33 - falling down from the top okay all right
11:36 - and then you're gonna have to change the
11:38 - y so you change the y by the
11:43 - velocity that we're just uh changing
11:45 - right so like this
11:48 - okay so let me test it so you can see so
11:51 - when i run this it will kind of fall
11:53 - down and then we'll just follow the way
11:54 - down
11:55 - because we're not blocking it so if you
11:57 - see you see here
11:58 - it's falling down it's falling all the
12:00 - way down so what we want to do is we are
12:03 - going to um
12:05 - make him stay on the top here on the
12:07 - platform okay
12:08 - all right we'll save the project go back
12:10 - to the main character let's put this
12:12 - down
12:14 - okay so we will create another block to
12:16 - fix this
12:18 - so call this uh check
12:21 - hit ground
12:24 - okay so we're gonna have to create this
12:26 - boolean variable
12:28 - called is jumping and then click on this
12:32 - run without refresh okay make sure you
12:35 - have that
12:36 - and we are going to create it over here
12:38 - in the bottom here
12:40 - or maybe over here
12:44 - okay so we're going to use a repeat
12:45 - until loop here
12:48 - we're going to use a not operator
12:52 - now we're going to check if it's not
12:54 - touching the ground
12:56 - okay which is this right here
13:01 - and we have to check one more thing
13:05 - we'll do if and else
13:08 - and we're gonna drag this over here
13:12 - what we're going to do is uh changing
13:14 - the x
13:15 - on the y i mean change y
13:20 - change y y minus one
13:24 - okay and then
13:28 - okay so we're gonna set this variable
13:32 - [Music]
13:33 - so set the key velocity
13:38 - okay to zero here and then the else
13:41 - block
13:42 - will duplicate this and then we'll put
13:44 - one here
13:46 - sorry let me stop that accidentally do
13:49 - that
13:50 - and then we're going to say set the uh
13:54 - on the ground to one so when we touch
13:56 - the ground we'll set it to one
14:00 - and then we need another if condition
14:02 - inside here
14:06 - and then operator and check if it's
14:09 - jumping
14:10 - so we get this jump variable here
14:14 - and equal to one that means it's jumping
14:16 - then we'll set
14:19 - this back to zero
14:23 - okay okay so we're to call this new
14:26 - function that we
14:27 - just made so put it under this
14:30 - checkpoint
14:31 - from detection here and what we're going
14:34 - to do is we're going to use the operator
14:37 - using this we say if the velocity
14:41 - is greater than zero we're gonna call it
14:45 - okay okay so let me test it out
14:49 - so i think i see i start here right
14:52 - so let me go back over here and stop so
14:55 - it drops down see
14:56 - just it stays there so as you can see
14:59 - you can move it you see this kind of
15:00 - slides up
15:01 - to this we're gonna fix that actually so
15:04 - this is not good right we don't want
15:05 - this
15:05 - happening so jumping is good we have no
15:08 - animation yet
15:10 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
15:13 - going to do something here to fix that
15:16 - okay so let's go back to the hitbox okay
15:19 - stop this
15:21 - okay so we're going to move this over
15:23 - here actually we're going to call
15:24 - something for this guy
15:28 - or maybe i'll move this over here so
15:31 - that i can
15:33 - have some more coal later on for this
15:36 - put this back here okay so all my red
15:38 - custom block i put
15:40 - on the right side right except this one
15:43 - i guess this one's on the left but it's
15:45 - okay
15:45 - all right so let's continue this so
15:48 - we'll fix this part here
15:50 - um so we are going to create another
15:53 - variable
15:55 - okay so we're going to create a new
15:57 - variable actually
15:58 - make it called
16:00 - [Music]
16:02 - deviation so we're going to check some
16:06 - deviation of the sprite and the and the
16:09 - platform
16:10 - okay okay for this one
16:13 - make sure that you select for this
16:15 - bright only since we don't have a
16:16 - a g in the front right so this is a for
16:19 - this sprite only for the main character
16:21 - sprite
16:22 - okay so let's set this guy here
16:26 - set deviation to zero
16:30 - and then we're gonna use a repeat until
16:33 - [Music]
16:34 - here and we are going to be using
16:38 - operator
16:39 - nut or
16:42 - not not or and then we're going to use a
16:45 - knot here
16:48 - and then we're going to use the equal
16:49 - here okay let's
16:51 - zoom this in a little bit okay we're
16:54 - going to check this
16:55 - variable that we just created deviation
16:58 - we can open it up i guess you can see it
17:01 - okay we'll check this equal to let's say
17:03 - five or something doesn't matter
17:04 - just some number of deviation here we're
17:06 - gonna check
17:08 - and then you're gonna check this one um
17:11 - touching ground so it is not
17:14 - or the using the firewall not touching
17:17 - the ground
17:18 - so what we're going to do is we're going
17:21 - to change the y
17:24 - by one all right
17:28 - and then we say change variable
17:33 - change division by one also okay all
17:35 - right so so far this is what we have
17:38 - and then we need another if statement
17:40 - under this so if this
17:41 - is done will come out it will run this
17:44 - code below
17:46 - uh what we're going to put an equal here
17:49 - uh duplicate this put this over here go
17:52 - to
17:53 - 5 and then what we want to do is
17:58 - say change change x
18:03 - i'm going to use an operator and change
18:05 - y let's get both of them
18:08 - then we'll go back to the here we're
18:10 - going to get the minus
18:13 - operator and duplicate this again
18:17 - the minus here so we're gonna use a zero
18:21 - so minus the x speed
18:25 - and put zero here and minus that
18:28 - deviation
18:30 - okay so let's see if it's going to work
18:33 - so let me try it out
18:35 - okay so let's try this out
18:39 - okay so as you can see i can move this
18:42 - sprite
18:43 - jump and you see it doesn't fall through
18:46 - the
18:46 - lot like last time so it doesn't fall
18:49 - through right
18:49 - so it's pretty good pretty good so this
18:52 - is
18:54 - good okay
18:56 - so i think we'll stop here right now uh
18:58 - let me zoom out the code make sure you
19:00 - guys got all the code
19:02 - okay so let's go from the this side
19:07 - so you have the uh start here and then
19:09 - there's custom block here
19:11 - so this is the forever loop running this
19:14 - is the main one that calls other uh
19:16 - code and then these are all the other
19:19 - custom
19:20 - block that we have okay
19:23 - that's the jump control we work on today
19:25 - the check box the
19:27 - check the ground they will hit the
19:29 - ground the movement
19:31 - okay so this is all we have for this
19:34 - and this one is the same we don't have
19:36 - any code yet for this
19:38 - one so next next um
19:41 - video we're gonna make the among us uh
19:45 - animated character to move along with
19:48 - this box so that it looks better
19:49 - so as of right now you know it just
19:51 - cannot move like this
19:53 - you can jump so it looks okay
19:56 - so far like a square right if you're
19:58 - using a square
20:00 - uh and uh not moving then this is fine
20:02 - so you see this
20:03 - it's good it's not moving to the top
20:06 - it's great
20:07 - okay all right this is where we're gonna
20:09 - stop here so i hope you guys like this
20:11 - video
