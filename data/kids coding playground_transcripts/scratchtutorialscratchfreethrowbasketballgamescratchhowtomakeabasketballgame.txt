00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:11 - another video
00:12 - on scratch and today we'll be making
00:14 - another face sensing game
00:15 - called free throw basketball and i'll be
00:18 - wearing the same demon mask
00:20 - so if you do not enjoy demon masks
00:22 - please do not watch the video while i do
00:24 - it i don't know why but okay so
00:26 - anyways i'm gonna show you the demo so
00:28 - i'm not going to start it yet because my
00:30 - face i get give me the mask
00:40 - i got the face mask on
00:44 - not the face mask the demon mask
00:50 - oh my demon mask
00:55 - in a basketball hoop and you try to get
00:56 - the basketball to touch the
00:59 - uh
01:02 - so you can use your hands and everything
01:04 - so swing the basketball and
01:07 - make it move i can also use my head
01:24 - you can do
01:31 - [Music]
01:42 - [Music]
01:52 - okay
02:00 - okay so we're back like this and um i
02:03 - just took off my d-wind mask
02:05 - and we are going to start coding so
02:10 - so i were back and um i'm going to turn
02:13 - on the
02:13 - face sensing so yeah uh
02:17 - the face sensing i'm trying to put on my
02:20 - mask
02:21 - but don't don't don't turn it on yet so
02:23 - uh
02:24 - if you click on it it'll just show your
02:26 - face and then i put on my mask right now
02:28 - and it's all
02:29 - disproportioned and everything so i'm
02:31 - just gonna turn it on now
02:33 - click it's gonna turn on i don't want
02:35 - that to happen let's see
02:36 - you see my face no you don't but now we
02:39 - have to get
02:40 - turn video on
02:43 - instead turn it off you don't have to do
02:46 - this because
02:47 - i don't want a face reveal so i'm just
02:49 - going to turn it off so you can't you
02:51 - don't have to see my face and i don't
02:52 - have to
02:53 - uh suffocate in this mask so um
02:57 - the first thing we're going to do is the
03:00 - um is drawing the basketball
03:03 - we don't need this at all
03:07 - oh yeah we have nothing on our um
03:09 - backpack this is today
03:10 - so we have a basketball if you do not
03:12 - know how to draw a basketball hoop
03:14 - uh we draw on our own and if you don't
03:16 - know how to draw you can just go down
03:18 - our project and export it
03:19 - and we also need uh we're gonna draw
03:22 - a basketball paint
03:27 - first you start the rectangle the
03:28 - outline is four
03:30 - and it's black and the inside
03:34 - is a dark grayish blackish color with a
03:37 - 4 or 5
03:38 - if you want to and we're going to start
03:40 - out with a nice rectangle
03:43 - a light nice long pool because every
03:46 - basketball
03:47 - has a pole and you have to have the
03:50 - rectangle on the bottom and we're gonna
03:53 - proportion that
03:54 - so now it's all even and then now you
03:57 - gotta make this
03:58 - the board you know all basketball hoops
04:00 - have a board so the thickness has to be
04:02 - 15 at this point i'm pretty sure and
04:06 - it has to be a light gray color because
04:08 - all boards are light gray or sometimes
04:10 - white
04:11 - uh and now it's 10 it's 10 yeah and
04:15 - uh we have this and we're gonna make the
04:16 - whole entire rectangle
04:22 - so yeah and we're gonna put that on top
04:27 - and we're gonna
04:31 - do the smaller rectangle inside
04:34 - which is just another rectangle but just
04:37 - slightly smaller
04:38 - because they always have that i don't
04:39 - know why they waste paint just to do a
04:42 - smaller
04:43 - uh rectangle it doesn't matter but uh
04:45 - and then we have a red rectangle
04:47 - it's to help you balance the ball so we
04:49 - just make a red rectangle
04:53 - with no fill
04:57 - so no fill
05:01 - so the fill is going to be the same
05:03 - color as the scoreboard
05:04 - now i mean the board and then the
05:06 - outline is red
05:12 - and that would be 15.
05:19 - so yeah
05:23 - so yeah uh we're gonna make that 15 and
05:26 - there we go we got a scoreboard and we
05:28 - just
05:28 - did not scoreboard but the thing that
05:30 - helps you balance the goal over there
05:32 - and now we got to make the uh goal
05:35 - itself the hoop
05:36 - so we first start out with a dark brown
05:39 - color almost a maroon
05:41 - uh darkish color not black a little bit
05:44 - lighter ish
05:51 - so a brownish color
05:55 - and we got more of a burgundy color
05:59 - and there we go burgundy same thing so
06:02 - we got 15
06:02 - thickness and uh we put
06:06 - a straight line hold shift remember
06:09 - and drag it across and there you got
06:12 - the top of the hoop and now you got to
06:14 - make the net itself
06:16 - which is a brown color
06:20 - a brown color
06:24 - you should just have to drag it down
06:26 - there and
06:28 - we have to make the net so hold
06:31 - shift no hold shift because you have to
06:34 - make a line like that
06:36 - because the hoop is not just um
06:40 - like just put like not straight it's
06:43 - more of uh sideways so you want to do
06:46 - ctrl c
06:47 - ctrl v we and then we can flip
06:50 - horizontal
06:51 - so that will be on the other side and we
06:53 - can just move it
07:00 - up
07:02 - and we're gonna put a third line in the
07:03 - middle of course because that's how the
07:05 - hoop is so shift this time because it's
07:07 - straight
07:09 - and we're gonna put two lines on the
07:11 - sides so remember
07:12 - hold shift are these two
07:16 - and hold shift for the other this might
07:19 - be worse than my last goal
07:21 - because of the bottom and all we have to
07:23 - do is just
07:24 - group these together drag them on the
07:27 - uh wooden thing not the wooden thing but
07:29 - the thing
07:31 - that holds the net and we can make that
07:33 - thing go in front
07:35 - and we group that
07:41 - again and we place it on
07:44 - the thing so there we go a basketball
07:47 - hoop
07:47 - so if you do not know how to draw this
07:48 - still just export it
07:50 - and we can just make this a little
07:52 - thinner
07:55 - little just thinner
07:58 - but you know uh
08:01 - we still have it in our backpack so we
08:04 - just have to drag
08:07 - i think it's this one
08:10 - so i don't think we have in our backpack
08:13 - so i'm just gonna
08:14 - so i'm gonna put this like that a little
08:17 - skinnier
08:18 - but not too fat like the last one
08:22 - a little down and maybe
08:26 - so there we go all we have to do is just
08:28 - do control c
08:29 - and make the scoreboards right which is
08:32 - paint control v
08:33 - and there we go the scoreboard sprite
08:35 - and we got to make it on top of the net
08:37 - but not really on top of the net so it's
08:40 - actually on the bottom of the net
08:42 - behind the net but actually in front of
08:45 - the hoop
08:46 - so i mean the uh
08:49 - the thing where you shoot the thing in
08:53 - the goal and uh we gotta put that on top
08:55 - and then we have to make it go to back
08:57 - later
09:04 - gotta make it go to back layer
09:13 - so i'm gonna just change the backdrop so
09:15 - all we need oh
09:16 - yeah i'm gonna click this real quick
09:18 - wait a second so they'll go to the
09:20 - backlight
09:22 - and then we have to make the um blue
09:24 - backdrop which is
09:26 - um just a blue color
09:30 - regular look at this color
09:34 - and then we make a gigan it doesn't
09:37 - matter about the red thing
09:39 - you won't be able to see it anyways but
09:41 - like still
09:45 - yeah and we got it and we're gonna so
09:50 - now we're gonna move we're gonna code
09:52 - the basketball we don't have much code
09:54 - so that's the good part because we can
09:56 - make a fun face sensing game without
09:59 - much code and then now we need to when
10:01 - the green flag is clicked
10:02 - it will go show go switch
10:05 - costume switch backdrop
10:10 - oh it's already that same backdrop it'll
10:12 - go to
10:13 - a position and i'm gonna move it up here
10:16 - around here
10:18 - and it will point in direction 180 so
10:21 - it'll
10:21 - be pointing down
10:26 - and we're gonna have set score to zero
10:31 - new variable
10:36 - set score to zero and turn video on
10:41 - but we're not going to turn it on until
10:43 - the end where i wear the demon mask and
10:45 - everything
10:46 - you know set video transparency to 20 so
10:49 - it'll be not that faint because 50 is
10:52 - very faint
10:53 - and yeah so we need to see and then wait
10:55 - two seconds
10:58 - i i hope i don't click on the green flag
11:00 - on this thing and also turn on
11:02 - everything
11:03 - and wait two seconds and it'll go
11:05 - forever
11:08 - move 10 seconds and if on the edge it
11:10 - will bounce
11:12 - 10 steps
11:16 - this is a very dangerous code block and
11:19 - dangerous and now we're going to work on
11:23 - another piece of code we have so when
11:25 - the green flag is collect
11:27 - it will go forever
11:30 - it will you need to make a
11:33 - score called high score i'll do it in a
11:36 - second so i'm going to make that a
11:37 - second
11:38 - right here variables you know we have
11:41 - high
11:42 - score cloud variable
11:46 - so we have that and um
11:50 - and we have if then
11:54 - if then the score
11:57 - is greater than the high score
12:04 - then it will set high score
12:07 - to score that means if you get a higher
12:10 - score than the world score
12:12 - or whoever plays this game score that
12:14 - means it will set the score
12:16 - to that score and then now if then
12:20 - if then not inside the if then but
12:22 - inside the forever
12:23 - if that is touching sprite 2 which is
12:26 - now target square
12:33 - now target square
12:38 - then it will start sound drum bass too
12:50 - yeah and then we need to change the
12:53 - score by one
12:58 - and hide
13:04 - and it will wait 0.5 seconds
13:09 - and it will show
13:14 - and then after that it will go to a
13:17 - position which is just the same thing as
13:20 - this position
13:21 - and point and direction
13:25 - 180 so where's that block
13:33 - and then we're going to have when the
13:34 - video motion
13:37 - is greater than 10 it'll start to sound
13:40 - boiling
13:41 - and it will send it flying
13:45 - okay so i'm going to use the boiling and
13:47 - b-o-i-n-g
13:52 - this one so blink starts on boink
13:56 - and then point and direction
14:00 - point where is that block point and
14:03 - direction there you
14:04 - are uh video direction
14:09 - video motion on
14:13 - sprite on sprite
14:16 - and when the s key is pressed it will
14:19 - stop
14:20 - everything because if if you just click
14:23 - the stop
14:24 - key uh if you just click the
14:27 - regular stop like the stop sign
14:30 - it will just keep on going this the the
14:34 - basketball the video will keep on going
14:37 - in the basketball and everything
14:38 - but we just need to do this so then turn
14:41 - the video off
14:46 - and it will stop all
14:51 - and now i'm going to get my demon face
14:53 - mask so wait a second
14:55 - so i got my face mask back and now i'm
14:58 - going to
14:59 - save now i'm going to move the high
15:01 - score
15:03 - to that side and now we're going to play
15:10 - it
15:12 - okay so i'm going to full screen this
15:15 - and let's start so i got my mask back
