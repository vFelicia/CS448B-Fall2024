00:08 - hello everyone welcome back to a kids
00:11 - coding playground channel today we'll be
00:14 - learning a new game called jumpy monkey
00:17 - game so basically this game is that you
00:21 - launched a monkey from here jambavati
00:24 - banana tree and trying to catch some
00:26 - banana so the point of the game is to
00:29 - launch the monkey grab the banana key
00:31 - without hitting the tree and then the
00:34 - game will allow the player to control
00:36 - the angle and the power of the launch by
00:38 - how how how high how how much power you
00:42 - want to launch the monkey after from the
00:44 - way arrow is and you know what degree
00:48 - you want to launch a monkey so the game
00:51 - will keep track of the number banana to
00:53 - be grabbed on the on the screen and when
00:56 - you when the player grab hold of bananas
00:58 - then game in so on it will also she
01:01 - traveled how many time you launched the
01:03 - monkey to kick the bananas so we'll try
01:06 - to get it to the fewest launch possible
01:09 - to get all the bananas we'll be learning
01:12 - these following concept broadcasting a
01:14 - message
01:15 - touching spray of the edge picking
01:19 - random variable sprite - and cloning
01:23 - speech to text and using custom sprite
01:27 - how to edit up sprite so this is mobile
01:30 - and scratch so you're not from you with
01:33 - some of this thing maybe you can look at
01:36 - the easier one lessons like beginner
01:40 - intermediate but anyway I will teach
01:42 - some of this to you guys alright so let
01:47 - me go into the begin here so let me
01:51 - demonstrate the game once so as you can
01:55 - see if I click on this Go button it
01:59 - created the bananas on the left side
02:03 - right side of the screen here and I will
02:06 - launch the monkey across and trying to
02:08 - grab the bananas also we added this one
02:11 - this one is like a speech icon where you
02:15 - can make the computer top for you so
02:18 - let's check
02:19 - this output we click on this basically
02:21 - just will say this sentence and we Lopez
02:25 - say descendants me a little bit so let's
02:28 - click on this to play this game you can
02:31 - use up or down arrow keys to control the
02:33 - power of the launch to change the degree
02:36 - of launch use left and right arrow keys
02:39 - try to catch as much bananas as you can
02:42 - like you wanted so as you can see this
02:46 - is the point of the game so once we give
02:48 - you the instruction that I can't
02:50 - disappear so let me you can see the
02:54 - arrows moving from here right I can make
02:58 - it bigger probably easier so you see the
03:01 - monkey I can change the degree I can
03:04 - change the power you can see the power
03:06 - can change here right so let's see let
03:12 - me launch my monkey back here so you see
03:15 - this is channel 2 - heart rate I have
03:18 - too much power that Mohican went off the
03:21 - screen a bit so if I come along to
03:24 - correctly you can see the monkeys trying
03:26 - to grab all the bananas we can oops
03:33 - create more power for that so as you can
03:36 - see some monkey kept all the bananas and
03:39 - you will display the message say you win
03:42 - so uh just uh let the player know that
03:45 - you win so there's no more banana to
03:47 - catch and we use for launches to get all
03:51 - the bananas on the for this game so
03:54 - let's get started we'll have to do this
03:57 - game come I'll show you how to do step
04:00 - by step for the skin
04:02 - ok alright so we'll create a new project
04:09 - this is a blank logic so we'll make the
04:13 - game form so what we had is we have a
04:17 - couple sprite right we were using
04:19 - earlier on the scam you can see with the
04:21 - arrow so we don't need the cat we can
04:24 - trash this cat and say arrow
04:31 - okay we have the arrow sprite
04:35 - we'll need the monkey it will tell a
04:40 - little monkey here by changing a little
04:44 - to be skipped up in Anna's okay and then
04:51 - after that we will will have to make the
04:55 - make the banana tree so we don't
04:57 - actually have one or you can just use
04:59 - tree from here right
05:01 - you can't I'm sure you but I don't think
05:03 - any of the tree really match for our
05:04 - game so what we can do is we can get a
05:07 - custom one so what we can do is you can
05:11 - go to like Google wot search search for
05:15 - banana tree PNG cartoon or something
05:19 - sometimes you can select transparent and
05:21 - they gives transparent sometimes they
05:23 - don't even though they said PNG but it's
05:25 - not transparent but uh either way you
05:28 - can say right click and then you can say
05:31 - save this image so as you can see I did
05:34 - it earlier a little bit I did download
05:36 - already just few minutes ago so this and
05:39 - this is same so let's say after you
05:41 - download this image let's say we want to
05:43 - use this banana tree but if you can see
05:47 - this banana tree when we open it it
05:50 - actually will not be correct so let's
05:54 - say I go back to my game Here I am going
05:59 - to upload let's say I upload my my
06:02 - download I thought that won't I
06:03 - downloaded earlier you can see the the
06:08 - banana tree is not transparent right I'm
06:11 - a cup of the monkey and the banana so
06:13 - that's not kind of what we when we want
06:14 - to erase or the background around the
06:18 - tree and leave just the tree so that we
06:21 - couldn't use it for our game so what you
06:23 - can do is we're going to trash this
06:25 - unfortunately in the new scratch 3.0
06:28 - they don't have that magic wand to erase
06:31 - it so I do have the older version of
06:33 - scratch off line enter and you can
06:35 - download that so for this off line here
06:38 - - you can say upload
06:41 - you can upload your PNG file that you
06:44 - just downloaded which is the banana tree
06:46 - as you can see it's covering the cat
06:48 - right so what you can do is go to
06:50 - costume and that's this uh here say
06:53 - remove background so basically you click
06:56 - on this you kind of do this this as you
07:04 - can see you can actually remove or like
07:08 - charcoal slowly you can remove all the
07:11 - background except the banana trees or
07:15 - whatever you want you can just highlight
07:17 - it with the screen thing this little
07:21 - green marker and then after that so you
07:26 - can see you got the banana tree so after
07:28 - that just click on another sprite or
07:30 - something so now you can see the
07:32 - companion tree is not blocking the cat
07:35 - right you can see the cat behind that we
07:37 - removed the background so what you can
07:39 - do is right-click save it to your local
07:41 - file so it will save it as a
07:44 - you know sprite to basically this is an
07:47 - older version of the sprite right this
07:50 - is a older version of scratch so you can
07:54 - just name it tree okay so we have our
08:06 - tree so what we can do is we can go back
08:09 - to our game so now we can load this tree
08:14 - into our game so you say upload so you
08:20 - can select this now you can see the
08:23 - banana tree is not blocking the banana
08:26 - and the back you can still see the
08:28 - banana in the back and the monkey in the
08:29 - back in the air alright so which is good
08:32 - that's what we kind of mean so now we
08:37 - can start coding our game so before we
08:40 - can continue please like share and
08:44 - subscribe to our Channel so I'm support
08:47 - our channel alright so let's get started
08:50 - now okay so what we need to
08:54 - we can select a background right
08:58 - whatever you like you can do the forest
09:01 - blue sky doesn't matter
09:04 - I guess forest probably won't make sense
09:08 - you can use this let's use this so
09:11 - drastic so we have curiosity you have
09:15 - the pen a tree on the ground right come
09:18 - on the ground mmm
09:20 - let's put them right here so what a
09:22 - monkey here so now let's get started so
09:27 - we will walk on this arrow first so the
09:32 - arrow sprite like we always need
09:37 - something like this I'll get the green
09:40 - flag like green Packers click who won't
09:43 - do something this is basically in the
09:45 - beginning what we need to do when
09:48 - whenever the game runs ok before we
09:55 - begin now only to create some variable
09:58 - first to keep traffic well game first
10:02 - variable we can create a banana so they
10:06 - would this one will keep track of how
10:08 - many banana we have in the game and how
10:11 - many Chrome or banana we want to make we
10:13 - can play an x one call for speed this is
10:18 - how fast the monkey will be falling down
10:23 - next one we can create his launch power
10:29 - this is like how how much power we want
10:32 - to push the monkey moving upward then we
10:37 - create another one launches this will
10:41 - keep track of how many launch the player
10:44 - use so what we can do is some of them we
10:48 - don't need to show up on the screen
10:50 - maybe the fall speed we don't need so we
10:53 - need the bananas maybe show the player
10:57 - how many banana they still have this is
11:00 - the launch power where the player can
11:01 - control the launch power right and then
11:04 - the other one is
11:06 - the number of launches that how many
11:08 - time the player launched the monkey up
11:10 - to grab the bananas okay so we now have
11:15 - all the variable we need we will start
11:18 - working on our game let's go back to the
11:21 - arrow sprite we'll move the arrow
11:24 - sprites um be here with this area then
11:31 - we will set the launch power so by
11:37 - default the launch power will make it
11:39 - ten so this is like this is the power
11:44 - when we're moving the the monkey so
11:49 - we'll use that then we go to here so all
11:57 - tractors in here so this is the location
12:00 - of this arrow I mean you don't have to
12:01 - be exactly so you can move it don't get
12:04 - too close because actually when we have
12:06 - the co for the monkey we don't want the
12:08 - monkey actually touching the edge if
12:10 - it's actually touch the edge here it
12:12 - might be of some problem so better move
12:14 - this arrow a little bit higher here I
12:17 - show you this part of it better so we'll
12:20 - change it a little bit okay
12:24 - so next we'll make the arrow point in
12:29 - direction 45 okay so when we click on
12:34 - this you can make the arrow point that
12:37 - way 45 so next we'll say so we want to
12:45 - make the error code to the front layer
12:47 - so that way we can when we moving the
12:49 - monkey we can see it so in the front leg
12:58 - out in front layers and then look coming
13:01 - to the scroll down a little bit so can
13:05 - select that so go to the front layer so
13:08 - the we are done with the co 40 initially
13:12 - for the for the launch power and then
13:18 - setting the angle for the arrow next
13:23 - we'll go to event select this one you
13:29 - can say select left arrow we'll want to
13:37 - turn one degree to the left you can
13:43 - duplicate this you can say select right
13:47 - arrow this one you have to throw it away
13:50 - you can say turn one degree to the right
13:54 - so now you can control the angle and the
13:57 - degree of your arrow how you want the
14:00 - fire of the monkey now we will use the
14:06 - up arrows similar but not exactly the
14:09 - same so the up arrow will control the
14:12 - power so we select up arrow and we need
14:19 - to condition if then we also need to use
14:24 - a operator basically we don't want the
14:28 - launch power to be too much so they
14:31 - don't want to be like we don't want them
14:33 - to go above you know 20 because it'll be
14:36 - doesn't extend you should all wear so
14:39 - what you can do is keep the operator
14:41 - here you can directly launch power here
14:44 - saying launch power is less than 20 then
14:48 - you will allowed to change it this will
14:53 - change the launch power lunch about
14:59 - they're not selected so you can change
15:01 - it by 0.1 so just a little bit so it can
15:06 - go to like 10:00 and 1:00 or whatever
15:08 - right next we will count duplicate this
15:14 - again here so we'll use this as the down
15:18 - arrow this time we have to say I gotta
15:25 - use the different operator you'll say
15:30 - if the launch power is greater than one
15:34 - then then you get allowed them to change
15:39 - it by negative negative zero point one
15:44 - so let's kind of test this for now we'll
15:48 - say that our weathering in our project
15:50 - we can call it jump p21 already saw the
15:57 - name too so let's start this you can see
16:02 - if I move the left key you can see the
16:07 - left common left coal running and the
16:09 - right whole running move right you can
16:11 - see the arrows turning this cause
16:14 - running I move up you can see my power
16:17 - here is churning right the power here
16:19 - turning so you can see this Co is
16:22 - running so it get to Ted 20 you see I
16:25 - cannot go above 20 right because this
16:27 - this if condition here is he not allowed
16:30 - them to go so I go down so you can see I
16:34 - can call it down all the way to 0.9 so
16:38 - you cannot go down any more so now we
16:40 - are done with the arrow we'll go to the
16:43 - monkey next for the monkey we can drag
16:49 - this in when green flag is clicked or
16:54 - little we set some variable so first we
16:59 - need to reset the launch will result
17:06 - launch to zero basically every time the
17:08 - game start or reset the launch so it
17:11 - doesn't continue what the player last
17:14 - time then we have to set the rotation
17:18 - style hmm so set rotation to style and
17:25 - you can say don't rotate so this is the
17:29 - same as if you clicking on this monkey
17:31 - and you're going over here and you click
17:33 - in this middle button same day then we
17:36 - can say Colton launcher we also can set
17:40 - the size here
17:43 - we can set the size for the monkey and
17:51 - we can set it like maybe 35% and we say
17:58 - you can say go to you say go to the
18:07 - launcher which is our arrow we can
18:10 - rename our arrow to launcher or uses to
18:17 - launch so from here I can do mr.
18:20 - launcher then we'll go back to the
18:23 - monkey we can select Archer
18:25 - what does they what this does is when
18:28 - you click on the green flag or reset the
18:31 - launch you'll set the monkey not to
18:34 - rotate and set the size for monkey and
18:37 - make the monkey go behind this arrow now
18:41 - if I click on the screen green flag you
18:43 - can see the monkeys behind the arrow we
18:47 - can move the road little bit I guess the
18:48 - monkey is pretty small I mean it 35% let
18:54 - me move this out of the way here let's
18:58 - move the arrow down this way and then
19:03 - whole tract is over here to connect this
19:07 - block back yep now it's pretty good the
19:12 - monkeys kind of in the corner here
19:15 - following the launcher so what will we
19:20 - accomplish so far is we got the monkey
19:23 - set up to follow the launcher we still
19:26 - have to work on the code to make the
19:28 - monkey jump off from from the launcher
19:32 - and come a fight fly over the tree and
19:35 - grata banana but we can continue this on
19:40 - the next lesson don't want to create too
19:43 - long lesson kids might get bored so
19:48 - right now we'll stop here for now and
19:50 - we'll continue
19:52 - the second video all right thank you for
19:55 - watching now please subscribe and like
19:58 - our video to support us thank you
