00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so hello guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here
00:09 - today we'll be doing a like a more
00:11 - advanced version of the turtle race so
00:13 - if you've not done the turtle race
00:15 - python project
00:16 - i suggest you to look at that video
00:18 - first before moving on to this one
00:20 - on this video it's a little bit more
00:21 - advanced we'll be adding like a winner
00:23 - so as you can see in this image right
00:25 - here
00:27 - red and purple are really close to each
00:28 - other you can't really tell which one's
00:30 - the winner
00:31 - so we're going to be adding a winning
00:33 - function where it compares the x-axis
00:36 - so we can see which one's actually the
00:38 - winner
00:39 - so let's start so first we're gonna
00:42 - make a new variable called winner turtle
00:44 - to
00:45 - tell which turtle wins turtle
00:48 - and then it's gonna be equal to turtle
00:52 - turtle and then oops let me put the
00:55 - shift key
00:57 - turtle and this parenthesis
01:00 - okay and then after that we want to win
01:02 - our turtle dot high turtle so we're
01:04 - going to hide the turtle
01:06 - so winner
01:12 - dot hide turtle so we're gonna hide the
01:15 - turtle first
01:19 - okay and then after that we're going to
01:21 - make the
01:22 - winter turtle pen up first so it's not
01:25 - drawing
01:25 - anything
01:28 - pen up
01:31 - and next we want to get a thing where we
01:34 - set the
01:35 - winner turtle to zero zero for now we'll
01:37 - change its
01:39 - axises later so we're just going to set
01:40 - it to zero zero for now
01:42 - winner turtle dot
01:45 - set x we're gonna set its x and y we
01:48 - really don't have to set the x
01:50 - oh i mean the y we're just comparing the
01:52 - x but we're gonna set it anyways okay
01:56 - turtle dot set y zero okay
01:59 - so we're gonna set to zero zero first
02:02 - and after that we're gonna get a map so
02:06 - we're gonna define the map as brackets
02:08 - first so we're going to
02:10 - put some more enters real quick okay so
02:12 - now you can see it better
02:15 - okay so we're going to go down here so
02:17 - um
02:18 - i just put some enter so we get some
02:20 - more lines so you guys can see it better
02:22 - so we are going to make a a
02:26 - map so we're going to do race turtle
02:29 - per curler
02:32 - dot map map no not that map and then we
02:36 - do
02:36 - equal sign equal to these curly braces
02:40 - and then after that we're so we're going
02:41 - to find the raised turtle map as the
02:43 - braces
02:44 - so okay we're going to have to get a key
02:47 - value pair
02:48 - so the key value pair is like the letter
02:52 - one the like the spelling one ome and
02:55 - the number one
02:56 - so we're like comparing those two so
02:57 - we're comparing red
02:59 - the red turtle red as the race toward
03:01 - one so we're going to write race turtle
03:05 - map and then we're going to do brackets
03:08 - and then put parentheses and then
03:11 - red like that
03:15 - i'm sorry accidentally did double quotes
03:18 - you have to do single quotes
03:19 - like this and this okay so the race
03:23 - journal map
03:24 - red is equal to the race
03:27 - turtle one so red is equal to the raised
03:29 - total one
03:32 - one actually no we don't have race
03:35 - turtle one we have my turtle one so
03:37 - race turtle one was um something else i
03:40 - had before
03:41 - so we're gonna do my turtle one
03:45 - one my turtle one so right here we have
03:48 - the my turtle one
03:49 - is equal to the turtle so we're gonna
03:50 - have to use my turtle one
03:52 - and not race turtle so we're gonna use
03:54 - my mind
03:55 - one and after that we're gonna do race
03:57 - turtle
03:59 - map and the brackets and parentheses
04:04 - and we're gonna do yellow
04:07 - yellow and then it's equal to race
04:10 - turtle i mean not race turtle my turtle
04:13 - two
04:14 - okay i'm used to saying race turtle um
04:17 - and then the third race turtle map we're
04:20 - gonna compare cyan with the race turtle
04:22 - three
04:22 - so the my turtle three so we're gonna do
04:26 - race
04:30 - students and this and then we're going
04:32 - to put cyan
04:34 - and now here we're going to do equal to
04:37 - my turtle
04:39 - 3 okay and finally we have one more
04:42 - which is purple
04:44 - race turtle map
04:48 - and then we're gonna do this and this
04:50 - and put this inside i will do purple
04:54 - is equal to my turtle four
04:59 - four okay and then next
05:02 - we're gonna do keys is equal to the my
05:04 - turtle
05:06 - uh race turtle map dot keys so we're
05:09 - going to
05:09 - keys is equal to race
05:13 - turtle map
05:17 - dot keys so this is defining the
05:19 - variable
05:20 - that okay and then next we can add
05:24 - something called print the keys so like
05:27 - after the thing will
05:28 - uh end it'll print all the keys it's
05:30 - just red yellow cyan and purple
05:32 - down here um um it's used for debugging
05:36 - usually but we can still use it i'll
05:38 - comment it out for now and i'll show you
05:39 - guys at the end
05:40 - print and then
05:44 - okay and then next we're going to do
05:48 - the winner color turtle color so this is
05:50 - like setting a variable to a blank
05:53 - link thing in scratch like you know in
05:55 - scratch how sometimes we have to set
05:58 - the variable to a blank thing so this is
06:00 - what we're doing right here
06:02 - so the winner turtle so because there's
06:04 - no winner yet that's why we're going to
06:05 - set it to blank
06:07 - so winner turtle color
06:11 - color when our turtle color is equal to
06:16 - these quotes just blank okay
06:19 - and then next we're going to get
06:23 - a repeat loop so for
06:26 - i and range so you can do any letter
06:29 - you'd like
06:30 - range we're going to repeat the length
06:34 - of the keys so the key is uh four which
06:36 - is red yellow
06:37 - cyan and purple so we're gonna do len
06:42 - and then put another parentheses and
06:45 - keys
06:46 - so this is a loop so you want to put a
06:48 - colon and
06:49 - tab and each key
06:53 - is equal to the keys of the index
06:57 - so first we're going to get the first
06:58 - one which is red
07:00 - is zero and then next it'll go for the
07:02 - next one which is yellow which is
07:04 - one as an example and then next we're
07:06 - going to go to two which is cyan and
07:07 - three which is purple so
07:09 - usually in coding except for scratch you
07:11 - start on zero
07:12 - so we're gonna get the keys of
07:16 - the index like that
07:20 - and then next line we're going to write
07:22 - each total is equal to the race terminal
07:24 - map of
07:24 - each keys okay so each
07:28 - the each key is um the my race turtle
07:31 - map
07:32 - each key we're getting this thing the
07:33 - first line my turtle one
07:36 - so so first we'll be getting the red one
07:40 - so the first key we're going for is the
07:41 - red so we're going to get it
07:43 - each turtle
07:46 - turtle is equal to the race
07:50 - turtle map race turtle map and we're
07:53 - going to do
07:54 - each
07:57 - okay okay
08:00 - and let me capitalize this real quick
08:03 - and let's capitalize it and then next
08:07 - we are going to find compare the x and
08:10 - x coordinates of the turtles to see
08:11 - which one is the winner so first we're
08:13 - going to get
08:14 - if each turtle dot the x coordinate is
08:17 - greater than the winner turtle then
08:18 - we're going to change it so
08:20 - we're going to get an if-then statement
08:21 - if
08:23 - each turtle
08:26 - dot x-core and then put another
08:30 - parenthesis
08:32 - and then we're going to put a
08:35 - oops and then take that out i'm gonna do
08:37 - this so the
08:39 - greater than symbol so if
08:42 - uh yeah so i was supposed to do that i
08:45 - have to put another parenthesis like
08:47 - that
08:48 - sorry about that and then we're gonna do
08:49 - winner turtle
08:52 - dot x core and then do this
08:55 - and then we're gonna have to add a
08:56 - column because this is uh if then
08:58 - statement
08:59 - so if the each turtle of the x
09:01 - coordinate
09:02 - like we're here the the comparing we're
09:05 - comparing the keys right now
09:07 - so so let's say the red turtle is
09:10 - this one and the winner turtle remember
09:12 - we set the x to zero and set the y to
09:14 - zero
09:15 - so let's say the red turtle is like at
09:17 - 160
09:18 - on the x so that's greater than the
09:20 - winner turtle so
09:22 - so if this is greater than it so then
09:24 - we're going to do this
09:25 - we're going to make the winner turtle
09:28 - turtle
09:29 - equal to the each turtle
09:33 - okay and then the winner turtle color
09:36 - is equal to each key so the winner
09:41 - color is equal to each key
09:45 - and each key right here is defined as
09:47 - the keys of the index like the red
09:49 - yellow cyan and purple
09:51 - okay and then next
09:55 - let me take out the tabs so now no more
09:57 - tabs anymore
09:58 - so next we are going to i'm going to
10:00 - comment this out for now but
10:02 - we'll look at it later so it's like
10:04 - we're going to print the winner
10:06 - turtle color okay so first before we go
10:08 - on to that
10:09 - we're going to uncomment this so i can
10:11 - show you this
10:12 - so let's do that and also one more thing
10:18 - uh when i said commented the print
10:20 - winner turtle color we can actually show
10:21 - it right now so then you guys can see
10:23 - which one's the winner
10:24 - so we're going to do print winner
10:28 - turtle color
10:32 - and then that so we're gonna run it now
10:36 - so let me save
10:38 - let's run okay so there's the turtles
10:42 - so let's see which one wins
10:47 - okay so as you can see it shows all the
10:50 - keys right here and the winner is the
10:52 - red one as you can see
10:54 - the winner is red and these are all the
10:55 - keys okay so now that's what it's for
10:59 - and then now we're gonna have to display
11:01 - which one's the winner onto the
11:04 - board right here so we're gonna do that
11:06 - pretty really quick right now
11:07 - so let's okay winner
11:11 - turtle message so this is another
11:14 - variable
11:16 - when internal message is equal to the
11:20 - word winner
11:21 - so we're just joining two things to make
11:22 - it like the winner
11:24 - whatever the winner caller is and then
11:26 - the turtle so the winner is
11:29 - i'm just going to put it in all caps
11:30 - because why not and then
11:33 - and then we're going to plus so we're
11:35 - going to add the winner
11:37 - turtle color
11:40 - and then we're going to also add the
11:42 - word turtle
11:45 - and then i'm going to add the word
11:47 - turtle
11:50 - oops let me click on here turtle
11:54 - okay let's add a space right here okay
11:58 - so next we're going to set the color of
12:01 - the font
12:01 - i mean the color of the text to white so
12:04 - it's easier to see
12:06 - setup turtle dot color
12:11 - i'm not set up qatar oh yeah we are
12:13 - using something else right here so
12:15 - i keep on forgetting so we're using uh
12:18 - turtle right
12:19 - remember we're using turbo is equal to
12:21 - this so we cannot use setup turtle
12:23 - so because in my old project i had setup
12:25 - turtle in it so
12:26 - that's why i keep on saying that but we
12:28 - have to use turtle
12:30 - okay all right so for turtle
12:35 - dot color we're gonna set the color
12:40 - to let's say
12:43 - white like i said earlier
12:46 - white and then make that lower case
12:51 - and then after that we're going to
12:54 - add a semicolon right here actually and
12:56 - then
12:57 - we're going to go down and next line
13:00 - we're going to
13:01 - set set up turtle's speed to zero so
13:03 - we're going to do the turtle
13:05 - dot speed zero
13:10 - and then next we're going to make the
13:12 - setup turtle or
13:13 - the turtle to pen up dot pen up
13:20 - and after that we're going to make it go
13:22 - to like negative 125
13:24 - 20 to negative 100 so that's somewhere
13:26 - like right here negative
13:27 - 120 and one negative 100 like somewhere
13:30 - right here
13:31 - so then you can see it so then we're
13:33 - going to do turtle
13:36 - dot go to
13:40 - go to and then we're going to put
13:43 - negative 120 and then we're going to do
13:46 - negative 100
13:47 - so we're going to set it to that place
13:49 - and then we're going to write it
13:51 - we're going to set we're going to use
13:53 - the turtle we're going to set up the
13:54 - writing so turtle dot
13:56 - right winner
13:59 - turtle message so up here we define the
14:01 - variable
14:03 - winner eternal message as the winner
14:05 - plus the winner turtle color plus the
14:06 - turtle
14:07 - and then we're gonna set the font to
14:09 - arial font
14:11 - equals to error
14:14 - real
14:20 - 20 we're going to set the size to 20
14:23 - and we're going to make it bold so there
14:26 - you go
14:27 - let's try it out so this is the code we
14:30 - had
14:32 - okay i'm just going to show it really
14:33 - quickly save and let's run
14:37 - so at the end it'll show the keys and
14:39 - all that so once the
14:41 - thing is finished
14:45 - so as you can see the cyan turtle
14:47 - actually won that
14:48 - if we didn't have this we would not be
14:50 - able to tell which one won actually
14:52 - look the purple and cyan are pretty
14:54 - close actually
14:55 - i wouldn't be able to tell so right here
14:58 - it also shows the cyan
14:59 - and shows the keys so i'm going to play
15:02 - it one more time for you guys
15:06 - okay and then um
15:10 - if you do not want this print and all
15:11 - that stuff you can comment it out
15:13 - and as you can see the purple turtle one
15:14 - so now it's much more accurate
15:16 - and it makes your little game much more
15:18 - cooler
15:19 - so i think that should be it for this
15:21 - tutorial thank you guys for watching
15:23 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
15:25 - and i'll see you guys in the next video
