00:01 - [Music]
00:10 - hello kids welcome back to the channel
00:13 - today we will continue with our party
00:16 - animal team that we have left off with
00:18 - the scratch introduction so what we're
00:21 - going to do we're gonna make a few
00:23 - change to the game today well we're
00:25 - gonna make the at the dog the bat in the
00:28 - background for this game so that you
00:31 - know make it a little bit more animals
00:32 - right because this is an animal party
00:34 - kick game so also we're gonna change a
00:37 - little bit with the music don't like
00:39 - this music playing in the back it's
00:42 - really loud with this drum and cymbal so
00:46 - we're gonna try something different
00:48 - we're gonna change the music out so what
00:50 - I'm going to do is I don't remove all
00:52 - this as you can see there's a little
00:54 - weight here in between so we're gonna
00:56 - have to put them way back into the the
00:59 - step so that it will look a little bit
01:01 - better
01:01 - okay so we'll move the weight here back
01:06 - 0.25 which we did right and then we can
01:09 - kind of move these back in now maybe we
01:13 - can duplicate this here and then we'll
01:20 - change this forward and step the whole
01:26 - wood - ten step we'll duplicate this
01:28 - again whatever - ten step so let's let's
01:34 - remove that this so let's stop this so
01:39 - we have a moving forward ten step we 0.5
01:43 - to 5 seconds moving forward 10 step way
01:45 - again go back
01:48 - so basically going back and forth okay
01:50 - so we start again you can see from the
01:52 - cat going back and forth on the stage a
01:55 - little bit okay so we're gonna add our
01:57 - music back so this what we can do in
01:59 - pecan Sam here we can say select choose
02:03 - a new sound and maybe you can type
02:07 - dance or something okay so here we are
02:10 - about different pencil over so you hover
02:14 - over they can't place the sound book so
02:17 - you can choose any pencil that you like
02:20 - you can choose this one for now so this
02:24 - is more energetic so let's check after
02:27 - we choose that we're gonna go back here
02:28 - we're gonna create another when green
02:32 - flag is clicked because actually it is
02:34 - song playing come on mom so you don't
02:37 - want to add it into any of this block if
02:39 - you do it kind of messed up again so I
02:42 - can show you that in a bit so let's go
02:44 - to control again or add a forever loop
02:47 - so and then you go to sound and as you
02:51 - can see right it says something like
02:53 - play the sound then energetic until done
02:56 - so that mean like the sound will play
02:59 - for how many ever second or minute this
03:02 - this song has so you actually put this
03:04 - in here it will actually blocks the cat
03:07 - for moving until the sound is done so
03:10 - let me just kind of show you that let's
03:13 - just play this for once so as you can
03:15 - see the cats kind of anything with the
03:17 - music in the back so let's say if we did
03:20 - not have it as separate forever loop and
03:22 - we put it by say in here or something
03:25 - like that so you won't be a problem as
03:28 - you can see so it's kind of getting
03:31 - stuff
03:33 - that's why you don't want to do that so
03:36 - you do not want to put that into the
03:38 - same forum because this song may be
03:41 - longer here to keep it on the side so
03:44 - now that we have fixed it the cat
03:47 - movement and then added a different song
03:50 - so now we're done with a cat so now next
03:53 - what we can do is we're gonna add the
03:55 - other sprite so what you can do is go
03:57 - back here let's do a search so now we're
04:00 - gonna add the doc type top so we have
04:03 - this top we're gonna add him to the just
04:07 - to the screen so let's say we move him
04:09 - over here so so that what we can do is
04:13 - we're gonna make him kind of run back
04:15 - and forth in here right so we must start
04:18 - with this go back to the event when
04:21 - green flag is clicked meaning that we'll
04:23 - never play a click on this green flag
04:25 - this toe will execute so we're gonna
04:27 - have another forever loop so put in here
04:32 - so let's say we're gonna move the dog 10
04:36 - step and then what we want to do is when
04:39 - it get to the edge we want to bounce so
04:42 - uh if on edge bounce many of the dot run
04:45 - all the way over here it will bounce
04:46 - back so while we try this and see what
04:49 - happened also before we do it let's
04:52 - change the costume as well so we're
04:54 - gonna create another one here I should
04:59 - make this bigger actually sorry about
05:02 - that
05:02 - let me make this bigger I always forgot
05:05 - about that so it's easier for everyone
05:07 - to see so here we're gonna make it
05:10 - another forever loop here so this time
05:16 - we're gonna change the custom just like
05:17 - how we did with a cat or a check in a
05:19 - costume
05:20 - so those look like a dog is running so
05:23 - we can put out a little bit wait here go
05:25 - back to here control you can say wait
05:30 - 0.2 second okay so now if we run it you
05:35 - can turn a quick look at the dog see
05:37 - what happened
05:38 - you can see this new stuff right
05:43 - incorrectly is
05:45 - so you see how the top is flipped over
05:47 - so that's not what we won right so I'm
05:50 - sure that dark is actually kind of run
05:53 - correctly right so what we can do we can
05:56 - fix that so we can do move the dog back
05:59 - to this position so maybe before we
06:01 - start we're gonna move into this
06:03 - position as you can when you track this
06:06 - you can see this change so what you can
06:08 - do is you can first track the dog and
06:11 - then you can move this over here so now
06:13 - we're gonna make the dog start at this
06:14 - position one more thing is the doc is
06:17 - are rotating right so we don't want him
06:19 - to do that click on this here click on
06:22 - this you see this there's a one button
06:24 - in the middle select this so this one
06:28 - will not make the dog rotate so the top
06:30 - only bounce back and forth so now we're
06:32 - done so let's save it run it again
06:39 - [Music]
06:41 - so which is what we want okay so we got
06:44 - the doc going so now let's try to add
06:47 - the pad when we can fly' the bad around
06:50 - the stage as well so let's try that will
06:55 - type in back okay we have this back tear
07:00 - and if you want a different custom with
07:02 - the bat maybe you can choose another one
07:04 - Oh again we don't have another one I
07:06 - think the old scratch has a different
07:08 - bat looking bad but I think this one
07:10 - does not let me just try again okay so
07:15 - we only have this bat
07:16 - perfect oops
07:35 - okay so I only have this bat so we'll go
07:39 - back
07:44 - okay so in here we have the bats the
07:49 - bats what we want to do is we can become
07:52 - a little smaller to want can't put 50%
07:54 - so the bad is are the smaller so what
07:57 - we're gonna do is we're gonna make the
07:58 - black pad chemical eye around so again
08:01 - what that's starting from this position
08:03 - so in here I go back to event on clicked
08:11 - we can say okay more the back to this
08:13 - position okay and then say we're ready
08:19 - set the size if not you can also do this
08:21 - right here you can say set
08:24 - set size here if let's say you did not
08:27 - change it here you and change it over
08:29 - here as well so let's say you say change
08:31 - it to 157 let's say we put this 100%
08:35 - back so you see how the bat is small but
08:40 - when we click on this it will actually
08:42 - make the bat smaller so the bat actually
08:46 - is smaller so because of this code you
08:48 - can do it with a CO or you can do it
08:49 - over here so same thing so what we're
08:52 - gonna do is we're gonna have a forever
08:53 - loop okay so what we're going to do is
08:59 - we're gonna point the bat at 90 degree
09:02 - so that you know the bat will be flying
09:05 - this way because if the bat is uh you
09:10 - see how he ate this way he's come like
09:12 - this way I think some of the yeah the
09:15 - bats like this is not a good example
09:16 - actually well let's say let's let's
09:21 - change the the sprite because I'm gonna
09:23 - show you this now let's change this
09:25 - brightness use the bat let's use the
09:27 - butterfly
09:32 - okay let's use this putter fight and
09:35 - this is better so what we're going to do
09:38 - is we're gonna copy the code actually
09:40 - over so we can do is drag this tone you
09:44 - see how it's kind of moving moving just
09:47 - let go so now the code get copied over
09:50 - here so you know what they're typing and
09:51 - so he can now can trash ahead so now
09:54 - we're the butterfly so what we're going
09:56 - to do is we're gonna make the path I go
09:58 - up and then back so what we're going to
10:02 - do is we're gonna put him into it
10:04 - direction so we got a point to 90 so as
10:07 - you can see you see here 90 and then you
10:10 - can go negative 90
10:12 - you see his hats in the front so what we
10:14 - gonna do is we're going when he's flying
10:16 - this way his hat is gonna point this way
10:18 - when it's flying back this way we at
10:20 - some point this way so we're gonna set
10:21 - that right now 90 so which is pointing
10:25 - to the right so gum stay glide let's say
10:30 - we want the butterfly to start here
10:32 - right
10:33 - this is 161 let's say negative 161 as
10:37 - you can see the negative 161 right so we
10:39 - can find make him go up so you see this
10:43 - one changes up now to say cry one second
10:46 - to here and then maybe we're gonna say
10:48 - over here that was a cry one second to
10:53 - this location and then finally we're
10:56 - gonna over here and it was a cry one
11:01 - second to here so now the butterfly will
11:03 - be moving like this right so what we're
11:06 - gonna do is we're gonna make him go back
11:07 - so what we can do is come on turn him
11:10 - around
11:11 - say opponent Direction negative 90 so as
11:16 - you can see it's pointing to the left
11:17 - now so we're gonna fly him back all the
11:21 - way over here where he stopped from so
11:24 - unless a glide to this one you can
11:27 - change it to two seconds if you want so
11:30 - now I run it you can actually see the
11:32 - bad it's kind of cold out there so up or
11:35 - cross up down and he'll turn around and
11:38 - come back here okay so let's say this
11:41 - and let's run
11:49 - [Music]
11:52 - do you remember what we did with a doc
12:05 - [Music]
12:07 - [Applause]
12:09 - actually turn around because we put
12:12 - negative 90 point interaction which is
12:14 - left side so what we have accomplished
12:18 - this is a really simple game where you
12:20 - have a couple of sprite on the screen we
12:21 - added some music and we kind of learn
12:24 - about the direction right how the point
12:26 - left and right and depending on where
12:30 - you're facing from right so that's about
12:33 - it for this game so thanks for watching
12:37 - please don't forget to subscribe like
12:40 - and share so that everyone can also
12:44 - learn thank you
