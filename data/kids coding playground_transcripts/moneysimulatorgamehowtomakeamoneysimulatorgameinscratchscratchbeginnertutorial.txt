00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:08 - kilogram today we'll be making a project
00:11 - in scratch called money simulator so
00:13 - basically the point of the game is just
00:15 - to collect money you move around this
00:16 - grid i'll show you a demonstration of it
00:18 - after this so basically move around the
00:21 - grid collecting as much money as you can
00:23 - we might add some extra improvements to
00:25 - it at the end but for now this is the
00:27 - game we have right now
00:30 - also labor day is on monday so
00:32 - um
00:33 - if you want to check out our labor day
00:35 - animation project you're more than
00:37 - welcome to check it out um
00:39 - yeah and you can tell us what you did
00:40 - over the labor day weekend
00:42 - in the comments section um all right so
00:44 - without further ado let's get into the
00:46 - project
00:47 - so basically you can move around
00:50 - it can it's just moving in place right
00:52 - now we just made it look better by doing
00:54 - that in the original project we didn't
00:55 - have it
00:56 - every money you collect you get one
00:58 - score
00:59 - and we might want to we could probably
01:01 - remove the pop sound that's kind of
01:02 - annoying honestly but yeah that's
01:04 - basically it
01:07 - so it's pretty simple project you just
01:08 - basically run around getting
01:10 - these uh things
01:12 - the money all right so let's start a new
01:14 - project file new
01:16 - oops
01:18 - and then okay so let's rename this
01:19 - project
01:21 - i'll probably name it uh money
01:23 - simulator okay money simulator we'll
01:26 - keep this scratch cap
01:28 - so i'm going to keep this at 60 size i
01:30 - think this is the perfect size so let me
01:32 - drag some stuff from the backpack you
01:34 - can install this from the google drive
01:36 - in the
01:37 - uh description below so we have the
01:38 - money
01:39 - and then we have the grid oh yeah that's
01:41 - for the backdrop
01:42 - so we go to the backdrop drag it in
01:45 - so now the grid
01:47 - to make our lives easier these grades
01:48 - are actually spaced 60 steps apart like
01:52 - almost 60 apart like in scratch
01:54 - so perfectly 60 apart so it's easier to
01:57 - use
01:59 - so yeah um
02:00 - let's go to the scratch cat first let's
02:02 - rename this right to the player so
02:05 - player we go to the code and then when
02:08 - green flag clicks inside the player
02:10 - we're going to make it go to
02:13 - negative 30
02:15 - on negative 30. so if you run it we're
02:18 - going to make it go right here near the
02:19 - middle i guess this is basically the
02:21 - middle
02:22 - maybe we can make a little bit smaller i
02:23 - don't know maybe 55 yeah that's a little
02:26 - better 55 looks a little bit better so
02:28 - yeah the negative 30 negative 30 is
02:31 - basically the middle
02:33 - and then we're going to make that point
02:34 - direction of 90 degrees
02:37 - and we're going to set the rotation
02:39 - style to left and right so it won't flip
02:40 - upside down when you move it
02:42 - and we're going to get a forever loop
02:44 - so it will likely be moving
02:47 - i forgot to zoom in
02:49 - uh forever next costume
02:53 - next costume and we're gonna wait 0.1
02:55 - seconds
02:57 - 0.1 seconds
02:59 - and then we're going to do the movement
03:01 - now so we're going to do
03:03 - when down arrow is pressed
03:05 - then we're going to point direction of
03:07 - 180
03:09 - point in direction of 180
03:13 - so to the bottom we're going to point to
03:14 - the bottom
03:15 - and we're going to start working like
03:17 - start moving 60 steps to the bottom
03:20 - because i already told you each of these
03:21 - squares
03:23 - are 60 steps like that
03:25 - uh perfectly 60 steps and then if on
03:28 - edge we're going to make them bounce
03:30 - and duplicate this down arrow we're
03:32 - going to do up arrow now so up the upper
03:34 - arrows press one point direction of zero
03:36 - which is pointing up
03:38 - and we're gonna move 60 steps and a fun
03:40 - edge will bounce
03:42 - uh duplicate the up arrow we're gonna do
03:44 - right arrow now
03:45 - right arrow we're going to point the
03:47 - direction of organ point direction of 90
03:50 - which is the right side
03:51 - uh we're going to
03:53 - uh one same thing this is the same and
03:56 - move 60 steps if under bounce same thing
04:00 - and then left arrow
04:01 - we're going to do negative 90
04:04 - and move 60 steps if on edge bounce so
04:06 - we have the movement
04:08 - so as you can see you can move around
04:10 - the grid
04:12 - all right so yeah that's pretty much it
04:15 - for the cat pretty easy
04:17 - and let's go to the gold so
04:19 - inside the gold we're going to make a
04:21 - new variable so
04:22 - i'm going to name the variable
04:24 - money all right
04:26 - for all sprites
04:28 - and when green flag clicked
04:31 - zoom in
04:33 - we're going to set the money in the
04:34 - beginning to zero
04:36 - and forever loop forever
04:39 - we're going to set the x
04:42 - uh i'll tell you why we have to do this
04:44 - in a bit after i finish this one so
04:46 - we're going to set the x to
04:49 - negative 210
04:51 - plus
04:52 - pick random zero we're gonna multiply
04:55 - pick random zero to seven
04:59 - zero to seven
05:02 - and multiply by sixty
05:04 - all right
05:05 - so basically negative two ten is
05:07 - this side this is negative 210 this grid
05:09 - right here
05:10 - this last row
05:12 - and we're gonna add it to the pick
05:14 - random zero to seven times sixty so
05:17 - uh let's say the number picked random is
05:19 - zero so that means it'll set the x to
05:20 - negative two ten so it'll be right here
05:23 - so you might be wondering why we're
05:25 - doing seven when there's eight grid
05:26 - eight grid squares like one two three
05:28 - four five six seven eight it's because
05:30 - we're already counting this one as
05:32 - negative two ten so we're going to only
05:34 - need seven one two three four five six
05:37 - seven so d7
05:39 - and we're going to multiply by 60
05:40 - because each one is 68 across 16 steps
05:44 - and then we're going to get another
05:46 - script let's get a set y2
05:48 - duplicate this small
05:50 - piece
05:52 - and we're going to do negative 150
05:54 - negative 150 is this bottom row this is
05:56 - all negative 150 and we're going to add
05:59 - it to zero to five because there's
06:02 - six blocks one two three four five six
06:04 - and we're already counting this one
06:06 - so we're gonna only need five and we're
06:09 - gonna multiply 60 again because of the
06:12 - fact that each one is 60 across
06:14 - all right
06:15 - and we're going to
06:17 - use timer for this so we're going to
06:18 - reset the timer right here
06:21 - and then so basically if the timer is
06:23 - like greater than a certain amount then
06:25 - the money will go somewhere else
06:27 - so we're going to wait until
06:30 - wait until the
06:31 - is touching the player or so we're gonna
06:34 - do touching player
06:36 - oops
06:38 - touching the player
06:40 - or the timer is greater than three
06:43 - all right
06:45 - greater than three so the timer is also
06:47 - greater than three
06:48 - then we are going to
06:51 - if
06:53 - we're going to get an if
06:55 - touching player so we can do if uh
06:58 - touching player then we're going to
07:01 - let's start a sound uh we're going to
07:03 - start this sound called water drop i
07:05 - think it's in the sprite library and
07:07 - then we're going to change the money by
07:08 - one
07:09 - all right
07:10 - in the future we might add some other
07:12 - stuff but for now this is all we have
07:25 - it's working perfectly fine
07:28 - so now we have a simple
07:30 - moving around beginner's tutorial uh we
07:33 - will add some other stuff to it and
07:35 - later maybe like some traps or like some
07:37 - enemies that can attack you and you can
07:39 - lose lives or lose a game yeah so
07:43 - maybe in the future we'll make another
07:45 - video based off this project
07:48 - and also in the backdrop uh we have a
07:50 - little bit more code actually so
07:53 - like if you want to make it a little bit
07:54 - visible more better you can make it like
07:56 - when green flag clicked
07:58 - uh you can clear all graphic effects and
08:01 - then you can set change the ghost effect
08:05 - by 70. i had this my old project i think
08:08 - so once you run the project it'll be a
08:10 - little bit
08:14 - oh no wrong one ghost sorry accidental
08:16 - the wrong one
08:18 - so yeah as you can see it's a little bit
08:20 - dimmer i guess
08:22 - yeah
08:23 - so yeah maybe like if you want this you
08:26 - can keep it i don't know like i don't
08:29 - know if this is really necessary just
08:30 - make it like a little bit easier to see
08:32 - but yeah that's pretty much it
08:33 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
08:35 - to like share and subscribe to our
08:36 - channel kids good playground and i'll
08:38 - see you guys in the next tutorial
