00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be doing a two-player
00:12 - ping-pong game so
00:14 - the objective of the game is to keep on
00:16 - hitting the ball back and forth
00:18 - and you try not to let your opponent hit
00:21 - in the back
00:22 - and when the ball touches this edge or
00:24 - this edge
00:25 - then you get a point so you have this
00:27 - point and
00:28 - this side's point and with that and then
00:30 - the first player to get seven points
00:33 - will win the game so let's go
00:36 - we will be learning these following
00:38 - concepts today variables
00:40 - loops broadcasting messages sensing
00:43 - collision which is like
00:44 - sensing blocks and pick random
00:48 - so i will be showing you guys the game i
00:50 - have my brother here with me
00:51 - hey to show us the game so let me make
00:54 - it bigger
00:56 - so you want me arrow keys sure i'll be
00:58 - here okay
01:01 - first of seven points and i even added
01:05 - some music
01:13 - so you just keep on oh no you like going
01:20 - so i'm just gonna let myself lose or
01:22 - something
01:23 - i wanna um demonstrate what happens when
01:27 - you
01:28 - uh lose
01:32 - so when the ball when the other person
01:35 - gets seven points
01:37 - on you then that means you will get uh
01:39 - you'll say the other pla
01:40 - either if the player if it's the player
01:43 - one that wins so say player one wins
01:45 - so this side is player one this side is
01:47 - player two
01:50 - hit it back
01:55 - okay one more point and then i'll show
01:58 - you guys how to make the game
02:01 - okay so say player two wins which is
02:03 - this team
02:04 - so i'll be making a new project so i can
02:08 - show you guys step by step how to make
02:09 - it so let's make a new project
02:12 - so let's make two variables in the
02:16 - beginning
02:17 - we will need a variable called player1
02:20 - score
02:23 - one score and another variable called
02:26 - player two score
02:34 - player two score so you have the two
02:36 - variables
02:38 - um we want we don't need this so you can
02:40 - just delete it the my variable
02:41 - you don't need that delete the scratch
02:43 - count we won't need that as well
02:45 - and you can double click on this to make
02:47 - it like that
02:51 - and next we'll be doing the backdrop so
02:54 - for the backdrop
02:55 - i'm gonna put some code for it so this
02:57 - is the color i did
02:59 - um for my last backdrop 39 color 100
03:03 - percent saturation and 40 brightness so
03:06 - get this color and then we need no
03:09 - outline
03:11 - so we're going to get the box thing uh
03:14 - and just
03:14 - draw a square like
03:18 - so there you go so i got the square
03:23 - this is the backdrop um and next we're
03:26 - gonna
03:27 - get some music i guess uh
03:30 - let's go get a song you guys can pick
03:32 - any song you guys want
03:34 - i'm just gonna pick the song i used this
03:36 - one
03:39 - so just kind of one flag clicked forever
03:42 - loop
03:44 - uh play the sound until done that's it
03:49 - and we will need two paddles
03:52 - so there's a paddle sprite just take
03:55 - two of those just make one and then
03:57 - duplicate it
03:59 - and go into the sprite we're going to
04:01 - make it a vertical
04:04 - oops select this thing
04:10 - so you can actually um just
04:14 - turn it vertical
04:18 - like that okay i know it's not perfect
04:23 - actually just duplicate this so then you
04:26 - already have an
04:27 - uh you already have a uh
04:31 - you already have like a vertical one so
04:34 - there you go two paddles we'll also need
04:37 - the ball
04:38 - let's get the ball sprite let's go here
04:41 - get the ball
04:42 - you want to get the this ball just going
04:45 - to get this one
04:47 - and next we're going to work on the ball
04:49 - code
04:50 - so one flag clicked
04:54 - actually no one yeah one flag clicked
04:57 - you want to set all the variables to
04:59 - zero set the player one score and set
05:01 - the player two score to zero
05:04 - uh set the size to forty percent so it
05:06 - won't be too big
05:09 - and we want it to go to zero zero the
05:12 - center position
05:15 - and then we want it to point in
05:16 - direction of 45
05:19 - so point in direction of 45
05:23 - it's going to be like top right
05:27 - so then we can bro then we're going to
05:28 - broadcast a new message
05:31 - called start game
05:38 - so that start game so when this receives
05:41 - start game
05:44 - then we can um execute
05:47 - all this code so get a forever loop
05:50 - move ten steps if on edge bounce
05:55 - that's the first part and then you get
05:58 - if it's touching the paddle one and
06:02 - touching the paddle
06:04 - the first paddle not the second paddle
06:05 - so if it's touching paddle
06:08 - then we can start sound pop to make some
06:11 - sound
06:12 - sound effects i guess turn
06:15 - we need to turn so it'll turn a random
06:18 - degree so it'll go
06:20 - different angles and directions you can
06:22 - turn pick
06:23 - random 170 to 190 degrees so
06:26 - let's get that pick random
06:30 - 170 to 190
06:35 - degrees so let's
06:38 - uh duplicate this
06:42 - put this under here instead of paddle
06:45 - we'll do paddle 2.
06:48 - and we'll start the pop turn this is all
06:50 - the same
06:52 - and then we'll get another if then
06:54 - statement
06:56 - if the
07:00 - x position is greater than 230
07:05 - so that means if the x position is
07:06 - greater than like
07:08 - 230 230 is like right here that means it
07:10 - touches the edge i guess
07:12 - so if the x position is greater than 230
07:17 - then we will change
07:23 - the players one score by one go back to
07:26 - the zero zero
07:28 - go back to the middle
07:31 - and wait three seconds and we'll start
07:33 - it over again
07:38 - we can duplicate this
07:42 - put this under here instead of this we
07:45 - will get the
07:48 - a less than symbol so less than symbol
07:50 - put that in here
07:51 - if the x position is less than negative
07:54 - 230
07:55 - so if it's less than this position like
07:57 - negative 230s right here
07:59 - then we can change the player to score
08:01 - by one
08:03 - go back to zero zero and wait three
08:05 - seconds so
08:07 - i just scroll around to let you guys see
08:09 - that's all the code we have for now
08:12 - obviously it does nothing yet except
08:15 - bounce around i guess
08:16 - now we can work on the paddle code
08:20 - so we can actually make the paddle a bit
08:22 - smaller like 75 percent
08:24 - size and same with the paddle 2 let's
08:27 - make it 75
08:28 - size so we got the two paddles
08:32 - let's get coding on it so when i receive
08:36 - start game
08:38 - we'll get a forever loop
08:41 - if on edge bounce
08:44 - so you cannot go down here and hide down
08:46 - here
08:48 - this is for player one so we'll do w the
08:51 - w key and the s
08:52 - key so if the key w is pressed
08:56 - which is the up if the w key is pressed
08:59 - then we can change the y by eight
09:02 - change y by eight
09:06 - and we can duplicate this if the s
09:09 - key is clicked which is down
09:12 - so when the s key is pressed we'll go
09:14 - negative eight
09:18 - and then we want to set the x and y
09:19 - position so i have the coordinates
09:21 - written down we will do
09:24 - negative 200
09:27 - and y zero so it will be right here
09:31 - about
09:31 - right here that's negative 200 y zero so
09:36 - then we'll get another if-then statement
09:38 - if
09:40 - the player one score is equal to
09:43 - seven i'm doing seven score
09:46 - as the winning you can do any number if
09:50 - you want
09:51 - uh if the player one score is equal to
09:54 - seven
09:55 - then we can broadcast a message called
09:58 - player one wins
10:00 - player one wins
10:04 - and then for the paddle 2 it'll be
10:07 - similar code
10:08 - we'll just set the x and y position
10:12 - to 200
10:15 - x so it will be in the y
10:19 - zero so it will be somewhere right here
10:22 - and then we can pretty much just drag
10:23 - this
10:24 - drag and drop it into the paddle too so
10:27 - we'll get the same code
10:29 - and then instead of w it'll be the up
10:31 - arrow key
10:32 - and instead of the s it'll be the down
10:34 - arrow key
10:36 - and instead of player one score it'll be
10:38 - player two score
10:41 - player two score and we'll broadcast a
10:43 - new message
10:44 - called player 2 wins
10:50 - player 2 wins and then we'll also make a
10:53 - new
10:54 - sprites paint a new sprite
10:58 - we will make two costumes for i'm gonna
11:01 - make this
11:02 - first one red so i'm just gonna type
11:05 - player one wins
11:11 - um player one wins make it a bit bigger
11:14 - a little bit smaller actually so player
11:17 - one wins
11:18 - i'm just gonna duplicate this we're
11:20 - gonna do it in the same
11:22 - sprite just two costumes and i'm gonna
11:24 - rename the costume to
11:25 - player one win
11:30 - just duplicate this
11:33 - instead of player one when i'm just
11:35 - going to name this to player two
11:39 - and then i'm just gonna double click on
11:42 - this
11:44 - i'm gonna make i'm gonna change the text
11:46 - to green
11:48 - to tell the difference so instead we're
11:51 - gonna write player
11:52 - two wins
11:57 - so we have two costumes player one and
11:58 - player two wins okay
12:02 - so let's go to the code for it so when
12:04 - flat clicked we want to go to zero
12:06 - zero go to the center
12:10 - and we want to hide so when it receives
12:14 - the
12:14 - player one win then we will show
12:19 - switch costume to player one win because
12:24 - the player 1 wins
12:25 - and we'll stop all
12:28 - just duplicate this for player 2 wins
12:32 - just click player 2 wins changes to
12:35 - player 2 win
12:37 - so that's all the code let's play it
12:40 - i'm playing by myself right now so
12:43 - it's not that easy
12:46 - [Music]
12:49 - so what happened to the paddle so guys i
12:52 - actually found out the bug
12:55 - set this to left and right so it won't
12:58 - flip so as you could see
13:00 - the paddle flip to the left a little
13:03 - so just do this left and right so now it
13:06 - will not flip
13:08 - save your project now i'm going to go
13:11 - full screen
13:12 - and show you guys oops
13:15 - i'm playing by myself right now so it's
13:17 - kind of hard i get two screens at
13:20 - two two places at the same time
13:30 - yeah so let me just make one of the
13:35 - teams lose
13:50 - [Music]
13:53 - and finally i'll say player one wins
13:56 - whichever
13:57 - team wins so yeah there you have it
14:00 - uh two player ping pong game and we
14:03 - rename it
14:04 - two player palm game
14:07 - player pong game so
14:10 - thank you guys for watching please like
14:12 - share and subscribe
14:13 - and i'll see you guys in the next video
