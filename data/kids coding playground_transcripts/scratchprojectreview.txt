00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids from playing
00:09 - around here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video in scratch and today we'll
00:11 - be um
00:13 - reviewing projects from our channel
00:16 - studio so
00:17 - we have a bunch of people in our studio
00:22 - and they all post content for us to
00:24 - review sometime so today i will be
00:27 - reviewing some stuff
00:29 - so let's get started so i was just
00:31 - looking at this um
00:34 - project and i it seemed pretty cool by
00:38 - pragal pro
00:39 - and i really like uh
00:41 - the snow effect there's also
00:44 - um some music but i'm just turn it down
00:47 - and i like the snow effect it's just
00:50 - pretty simple and you can click space to
00:52 - throw a snowball so it's just like some
00:55 - sort of like snowball fight so
00:58 - yay
00:59 - so
01:01 - looks pretty cool
01:03 - i'd rate it pretty good
01:05 - that deserves a favorite
01:07 - okay so i found another game
01:09 - called block dodge so here we are with
01:12 - another game for a project review it's
01:14 - called block dodge
01:15 - um so basically it looks like it's just
01:18 - a game where you just dodge blocks i
01:20 - guess
01:21 - so let's go full screen
01:23 - so let's hit start
01:25 - so i'm assuming you use the arrow keys
01:26 - okay so you use the arrow keys to dodge
01:28 - the blocks as you can see
01:30 - uh it's a pretty simple game but it's
01:32 - pretty cool
01:34 - um
01:35 - i would like like if it had more
01:36 - decoration or something it would be
01:38 - probably a bit better but like it's
01:40 - still pretty good
01:41 - still pretty good
01:44 - just a fun basic project so
01:46 - that deserves a favor
01:51 - so um
01:53 - i found this cool um project i'm
01:57 - um you should set up some sprites and
02:00 - made a project click space to start
02:03 - and it plays a cool tune
02:06 - so this is cool
02:13 - so i found this really really cool
02:15 - project
02:16 - by espio 200
02:18 - and i
02:20 - this deserves a favorite i have already
02:23 - reviewed i saw it so uh you start and
02:26 - you can change your costume by using the
02:28 - up arrow so there's the apple the ball
02:31 - and the butterfly so if you click the
02:34 - butterfly will go there and you paint
02:37 - with the butterfly
02:39 - i really like the costumes and the color
02:42 - and how you can change
02:45 - of what you want to paint so you can
02:47 - paint something
02:48 - pretty cool here so we got the ball too
02:51 - kind of looks like a caterpillar
02:53 - and there's also a button called clear
02:54 - so i like everything in this project uh
02:58 - it's nice but if it had a backdrop it'd
03:00 - be cooler because
03:01 - a backdrop would be pretty cool but
03:04 - great job uh
03:06 - yeah
03:08 - so i found this also cool project in our
03:10 - studio also by um the same person is
03:13 - po200 and
03:16 - it is a simple platformer game and it
03:19 - plays cool music wall jump
03:22 - and
03:23 - this is cool i mean like
03:25 - just like right it's just a generic
03:26 - platform yeah like who doesn't want to
03:28 - play generic platform yeah it's just a
03:30 - regular platform we've got the spikes
03:32 - lava everything this is a really good
03:34 - design i like the whole entire thing i
03:36 - like the multi-colored um
03:38 - avatar
03:40 - and
03:41 - just how the game functions
03:43 - it works like a really good platformer
03:45 - so the jump physics are pretty good too
03:47 - yeah all right let's say given some
03:49 - credit for that
03:51 - it was probably from some like tutorial
03:52 - but that doesn't matter
03:54 - yeah
03:54 - and and it's also um
03:57 - i'm pretty sure
03:58 - is
04:00 - i forgot what i was going to say but
04:02 - it is
04:05 - has a lot of levels so
04:07 - yeah like you put some effort this
04:10 - person put some effort into making
04:11 - levels
04:12 - so that deserves a favorite
04:15 - so yeah
04:17 - so i just saw this project and it's
04:20 - called defense uh version 1.1 so
04:23 - um so i guess you're just supposed to
04:25 - use the arrow keys and you use your um
04:31 - uh arrows to try to defend against the
04:35 - and if something like
04:37 - goes past the line i think then you lose
04:41 - i'm not sure which parts the line yeah
04:42 - yeah the edge the edge yeah but pretty
04:44 - much
04:45 - what one thing you would want to do is
04:47 - like make it
04:48 - so there's a delay between shooting it
04:50 - because it's kind of opie it's doing
04:52 - that but it's still pretty hot yeah
04:54 - yeah that's pretty much it
04:56 - our last one is a fidget spinner game
04:58 - taking this back to 2016 when this is
05:00 - actually a thing so
05:02 - fidget spinner
05:04 - i'm pretty in the description it says
05:06 - it's from this guy named guy so i guess
05:08 - it's from some tutorial or something
05:10 - check it out but still we're gonna check
05:11 - it out anyways so
05:15 - fidget spinner yeah
05:17 - basically it's just a clicker you just
05:18 - click it click the fidget spinner to get
05:20 - it yes yeah cookie cutter spins whatever
05:22 - you call it yeah basically a clicker but
05:25 - if you could add like some small tabs
05:27 - here like you can buy upgrades yeah like
05:29 - it'd be cooler yeah if you buy like 2016
05:32 - person and then they would get like one
05:34 - spin tree for like every five seconds uh
05:36 - that'd be pretty cool and you can like
05:39 - fidget
05:40 - spinner industry whatever so yeah pretty
05:43 - good project from
