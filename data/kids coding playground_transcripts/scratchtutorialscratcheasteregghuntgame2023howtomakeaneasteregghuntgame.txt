00:00 - [Music]
00:09 - thank you tell us what you think about
00:11 - our new intro and please comment your
00:13 - thoughts down below and also please
00:15 - check out our Easter game from last year
00:17 - which you can find in the video
00:19 - description and we hope you enjoyed that
00:21 - tutorial as well
00:23 - welcome back guys it's kids home
00:24 - playground here and today we're back
00:26 - with another video at scratch today
00:27 - we'll be making the Easter themed game
00:29 - because it's Easter Sunday today and we
00:33 - have our Easter game over here so
00:37 - there's some music playing and there's
00:39 - this rabbit find where I hide the three
00:40 - eggs so here there's gonna be an egg
00:43 - here there's gonna be an egg and here is
00:46 - going to be an egg so basically we're
00:47 - supposed to find or all three of the
00:49 - eggs are
00:51 - um where the rabbit has hidden them so
00:53 - there's one over here there's one over
00:55 - here and there's one over here so good
00:58 - job you found all three eggs so it's
01:00 - basically a memorization type game so
01:01 - then you can like find all the eggs and
01:04 - win
01:05 - so that's basically the game that we're
01:08 - working on today and it involves lists
01:10 - so
01:12 - of uh there has been some questions on
01:15 - Sprites on the usage of our projects uh
01:19 - so you can just come into my project
01:20 - I'll be sharing this project Easter egg
01:22 - hunt 2023 go to my profile gumballs098
01:26 - and then you can open your backpack like
01:28 - as so and drag the Sprites in so then
01:31 - you can use them on your own
01:33 - and also uh there has been a lot of
01:36 - requests for Google access for our
01:38 - Google Drive
01:40 - um and you should be using your personal
01:42 - account not your school account so we
01:43 - don't get all these requests but
01:46 - um there is a video on Google Drive and
01:49 - how to use it so we'll be linking that
01:51 - in the description so then you can also
01:54 - use the Google drive as well as
01:56 - you can also drag the Sprites so
01:59 - let's get started
02:07 - so I'm gonna get my Sprites here we only
02:09 - have two Sprites to this project which
02:11 - is the hair
02:14 - the hair and we also have
02:18 - no scratch cat goodbye and we also have
02:20 - the eggs
02:21 - so
02:23 - we have our two um Sprite situated and
02:27 - after that we have our backdrop which is
02:30 - actually going to be the Garden Rock
02:35 - this one so this is the thing that we
02:37 - used but we actually covered up the
02:40 - thing so it wouldn't cover up the rock
02:41 - so then it wouldn't be on the the eggs
02:44 - won't be on the grass so basically we
02:46 - just take a section of that
02:48 - and then we just like uh paste that
02:50 - control C control V
02:52 - and then just just try to cover up the
02:55 - rock as good as we can so then young the
02:57 - eggs will be on the rock for visual
03:00 - qualities
03:02 - and maybe take a snippet from the flower
03:07 - and we can just cover up the rock a
03:09 - little bit over there for visual quality
03:13 - so that's basically what we did to cover
03:15 - up the Garden Rock
03:17 - so
03:19 - when during the egg positionings
03:23 - during the egg positionings the egg was
03:25 - actually not on the same elevation as
03:28 - the rabbit so it didn't have the same so
03:31 - you would want to control C control V
03:33 - the hair
03:34 - to the egg and then try to align them as
03:38 - best as possible to
03:41 - um make it the best quality you can so
03:44 - the best alignment possible and then the
03:47 - egg does not have to be in the center
03:48 - it's just off to the side a little bit
03:51 - so now
03:54 - so it's basically down a little bit from
03:56 - the
03:57 - um
03:58 - Center
04:01 - so now
04:03 - let's get coding so first let's make our
04:06 - variables so for our rabbits we have an
04:11 - index for our rabbit and then this is
04:14 - for this Sprite only
04:16 - so we have that and now we also have egg
04:19 - found
04:21 - how much eggs you have found for all
04:23 - Sprites and then as well as rabbit
04:27 - finish talking oh just hold it right now
04:31 - talking
04:34 - so basically we need this rabbit
04:36 - finished talking variable so then
04:38 - um there's no cheating in the game
04:39 - because the rabbit will be going to each
04:41 - of the places where he's placing the egg
04:43 - so the rabbit finish talking is
04:46 - basically going to be so you can't click
04:49 - on that rabbit when he places the eggs
04:51 - so then you cannot cheat
04:53 - so let's get coding so I have the green
04:56 - flag is clicked
04:59 - when the green flag is clicked it will
05:01 - go to x I have coordinates so negative
05:04 - 190
05:06 - y
05:07 - 120.
05:09 - and it'll switch costume to the First
05:12 - costume which is hair a
05:14 - which is the sitting position like this
05:17 - and after that we need a list so
05:21 - we make a list over here and then we
05:24 - name it egg
05:25 - X location so this is what basically
05:29 - this decides where the egg will be
05:31 - located on the x coordinate plane so we
05:35 - have the egg X location
05:37 - so first it'll delete all of X location
05:40 - so then there won't be any extra like
05:43 - places where the eggs could be and then
05:45 - we'll also need an egg
05:47 - Y location
05:50 - like why
05:52 - so and also delete all of egg y
05:55 - locations so it's our two lists over
05:57 - here
05:59 - and basically it will do
06:01 - add
06:03 - thing so it'll add pick random
06:09 - negative
06:10 - 200 to negative 90 to X location
06:14 - so I'll explain this after when I'm done
06:16 - so we'll do this again and instead
06:19 - instead of pick random negative 200
06:20 - negative 90 will be negative 90 to
06:24 - 70.
06:27 - and then for this one
06:29 - we will have
06:30 - 70
06:33 - to 200. so basically this is determining
06:37 - the three zones so there's basically
06:40 - three zones to this map and that's where
06:43 - the eggs are going to be placed in
06:45 - either of these three zones so it the
06:49 - reason we did this is because the rabbit
06:51 - could select the same spot and not move
06:53 - at all and then say this is the second
06:56 - egg where it is and they're both in the
06:58 - same spot and it can get people very
06:59 - confused as they have only found two
07:01 - eggs not three so that's basically why
07:03 - we need the zones to separate the eggs
07:05 - so
07:07 - it's actually not confusing so they're
07:08 - like not right not next to each other
07:11 - so for y it's going to be different so
07:14 - since we already separated that X we
07:16 - need to repeat three
07:18 - uh and it'll add
07:22 - to use a ad it'll pick random negative
07:25 - 120
07:27 - 260
07:29 - and this is the egg Y location the egg Y
07:31 - location does not need three zones
07:33 - either because it would be it doesn't
07:36 - need three sets because it's only
07:38 - separated by the X so
07:41 - now we have say
07:44 - uh find
07:47 - find where I hide the three eggs
07:53 - remember the location
07:58 - find where I hide the three eggs
08:00 - remember the location for three seconds
08:02 - or more if you want and then it'll
08:04 - broadcast start game
08:09 - start
08:12 - okay so let's move on to this part so
08:15 - when I receive
08:18 - start game
08:21 - um those set
08:24 - egg found to zero because you have not
08:26 - found any eggs yet
08:27 - and then it'll go forever
08:32 - um and say if then if then the egg found
08:36 - is equal to three so operator equals
08:40 - egg found is equal to three
08:44 - um
08:46 - so if egg found is equal to three it
08:48 - will say
08:54 - good job
08:56 - good job you found
08:58 - who found all
09:01 - three eggs okay for three seconds so we
09:06 - have that and then it'll stop all so
09:08 - that's basically after when you win
09:11 - and after that we'll have uh when uh
09:15 - another start game so when I receive
09:16 - start game
09:19 - it will
09:20 - set
09:23 - rabbit top finish talking
09:26 - to n so basically the rabbit's not
09:30 - finished talking yet so you cannot cheat
09:32 - and we'll set the index to one
09:38 - and then after that it will repeat three
09:41 - times
09:45 - and it'll broadcast animate so it will
09:48 - go to three different spots for the X so
09:51 - repeat three times broadcast
09:54 - animate so show is basically running and
09:57 - to place each egg
10:00 - and then you'll Glide one second
10:02 - to where the list determines so Glide
10:05 - one oopsies collide one second to X so
10:11 - we need to go back to our list place
10:12 - over here and say item
10:17 - uh index item index of X location so it
10:22 - already determines where the x of Y
10:24 - locations are so basically this is
10:26 - telling them to go to the places
10:30 - I'll show you the list over here so we
10:33 - have this so this already determines
10:34 - where all the lists are
10:37 - and
10:38 - this only determines where the X and Y
10:40 - should be located
10:42 - and you see
10:45 - so now we're going to go back to here
10:47 - and then we're gonna have item
10:54 - of egg Y location
10:58 - and then so item index of egg Y location
11:01 - to go to the Y position of the Y
11:04 - location
11:06 - so and now we're gonna say here
11:11 - so I'm just going to say here
11:14 - for one second and then it would change
11:16 - index by one so basically going through
11:19 - a number counting type of thing so the
11:22 - first one go to the second one
11:24 - and then now under this you'll go switch
11:28 - costume to Hair A
11:31 - and it'll go to
11:35 - go to where it was originally at
11:38 - negative 190
11:40 - y120
11:42 - and then after that it'll say
11:49 - now tell me where
11:53 - I
11:55 - hid the eggs
11:58 - by clicking on oopsies so much typos the
12:02 - screen
12:05 - now tell me where I hit the X by
12:07 - clicking on the screen all right so now
12:09 - it's gonna be three seconds and then
12:12 - after that it will set
12:18 - set rabbit finish talking to Y so this
12:20 - is when it's done talking and then you
12:21 - can actually interact with the game
12:25 - so now we have over here
12:27 - when I receive animate so when it starts
12:30 - and this animation it's blocking thing
12:33 - it'll repeat four times
12:36 - four times and it'll switch costume
12:40 - to hair B
12:42 - and then wait 0.1 seconds
12:48 - and then switch costume to hair see
12:52 - and then wait 0.1 seconds now for that
12:55 - you'll switch costume back to Hair A
13:00 - basically the whole entire animation
13:02 - sequence thing
13:05 - uh I'm trying to put up these as best I
13:07 - can
13:08 - so basically this is all the code oh no
13:13 - basically this is all the code for the
13:15 - um hair determining where the list is
13:18 - and what placing the eggs so this is
13:21 - basically so I'm gonna play the game for
13:23 - you
13:24 - oh shama remove the list real quick
13:28 - and then so
13:30 - variables kind of blocking but it's
13:32 - saying something and after that you're
13:33 - going to where the eggs are
13:35 - and it'll go to where they are so
13:38 - basically it goes here here and here
13:40 - so
13:42 - you click on these and that will be
13:45 - uh where the eggs are gonna be so
13:49 - uh we're finished with the egg uh here
13:51 - so feel free to pause over here
13:54 - and now we're going to move on to the
13:56 - eggs
14:00 - so when the green flag is clicked
14:05 - it will hide
14:08 - and then when I receive
14:12 - start game
14:14 - it will set index so over here set index
14:19 - oh yeah we need an index because that
14:21 - one's for the hair so we actually have
14:23 - to write do another index do not skip
14:25 - this part for this Sprite only for the
14:28 - eggs as well
14:29 - and then you'll set the index to one
14:32 - as well as repeat when you repeat over
14:36 - here repeat
14:38 - length so length
14:41 - length of egg X location
14:44 - so there's three so it'll repeat that
14:47 - and then it'll create clone
14:51 - of myself you know also change the index
14:57 - by one
14:58 - and now over here
15:02 - uh we're gonna work on the when I
15:03 - started the clock
15:04 - so
15:07 - when I start as a cloud
15:10 - so when I started to close
15:13 - when I start as a clone it will go to
15:17 - X
15:20 - um
15:20 - item index so where is that
15:24 - item
15:26 - index
15:28 - of
15:29 - X location and then item index of egg Y
15:34 - location
15:35 - and then after that it will set
15:39 - ghost effect so basically it'll be
15:41 - hiding it but it's actually not hidden
15:43 - set ghost effect
15:46 - to 100.
15:49 - and then after that it'll show
15:52 - and then you'll wait until
15:55 - there's a big hunk wait until
15:58 - don't wait until you need two add
15:59 - operators
16:01 - so we did an end over here and then end
16:03 - up here
16:05 - so you did wait until
16:08 - um it's touching not spoiler and mouse
16:12 - is down so you click on it and your
16:14 - mouse is touching it and
16:17 - you need an equal side over here
16:20 - and
16:22 - rabbit finished talking
16:25 - is equal to Y so this is until you can
16:28 - carry you can get the eggs so basically
16:31 - you wait until it's touching the mouse
16:33 - pointer the mouse is down it's click on
16:35 - the thing and the rabbit is finished
16:36 - talking
16:38 - after that it will change the egg found
16:41 - by one
16:42 - and then set goes to effect to zero so
16:44 - you can see where
16:46 - see you got the egg so say ghost effect
16:50 - zero and then say you got it you got it
16:55 - over here
16:59 - for one second
17:01 - and then we'll also wait one second
17:04 - as well as it'll now delete this club
17:08 - so now we have the egg situation done
17:13 - so
17:14 - trying to get a big view of this
17:16 - so feel free to pause oops feel free to
17:18 - pause over here and copy down the code
17:21 - and now we're moving on to the backdrop
17:24 - so when the creative flag is clicked
17:26 - it's very straightforward
17:28 - um we're gonna pick a sound for this one
17:29 - I used eggs because it really matched
17:31 - the theme because the tags
17:34 - and you'll set volume
17:37 - set volume to 25 percent
17:40 - and forever
17:43 - it will place out eggs until done so
17:46 - that's basically the whole entire game
17:47 - we have over here except we have to hide
17:48 - the variables so uh for the hair you
17:51 - hide index we hide rabbit finish talking
17:54 - the egg we hide index we'll keep egg
17:57 - found and we'll move it up here so
17:59 - basically that's the game
18:01 - and
18:02 - so I'll demo it so let's say fine when I
18:05 - hide the three eggs from the location
18:07 - and then you'll stay here and hit it
18:10 - like over here and then hit a head over
18:12 - here so that's basically where the three
18:14 - eggs are so so I think there's one over
18:18 - here I'm not sure it might be one over
18:20 - here and over here now here okay so yeah
18:26 - so I found all three eggs and that's
18:28 - basically a whole game so everything is
18:30 - in order
18:32 - so please like share subscribe and
18:35 - comment in the comment section below
18:37 - what else games and you might uh end up
18:39 - on our channel one day we might make
18:40 - your project and uh comment in the
18:43 - comment section below if you celebrate
18:44 - Easter and uh if you went egg hunting or
18:48 - any of those really fun activities on
18:51 - Easter so anyway have a great Easter
18:54 - [Music]
