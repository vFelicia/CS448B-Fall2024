00:03 - [Music]
00:10 - hello and welcome to kids coding
00:13 - playground channel here we'll be
00:14 - teaching kids step by step learning the
00:17 - basic programming concept one of my
00:20 - favorite tool to use is scratch scratch
00:23 - is a visual or interactive programming
00:25 - language to develop MIT what kids can
00:29 - program their own interactive story
00:31 - games and animation so it is a really
00:34 - fun and easy tool to use let's get
00:39 - started now we'll go to here so we need
00:45 - to go to scratch that mit.edu
00:49 - so in here you can you can sign up for
00:52 - your own account okay after you sign up
00:56 - then you can see your stuff what are
00:59 - some other things that you could you
01:01 - have your project come here and then you
01:04 - can also if you don't like the online
01:07 - version you can also go here go down
01:10 - here into the download so this download
01:13 - you can download the offline version of
01:16 - scratch meaning you can actually run it
01:18 - anywhere but I do recommend the online
01:22 - version so that if you have online
01:24 - access then you can pretty much use it
01:26 - anytime the offline versions you know
01:30 - you have to save it locally on your file
01:31 - in the year to like load it up but it
01:35 - allows you to work online without
01:36 - internet access but the online version
01:39 - everything is saved to your engine to
01:42 - your project so let me get started so
01:46 - now that you have a little bit basic of
01:48 - about scratch where did it go and how to
01:51 - download the scratch and how that lock
01:53 - in and use it so once you log in you
01:56 - will see you can go to my stuff click on
02:00 - this and you'll show like different
02:01 - stuff what are some of the project you
02:03 - have for scratch so or you can also
02:07 - create your new project so we can do
02:11 - that by clicking on this button here
02:13 - create a new project so when you create
02:15 - this new project
02:16 - it will low into this editor so this is
02:20 - the editor for scratch so let me show
02:24 - you one of the sly I made about the
02:28 - scratch
02:29 - so here the scratch editor this is a 3.0
02:32 - scratch recently updated to 3.0 so this
02:36 - is a menu so this is the menu while you
02:38 - have here this is the stop and start
02:41 - this is the button to run your game this
02:45 - is the script area when you put your toe
02:47 - here those blocks this is the Kohl
02:49 - palette so you can track and drag the
02:52 - code and drop into this group area and
02:54 - these are the extension extension is
02:56 - like other stuff like music pen you know
03:00 - or others thing that you want to use
03:02 - with scratch and this is the background
03:05 - editor you can put a background for your
03:07 - game this is the sprite editor where you
03:10 - can edit putting different sprite like
03:13 - the cat here for example you can have a
03:16 - dog or something else and this is the
03:19 - stage meaning like when you're going to
03:21 - see so when your game runs so this is
03:24 - the basic apart the laid out for the
03:27 - scratch next we want to understand about
03:30 - the X&Y position of the of the scratch
03:33 - so in the center of scratch will be 0 0
03:37 - this side will be positive x right this
03:41 - I will be negative X and this size
03:43 - positive Y this down here is negative Y
03:47 - so as you can see this quadrant here is
03:50 - positive x and positive Y here is
03:52 - positive x negative Y here is a negative
03:56 - x negative Y and here's negative x
03:59 - positive Y so here to kind of understand
04:01 - the positions of 0 0 is kinda in the
04:04 - center of the stage ok so next we're
04:09 - gonna go step by step
04:11 - teaching the kids how to code the first
04:14 - scratch game ok here we go so this is
04:19 - the sample lesson we can I walk on today
04:21 - so we're gonna have the cat in the
04:22 - background with the music and the cat
04:25 - will be dancing
04:26 - okay so let's let's start with the
04:30 - program so first we have the cat right
04:35 - so what we can do is we can click on
04:37 - this button here and go into here say
04:42 - select a background and then you can
04:44 - type maybe dance let's say yeah see
04:49 - dance so you have this spotlight select
04:52 - this so now you have the cat have a
04:56 - background of the dance stage we can't
04:58 - move that catcon in the middle of that
05:00 - stage here so after that what we can do
05:04 - is we can do some coding to make this
05:08 - cat move so first thing we can do is you
05:13 - can see these here these are the
05:15 - different code block they have so we can
05:20 - start with the first one event so when
05:24 - the button is clicked what do you want
05:26 - the cat to do so the cat it's not doing
05:31 - anything right now let's say we want to
05:33 - make the cat move so we're gonna have to
05:35 - take a look at this costume so as you
05:37 - can see the first costume is the cat
05:39 - camera standing here second custom is
05:42 - the cat can I like moving his leg so you
05:45 - can what you can do is you can put a
05:46 - loop we'll go into more detail on this
05:49 - later on but for right now I just follow
05:52 - along so you can see here control we
05:54 - can't drag this for loop into the into
05:59 - this block here so it was kind of like a
06:01 - Lego kind of thing you slaps naturally
06:04 - so and then you can say go back to here
06:09 - look and look you can say next costume
06:12 - so what you do is when you click on this
06:15 - you'll see the cat continuously forever
06:18 - changing the costume so I can click on
06:21 - this once so you can see it cannot go
06:23 - really fast right that's what we're not
06:25 - what we want right you can stop it so
06:28 - what we can do is you can put a little
06:30 - bit of weight
06:31 - okay in the control I believe yeah
06:34 - that's it yeah here so you can track
06:36 - weight over here you can do like 0.1
06:40 - second so this is like a fraction of a
06:43 - second right so let's say if you go
06:44 - start again so you see how you click on
06:47 - this green flag go that means they will
06:49 - execute this block of code here so let
06:53 - me kind of zoom in so you can see better
06:55 - I should do that earlier
06:57 - so now let's let's click on this code so
07:01 - as you can see you can see the cat is
07:03 - kind of running or dancing or what it's
07:05 - doing and you can see that this block of
07:07 - code has become yellow meaning this
07:09 - isn't running so you can stop this now
07:12 - we have the cat moving kinda thing so
07:14 - now let's same one add some music to
07:16 - their cat right so what we can do we can
07:20 - go in here and then we can this is the
07:24 - extension we can add music extension so
07:27 - once you have the extension music you
07:29 - see something like this so what we can
07:32 - do is we can go back to the event we're
07:35 - gonna draw out another start when start
07:38 - is click then we are going back to the
07:42 - control we had another forever loop here
07:44 - and then what we can do is we're gonna
07:49 - make the cat kind of moving forward a
07:52 - little bit moving back a little bit so
07:54 - this is a movement so you had to go to
07:56 - the motion so you can say move forward
08:00 - ten step and what we can do is go back
08:02 - to the music we can say hey play this
08:05 - drum sound right or point zero five two
08:11 - second for the beat and then play and
08:14 - then make the movement again and then we
08:17 - can use like moving back right put back
08:21 - here and then you send
08:23 - ten so here so you can have like the
08:29 - drum plane is moving forward I'm moving
08:32 - backward and then we can use another
08:34 - music like let's say you can put another
08:37 - sound here and you can choose a
08:39 - different sound maybe you can choose
08:41 - this one right and then you can also
08:45 - make it move forward I can or you can
08:47 - just duplicate the code you right click
08:49 - say duplicate so now you have a second
08:52 - set of holes playing some sound we can
08:57 - move backward and forward again and then
09:00 - maybe we can delete this part we'd only
09:02 - track it back in here we'll delete that
09:05 - this one we can just select another one
09:08 - here so what happened if I run this code
09:11 - now you will see that the cat will
09:13 - continue moving dancing moving forward
09:17 - and backward and then we're changing the
09:19 - costume and playing this sound so let me
09:21 - run this real quick or save our project
09:24 - [Music]
09:31 - so as you can see this is a really
09:34 - simple project we created so where you
09:36 - can make the cat dancing right so next
09:40 - we can do is we can also make the cat
09:42 - maybe changing color
09:44 - so there's another event you can use by
09:47 - different event let's go back to the
09:49 - event so when space key is pressed so
09:53 - what we want to do is when the space key
09:56 - is pressed we want to change the color
09:58 - effects so we're going to go back to the
10:00 - look you can see that here change color
10:04 - effect by 25 so what happened is they
10:07 - kind of make the cat change the color
10:11 - and also you can make the cat say
10:13 - something if you like and you can say
10:15 - hello right and we can say hello for
10:20 - maybe one second right so what you do is
10:24 - when the game is running you can push
10:26 - the space key and it will change this
10:32 - you see hello the cat is changing colors
10:34 - so so you can see that the cat is
10:37 - dancing the music is playing in the
10:41 - background and then you can push the
10:42 - space key or change the color of the cap
10:44 - so and also you can also like you know
10:48 - let's say if I want to reset the game
10:51 - every time so let's say I dragged the
10:54 - cat over here so let's say what I can do
10:57 - is I drag this here so every time the
11:00 - game start we'll move the cat to this
11:02 - position let's save the cat somehow
11:04 - playing you doing some other game I
11:07 - can't move to a certain position but
11:09 - when I click on this stop button it'll
11:11 - always put the cat back to this stage
11:13 - here so I click on this your character
11:22 - your sprite in the game next thing we
11:26 - can do is I think we'll we'll stop here
11:30 - for now so this is kind of the basic of
11:33 - the game so next we can go introduction
11:38 - introduce how to add that even spry into
11:41 - the game maybe making adding the dog
11:43 - having the bats that flies around so ok
11:48 - we're gonna try that next next lesson
