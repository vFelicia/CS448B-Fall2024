00:03 - [Music]
00:10 - so welcome back guys to the channel
00:12 - today we'll be doing uh probably the
00:15 - last part for the
00:16 - christmas platformer so we're going to
00:20 - be finishing up the game
00:21 - so before we uh get into the code i'm
00:23 - just going to like go over the code real
00:25 - quick
00:26 - so this is dying if it's touching the
00:28 - green flag go to make a new
00:30 - start a new level if the player's dead
00:32 - it'll reset player
00:34 - if the player is dead we're going to set
00:35 - it to yes which triggers
00:38 - um this thing if a repeat until is
00:41 - player dead equals yes and this thing
00:43 - broadcasted here
00:46 - then we have the if it's hitting the
00:48 - ground
00:49 - like the platform detection the platform
00:52 - detection
00:53 - restarting the game the movement jumping
00:58 - starting all the controls like this is
01:00 - the jumping movement control and jumping
01:02 - start of these two
01:03 - and then we have the moving the speed x
01:06 - this is the wall jumping
01:07 - and this collision with walls and then
01:10 - in the animated character
01:12 - it's been the same for a while and then
01:14 - we had the green flag we placed
01:16 - just two levels so we could just test it
01:18 - out
01:19 - the snow we have the snow effect right
01:22 - here
01:23 - the snow effect ground
01:28 - spikes we just put a couple spikes for a
01:31 - sample
01:32 - and then trampoline we'll be working on
01:33 - today
01:35 - okay so before we move on we have to do
01:39 - something in here
01:40 - so i'm just going to make like um so
01:43 - this is like you have to make it six
01:44 - levels i'm making seven levels so i can
01:46 - make this one less than the total amount
01:48 - of levels
01:49 - so this is just to show how many green
01:51 - flags you want to put in it so if the
01:52 - level
01:52 - is less than six then we're going to
01:55 - change the waffle by one
01:57 - right here we're gonna
02:01 - and the green flat you know in the
02:03 - ground sorry i'm gonna set this
02:05 - to seven okay so now we have that done
02:09 - out of the way now we can go into the
02:11 - main character and we can make the
02:13 - fastest score thing
02:14 - so in my original project i made like a
02:17 - high score
02:18 - like uh fastest time thing so we're
02:22 - going to make
02:22 - a variable called timer
02:26 - so this is going to be for all sprites
02:28 - and then we're going to make
02:30 - another variable and name it uh
02:33 - fastest time and has to be a cloud
02:35 - variable
02:39 - so we're gonna put this as a cloud
02:40 - variable click ok
02:43 - so we have the fastest time variable so
02:45 - we're gonna move this on
02:46 - this side so it probably wouldn't work
02:49 - yet because we don't have
02:50 - all the levels laid out yet so we're
02:52 - gonna
02:53 - get into the main character put a one
02:55 - green flag clicked
02:57 - when green flag is clicked we're gonna
02:59 - set the timer to zero
03:02 - set timer to zero and then forever
03:06 - we're gonna keep on updating the timer
03:08 - to the actual timer
03:10 - i'm gonna set the timer
03:15 - timer to the sensing this timer
03:20 - put that in there okay and we're going
03:22 - to get an if then statement so
03:24 - if we're control
03:27 - put that right there if level is equal
03:30 - to
03:32 - seven so i'm making seven levels so if
03:34 - the level is equal to seven
03:36 - that means it's the last level then
03:39 - we're going to put another offense
03:40 - statement
03:41 - and also if timer is
03:46 - less than than the fastest time so if
03:49 - the timer
03:50 - of this person is faster than the
03:53 - fastest time
03:54 - basically less than then we're going to
03:56 - set the fastest time
03:57 - to the timer so then the fastest time
04:01 - will be the fastest person doing it so
04:04 - and after that we're gonna stop the
04:05 - script
04:07 - put that right here stop this script
04:12 - okay so after someone gets the fastest
04:14 - time then we're gonna have to stop the
04:16 - script
04:16 - so after we're done with this let's go
04:19 - work on some other levels so
04:21 - we're gonna go into the ground so for
04:24 - level three
04:25 - i just have the ground
04:28 - a platform up here and it's three
04:30 - presents so we have these in the
04:32 - description if you would like to
04:33 - download them or you can do anything you
04:34 - want pretty much but we just have three
04:36 - presents
04:37 - so we're gonna go into the green flag so
04:40 - we're gonna show it real quick
04:42 - so i wanna put the green flag right here
04:45 - so we're gonna um duplicate this
04:50 - put that under and put that right here
04:53 - so if the level is equal to three
04:54 - we're going to place the clone at 206
04:58 - and 126.
05:02 - oops
05:06 - so stop it okay so this is where i want
05:08 - it to be like somewhere right there
05:10 - so i drag it where i want and you can
05:12 - see it right here
05:14 - and after that we're gonna um we can
05:17 - make another level so we're gonna go to
05:20 - costumes for the ground
05:21 - so you guys can do any whatever you want
05:23 - for your levels but this is what we have
05:25 - for level four i just got a candy cane
05:27 - flipped it to the side a present and a
05:30 - ground
05:31 - so that's basically it and then we want
05:33 - to position the green flag
05:35 - and maybe like right here so we're gonna
05:38 - like go to the code
05:40 - move this duplicate so
05:44 - let me zoom in so if the level is equal
05:47 - to four
05:49 - then we're going to set the position to
05:50 - 202.
05:52 - x is 202
05:57 - 202 and the y is going to be negative
05:59 - 109.
06:02 - okay so that's what we want it to be for
06:03 - level four
06:05 - and then for level five i would like to
06:08 - do this and we're going to put a jump
06:10 - pad right here this is why not because i
06:11 - could jump up here and then get up there
06:13 - so for the jump pad you can go to the
06:17 - ground
06:18 - and just copy i mean not the ground
06:21 - green flag
06:22 - and just kind of copy this code into it
06:26 - drag and drop into the translation but
06:29 - we'll still have to change some
06:30 - some stuff up not everything is the same
06:36 - so obviously we have to make these
06:38 - positions at different places so
06:42 - okay okay
06:45 - so first let's work right here so
06:48 - in here um the first thing i have to
06:51 - change is add something so like we're
06:53 - making the jump pad
06:54 - change costumes as you can see there's a
06:55 - bunch of costumes so in the beginning we
06:58 - want to switch the costume to costume
07:00 - one trampoline one
07:02 - and then in here we also want to do
07:05 - something
07:06 - between take this thing out take this
07:09 - thing out
07:10 - and then we're gonna get another forever
07:12 - loop so we're here let's get it forever
07:16 - forever so this is the jumping
07:19 - if mate touching main
07:23 - so if it's touching the main character
07:25 - the trampoline
07:27 - then we're gonna broadcast a message
07:29 - called bounce so the player will receive
07:31 - that
07:31 - later and it will be able to jump up so
07:34 - we're going to work on that later
07:35 - first we're going to work on this first
07:37 - i'm going to make a new variable i mean
07:38 - uh
07:39 - message and we're going to name it
07:40 - bounce
07:43 - bounce right here so we're gonna name it
07:46 - bounce
07:47 - and then repeat eight times because
07:48 - there's eight costumes
07:51 - as you can see so repeat eight times
07:56 - and then we're gonna do next costume
07:59 - next costume and then wait
08:03 - 0.05 seconds just a little bit
08:06 - wait and then we're going to switch the
08:09 - costume back to the first costume
08:11 - after we are done so down here
08:14 - switch costume to trampoline one and
08:17 - then obviously we have to make these at
08:19 - different
08:19 - locations so right here we're gonna take
08:22 - all this
08:23 - out and just keep one
08:27 - so i'm gonna put a jump pad at level
08:31 - four five i think this is level five or
08:33 - something
08:35 - let's go to ground so this is level five
08:37 - as you can see so we're gonna
08:39 - if level is equal to five we're going to
08:41 - place a column let's
08:42 - show it i want to place this clone at
08:45 - this this location so we're gonna do it
08:48 - at
08:49 - negative 138 and then for the y we're
08:53 - going to do negative
08:54 - 117
08:58 - 117 like that so now we have a jump pad
09:02 - appearing right there
09:03 - so now i have to go back to the main
09:05 - character and we have to uh
09:08 - do the bounce thing so when i receive
09:12 - bounce we're gonna set the g velocity
09:17 - so you jump up higher set g velocity
09:20 - to 30. okay so it just jumped up 30
09:24 - pixels high
09:26 - i'm pretty sure that's high enough okay
09:30 - and now let's play the game let's save
09:33 - it
09:34 - so
09:37 - level two level three as you can see the
09:41 - flag is right there
09:42 - level four level five as you can see the
09:45 - jump pad is working
09:48 - and we have to add a flag right here and
09:50 - then we'll
09:51 - add a flag right here and then we'll be
09:53 - add two more levels and then we'll be
09:55 - done
09:56 - so let's go to the green flag duplicate
09:59 - this code
10:00 - i know it's a little bit tedious putting
10:02 - all this code together
10:04 - so we want to do level five then we're
10:07 - gonna do
10:08 - show this thing let's put the flag
10:11 - like right here i'm gonna
10:14 - put it at 191 f of the x and
10:18 - y is going to be 150 and then level five
10:21 - i'm going to show it right there
10:23 - and then for level six let's see what we
10:25 - have to level six
10:27 - level six what i did was just put a
10:28 - stocking with stuff inside and then i
10:31 - put a candy cane
10:32 - so what you're supposed to do is get up
10:34 - here and jump right here and then the
10:36 - flag will be right here so there's a
10:37 - little platform right here
10:39 - so for level six all we have to do is
10:42 - just show
10:43 - oh yeah we can add some spikes on level
10:44 - six if you guys like
10:46 - so for level six let's add spikes right
10:49 - here
10:50 - i feel like adding spikes let's make
10:52 - this a little bigger
10:54 - zoom in so let's show these spikes
10:58 - so i want to put the spikes right here
11:02 - actually maybe this part right here
11:05 - so for the spikes on level five make it
11:08 - perfect okay there you go
11:09 - i'm gonna make it at 48
11:12 - and 105. and of course we have to change
11:15 - the level
11:16 - so this is level um five
11:20 - and level six so we're gonna put the
11:22 - spikes right there
11:23 - and then i want the green flag to be
11:25 - located right here
11:27 - let's just go to the green flag so
11:30 - duplicate this
11:32 - put that right there and then one equals
11:34 - to level six
11:35 - we're going to do a negative 203
11:39 - and 153
11:42 - like that and then for level 7 we're
11:45 - gonna we i made like a little wall
11:47 - jumping level so
11:48 - i think let's go to the ground costume
11:51 - so for level seven i made like this
11:52 - little wall jumping level
11:54 - basically a bunch of random rectangles
11:58 - and then i'm gonna put the flag up here
12:01 - and there's a little ravine you can fall
12:02 - into and you can die
12:04 - so for this level i'm just gonna
12:08 - hide this for now real quick so all
12:11 - we're going to do is just
12:12 - move this green flag where we want it to
12:14 - be like right here
12:16 - and then we're going to go to the code
12:20 - duplicate put this right here
12:23 - and then we're gonna do level seven so
12:25 - you guys can make as much levels or as
12:27 - little levels as you want but this is
12:30 - just an
12:30 - example of how many levels you should
12:32 - make at least
12:34 - and then 142 like that
12:37 - okay and then after that
12:41 - for the ground after you pass this level
12:44 - maybe we can put this costume
12:48 - up here so
12:51 - let's rename this let's rename this
12:53 - costume to like costume
12:55 - 12 and then rename this to costume 8
12:59 - and then rename it places
13:03 - uh renames
13:06 - and then this one you can rename to nine
13:10 - and then you move this one like this
13:13 - okay
13:15 - so i just and then this is just the
13:17 - thing
13:18 - like the good job you completed the game
13:20 - thing
13:21 - so yeah actually and then we can go into
13:24 - the
13:25 - main character and then instead of doing
13:30 - um six right here we can do seven
13:31 - because i'm adding extra level which is
13:33 - this thing
13:35 - and then we can go to the ground and
13:36 - then we're gonna change this eight
13:38 - so now let's play the game
13:44 - oh yeah and you guys can add music if
13:46 - you'd like
13:50 - and i think the fastest time is not
13:54 - working yet because we also have to
13:55 - change the
13:57 - thing the amount of levels for that as
14:00 - well
14:00 - so i will change this after this demo
14:02 - run
14:05 - so as you can see i'm gonna fall into
14:07 - this ditch and as you see you'll die
14:10 - [Music]
14:12 - and yeah because there's uh this is the
14:14 - last level the flag will not work
14:16 - [Music]
14:18 - okay and then for the fastest time in
14:20 - the main character
14:23 - instead of levels equal to seven we're
14:25 - gonna have to do
14:26 - eight actually this is level seven
14:30 - green flag we have to add one more
14:36 - and a little a mistake in the project
14:40 - because um the fastest time is not
14:43 - showing up
14:44 - because we have to do this less than
14:45 - nine the level's less than nine
14:48 - so now we can save it let's play it
14:54 - and then and then um i'm just gonna
14:58 - do this and then i i can like i guess i
15:01 - can just set
15:02 - the level um
15:06 - also the timer right here as you can see
15:09 - the timer is constantly updating
15:12 - so as you can see the timer
15:16 - shows you how fast you're doing it
15:21 - so i'm gonna quickly finish this
15:27 - and one more level
15:34 - and there's one more minor fix in here
15:37 - so you have to um instead of doing this
15:39 - to seven because i had eight levels
15:41 - i accidentally forgot about this level
15:43 - so i had the changes to eight
15:46 - not seven so it depends how many levels
15:48 - you have so you're going to change this
15:50 - number
15:50 - to according to how many levels you have
15:53 - in the game
15:55 - the fastest time is not quite working
15:57 - because right here we stated that timer
15:59 - is
15:59 - has to be less than fastest time in
16:01 - order to work so one way you can do it
16:03 - is set the fastest time to something in
16:05 - the beginning
16:06 - so like if you set it to like 30 or
16:08 - something
16:10 - 30
16:14 - and then so now the fastest time is 30.
16:16 - so if you get something lower than 30
16:19 - then it will um automatically change
16:23 - another way you could do this instead of
16:25 - just setting it you can use an or
16:27 - statement so
16:28 - or so if the fast time
16:31 - is equal to zero
16:37 - the fastest time is equal to zero and
16:39 - then you put this
16:41 - inside here and then just plug that into
16:47 - okay so now let's play it and see if the
16:50 - fast time will work
16:52 - which i'm pretty sure it will it will do
16:56 - okay one four
17:01 - one five
17:05 - and six this is level six okay i'm
17:08 - almost there okay as you can see the
17:11 - fastest time actually updated to the
17:13 - current fastest time right here
17:17 - so yeah thank you guys for watching
17:19 - don't forget to like
17:21 - share and subscribe and ring the
17:22 - notification bell as well
17:24 - and i'll see you guys in the next video
17:27 - [Music]
17:30 - bye
17:35 - you
