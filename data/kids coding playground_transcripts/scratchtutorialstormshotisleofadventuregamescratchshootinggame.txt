00:00 - thank you
00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's kids going to
00:09 - playground here today we're back another
00:10 - video in scratch today we will making a
00:13 - video on a game called stormshot Isle of
00:17 - Adventure it's actually a game on the
00:20 - Play Store and
00:22 - I'll show you it right now and if you've
00:25 - ever seen like ads on these games this
00:28 - is like what we will be making today but
00:30 - on scratch so let's go and I'll just
00:33 - demo the video so let's play so we have
00:37 - some music going but it's really quiet
00:40 - [Music]
00:41 - so so we're trying to shoot the dancer
00:45 - with uh like a ball so let's see so
00:49 - we're gonna have like a little
00:51 - um where we're shooting Mark with the
00:54 - dots and this is the level current level
00:57 - and these are the amount of lives I have
00:59 - you can as you can see if I shoot
01:01 - upwards it will come back down and hit
01:04 - me which makes me lose a life hey and if
01:07 - I shoot him that means I get to the next
01:10 - level and now I'm on level two and it's
01:13 - basically a strategy and it shows you at
01:15 - the right angle I try to hit him without
01:17 - losing the game or losing all your lives
01:20 - so we're gonna try to find the perfect
01:22 - angle oh I just hit myself that's not
01:25 - good
01:27 - can we find a different angle there we
01:29 - go and
01:31 - um
01:32 - basically we're trying to get to the
01:35 - last level well it's it's forever so
01:38 - once you beat the game
01:41 - it will
01:43 - [Music]
01:46 - um hey reloop around and continue with
01:50 - the next level so I'll try to beat the
01:52 - game real quick
01:54 - hey maybe I'll just try to go down here
01:57 - yeah there we go
01:59 - uh
02:02 - hey this one might be a little tricky
02:06 - so um let's go hey
02:12 - I'm trying to beat this uh game
02:15 - uh yeah we got him hey now we're on the
02:18 - 10th stage
02:20 - and it just Loops back to the first
02:21 - stage it says it's level 11. so let's
02:24 - see how far you can get on with the
02:27 - level so right now I'm on level 11 and
02:30 - it basically loops around and around
02:31 - until you lose all your lives which
02:34 - means it's over
02:37 - and it says game over
02:39 - and that's just basically the end of the
02:41 - game
02:43 - so let's get started so now we're just
02:44 - gonna name the project
02:48 - dorm shot aisles of ad
02:52 - Adventure okay and we don't need the cat
02:55 - well we do have the cat inside the game
02:57 - but
02:58 - um I haven't actually with the gun
03:01 - so here we have him and we're gonna drag
03:05 - in our stuff so we're gonna drag in our
03:08 - backdrop for our
03:11 - project
03:12 - our ball
03:14 - our um stage
03:17 - and our DOT
03:20 - and our game over
03:22 - so you can just download some uh for the
03:25 - backdrop you can just download some
03:27 - photos to put as you can see we have an
03:30 - island and a pirate ship over here we
03:32 - downloaded from the internet and
03:34 - it's really easy to make this backdrop
03:36 - you just have to download the things and
03:38 - if they have background just go to a
03:39 - background remover site and all we did
03:41 - was just get a blue sky background and
03:47 - change the color
03:50 - of the grass
03:53 - to
03:57 - the ocean colors so yeah you just have
04:00 - to click on this and
04:03 - go like that
04:08 - so you can color it
04:10 - and yeah just change it over here
04:13 - and yeah just do that for all the
04:15 - outlines and basically you've got your
04:18 - ocean
04:20 - and yeah just go like that and we have
04:26 - clouds on the other one so we can also
04:28 - add some clouds
04:30 - with some white and no outline and make
04:35 - the clouds White
04:37 - and just add some extra details to our
04:42 - game that's basically our background
04:45 - and yeah
04:48 - and the ground you might want to delete
04:52 - so then yeah and you can just move
04:54 - everything down
04:59 - and basically yeah that's what we have
05:01 - that's basically our background and then
05:03 - you just put on the stage for the level
05:05 - you have and you can duplicate some
05:07 - accessories like the island
05:09 - and the pirate ship you can find these
05:11 - stuff online
05:13 - so I'm just gonna duplicate these and
05:15 - now you have a pretty good setup
05:17 - background to use
05:21 - okay so yeah we're gonna delete that
05:23 - backdrop too and for the cat you can
05:27 - draw your own uh gun
05:30 - it's just really simple some rectangles
05:32 - and then or you can just export it from
05:34 - my project I have the Sprites that you
05:36 - can take I'm gumballs098 and you come
05:39 - over here right click export the thing
05:41 - so then you can use
05:43 - and the balls is just false and then all
05:45 - you have to do is just draw the circles
05:48 - and the dot you can just oh it's by six
05:51 - by six
05:53 - it says six by six so it says six by six
05:57 - over here and that's basically how large
05:59 - you want the dot to beat
06:03 - and the stage you can just design your
06:05 - own stages but we always all we have to
06:08 - do here is make some rectangles and draw
06:12 - some lines
06:13 - to make like the boardwalk type of
06:16 - texture
06:19 - and yeah just make the lines thickness
06:22 - whatever and we just use thickness 10
06:25 - and we just use Brown
06:27 - so that's basically our backdrop
06:32 - so let's get coding so we're going to
06:34 - start with the cat and then okay so
06:37 - we're gonna show the green flag go to
06:40 - the variables
06:41 - and then we're going to make a new
06:43 - variable called Shoot
06:47 - and
06:48 - I will be creating all the variables we
06:51 - need for this project right now so we
06:54 - also have to make the dot variable the
06:58 - level variable
07:01 - the lives variable
07:07 - um
07:07 - the random variable
07:13 - the random variable
07:15 - and
07:17 - the shoot variable
07:21 - I think we already have the shoot
07:22 - variable my bad we should have five
07:24 - variables green
07:27 - so now we have we start at the green
07:30 - flag and then we're gonna go set set
07:33 - shoot
07:34 - to zero and we're now going to set lives
07:39 - to ten you can really vary the lives if
07:42 - you want to to like 11 12 if you want it
07:45 - to make easier or harder and then set
07:49 - level two one which is the first stage
07:54 - and it'll go to
07:56 - X so this is we're on the cat right now
07:58 - and it'll just go to a position around
08:01 - here so then you could do your shooting
08:05 - it'll make a block called
08:08 - start
08:10 - game
08:15 - and now we're gonna code a little piece
08:19 - and we're gonna put start game under
08:21 - here
08:22 - now we're gonna get start game
08:25 - and we're gonna start with clear graphic
08:28 - effects because whenever you get hit you
08:30 - can you might have noticed that you have
08:32 - like a ghost effect so you might want to
08:34 - clear all of those before you start take
08:37 - a forever Loot and then make your point
08:40 - towards Mouse pointer so you can get the
08:43 - amount cap pointing your way
08:45 - and then you need an if and then
08:48 - and if then
08:51 - the mouse unit and so if then the mouse
08:55 - is down
08:57 - and shoot equals zero which means you
09:00 - can shoot again
09:02 - shoot equals zero
09:07 - so shoot equals zero means that you can
09:09 - shoot again because you can only shoot
09:10 - one shot at a time and if you shoot
09:13 - something that means it will set your
09:16 - shoot to one so
09:18 - we might we have to do that set shoot to
09:21 - one and then create the clone of
09:25 - the oddball
09:30 - and now we're gonna go to the ball and
09:35 - when the green flag is clicked
09:38 - and the green flag is clicked it'll hide
09:40 - in the beginning of course
09:43 - because you do not want it like pointing
09:46 - up and then
09:47 - when I started the Clone as you can see
09:49 - we already created a clone over here so
09:51 - all we can do we can jump straight to
09:53 - when I start as a club
09:55 - it will set size to 50 percent
09:59 - might be a little large real and it will
10:02 - go to the cat because that's where it is
10:05 - coming out of
10:08 - and then it'll Point towards Mouse
10:11 - pointer since it will go whatever way
10:14 - you want to go
10:16 - and then it will go to the front layer
10:20 - so let's just put that in and then show
10:25 - and then a point in Direction
10:30 - and we're going to go to sensing take
10:33 - this block and change this one point in
10:37 - Direction
10:38 - cat and then change this one to
10:41 - Direction you always have to change the
10:43 - back one first and not this one first so
10:46 - always change this one then that one so
10:49 - you have point and direction
10:51 - of cat
10:53 - and then you put a repeating a repeat
10:56 - until
10:58 - touching champ 99
11:01 - which is the dancing oh I haven't got
11:04 - the person that's dancing
11:06 - so you might have seen that the person
11:09 - was dancing so
11:12 - I'm gonna go after the ball touching
11:14 - champ 99
11:16 - they'll move
11:19 - 25 steps
11:25 - and if it touches the edge it will
11:27 - bounce and if you could see in our My
11:29 - Demo earlier in this video when you
11:31 - click on it when it touches the edge
11:34 - it'll bounces from the top or bottom
11:37 - and
11:39 - you have a change level by one every
11:42 - single time
11:44 - you win a level so let's put that in
11:47 - level by one
11:49 - broadcast
11:52 - next level
11:57 - and it'll set Shoot To Zero
12:03 - and then it'll delete this click
12:07 - so let's start on another part
12:10 - of the thing so when I start as a clone
12:16 - it'll wait 0.2 seconds
12:22 - this weight is necessary I'll explain to
12:26 - you in a minute
12:27 - and then wait until
12:31 - touching cat
12:34 - okay and
12:37 - I'll broadcast an event called Hit cat
12:44 - so that's if you accidentally shoot
12:46 - yourself
12:47 - then you'll have to use this broadcast
12:49 - and then it will change your life
12:52 - lives by minus one as you can see you
12:55 - have 10 lives so it will change by minus
12:57 - one
13:01 - and it will set Shoot To Zero
13:05 - so you have an opportunity to shoot
13:06 - again and then I'll delete this clone
13:10 - the reason we have this weight over here
13:12 - is because if you don't have this weight
13:15 - then if you set it to like no weight
13:18 - that means oh you'll automatically get
13:20 - hit because the ball spawns right over
13:22 - here so if you don't have the 0.2 weight
13:25 - the ball will just keep on hitting the
13:27 - cat because it will spawn right here
13:30 - and if you that that's why you need to
13:33 - wait because you have 0.2 seconds for
13:35 - the ball to come out of the gun
13:40 - and then now we have an
13:43 - little when I start as a clone
13:47 - it will repeat
13:50 - three
13:52 - wait one second
13:55 - and I'll set Shoot To Zero
14:02 - and we're gonna set Shoot To Zero so
14:04 - get that over here and then delete this
14:07 - clip
14:09 - so now we're going to move on to a large
14:11 - chunk of code so this is to make a
14:15 - randomized outcome every single time you
14:18 - shoot a ball it have probably has a
14:20 - random chance of going to a different
14:22 - direction so
14:25 - so you need this so the ball will delete
14:29 - after three seconds of not hitting
14:31 - anyone because if it just keeps on
14:33 - bouncing between two barriers it gets
14:35 - very annoying and
14:37 - um you'll never hit someone so you have
14:39 - three seconds and the ball will
14:41 - disappear so let's continue to this next
14:43 - piece of code so when I start as a clone
14:47 - go forever
14:50 - you need a if then statement
14:54 - over here so we have if then if it's
14:58 - touching stage
15:01 - then it will set random
15:06 - so this really randomizes the outcomes
15:08 - about where your ball will go so a set
15:11 - random to pick random one to ten
15:15 - this is kind of like a probability type
15:17 - of thing that we're doing here so if we
15:19 - put it if then else under
15:23 - this set like just like that
15:26 - and then if then else and we put an or
15:30 - if we put random equals one
15:39 - or random equals two
15:44 - so this is just like probability
15:47 - foreign
15:48 - and right now we have to put another if
15:51 - then else right into here so if then
15:58 - so if then your random equals one so if
16:01 - you end up drawing a one
16:05 - from
16:07 - the random chance
16:09 - then it will point in Direction
16:12 - negative 60.
16:18 - else It'll point in Direction 60.
16:22 - so if you want a higher chance or a more
16:24 - biased chance of getting like random
16:28 - like getting appointed down to negative
16:30 - 60 you can just decrease this number to
16:33 - a lower number than 10 if you want it to
16:36 - make be more biased and
16:38 - less representative so
16:41 - if you want to do that and right now we
16:43 - have to put it
16:44 - put something in this else over here so
16:47 - else if it's neither one nor two then it
16:52 - will point in Direction
16:55 - Direction
16:57 - where is it
16:59 - you need to multiply so direct put first
17:02 - point multiply
17:04 - so point and direction
17:10 - oh my goodness
17:13 - point and Direction
17:15 - times negative one which means when you
17:19 - shoot it it'll come back to the cat so
17:23 - let's type of the code that we're doing
17:24 - here
17:25 - and I'm gonna try to Clump up this code
17:28 - so you can have a good view on all of
17:31 - this
17:33 - so yeah this is basically our code so
17:37 - feel free to pause right now to check
17:41 - over any of your code
17:45 - okay so let's move back to the cat we
17:49 - are not completely done with the cat
17:51 - because we have to take some other
17:53 - things and account so when I receive hit
17:56 - cat I mean next level if you remember it
17:59 - the broadcast from the ball then it will
18:02 - stop other scripts so we're going to
18:05 - stop all stop other scripts in this
18:07 - Sprite it'll wait 0.2 seconds
18:14 - and it will start game so you can
18:17 - continue to shoot and all that good
18:19 - stuff
18:20 - and then when I receive hit cat
18:25 - then it will stop other scripts in the
18:28 - Sprite
18:29 - put that up here
18:31 - top of the description the Sprite drop
18:33 - P10
18:36 - it'll change ghost effect by 10 so you
18:38 - can have a little visual effect to look
18:41 - at so change effect
18:44 - change ghost effect by 10.
18:47 - and then you need it if then else right
18:51 - under do not put it in here so right
18:53 - here so if then else if the lives
19:00 - is greater than zero
19:04 - basically you get to rerun the game
19:07 - which is start the game
19:09 - or
19:10 - else
19:12 - it will broadcast
19:15 - game over
19:22 - awesome
19:25 - so now we're just going to go to the
19:26 - stage to do some coding so
19:29 - you go over here
19:31 - when I well I mean when the green flag
19:33 - is clicked
19:34 - it'll go to the back layer
19:39 - and I'll switch costume
19:42 - to costume one
19:46 - and then it'll go to
19:48 - just x 0 y 0. and then when I receive
19:55 - next level
19:57 - it was switch costume
20:00 - to all right so I'll explain to you in a
20:04 - minute what this means
20:06 - joins which caused him to join
20:09 - costume
20:14 - join costume
20:17 - mod so take this one put it into the
20:20 - banana section
20:22 - join costume level
20:27 - mod
20:29 - 10. so right now we have 10 levels so
20:31 - the mod is 10 which is basically the
20:36 - remainder
20:37 - of something so I'll show you in a
20:40 - second what that means
20:44 - so if I put over 10 over here
20:46 - and I put 100 over here
20:49 - the mod is zero because a hundred is
20:51 - divisible by 10. but if I put
20:55 - something else
20:57 - like maybe a seven
21:01 - it's seven because
21:04 - a seven cannot be divisible by ten
21:06 - unless and this cannot calculate
21:08 - decimals so the remainder is seven
21:12 - but what if I wanted to put 11
21:15 - the remainder is one because eleven
21:18 - um I mean 10 divided by 10 is 1 and
21:21 - there's one remaining because it's 11.
21:24 - and we have 10 levels
21:27 - and you can see it starts with level
21:29 - zero which is basically level 10 and
21:31 - this is level one level two level three
21:33 - level four all the way up to level nine
21:35 - and then this is level ten so that's why
21:37 - we have to have mod 10. and it'll join
21:41 - the costume which is any of these
21:45 - costumes
21:46 - so that's what we have for the stage
21:50 - okay so now we're gonna code champ 99.
21:55 - so when the green flag is clicked
21:58 - it'll go to
22:01 - so first we're going to change the size
22:03 - it's a little I think it's 50. so yeah
22:06 - and
22:08 - I have some exact coordinates
22:10 - for level
22:12 - uh one
22:14 - so I'm just gonna write down this
22:16 - and then
22:19 - and now we're gonna go forever
22:22 - weight 0.2 seconds
22:29 - yep which are one two seconds and next
22:31 - costume so it is dancing so
22:35 - let's start and you see our champ 99 is
22:39 - in the right place
22:41 - for our
22:44 - level one so this is level one and
22:48 - so now we're gonna go to level two and
22:51 - we're gonna put him in a general place
22:53 - so we're probably gonna put them here
22:56 - so let's now go so when I receive
23:00 - next level
23:04 - so if
23:06 - this might be a little tricky so if that
23:10 - so you need it equals first so if then
23:14 - you need a mod again once again because
23:17 - after when you finish the game it
23:19 - repeats back to level one so you want to
23:21 - keep that remainder into account so you
23:24 - can use this
23:26 - for the money
23:27 - and if you use level mod 10 equals one
23:36 - so
23:37 - basically
23:39 - ah
23:40 - there's 10 levels and the level is equal
23:43 - to one it has to be divisible so and
23:46 - this will find the remainder
23:48 - and then we're going to make it go to
23:49 - this position so let's just put that on
23:52 - and we're just going to dupe
23:55 - no we do not want to add a comment so
23:57 - I'm just going to duplicate this
23:59 - so that if then mod is 10 and then it
24:03 - equals 2 this time
24:05 - that it will go to the general position
24:09 - of where level two is so you see you go
24:13 - to level two drag them to a position
24:15 - where you would want him to be
24:18 - so that would be in this case whatever
24:20 - this position is then you duplicate it
24:23 - again
24:24 - and this time we have to check where
24:26 - level three is so where's level three it
24:30 - I should I would want to put him maybe
24:32 - here
24:34 - so let's just now go to here
24:40 - and
24:42 - put in
24:44 - our stuff
24:47 - and
24:49 - just repeat this process oh yeah I'm
24:52 - gonna change this to three every single
24:53 - time just repeat this process over and
24:56 - over again until you find until you find
24:58 - a place where you want to put champ 99
25:00 - on different places on the map
25:03 - so that's basically the general
25:06 - understanding so I'm gonna go quickly
25:07 - finish this up off camera
25:10 - so yeah okay so I'm on the last part of
25:14 - the level thing so I'm gonna show you
25:16 - and it's for the 10th level which is
25:20 - basically the zeroth level as you can
25:22 - see over here
25:24 - so that's exactly where we're gonna put
25:26 - him so we're gonna write zero instead of
25:29 - ten
25:30 - and we're gonna change him to where we
25:33 - would like him to be
25:36 - yeah
25:37 - so that's basically I have all the code
25:40 - over here
25:41 - um you can if you want to make different
25:43 - maps you can choose wherever you want to
25:45 - put
25:46 - um our character
25:48 - so that's basically for champ 99.
25:53 - so let's move on to the DOT
25:57 - so when the green flag is clicked
26:02 - set ghost effect
26:08 - ghost effect
26:12 - to 100 this is purple we want it red and
26:16 - then you go to this button and then you
26:19 - click pen so you have a whole entire
26:21 - different
26:22 - set of blocks over here so you click
26:25 - drag and erase all
26:27 - if you do not see pen you can click it
26:30 - over here click on this little button
26:32 - over here and you can find all of them
26:34 - there's a lot of new different blocks
26:36 - you can use over here
26:38 - so you can go try those out and we're
26:41 - gonna put in a forever over here and
26:44 - then we're gonna set pen color
26:47 - to
26:49 - let's go about reddish so let's go look
26:52 - yeah maybe that red and then erase all
26:57 - and then
26:59 - make a block called
27:01 - draw
27:02 - dotted line
27:05 - perfect
27:07 - it's called dotted line and then we drag
27:09 - and draw dotted line under there so now
27:11 - Define drawdate
27:13 - so we're gonna set pen size
27:18 - by
27:19 - oh not by two
27:24 - five
27:27 - and then set dot so this is where we
27:29 - have use the DOT and to zero and then go
27:32 - to cat so this is where we because the
27:35 - thing starts on the cat so go to
27:40 - and then pen down so you start drawing
27:44 - and then show
27:49 - and then point towards
27:52 - Mouse pointer because the line if you
27:54 - saw in the demo it follows wherever your
27:57 - mouse goes
27:58 - and then we're gonna have a pretty big
28:00 - repeat until Loop over here so repeat
28:04 - until
28:07 - touching unit workers so repeat until
28:11 - touching Edge so that's when the line
28:15 - stops the dotted line stops
28:17 - or touching stage so that's basically so
28:22 - it doesn't like phase through the stage
28:23 - which would look really weird and then
28:25 - we have the if then statement over here
28:28 - and here and then if then the dot is
28:31 - equal to two
28:33 - so I'm going to put this
28:35 - dot is equal to two
28:40 - so this piece of code just really makes
28:42 - the dotted line become a dotted line and
28:46 - if you do not want this code
28:48 - um it would be just like a laser line
28:51 - and now we have the dot equals two
28:54 - I'm going to set dot to zero and then
28:58 - pen down start drawing process then pen
29:01 - off
29:03 - and then under here
29:05 - I'm gonna get a motion block move 20
29:08 - steps
29:09 - just like that and change Dot
29:14 - by one and then pen up
29:17 - perfect
29:19 - so now we have our DOT done we're going
29:21 - to go to the backdrops for some coding
29:25 - so when the green flag is clicked
29:28 - I'm gonna set the volume well this is
29:30 - pretty much optional but
29:32 - just so you can hear me better
29:34 - it's a 25 and then forever
29:38 - play sound
29:40 - get the little music up and going
29:43 - dance celebrate
29:47 - this is the song
29:51 - play sound dance celebrate until done
29:54 - so now we're gonna hide up the variables
29:58 - maybe move some around so we're gonna
30:01 - hide this this oh Lies We want to show
30:03 - tied dot then what level down here well
30:07 - it's optional where you put the level
30:08 - and put the lives up here
30:10 - so
30:14 - so I just found out something my line is
30:18 - constantly moving like this and that is
30:22 - not great unless if you really want to
30:24 - keep that we can just go to our you see
30:28 - it's just constantly doing that we can
30:30 - just go like that click edit and then
30:32 - click this little button down here so
30:35 - it's going to be a stationary line and
30:38 - our game should be pretty much finished
30:41 - now yep let's try to win hey
30:45 - can maybe
30:49 - ouch
30:51 - hey
30:53 - so yeah
30:55 - the music should be going
30:59 - yep you guys can probably hear the music
