00:52 - and there's a cake and you're supposed
00:54 - to customize the cake so you can click
00:56 - on this button right here and it'll
00:58 - change the color of the cake
01:00 - same with the frosting
01:02 - and you can do that with the candles too
01:06 - and we have a little scratch chat right
01:08 - here dancing and there's the birthday so
01:10 - we actually got this one from this uh
01:12 - official scratch cat game
01:14 - so yeah
01:15 - this is what we have here today
01:18 - so
01:21 - so um
01:22 - this is the official scratch cat
01:24 - animation that they made for the 15th
01:27 - birthday so if you don't if you haven't
01:29 - checked it out go check it out
01:31 - uh so it so the birthday of scratch cat
01:35 - is on may 16th
01:37 - which is on monday so
01:39 - yeah
01:40 - so let's just remix this project
01:43 - and most of the stuff we do not need
01:45 - here
01:46 - so like you we do not need this we don't
01:49 - need this we don't need this we don't
01:50 - need this we don't need this and we
01:52 - don't need this so now we're just left
01:53 - with these two
01:56 - so
01:57 - and we don't broadcast any ready so
01:59 - let's just delete that
02:01 - we're gonna put this on the bottom here
02:05 - and we're gonna shrink the size to 60.
02:10 - we're also going to change the go to
02:11 - because now it's a different go to
02:17 - make it
02:18 - let's do a little bit higher because we
02:20 - need to put the buttons down there
02:24 - so let's go to that and point direction
02:27 - there
02:29 - i'm just going to pull out the hide here
02:34 - so now we're going to change out the
02:35 - music so we don't need this we don't
02:37 - need this
02:39 - and we're gonna do this
02:42 - we need that actually
02:44 - we don't need this
02:47 - i don't need this so we put this over
02:49 - here and this is switching part to end
02:52 - we switch it back up to end which is
02:54 - this one
02:56 - and we play sound this until done
02:59 - and we'll delete the shadow
03:02 - so now let's get the candles and the
03:04 - table out of the backdrop so let's
03:07 - actually keep the shadow on the cat
03:09 - so we can actually do that
03:12 - so we have our shadow here we just align
03:14 - it perfectly to where his feet are or we
03:18 - can just do this yes
03:20 - just put it
03:21 - under his feet
03:23 - make it go back
03:25 - and same with the other dance movement
03:30 - so down here and we go back
03:34 - so we have a shadow for our
03:36 - scratch cat
03:38 - so now let's get the table out of the
03:40 - backdrop and into different sprites so
03:43 - we go to the backdrop
03:45 - so let's get the sprite so first we
03:48 - control x
03:50 - so we cut it and then we paint a new
03:52 - sprite you ctrl v
03:55 - and it's over here
03:57 - and now we just drag it and we have to
04:00 - do that ungroup
04:02 - and then click out
04:03 - pull this out and now we have our table
04:05 - here
04:07 - and we put it over there
04:09 - so we have our cake
04:11 - and we have to control x so we cut it
04:14 - and then we paint a new sprite
04:16 - ctrl v and we have our cake over here
04:19 - so
04:21 - we don't need the cake here so we're
04:22 - just gonna do that and we're gonna
04:24 - ungroup it
04:26 - and we're gonna
04:29 - delete that and we have the 15 which is
04:32 - which are the candles
04:33 - so we're going to move to 15 center it
04:36 - and then we're going to get the candles
04:38 - the candle fire because the fire doesn't
04:39 - look big enough so we're gonna
04:42 - get a cake
04:44 - and then we're gonna go to costumes
04:47 - and we're gonna get this fire
04:50 - we're gonna control c
04:52 - and then we're gonna go control
04:55 - v
04:56 - so there's a bigger fire on the candles
05:04 - and then
05:08 - there's a little uh inside the fire type
05:10 - of thing inside the fire thing we kind
05:12 - of missed it
05:13 - this little white thing
05:17 - so we have to copy that
05:20 - we paste it we bring it out we delete
05:23 - the candlestick
05:25 - and we get the candle fire
05:28 - ctrl c
05:29 - drag it back into here delete that
05:32 - control v
05:33 - put it on the make it larger and then
05:35 - put it on the candle and then we control
05:39 - v
05:41 - and control c this one because we
05:42 - enlarged it and then we put it on the
05:44 - 15.
05:45 - so now we got our 15 candles
05:50 - so
05:53 - so now we're just gonna adjust it a
05:55 - little bit and now it looks good
05:58 - so
05:59 - what we need to do next
06:01 - is group it all together and drag it in
06:03 - the middle
06:05 - so we have our cake here
06:07 - we're gonna delete the fire
06:10 - and we have to delete all these candles
06:11 - because we're not gonna use them
06:13 - and we're gonna delete these one by one
06:15 - over here
06:17 - these little
06:18 - extra texture for the candles
06:20 - and now we're going to get the frosting
06:24 - so we're going to ungroup all of this
06:27 - we're actually going to get the cake
06:28 - first because it's easier then we get
06:29 - ctrl c
06:31 - ctrl x and then we'll get the frosting
06:33 - from there
06:35 - and then since we used control x we
06:38 - paint a new sprite and we control v and
06:40 - then our cake appears here
06:44 - and we name this cake
06:46 - we can name the frosting frosting
06:53 - we name this frosting
06:56 - and we're going to delete cake b
06:58 - so now we have our frosting and cake
07:01 - we're good to go
07:03 - so now i have a button so let's drag
07:05 - that in
07:06 - we're going to get a button here
07:08 - if it's going to load
07:10 - so there we have the button so you see
07:13 - each of them we have a cake frosting and
07:15 - our candles so a background is just a
07:17 - white uh circle with the outline of
07:19 - black
07:20 - and
07:21 - our frosting we just duplicate it in but
07:24 - it gets very thick so we have actually
07:26 - have to change the thickness of
07:29 - the sprinkles and the frosting
07:32 - so you see over here ctrl c
07:35 - we go over here
07:37 - ctrl v
07:38 - and you see it's very big compared to
07:40 - the circle
07:41 - you shrink it
07:43 - the more we shrink it the more thicker
07:45 - it looks
07:46 - so we're actually going to change the
07:48 - thickness
07:50 - to
07:51 - a maybe
07:53 - two
07:55 - so now we have two thickness and we can
07:57 - just drag it easily in but we just
07:59 - decided to delete the dish because it
08:00 - looked
08:01 - a little bit better without the dish
08:04 - so you see here we have that done
08:06 - so the frosting is a little bit more
08:08 - complicated so we're gonna go to the
08:10 - frosting
08:11 - we're going to ctrl c ctrl v
08:14 - into our sprite
08:16 - and you see this is very big compared to
08:19 - the thing like just like the cake and
08:21 - now we have to shrink it all the way
08:23 - down to this size and the sprinkles look
08:25 - really thick
08:27 - so this is not good
08:29 - so we actually have to change the
08:30 - thickness
08:32 - so let's
08:34 - so let's change the thickness of the
08:36 - outline
08:42 - so we're gonna change that
08:44 - to two
08:49 - and now we have that two and we just
08:51 - change every sprinkle so we
08:54 - hold shift and then we can select
08:57 - multiple at a time and making this oh i
09:00 - actually messed it up
09:02 - doing this makes it a little bit more
09:04 - easier
09:05 - for us to change the thickness i'm just
09:07 - showing you examples so you and now we
09:09 - can change all of them at once and now
09:12 - they're a little bit less thick that's
09:14 - how we did it for the frosting
09:18 - yeah just like that
09:20 - yeah and some of them are still pretty
09:21 - thick because we haven't changed that
09:22 - yet so yeah
09:24 - that's what we have for that
09:27 - and now we have the candle
09:31 - so we decided to use the scratch one
09:33 - they had for 15 so we just go click on
09:35 - this 15
09:37 - control c this
09:40 - we control v this
09:42 - and it's just a little bit big so we
09:43 - just shrink it
09:46 - and
09:47 - yeah
09:50 - so
09:52 - you can always decrease the thickness of
09:55 - these
09:56 - little fire pieces
10:00 - in the one
10:05 - so yeah
10:08 - now from three we can maybe do two or
10:10 - one
10:11 - so we have that
10:13 - and this
10:15 - well i think we can keep that we just
10:18 - click that
10:21 - and click it again
10:23 - and we switch to
10:25 - and now we can take out the other now we
10:27 - can just group all of these or we can
10:29 - change these
10:30 - but let's just group that
10:33 - and shrink it
10:38 - so that'll be our substitute 15 instead
10:40 - of this one so
10:42 - let's delete that
10:43 - and let's let's make it a little bit
10:44 - larger and let's put it in there yep
10:47 - and now we have our 15 for our candles
10:52 - so let's get coding
10:54 - so
10:55 - let's do the code for the buttons
10:58 - so when the green flag is clicked let's
11:00 - zoom in a little bit the green flag is
11:02 - clicked it'll go to the front layer
11:06 - it'll switch costume
11:08 - to costume one which is the
11:10 - first costume
11:12 - and we'll go to
11:14 - this position
11:16 - it'll create clone of myself so you'll
11:19 - make three clones of
11:22 - the sprite so when i start as the clone
11:25 - it'll go to the front layer
11:27 - because what if it goes in the back
11:29 - doesn't look good go to the front layer
11:31 - and i'll switch costume
11:34 - to
11:35 - costume number plus one so it gets
11:38 - it just goes up by one costume each time
11:41 - we need the operator
11:43 - costume number
11:45 - plus
11:47 - one
11:48 - now change x by 75 each time so each
11:52 - costume will be separated
11:54 - by each other 75
11:57 - and you need if then
12:00 - so if then
12:02 - not
12:05 - so we need not
12:08 - if then not
12:11 - equals
12:13 - any costume number
12:17 - equals three
12:20 - then it will create clone of myself
12:25 - and when the sprite is clicked
12:30 - if
12:31 - then oh yes what's this
12:35 - if then the costume number is equal to
12:37 - one which is the cake
12:40 - costume number is equal to one costume
12:43 - number
12:45 - then it will broadcast cake color and
12:48 - that will change the cake color so first
12:51 - broadcast
12:54 - make a new
12:56 - broadcast message cake color
12:59 - and now all we have to do is just do
13:02 - we can duplicate this thing
13:04 - and then if costume number equals two
13:07 - it's frosting color this time so just
13:10 - make a new message
13:12 - frosting
13:17 - and we duplicate that and if the costume
13:20 - number is three
13:22 - then we can do
13:26 - candle color
13:30 - so now we have that
13:34 - so
13:37 - so
13:38 - uh now let's get more let's just
13:41 - go to the
13:43 - table
13:46 - so now let's just run the game so you
13:48 - can see
13:49 - and you see i'm dancing you see the
13:51 - buttons so let's work on the table so
13:54 - let's see let's drag the table down here
14:00 - so and let's increase the size of the
14:03 - table
14:05 - to maybe 125.
14:10 - let's actually move here
14:13 - and now we have that we just drag the
14:15 - cake on the table
14:19 - so it's the cake
14:21 - when the green flag is clicked it'll go
14:22 - to this position
14:24 - and then when i receive cake color
14:29 - then it will change
14:32 - color effect
14:34 - by
14:36 - pick random one to 300 so there's a lot
14:38 - of different colors you can choose from
14:41 - and now let's
14:43 - see if it works
14:45 - so you see
14:46 - the cake color is changing so now let's
14:49 - just do the frosting color
14:52 - so when the green flag is clicked
14:55 - we have to make it go to the cake
14:58 - so it's right on top of the cake so
15:00 - we're
15:01 - going to
15:02 - go to the cake
15:06 - and then when i receive
15:10 - frosting color then it will change color
15:16 - effect
15:18 - by pick random one to 300 so let's see
15:21 - if this works
15:24 - so you see oh yeah we also have to make
15:26 - it go to the front layer so let's do
15:28 - that right now
15:33 - yeah so now it's in front
15:35 - and we can change both colors
15:38 - so now let's do the candles so we might
15:41 - have to actually make it go backward one
15:43 - layer
15:44 - because we want the candles to go in
15:46 - front so we just put go backward from
15:48 - there
15:49 - we have our candles here
15:51 - so when the green flag is clicked
15:54 - it will
15:58 - go to about here
16:01 - just make it go here
16:03 - go to here
16:05 - now when i receive
16:09 - candle color
16:11 - it will change
16:13 - color effect
16:15 - like the other ones
16:22 - i'm also going to add go different
16:23 - layers because we always want the
16:24 - candles to be in front
16:28 - let's run the game
16:30 - so it looks like the flame is actually
16:32 - changing colors and we do not want that
16:34 - to happen
16:35 - because who wants blue flames
16:38 - or purple flames so all we have to do is
16:40 - duplicate this 15
16:44 - and then we just throw this away
16:46 - and then we just delete
16:49 - both of these
16:50 - and now we have our flames
16:55 - and we can delete the flames over here
17:04 - so yeah we have that
17:08 - so if the 15 appears to be behind your
17:11 - frosting
17:12 - to just click on it and drag it a little
17:15 - bit and then restart it and it will be
17:17 - fine so right now let's look at our game
17:20 - here
17:22 - scratch guy is dancing it says birthday
17:24 - uh and we have our cake and our table
17:26 - here
17:27 - we can change the color and we made the
17:29 - flame thing so now the flame doesn't
17:31 - change color
17:32 - and now we can make our dream cake
17:35 - so
17:41 - so please like share subscribe and
