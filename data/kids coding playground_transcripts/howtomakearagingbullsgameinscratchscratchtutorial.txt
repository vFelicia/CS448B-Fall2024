00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:11 - another video in scratch
00:12 - and today we'll be making a game called
00:15 - raging bulls and it's actually um
00:18 - a pretty cool game all the artwork is
00:20 - not copyrighted
00:22 - and is actually we got some of them from
00:25 - the internet
00:25 - but most of the artwork is drew
00:29 - drawn by my dad so yeah um
00:32 - let's demo the game my score is 130.
00:39 - you see there's fences here
00:45 - so um you see there's fences here and
00:48 - you have three
00:49 - lives in zero score high score is 130
00:53 - and these fences change every so often
00:55 - to block your
00:56 - view to getting to the red cape
01:00 - and yeah you have all this stuff and
01:06 - you try to get as much score as you
01:10 - try not to lose your can if you lose
01:13 - your lives
01:14 - one to five noob uh less than 10
01:18 - is a loser uh less than 20 is an average
01:22 - less than 50 is a pro and
01:26 - uh less than 100 of the hacker and 150
01:29 - plus is a god
01:30 - so i'm an average okay
01:32 - [Music]
01:37 - okay i'm a noob okay anyways um
01:41 - let's get started on the project so
01:43 - let's make a new project
01:50 - so yeah uh you don't need the scratch
01:53 - cat and i have everything in my backpack
01:55 - so
01:55 - download the google drive script uh in
01:58 - the description below
01:59 - we have everything uh there and
02:03 - yeah you can just get everything we have
02:05 - in the google drive
02:09 - and yeah i'm just gonna upload all these
02:11 - sprites in
02:12 - and the fences are actually drawn by my
02:15 - dad
02:18 - and then we have this and we are done
02:22 - so the three so we have a bunch of
02:25 - fences we're gonna make the backdrop and
02:26 - everything
02:27 - so export you can export the files
02:31 - in in my project and click
02:34 - export and get the project
02:38 - uh um sprite so um yeah
02:42 - so i'm gonna put in the black around so
02:44 - there's a background i'm gonna use
02:47 - and it's this background so we have the
02:48 - whole setup finished remember if you
02:50 - can't
02:51 - go in the google access the google drive
02:52 - go into my project and then download
02:54 - and export the sprites or you can draw
02:56 - them on your own if you were creative so
02:58 - um in the backdrop i'm going to try to
03:00 - attempt drawing the backdrop
03:02 - so we got these flowers from the mother
03:03 - day card game
03:05 - not really a game a mother's day card
03:07 - and
03:09 - we got this kate from the mongos
03:11 - imposter
03:12 - sassy imposter sassy sexy stuff whatever
03:16 - uh um a mongoose animation and this
03:19 - farmer
03:20 - actually have a hand up here so i think
03:22 - we got this from google
03:24 - and um and
03:28 - so um we actually have a hand on top of
03:31 - this one
03:31 - because in the original google one
03:34 - there's um
03:34 - just you know a pitchfork in the farmer
03:38 - and
03:38 - it's just not good i'm just saying
03:42 - and then so i just put a hand on top so
03:45 - his hands and on top of the pitchfork so
03:46 - you can download the sprite export it
03:48 - inside your um uh whatever your project
03:52 - and
03:52 - yeah so we're pretty much set and we're
03:54 - i'm gonna try attempt drawing the fences
03:56 - and the backdrop so i'm gonna make the
03:58 - backdrop backdrop one
04:01 - so first thing we need is a green shade
04:07 - of so fully almost green because we have
04:10 - a little beach area
04:13 - reshape it to make it look
04:17 - like a beach area so yeah
04:23 - i'm trying right now
04:28 - so yeah this is the beach is a little
04:29 - bit big maybe oh yeah i'm gonna extend
04:32 - the other side
04:33 - yeah let's see so there you got it and
04:36 - the beach is
04:37 - uh fine i guess and then we just need
04:40 - that color
04:42 - and make a square
04:45 - uh yeah yeah copy the saturation color
04:48 - and stuff
04:48 - and we now we just have to make a square
04:53 - so yeah we just need this color
04:56 - make the square
05:01 - and you actually have to make it go back
05:04 - so it will be behind it and you will see
05:06 - this
05:06 - well actually i just misproportioned
05:08 - this thing so
05:14 - uh proportionate again yeah and then now
05:16 - i'm gonna get the flowers
05:17 - oh it's a little bit out just make it
05:21 - bigger yeah why not
05:23 - and then yeah i'm just gonna get some
05:26 - flowers you know
05:28 - flowers the mother day card uh if you if
05:31 - you made that project this would be a
05:32 - breeze for you
05:33 - because you can control c ctrl v oh
05:37 - yes and put it over there and you can
05:40 - just uh be creative with your flower
05:42 - amount
05:42 - and your um daisies and there's
05:45 - marigolds and everything
05:47 - and yeah you can just be creative
05:50 - put whatever you want it's really just
05:53 - creativity at this point
05:55 - so when you put it over here you need to
05:57 - group them so it's easier to move
05:59 - if you ungroup it the panels will be all
06:01 - messed up so yeah it's like
06:04 - a different sprites into one so yeah
06:07 - so yeah i advise you to group it so yeah
06:10 - you have to put flowers all around if
06:12 - you did the mother's game decent game
06:14 - this would be really easy for you or you
06:16 - could just export the backdrop for my
06:18 - project so yeah uh so now it's time to
06:21 - work on
06:22 - and make the bowl so
06:25 - this is the bowl and it's idle form when
06:28 - you're not sending anything out
06:29 - no bowls are coming out this is on its
06:32 - idle form and this is like
06:34 - uh when it goes out a new one comes in
06:37 - and then
06:37 - one more goes back so
06:40 - we actually need to um make the ball
06:44 - rotated to the right to make sure uh
06:47 - because it has to go up um and we're
06:50 - using moving steps and you know how
06:52 - moving steps is to the right
06:53 - you have to make it go up so we have to
06:55 - point in direction zero
06:57 - and um keep it to the right so then
06:59 - it'll move up steps
07:01 - while actually moving so yeah i'm gonna
07:04 - try to make the ball
07:11 - by copying it
07:14 - so it has a body and it's like a circle
07:18 - but you just have to reshape it a little
07:19 - bit it's like an oval
07:20 - the hooves are just a square just
07:23 - reshaped
07:24 - with yellow on the bottom and then the
07:27 - tail is just
07:28 - another circles shaped with
07:31 - a tiny little circle and the horns
07:35 - are i think they are circles with
07:38 - just reshaping yeah so
07:41 - that's basically what you need to know
07:43 - about the bowl
07:45 - i'm going to try to attempt to draw the
07:46 - bowl so uh it might not look as
07:48 - the original one look as good as the
07:50 - original one
07:52 - and it's just a circle with this brown
07:54 - color
07:57 - and just a reshape a really a nice
07:59 - reshape we'll do it
08:04 - so and you make and i'm making
08:08 - the whole body
08:12 - so that comes with the ears and
08:14 - [Music]
08:16 - everything else and the potato shaped
08:19 - body
08:24 - so this reshaping would do the job
08:31 - kind of looks like yoda
08:36 - and you're moving body everywhere
08:42 - to making um bull
08:45 - so i'm gonna try to make the
08:48 - [Laughter]
08:52 - foods and uh stuff like that you know
08:55 - just the same brown colors or some
08:57 - reshape
08:58 - so i'm trying to speed run through this
08:59 - so we can get to the coding part because
09:01 - it's already been eight minutes and 55
09:03 - seconds so
09:04 - yeah we can hurry up a little bit
09:09 - yeah and you got who just changed them
09:11 - yellow color
09:13 - you get the point and if you don't want
09:14 - to draw it yourself just go to our
09:16 - project and export the files
09:18 - and feel free to skip this part if you
09:20 - do not want to draw
09:22 - it so yeah
09:25 - hoof
09:28 - yeah you can just duplicate the whos
09:34 - duplicate it to make a second hoove
09:41 - and then yeah
09:45 - i
09:48 - this one has a group
09:51 - and there we go there's a bull
09:56 - with his hooves and now you gotta make
09:59 - its
09:59 - horns the horns is just um
10:06 - this color some dark almost black color
10:10 - and it's dark just really dark brown
10:14 - you just change the color again
10:18 - so i'm going to show you the color of
10:20 - the bowl 6
10:21 - 26 42
10:25 - and the horn is 777.24
10:29 - and there you go
10:32 - uh make a circle just fine reshaping
10:36 - will do the job
10:42 - really fine reshaping
10:47 - a little bent middle there we go
10:50 - uh horn and then we just have to put
10:51 - this on ctrl v
10:55 - and then flip horizontal put on one side
10:58 - put this one on the other and make it go
11:01 - to the back
11:05 - so i don't think this looks originally
11:07 - the same
11:08 - but you know let's just delete that
11:10 - costume
11:12 - and you yeah the tail literally forgot
11:15 - about it
11:17 - it's just um a really thin
11:23 - uh cube or circle
11:34 - and so yeah
11:37 - just be running through it's already
11:39 - been 11 minutes let's go let's go
11:42 - uh just group it and put it on you get
11:44 - the point you get the point
11:49 - and yeah reshape a little bit so i'm
11:52 - gonna put this back on
11:54 - group group group this might end up to
11:55 - be like 40 minutes because of all this
11:57 - artwork and we're done okay
11:59 - let's see the total views and minimize
12:00 - minimize minimize
12:02 - so this is our goal okay now delete
12:05 - costume
12:07 - and you also have to make an idle
12:08 - animation just
12:11 - two bowls yeah rotate it and just put
12:13 - two bowls together so
12:15 - now we have to draw and that's pretty
12:17 - much it oh the fence defense defense
12:20 - so this will take a while it's just a
12:23 - diamond
12:24 - which is um
12:27 - 8 53 66. it's a
12:31 - diamond and it's a square
12:34 - with um
12:38 - it's just a square with fine reshaping
12:40 - and
12:41 - of course uh yeah
12:44 - circle and yeah reshaping
12:49 - this will take a while but there's two
12:52 - light parts
12:56 - so as you can see i'm trying to draw
13:06 - and um
13:10 - it doesn't look that much like a
13:13 - kite but i think it's a kite
13:19 - and then and then you need a little
13:22 - square
13:23 - rectangle on top which is just some fine
13:26 - edited
13:26 - um and you need a lighter version of the
13:29 - diamond
13:30 - put it behind the original one
13:37 - and yeah make a bunch of duplicates
13:40 - stuff like that you know
13:43 - and make a thing in the middle
13:50 - okay okay okay whatever um
13:54 - back yeah so yeah we have it um
13:57 - how you make your fence gate and how to
14:00 - make the
14:02 - fencing the long part is just a
14:04 - rectangle
14:05 - with fine reshaping that's it
14:14 - so yeah um just some fine reshaping
14:18 - just make another one and then put it in
14:20 - the back you know you know the drill
14:22 - um just put the
14:26 - eye dropper
14:31 - the eye dropper and yeah whatever i'm
14:34 - gonna change the color of the back piece
14:41 - so there we got it look that's the mail
14:43 - so now i'm just going to delete this
14:45 - costume
14:46 - so now we're actually going to get
14:48 - started with the code it's been 14
14:50 - minutes and
14:51 - almost 15 now so so we
14:55 - have to make the green grass and
14:58 - the little smoke so yeah i bet
15:02 - you guys can do that on your own pretty
15:04 - easy
15:06 - now we're going to start with the farmer
15:08 - which is going to be the first thing
15:09 - we're going to code today
15:11 - and the only
15:14 - code it has is to go to this position
15:17 - just in case if someone moves it
15:20 - and now the cape the cape has
15:24 - very simple code as well so when the
15:26 - green flag is clicked
15:30 - it will go forever
15:34 - and oh yeah i have to make it go to here
15:38 - and then you need a if then statement
15:42 - if then touching charging bull
15:47 - change score by one and you have to make
15:50 - a new variable
15:52 - score you know every single game we
15:56 - basically make a score inside so
15:58 - change score by one
16:02 - and wait 0.1 seconds
16:06 - a little delay is good inside the code
16:10 - so when the bull touches the cape you
16:11 - don't get like seven points because
16:13 - they'll just glide through the
16:15 - cape so low delay is good and now we're
16:18 - gonna work on the ball
16:20 - this bolt yes this bowl and
16:24 - when the green flag is clicked it will
16:26 - switch costume to costume one
16:28 - and costume one is this costume
16:32 - because there's a new bowl coming up
16:36 - next and it'll go to this position
16:39 - yeah i already have it because there's
16:40 - backpack and everything and i'll point
16:42 - in direction zero
16:43 - because it's pointing right
16:48 - now i'll point up because element i have
16:50 - to make it move steps so
16:52 - you need to make it point in direction
16:53 - zero so when the green flag is clicked
16:56 - forever if then
17:01 - touching mouse pointer
17:05 - then wait until mouse down
17:11 - so the reason we used uh wait until
17:13 - mouse down and stuff like that
17:15 - is because um
17:18 - if you do uh whatever um the
17:22 - uh when the sprite is clicked it will
17:24 - just you can still shoot it after when
17:26 - the game is finished
17:27 - so we do not want that to happen so
17:30 - we're gonna use
17:32 - this and i'll broadcast
17:36 - this message called charge forward
17:41 - so remember feel free to pause if i'm
17:44 - going too quick or i'm going too slow
17:46 - you can like speed it up
17:47 - and wait 0.2 seconds
17:52 - and switch costume to costume one
18:00 - now we're going to work on the charging
18:02 - bowl because once you shoot the
18:04 - ball like once you click it you'll go
18:06 - that way right
18:07 - so and a new bull comes up you can
18:09 - already see its horns in its head so
18:12 - that's why we did that
18:15 - and charging bowl so now we're gonna
18:17 - work on the charging roll
18:18 - uh sorry and it's gonna be depending on
18:23 - clones
18:24 - and stuff like that to make it move and
18:27 - uh
18:28 - stuff like that so you can send multiple
18:30 - bubbles at a time so when the green flag
18:32 - is clicked
18:33 - it will hide and set score to
18:36 - zero
18:40 - you'll also set lives to three which is
18:42 - a new variable
18:44 - because you want three lives right
18:48 - or you can make three million lives no
18:50 - one's here to judge you
18:51 - so so i'm just going to change the name
18:55 - of this because one of its capital
18:57 - one if it's not capital so let's just
18:59 - score
19:00 - and go forever
19:05 - if then
19:09 - uh operator lives
19:12 - equal zero
19:15 - yeah you know the point we've done this
19:17 - so many times already so
19:19 - you probably know the point right now
19:23 - um if the lives equal zero or the lives
19:26 - are
19:27 - less than zero which is like negative
19:29 - lives it will
19:30 - broadcast game over and i'll send that
19:33 - noob chart to you so yeah
19:35 - we'll work on that later
19:41 - and now we have to work on the
19:44 - one this clone so when i receive
19:47 - charge forward it will create a clone of
19:50 - myself
19:53 - and now we're gonna have a whole entire
19:54 - space dedicated to that
19:56 - so when i start as a cologne
19:59 - it will go to bowl because of course you
20:01 - need to go to the bowl because once you
20:02 - click it it has to look realistic and
20:04 - hit the flag
20:05 - so so the charging roll has to go to the
20:07 - ball
20:09 - as expected and it will point in
20:12 - direction zero as well
20:15 - because you wanted to go that way so
20:18 - yeah uh and switch costume to costume
20:21 - one
20:22 - which is at this point uh
20:27 - this bowl and this is like the stunned
20:28 - bowl once it hits the fence
20:30 - so yeah switch costume costume one
20:34 - show and start sound gallop
20:38 - like this type of sound called gallup
20:40 - look
20:42 - because it's running at the
20:45 - uh running at the red flag
20:49 - so we actually found in this sprite
20:50 - library and you can cut it to make it
20:53 - uh uh smaller so then it would be really
20:56 - fast
20:57 - see look fast and easy so
21:00 - repeat until touching cape
21:04 - touching the cape because it has to keep
21:06 - on going until touching the cape
21:08 - or else oh move 10 steps keep on moving
21:11 - and don't touch the cape
21:13 - but if then
21:18 - if the um
21:21 - you need two or statements so or
21:24 - and then another or if it's touching
21:27 - fence one fence two or
21:28 - fence 3 it will stop
21:33 - and become stunned and go back so
21:38 - fence 2 and fence
21:42 - 3. there we have it
21:45 - you know switch costume costume two
21:49 - and wait 0.1 seconds
21:52 - because small weight is good
21:59 - so the costume two is when the ball hits
22:02 - it
22:02 - and i'm trying to move this a little bit
22:04 - let's move this so you can see the whole
22:06 - script oh
22:07 - oh there we go and then uh wait 0.1
22:10 - seconds so if it hits the fence
22:12 - and hide and
22:16 - last of all delete this clone
22:21 - so if you delete it in the end because
22:23 - if you use clones you have to delete it
22:24 - at one point and then the end
22:27 - hide oopsie hide
22:32 - delete this clone
22:35 - so we're halfway finished and now we
22:37 - have to use the fence
22:40 - and so i'm going to show you the uh what
22:43 - i have right now so
22:45 - i'll show you
22:51 - so you can send multiple at the time so
22:53 - this is what we have coded
22:55 - so far and fence one
22:58 - when the green flag is clicked oh yeah
23:01 - we forgot to name this
23:02 - raging bulls
23:06 - oh as you can see in my if you saw it
23:08 - uploaded in my profile already
23:11 - so yeah you can check that out and when
23:13 - the green flag is clicked it will go to
23:14 - this position
23:16 - already there and it'll switch costume
23:19 - to costume
23:20 - one
23:23 - the only reason i did this is because
23:25 - it's on the right side and one of them
23:26 - is the left side and they clash in the
23:28 - middle
23:29 - at one point so switch costing the
23:31 - costume one
23:32 - and then go forever
23:36 - if then else so i did two variants to
23:39 - make the fence look better
23:40 - so it's going to rotate so on the first
23:42 - time it will be this fence
23:43 - second time it will be this fence and
23:46 - for this one the first time it's going
23:47 - to be
23:47 - this this fence and the second time is
23:49 - going to be this fence so it's just
23:51 - opposite
23:52 - looks cool it's better you need it if
23:55 - then
23:55 - else if then the costume number equals
23:58 - one
24:02 - equals one because um it's the first
24:04 - costume right so if the costume number
24:06 - equals one it'll glide one second
24:09 - to i just picked the random number that
24:12 - actually was reasonable
24:13 - to me it has to stay the same why
24:15 - because you know of course
24:18 - so it'll glide to that position and so
24:21 - yeah look at the number it'll go around
24:23 - here right so
24:24 - so yeah it'll move there and the y is at
24:28 - 60
24:29 - so then it will not move
24:32 - so the wa so the fence will go up there
24:35 - and it's like around 70.
24:36 - but i just did 71. why not so
24:40 - 71 i mean i mean 70 but it's 71
24:43 - so well you can just do 7d because just
24:46 - round up you know
24:47 - and then duplicate and then else it will
24:50 - glide
24:51 - 250 no i mean not 250
24:54 - 30 because the longer fence
24:59 - the shorter fence glides longer because
25:02 - it's
25:02 - shorter than the longer fence so that
25:05 - means it'll go
25:06 - glide more than the longer fence so
25:08 - it'll glide around here
25:10 - like about here maybe yeah about there
25:12 - and the longer fence would glide around
25:14 - yeah around 33. see and this one would
25:17 - glide
25:17 - like back like here
25:21 - or so as so so yeah
25:25 - um yeah and now wait 0.5 seconds
25:32 - so make sure and
25:35 - it'll glide so it'll go back
25:39 - and it'll glide one second back to the
25:42 - normal
25:44 - position as you can see it's already up
25:46 - there and
25:48 - now it will wait a pic random to 0.5
25:52 - um seconds
25:57 - so 0.5 to 2
26:02 - and next costume
26:06 - and when the green flag is clicked it'll
26:10 - go forever
26:11 - [Music]
26:12 - and if then touching the charging ball
26:14 - it'll drop lives by one so
26:17 - if then you know the point touching
26:20 - charging ball
26:22 - you'll drop the lines by one it'll wait
26:24 - a point five seconds
26:29 - change lives by minus one
26:33 - and zero point five
26:38 - so we're doing this on the fence because
26:41 - if we're doing this on the charging bull
26:43 - it will just get messed up and it'll
26:46 - lose
26:47 - too much live so that's the reason why
26:50 - we're doing it on the fence and not the
26:52 - charging bowl
26:54 - that's because we're using clone so that
26:57 - makes it
26:58 - easier for us to see the point here
27:01 - so yeah
27:07 - so i'm gonna bring this down to the
27:09 - fence one and fence three
27:12 - i mean fence two and fence three and
27:14 - then i'm gonna
27:16 - and it's about the same code for all of
27:17 - them but you just have to change the x
27:19 - and y
27:20 - and toggle in and off with them so i'm
27:22 - just going to work on this one so let's
27:24 - zoom in a little bit
27:26 - and when the negative 250s would be on
27:29 - the
27:30 - left side right so it would look a lot
27:33 - better
27:34 - on the left side so yeah
27:37 - switch costume costume one and copy
27:39 - number equals one
27:41 - it'll glide to a different position
27:42 - negative 100
27:44 - you know you can toggle in and out with
27:46 - these x's and y's
27:48 - to make sure so this one's negative 125.
27:51 - and this one instead of writing nega
27:53 - it'll glide negative 250 instead of 250.
27:58 - we already got one done and this one we
28:00 - just have to drag this to here
28:03 - and bam we're almost done
28:07 - in like 30 minutes and in the third
28:10 - fence it'll be a little bit lower so
28:11 - that y has to go down a little bit
28:13 - so it's negative 25 and the x is
28:16 - negative
28:17 - 250 like the right fence and
28:20 - it will move like this consistently
28:24 - and it'll go forever
28:27 - and yeah this is all correct it'll glide
28:29 - one second
28:31 - negative 15 25 so you just have to
28:34 - toggle in and out
28:35 - i mean negative 25.
28:38 - toggle in and out with these numbers and
28:41 - negative 25
28:43 - and here it would be negative 15.
28:49 - so yeah um and we can also change the
28:53 - glide seconds
28:55 - if you wanted to well yeah i just did
28:57 - that
28:58 - and wait 0.5 seconds one second
29:02 - and instead of negative 250 it would be
29:04 - 250
29:05 - and instead of negative 60 it would i
29:08 - mean 60 will be negative 25.
29:10 - you know pick random and all this i pick
29:12 - random seconds
29:13 - so one two three so the third fence is
29:15 - less buffed
29:16 - than the first and second one slower
29:19 - worst so now we're going to work on
29:21 - sprite one which is the scoreboard and
29:24 - the um thing that tells you if your new
29:27 - pro hacker god whatever
29:29 - so yeah let me show you the fences are
29:31 - moving first
29:34 - so we haven't done the music either yet
29:36 - so yeah there we go
29:38 - fences are moving and we're losing lives
29:40 - rapidly
29:41 - so this is actually working so
29:44 - when the green flag is clicked
29:48 - you'll go to x0 y0 of course
29:51 - and then it'll hide
29:54 - so the costume is one to five noob
29:58 - less than ten loser uh less than twenty
30:01 - average
30:03 - and uh yeah i use text i use handwriting
30:05 - so
30:06 - handwriting is my favorite see uh and
30:09 - yeah
30:10 - that's pretty nice and less than 50 is
30:13 - pro so
30:14 - this is actually and the high score is
30:16 - 130 for the main game so that's actually
30:18 - pretty good
30:19 - and um go to x x00
30:23 - and then when i receive game over
30:27 - it will go to the front layer
30:30 - so it would be on top of everything the
30:32 - farmer everything the cape
30:33 - everything so and it'll go show
30:37 - and if then you have to make a cloud
30:40 - variable
30:42 - a high score if then you need the
30:44 - greater sign on unmake the
30:46 - if then the score is higher
30:50 - than high score and you have to make
30:53 - this a
30:54 - cloud variable and
30:57 - you click ok um and then
31:01 - you put high score over here then you'll
31:04 - set
31:04 - high score to score
31:08 - of course because you just won the high
31:10 - score so you're the new champion
31:12 - and it'll stop all so there we have it
31:15 - the whole entire game oh yeah we have to
31:17 - also have to add the music and i think
31:19 - it's pretty much
31:21 - very simple i've done this so many times
31:25 - forever get a nice song guitar towards
31:30 - one
31:33 - oh my god how do you spell guitar guitar
31:38 - guitar chords run
31:42 - this one guitar chords one
31:45 - and play sound and there we have it
31:48 - our brand new game is crafted
31:53 - and we can also move score down and
31:56 - stuff
31:57 - high score wise on the other side so it
32:00 - looks pretty good
32:01 - [Music]
32:05 - and you try to make it to the other side
32:08 - without screwing up
32:16 - no so i died one to five
32:20 - is new less than 10 is loser
32:23 - less than 20 is average less than 50 is
32:26 - pro and less than 100 as hacker
32:28 - 150 plus is gone so the high score right
32:31 - now for my raging bull game
32:35 - my original raging bowl game
32:39 - is 130 good job guys
32:42 - i don't even think i can reach 50 yeah
32:47 - good job and someone said he got a
32:49 - thousand they got a thousand
32:51 - and so they said that they got a
32:54 - thousand
32:55 - i use four hours to play this but it
32:57 - isn't in the high score so i'm really
