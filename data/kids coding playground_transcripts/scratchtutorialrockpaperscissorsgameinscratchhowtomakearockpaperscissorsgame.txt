00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello and welcome back to
00:08 - kids coding playground and today we will
00:10 - be doing another tutorial in scratch
00:13 - so today we'll be making a rock paper
00:15 - scissors game
00:16 - inside scratch so first i'm gonna show
00:19 - you how
00:19 - the game works so let's go full screen
00:22 - so the player can select either the
00:24 - paper
00:25 - rock or scissors rock paper scissors
00:28 - to say select rock um
00:31 - as you can see it said player wins
00:33 - because rock beats scissors and
00:34 - see if i paper i win again computer pick
00:37 - rock
00:38 - when i get scissors i win again because
00:40 - the computer uh
00:41 - played a paper so it's like a simple
00:44 - rock paper scissors yeah and if they
00:45 - both pick the same thing it's a tie
00:48 - and computer wins because they picked
00:50 - paper and i picked rock
00:51 - so yeah it's a simple rock paper
00:53 - scissors game it's like the one where i
00:54 - do a python tutorial on
00:56 - rock paper scissors it's like the same
00:58 - thing so
01:00 - all right so let's get started by
01:02 - creating a new account so
01:04 - i'm new new project so it's a new
01:06 - project we're gonna name it
01:07 - rock paper scissors game
01:11 - that's good okay let's delete the
01:12 - scratch cat let's import some sprites
01:15 - first i have the let me put this one
01:18 - first
01:18 - so this is a player and this is the um
01:20 - enemy uh computer
01:23 - so inside i have three costumes of rock
01:25 - costume
01:26 - paper costume and scissors same the
01:28 - computer i have the rock costume papers
01:30 - costume and the scissors costume so we
01:32 - will put these into google drive so you
01:34 - guys can download them
01:35 - i just got these images from online
01:38 - so yeah and then we also have the
01:41 - um button where you click the rock the
01:44 - paper button
01:45 - and the scissors button and also we have
01:49 - the result button
01:53 - yeah so this is just like the computer
01:56 - wins or the player wins
01:57 - thing and then finally we have a
01:59 - backdrop to put in here
02:03 - like that so the backdrop kind of looks
02:04 - like this we actually got this
02:06 - backdrop from like some other old
02:08 - scratch project
02:09 - i don't know what it's called but like i
02:11 - got this from somewhere
02:12 - all right so inside the player we are
02:14 - going to start coding
02:16 - actually now let's start coding in the
02:17 - backdrop so inside the backdrop
02:19 - we're going to code like all the results
02:22 - and all that stuff
02:23 - so first we're going to start off by
02:26 - making a new custom block we're going to
02:28 - name the
02:29 - custom block called check results
02:32 - so we're going to make a custom block
02:34 - called check result
02:36 - all right after we have created the
02:40 - custom block check results we will get
02:42 - back to that later first we will have to
02:43 - go to the buttons
02:44 - so in the button we are going to uh make
02:47 - a variable
02:48 - in the
02:52 - variable called choice one which is the
02:55 - choice for the player
02:57 - and inside the rock i'm just going to
02:58 - make it go to whatever this position is
03:02 - so there's a group like let's go to
03:03 - whatever negative 175 y 80 and we're
03:06 - going to show
03:09 - and when we click on the sprite
03:14 - we're going to set this choice 1 to rock
03:17 - so the player click picks brock we're
03:20 - gonna broadcast a message
03:21 - and we're gonna name it start game
03:27 - start game alright now let's go to the
03:28 - paper button
03:31 - inside the paper button we're also going
03:33 - to make it go to whatever this position
03:35 - is one green one clicked
03:37 - go to negative 109.80
03:40 - and we're going to show
03:45 - when this sprite is clicked we're going
03:48 - to
03:49 - set the choice one variable
03:52 - to paper
03:56 - and then we're gonna broadcast start
03:58 - after
03:59 - start game after you uh click this all
04:01 - right so
04:02 - and then finally we have the scissors
04:04 - which is also the same thing
04:05 - the button scissors we're going to get
04:07 - it when green fly clicks
04:09 - go to whatever this position is negative
04:11 - 45 y80
04:13 - and we're going to show
04:16 - and whenever when the sprite is clicked
04:20 - we're going to set the variable choice 1
04:23 - to scissors
04:26 - scissors and we're going to broadcast
04:29 - the message
04:29 - start start game so basically these
04:33 - sprites are basically the small mini
04:34 - version of these
04:35 - and we just drew a black uh box
04:39 - that covers it all right
04:42 - now let's go to the backdrop so inside
04:44 - the backdrop we are going to
04:46 - when i receive the start game bro
04:48 - broadcast message
04:50 - we are going to broadcast we have to
04:53 - broadcast and wait actually so then
04:55 - wait for the action to finish so we're
04:57 - gonna broadcast
04:58 - new game new game
05:02 - and we're going to uh broadcast
05:05 - and wait show result
05:10 - show result this is these uh broadcasts
05:12 - are for later but i will just
05:14 - uh put them right now and after that
05:17 - after showing the result we want to
05:18 - broadcast
05:19 - game over so obviously it does not do
05:22 - anything yet because we have not
05:23 - broadcasted the message
05:24 - so now we're going to work on the custom
05:26 - block so we're going to define whatever
05:27 - this custom block
05:28 - means so now we are going to
05:32 - um make the custom block define the
05:35 - check
05:36 - result so before we begin coding we're
05:38 - going to make a few variables
05:39 - so we're going to do choice 2 and choice
05:42 - 2 is the
05:43 - computer um like the
05:46 - your opponent the computer we're also
05:48 - going to make
05:49 - another variable called winners so you
05:51 - know who's going to win
05:53 - all right and we're going to get if
05:54 - elsington first so
05:57 - in this define we're going to get if the
05:59 - choice 1 is equal to choice 2
06:01 - meaning the if the player is equal to
06:03 - the
06:04 - computer so if they're both equal then
06:06 - that means it would be a tie right so
06:08 - we're going to set the variable winner
06:10 - to time
06:13 - and then um next we're going to get
06:15 - another if else
06:16 - statement so if else
06:19 - inside here so if choice one is equal to
06:22 - rock so
06:24 - let's say the player chooses rock so the
06:26 - player doesn't change you have to
06:27 - remember that
06:28 - so the players uses rock and then we're
06:31 - gonna get another if l statement put it
06:33 - right here
06:34 - and if the um computer chooses paper
06:38 - which is choice 2 paper
06:43 - then we're going to set the winner to
06:45 - computer because paper beats rock so
06:47 - we're going to set choice 2
06:48 - i mean winner wrong variables
06:52 - winner we're going to set winner to
06:54 - computer
06:57 - and next we will get and just duplicate
07:00 - this we're going to set else
07:02 - we're going to set it to player so the
07:04 - player will win because
07:05 - the computer will pick scissors and the
07:07 - player is rock
07:09 - all right and then we're just going to
07:11 - duplicate this
07:13 - right here put this in the else
07:17 - um just take this out so if
07:21 - choice one we're gonna need if else
07:23 - another if else in here so
07:25 - we can just remove that for now so if
07:27 - the choice one
07:28 - player is equal to paper get another if
07:31 - else
07:33 - and if the choice two
07:36 - let's duplicate this choice two is equal
07:39 - to
07:40 - oops choice two is equal to
07:43 - scissors well scissors
07:46 - beats paper and player uses paper and
07:49 - the computer chooses scissors
07:50 - so we're going to set the winner to
07:52 - computer
07:54 - set the winner to computer
07:58 - else right here we're going to set the
08:00 - winner to player
08:04 - player because the player will win
08:06 - because the computer picks rock
08:08 - and the player has chosen paper all
08:12 - right
08:13 - and then one last if else condition
08:15 - right here
08:16 - inside here we're going to get an if
08:18 - else statement so
08:20 - right here we're gonna get if else if
08:23 - this thing is equal to rock choice 2 is
08:26 - equal to rock
08:29 - rock so if the computer chooses rock
08:32 - then we will set the winner to
08:38 - computer
08:40 - because the player would have chosen
08:42 - scissors and we don't need to check
08:44 - like this if else condition on top
08:47 - because the player will pick scissors
08:51 - and then else we're going to set the
08:53 - winner
08:55 - to the player because the computer would
08:57 - have picked
08:58 - uh paper and the player would have
09:01 - chosen scissors
09:03 - so right this thing is basically the
09:05 - same thing as
09:06 - this thing but this isn't necessary
09:11 - so you can also do this if you want
09:16 - that is basically the same thing but
09:19 - we don't need to check the condition
09:20 - because the player will have picked
09:22 - scissors all right and after we're done
09:25 - defining this thing
09:27 - the check results we are going to go to
09:30 - my blocks
09:31 - and put this right there all right
09:34 - all right now let's go to the computer
09:38 - we're gonna start coding on the computer
09:40 - first
09:41 - so right here we broadcast a new game
09:43 - right so inside the computer we're going
09:45 - to receive a message
09:46 - when i receive new game
09:51 - new game let's zoom in then we're going
09:54 - to
09:54 - repeat five times
09:58 - next costume so when a new game starts
10:02 - like when the player chooses something
10:03 - we're going to like make it change
10:05 - costumes a little bit so
10:07 - it'll look a little bit cooler i guess i
10:11 - guess i don't know
10:12 - and we're going to set we're going to
10:14 - make a list actually so this we're going
10:16 - to make a list called computer
10:18 - choice so this is like a list for
10:21 - whatever the computer chooses
10:22 - so first we're gonna set the variable uh
10:25 - choice two
10:26 - um and we have to do one green five
10:30 - clicks
10:30 - first we have to code the list and then
10:32 - we can work on this one
10:34 - so first we're gonna have to delete
10:35 - everything of the list
10:37 - delete all of computer choice and we're
10:39 - gonna add
10:40 - three things we're gonna add rock paper
10:44 - and scissors so we're going to add these
10:46 - three things to the list
10:50 - scissor
10:53 - spell it wrong seriously
10:56 - and then we're going to get the item
10:59 - thing item
11:00 - one of computer choice we're going to uh
11:04 - set the choice to pick random
11:05 - one to three item of the
11:09 - computer choice like that
11:12 - now okay if else statement if
11:16 - if uh the choice two is equal to rock
11:20 - so let's say the computer picks rock
11:24 - if choice two is equal to rock then we
11:26 - will switch the costume to rock
11:29 - which is obviously the rock costume
11:34 - and then we can just duplicate this if l
11:36 - statement
11:38 - they're not common oops duplicate uh put
11:41 - that in here and the else
11:43 - and if choice two is equal to paper and
11:46 - the else
11:47 - then we're gonna search costing the
11:48 - paper else we're gonna switch it to
11:49 - scissors
11:52 - like that so yeah
11:55 - so this is just switching the costume
11:57 - okay now let's go to the player
11:58 - the player sprite we're gonna when i
12:00 - receive new game
12:03 - okay let's zoom in hello understand new
12:06 - game we are going to
12:08 - we can honestly just like drag and drop
12:10 - this into here just change a few things
12:12 - up
12:13 - obviously we are taking this out we can
12:16 - keep all this
12:17 - instead we're going to do choice one and
12:20 - choice one right here with new rock
12:23 - paper
12:24 - and scissors so yeah obviously you'll
12:27 - switch to the corresponding uh
12:28 - costumes like that
12:32 - all right the player was pretty simple
12:33 - now let's go back to the buttons
12:35 - we'll have to code a little bit more in
12:36 - here so it's just really simple when i
12:39 - receive
12:40 - new game we're going to hide
12:44 - hide and when i receive
12:47 - game over we're also going to hide just
12:50 - drag and drop this
12:50 - for each one like that
12:58 - all right we're not quite done yet
13:01 - because we have
13:02 - it's also the result code that one's
13:04 - pretty simple honestly um let's go to
13:06 - the results
13:07 - this thing so inside the result we will
13:10 - be
13:10 - uh when green fly clicks for us we have
13:12 - to like set the position now
13:15 - whatever this position is we're gonna
13:18 - hide
13:20 - and when i receive new game
13:25 - new game we are going to hide
13:28 - and when i receive game over just
13:30 - duplicate this let's
13:32 - receive game over we're also going to
13:34 - hide
13:36 - and then when i receive show result
13:41 - we're going to show
13:44 - so basically in the backdrop um
13:47 - we broadcast show results so like once
13:51 - the player and computer are done then it
13:53 - will show the results
13:55 - of who wins so right here we have two
13:57 - costumes
13:58 - i mean three costumes we have player
13:59 - wins computer wins and a tie
14:02 - and three costumes we're gonna show it
14:05 - and we're gonna do if else if
14:09 - the winner is equal to the
14:12 - tie so if they both tie
14:15 - we winner is equal to time
14:19 - then we are going to switch costume to
14:22 - the thai costume
14:24 - duplicate this if the winner is
14:27 - um player switch costume to player wins
14:33 - else is going to switch the costume to
14:34 - computer wins
14:36 - all right and then right here we're just
14:38 - going to make it look better by
14:40 - changing some graphic effects so we're
14:41 - going to
14:43 - uh bro repeat two times uh and then
14:46 - we're going to
14:47 - set the color effect to 50
14:50 - just make it turn purple that means turn
14:52 - purple i'm gonna wait
14:54 - 0.25 seconds and clear
14:58 - graphic effects and now we're going to
15:00 - wait another
15:01 - 0.25 seconds so boom like that
15:05 - all right so now let's save the project
15:08 - let's run the game so let's go full
15:10 - screen as you can see
15:12 - i lost because i had rock and the
15:14 - computer had
15:16 - the uh paper and one thing we could do
15:21 - is let's go back to the button inside
15:24 - the button
15:24 - right here this actually is supposed to
15:26 - be show sorry about that
15:27 - so then you can continuously play you
15:30 - don't have to stop like you don't even
15:31 - clicking the green flag
15:33 - to restart so you have to actually you
15:35 - can actually put show if you would like
15:37 - right here if you don't want the game to
15:38 - stop so you can put show
15:40 - like that all right
15:44 - the results pretty sure you also put
15:47 - show no you don't
15:48 - need i don't think you do so let's save
15:51 - it again
15:52 - let's try it again so all right
15:55 - as you can see i won as you can see you
15:57 - don't have to keep on clicking the green
15:58 - flag
15:58 - to get these things come back again so
16:01 - it's pretty good
16:02 - i win again hi
16:05 - uh computer wins so yeah
16:08 - it's pretty cool pretty simple rock
16:11 - paper scissors game on scratch
