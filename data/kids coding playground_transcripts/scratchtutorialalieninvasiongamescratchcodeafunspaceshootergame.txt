00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back to kids coding playground
00:08 - today we'll be doing a alien invasion
00:10 - game on scratch so the point of the game
00:13 - is you use like spin the turret around
00:16 - you move it left and right and you try
00:17 - to shoot the ufo up here so we're gonna
00:21 - play the game so
00:22 - let's start the game i'm gonna turn on
00:23 - the volume a little bit too loud um so
00:25 - you can move the turn only to the left
00:27 - and right as you can see and then you
00:29 - can use the spacebar to fire at the
00:32 - alien ship
00:34 - as you can see there's a timer up here
00:36 - so once the time reaches zero and you
00:37 - don't defeat the ship then that means
00:39 - you will lose and if you can defeat the
00:41 - ship within the time and then you will
00:43 - win so i'll show you guys what will
00:45 - happen if you lose so when you lose it
00:47 - will just say you will lose and then
00:49 - play some losing music
00:51 - um and each bullet does 5 damage so if
00:54 - you shoot it
00:55 - 20 times you should be able to take it
00:57 - out as you can see it says you lose and
00:59 - that should be game over
01:01 - and then i'll try to win this time okay
01:03 - so
01:04 - [Music]
01:16 - it's a little bit hard to hit the ship
01:34 - so that's what happens when you win
01:36 - it'll have a little explosion effect
01:37 - right there
01:38 - so
01:39 - as you can see it's quite hard to beat
01:40 - the game but it is possible to win
01:43 - okay now let's start a new project and
01:45 - get coding so we're going to start a new
01:48 - project
01:48 - i'm going to start off by renaming our
01:50 - project
01:51 - to alien invasion
01:58 - so alien invasion we're going to delete
02:00 - scratch cat i have everything in my
02:01 - backpack so we have the
02:04 - turret
02:06 - we have the
02:07 - bullets we have the
02:09 - alien ufo with the wind and loose so
02:13 - right here the alien ufo
02:15 - i mean the turrets so this is how we
02:17 - drew
02:18 - so
02:19 - uh first we have a circle so right here
02:21 - we have red on the outside and white on
02:23 - the inside
02:24 - then right here we have the
02:26 - glass so
02:27 - this is the glass like the thing
02:30 - on the turrets and then right here we
02:31 - have the cannon the gun
02:33 - and what we did was let me ungroup it
02:36 - here i'll show you so
02:37 - what we did was we got like some dark
02:41 - gray
02:42 - and then we stacked it on top
02:44 - to make it look more like a turret so
02:46 - as you can see if you put it all
02:48 - together
02:50 - correctly um it should look pretty good
02:53 - like that it should look like this
02:56 - so
02:57 - that's what we have for the turret
03:00 - and if you want to download it you can
03:01 - go into our shared project and you can
03:03 - download it from there
03:05 - and um
03:07 - our turret you can draw if you want um
03:09 - just draw a circle uh kind of like a
03:12 - glass and then draw tur like the gun
03:15 - right here we have the bullet
03:18 - so right here as you can see the bullet
03:20 - is not centered so the center is like
03:21 - right here but we move the bullet a
03:23 - little bit to the right it's because we
03:24 - wanted to make it kind of look like a
03:26 - shooting out of the barrel
03:27 - and not like the turret itself so like
03:30 - we want to move the bullet like a little
03:31 - bit forward so it's like up here and
03:33 - what we did is just draw a oval and just
03:35 - put different colors so it's pretty
03:37 - simple to make the bullet
03:38 - and for the ufo we drew this one as well
03:41 - so
03:42 - basically it's so we have two green
03:44 - things for the antenna with the yellow
03:47 - lines and then we right here we reshaped
03:48 - a circle into like a
03:51 - semi-circle and then right here we have
03:52 - another uh longer semi-circle and for
03:55 - the base of like the spaceship and then
03:57 - we have the three i don't know if this
03:59 - is i guess they're wheels
04:01 - or something like that so we just put
04:02 - three of these
04:04 - and then right here we have the
04:05 - explosion what we did for the explosion
04:07 - is we drew a bunch of like stars
04:09 - red orange yellow all these stars and
04:11 - put them just layer them on top of the
04:13 - ufo
04:15 - so
04:16 - it's pretty simple to draw the ufo
04:20 - so yeah that's pretty much an overview
04:22 - of all the different sprites
04:24 - now let's get on to the code okay so
04:26 - first we're going to start with the
04:27 - backdrop so for the backdrop um what we
04:30 - did was we had the
04:33 - um
04:34 - we had the stars backdrop
04:36 - and
04:37 - i'm gonna go ahead and get it for my
04:39 - backpack
04:40 - okay so i just quickly got all the uh
04:43 - backdrops so here we have our stars
04:45 - backdrop we're gonna rename it to the
04:46 - backdrop so this is like the backdrop we
04:48 - use
04:49 - so we use this backdrop for the game
04:51 - so it's just gonna be the backdrop and
04:54 - then right here we have the start and we
04:56 - have the ready so we're going to delete
04:58 - this one so we have the ready and then
05:01 - start so basically it goes like ready
05:02 - and then starts and then as soon as that
05:04 - happens you switch to this one and the
05:06 - game starts so right here we have the
05:09 - ready so like um in our last video i
05:12 - showed you guys how to make your text
05:14 - kind of look like this so if you want to
05:16 - learn how to do that you can go ahead
05:17 - and watch that video but if you don't
05:19 - want to do it then you can just write
05:21 - the text like start ready so yeah we
05:23 - just made our game look a little bit
05:24 - better by doing this
05:26 - and then so we're going to get into the
05:27 - code so
05:29 - right inside the backdrop we're going to
05:30 - get a one green flag clicked
05:33 - i'm going to zoom in a little and then
05:34 - we're going to have to make a variable
05:36 - we're going to name it timer so timer
05:39 - so we have the timer and then i'll just
05:41 - move to the other side because the
05:43 - ufo hp will be on the left side and then
05:46 - we're going to give them 30 seconds so
05:48 - the timer set the timer to 30
05:51 - and then we're going to switch the
05:52 - backdrop to ready in the beginning which
05:54 - is the first one as you can see ready
05:56 - start that one so ready and then we're
05:58 - going to wait uh 0.5 seconds so it's
06:01 - going to wait a little bit before
06:02 - switching to the other one
06:03 - we're going to switch into the start
06:06 - backdrop
06:08 - and then we're gonna um play sound so
06:10 - we're gonna i have a pretty sure there's
06:12 - like a symbol sound or something but
06:13 - that's what i have for their single
06:16 - fashion
06:17 - yeah this one so i'm gonna be using this
06:19 - one um so we're going to use play sound
06:22 - crash symbol until done
06:24 - and then we're going to switch the
06:25 - backdrop to the backdrop
06:27 - like the uh game backdrop and then we're
06:29 - going to broadcast a message called
06:30 - start so this message starts is going to
06:34 - start everything else like all the other
06:35 - sprites we're going to broadcast it from
06:37 - the background
06:38 - start
06:40 - so start and then when i receive start
06:42 - here so this is going to be like the
06:43 - timer this is how you code time so when
06:45 - we receive start here
06:47 - so when i receive start we're going to
06:49 - repeat until
06:51 - timer is equal to zero
06:53 - so
06:54 - when the timer reaches zero then they're
06:56 - going to lose so we're gonna do timer
06:59 - so repeat till timer is equal to zero
07:01 - we're going to wait one second so it's
07:03 - gotta wait one second and then minus one
07:04 - because it goes down every one second so
07:06 - we're gonna change the variable timer by
07:08 - negative one every second
07:10 - and then we're gonna broadcast a message
07:12 - called lose so you'll lose if you run
07:15 - out of time so you have to lose
07:18 - and then right here let's get into the
07:20 - turrets so we're going to start coding
07:21 - in the turret
07:22 - um so for the turret we're going to get
07:24 - a one through flight plate let's zoom in
07:25 - again
07:26 - we're like flight we're going to go to
07:29 - so this is the position i had to go to
07:31 - zero negative 175 so about right here
07:34 - and we're going to point direction of
07:35 - 90.
07:36 - so basically for our turrets um
07:39 - we made it side uh up like up facing up
07:43 - and our bullet facing the side
07:45 - because we want our uh our turret to
07:47 - only rotate from zero to 180 degrees
07:50 - so we're gonna make it a point direction
07:52 - of 90
07:53 - and then we're going to do a one receive
07:56 - start so this is going to be the
07:57 - movement of this art so movement we're
08:00 - going to go to start and then forever
08:03 - um if
08:05 - right arrow is pressed
08:07 - key right
08:08 - is pressed
08:10 - then we're going to rotate 4 degrees to
08:12 - the right
08:14 - and then we're going to duplicate this
08:16 - and delete just trash this and then if
08:19 - we're doing the left side then we're
08:20 - going to rotate 4 degrees to the left
08:22 - and then right here we're going to point
08:24 - direction of the absolute value of the
08:25 - turret so as you can see earlier the
08:27 - turret cannot flip upside down so we
08:29 - just want it to go left to right so
08:32 - that's why we're using the absolute
08:33 - value of the turrets um so there's no
08:37 - negative numbers so it should be only
08:39 - able to move from zero to 180 so this
08:43 - half of the circle so here we have the
08:45 - zero
08:47 - about zero right here to 180
08:49 - so it should be only able to move
08:52 - the
08:53 - through these two quadrants
08:56 - okay so
08:58 - set it back to 90.
09:00 - okay so next after we get the movement
09:02 - done we are going to have to make it so
09:04 - the turret cannot flip upside down and
09:06 - go the negative direction so we're going
09:09 - to only make the turret go left to right
09:11 - like that so um as you can see
09:14 - uh so i'm going to uh play it so then
09:17 - it's at 90 so what we want to do is just
09:19 - make the turret from 0 to 180 so um and
09:22 - then we're going to take the absolute
09:24 - value of that so then it can't go
09:25 - negative
09:26 - so absolute value is basically just the
09:28 - distance from a number to zero so let's
09:30 - say you have negative five the absolute
09:32 - value is five just get rid of the
09:33 - negative sign same with five absolute
09:35 - value five is five so it's just the
09:37 - distance from zero
09:39 - and
09:40 - basically we just want it to go left and
09:42 - right so we're going to have to take the
09:44 - absolute value of the direction so we're
09:45 - gonna make it point in the direction
09:49 - point direction absolute value
09:51 - of the direction so we're gonna go
09:53 - motion and then direction
09:55 - so like that
09:57 - so we'll save it let's play it
10:00 - as you can see
10:01 - the turret is not able to flip upside
10:03 - down
10:05 - and it's just stuck so if i try to like
10:07 - press it doesn't work i can't go past
10:09 - this
10:10 - i can't go past two and i can't go past
10:13 - 178
10:15 - so as you can see it is working
10:17 - and now let's go into the bullets so
10:19 - onto the bullet
10:20 - um
10:21 - we have some code for this one as well
10:23 - so we're going to go whenever if i
10:24 - clicked we're going to hide the bullet
10:26 - in the beginning
10:27 - and then we're going to when i receive
10:30 - so when i receive start so when we start
10:32 - the game
10:33 - we're gonna forever loop
10:35 - we're gonna forever if so we're gonna do
10:38 - it spacebar to shoot the bullets we're
10:40 - gonna do if
10:41 - key space is pressed
10:43 - then we're going to go to the turret and
10:46 - make it go to the turn
10:48 - and we're going to point direction at
10:50 - the direction of the turret minus 90. so
10:52 - the reason for that is because the
10:53 - bullet is pointed towards the side and
10:55 - the turret is pointed up
10:56 - so
10:57 - if we were to minus 90 so we're gonna so
11:00 - if we're to minus 90 it would be right
11:02 - side up so since the turn is already
11:04 - facing 90 and minus 90 it'll be facing
11:06 - zero which will be facing up which is
11:09 - the way the turn is facing so
11:11 - we're going to
11:12 - go to turret and then we're gonna point
11:14 - in direction
11:16 - and then uh we're going to get
11:18 - minus
11:20 - and we're gonna minus 90
11:22 - and then we're gonna direction of the
11:23 - turret
11:24 - so we're gonna get this thing
11:29 - and then we're gonna select the turret
11:31 - and then direction
11:32 - so there we have it and then we're gonna
11:34 - next we're gonna show
11:36 - and then
11:37 - after that we're gonna start sound so i
11:39 - have a sound it's called laser so i went
11:42 - online and got it there so what i did
11:44 - was use the sound thing recorded it
11:47 - from the video
11:48 - and got this out so you can get that
11:50 - from online they have some laser sounds
11:51 - in the scratch library but i don't think
11:53 - it's as good as this one
11:54 - and then next we have the repeat sign we
11:56 - get the repeat loop so we're going to
11:58 - repeat nine times
11:59 - so it's going to move 40 steps so this
12:01 - is going to make the bullet move and we
12:03 - can move 40 steps
12:06 - and then next if the is touching the ufo
12:10 - so if it's touching the ufo we're gonna
12:12 - have to put that inside the repeat so if
12:14 - touching ufo the bullet is touching the
12:16 - ufo we are going to
12:19 - wait 0.01 seconds so it's going to stay
12:21 - there
12:22 - for a fraction of a second to make sure
12:24 - that's actually hitting the ufo
12:26 - and then it's going to hide
12:29 - okay so like that
12:32 - and then we're going to hide put a hide
12:33 - down here
12:34 - so let's say else the let's say the
12:38 - bullet hits the side it will also hide
12:40 - so
12:41 - that's why you have to hide right there
12:43 - so now we can play it
12:45 - so
12:47 - you can see you can shoot the bullet
12:51 - yeah so when you shoot the spaceship of
12:53 - course it doesn't
12:54 - do any damage or anything it just stops
12:57 - yeah that's basically what we have we
12:59 - have the shooting and the movement done
13:02 - next let's hop into the ufo okay let me
13:04 - zoom out so i can show you guys all the
13:05 - code
13:07 - okay now let's go into the ufo
13:09 - so inside the ufo we are going to make a
13:11 - new variable we can name it
13:13 - ufo so this is the ufo hp this is the hp
13:16 - for the ufo
13:17 - i move to the corner and then i'm gonna
13:19 - reflect lights
13:23 - clicked we are going to
13:24 - go to this position
13:27 - uh i i'd say 50 80 that's what i had
13:29 - last time so
13:31 - uh 50 80
13:33 - and then we're going to switch the
13:34 - costume to ufo
13:36 - the first one not the explosion one so
13:37 - we're gonna switch to the first one and
13:38 - then we're gonna make it have 100 health
13:41 - so like in my other game i put it as a
13:43 - hundred so i'm using 100 and then when i
13:46 - receive the message start
13:49 - so let's start the game
13:50 - we are going to forever loop
13:53 - and then we're going to go glide it
13:54 - we're going to glide 0.5 seconds
13:57 - and then we're going to make it pick
13:58 - random so we're going to it's going to
13:59 - glide to random places
14:00 - make the plot pick random
14:02 - negative 230 to 230
14:06 - and then for this one for the y we're
14:08 - going to
14:09 - duplicate that and i'm just going to
14:11 - make it go to
14:12 - 20 to 170.
14:14 - okay so now we have the gliding and then
14:17 - right here we're gonna do if the ufo has
14:20 - less than or equal to one hp
14:22 - then we're gonna stop the script so if
14:25 - the ufo
14:27 - has less than or equal to so less than
14:30 - oops
14:32 - let's put that in here less than or
14:33 - equal to zero
14:36 - so basically if it's lost all its hp
14:40 - then we are going to stop the script
14:42 - stop the script and then down here after
14:44 - this we're going to um do the shooting
14:47 - so if you get if the ufo gets shot it
14:50 - will initiate some other code so we
14:52 - don't want it to be interfering with
14:53 - this one so we're going to make a two
14:55 - different scripts so two different
14:57 - scripts we're gonna get the one receive
14:59 - start
15:00 - scroll down
15:02 - uh i'm gonna get a forever loop
15:05 - i could actually put this on this side
15:06 - actually so you guys can see both
15:09 - so
15:09 - forever and then we're going to do if
15:11 - then statement so if
15:13 - so if this thing is touching the bullet
15:15 - the spaceship is touching the bullet
15:18 - then we will um start sound screech i
15:21 - have the sound right here
15:23 - and then we're going to change the ufo
15:24 - hp by negative five
15:26 - so each bullet should do negative five
15:29 - five damage so we're gonna do
15:31 - by negative five
15:33 - and then after that we're going to
15:34 - repeat eight times and change the color
15:36 - effect so we're gonna make a change
15:37 - color effect just so you can see that
15:39 - it's taking damage i'm gonna repeat it
15:41 - eight times
15:42 - and then we're gonna do change color
15:44 - effect by 25
15:47 - change color effect by 25
15:51 - and then next we're going to clear all
15:53 - graphic effects after it's done
15:55 - put that under the repeat sign the
15:57 - repeat loop and after that we're going
15:59 - to do if
16:02 - so under the graphic effects we're going
16:05 - to do if
16:07 - it's if the ufo has less than or equal
16:10 - okay duplicate this
16:12 - and then so if it has less than or equal
16:14 - to zero hp
16:16 - then we will switch costumes to the ufo
16:18 - explosion
16:20 - and then we're gonna broadcast a message
16:22 - i'm gonna call it win
16:23 - so you win the game after you defeat the
16:25 - ufo
16:28 - oops broadcasting message
16:32 - and then we're going to stop the script
16:34 - once you win so we're going to stop
16:37 - the script
16:39 - okay so now we win
16:41 - we're going to make the win and loose um
16:43 - sprites work now so we're going to go
16:45 - into our wind sprite so inside our wind
16:47 - sprite i'm going to first get a
16:48 - lingering flag plate
16:50 - and green if i clicked we're going to go
16:52 - to zero zero
16:53 - that's the origin
16:55 - and then i'm gonna get a hide so it's
16:57 - gonna hide in the beginning
16:59 - and then when i receive win
17:03 - so when you win
17:04 - go to the front layer
17:08 - go to the front layer and then we're
17:09 - going to show
17:10 - and then we're going to play the sound
17:11 - explosion so i have the sound right here
17:14 - um
17:15 - and then next we're going to stop all so
