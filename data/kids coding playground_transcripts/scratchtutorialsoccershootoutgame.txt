00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding lagron and another video to
00:12 - the sequence of future and projects from
00:15 - kids like you so this is a project Jalen
00:19 - my cousin submitted to us it's called
00:22 - soccer shootout so that one of the game
00:24 - is to shoot this ball into the goal
00:27 - without the goalie blocking it so we'll
00:32 - be learning these following concepts
00:33 - today and stretch custom blocks
00:36 - broadcasting messages using brain
00:38 - operator touching sprites when key
00:41 - pressed and hit boxes so let's demo his
00:47 - game so when you shoot you press the
00:53 - spacebar the ball will go into the goal
00:55 - and I'll say goal up here and you can
00:59 - move him there are some things you can
01:03 - improve them because whenever you shoot
01:06 - a goal and you move the ball will move
01:10 - with you and you don't want that and
01:15 - there's also these two buttons are here
01:18 - which you can use the increase and
01:20 - decrease the speed of the golden wait
01:22 - time if you do this they'll increase the
01:25 - speed by 7 so now we'll wait 7 seconds
01:29 - before moving to this next spot and if
01:32 - you click this they'll decrease it so
01:36 - next I'll move every 1 second so see now
01:40 - it's faster moving to its next spot and
01:43 - instead of instead of gliding instead of
01:47 - moving to the x + y position we can use
01:50 - gliding to make the game more smoothly
01:53 - run more smoothly so there's also this
02:00 - goal we can also change it to a hitbox
02:02 - instead of this and hide the hitbox with
02:06 - ghost effect so without further ado
02:11 - let's get on to the project
02:13 - so I already have a project right here
02:17 - that has all the sprites already so
02:22 - these are all the sprites you'll need so
02:24 - before I can continue on the code I
02:26 - would like you guys to hit the like
02:28 - button subscribe to our channel share
02:30 - our video and comment down in the
02:33 - comments below on what you think about
02:35 - this video so these are the sprites you
02:40 - need all these sprites are from the
02:43 - sprite library and scratch so you can
02:47 - just search them here and this one is
02:50 - just um a dress print this one paint
02:53 - spray paint spray so first we'll start
02:56 - out with the green button this one's
02:59 - supposed to trace the speed so when the
03:02 - sprite is clicked we one dragon if then
03:09 - statement so we'll need variables the
03:15 - speed points and ball is moving those
03:18 - are the three variables we will need
03:19 - okay
03:20 - so we'll need the greater than symbol so
03:26 - if the speed is greater than zero then
03:30 - any number over 0 then it will change
03:34 - the speed by - neck is zero point one
03:38 - change the speed so what this basically
03:41 - does is make the speed go down by zero
03:44 - point one every time you click the
03:45 - button and we'll need a one click so we
03:53 - can set the X and y position to this
03:56 - position and set the speed to 1 as the
04:01 - default speed to 1 as default so next
04:11 - we'll work on the stop button which is
04:13 - kind of like the thing that makes it um
04:16 - makes the speed go up so it'll take
04:19 - longer time so we'll need the one sprite
04:23 - clicks when sprite clicks right here
04:27 - if then statement great we need a less
04:31 - than symbol
04:32 - each time so if the speed is less than 2
04:36 - 2 is the maximum speed you can cope to
04:40 - there no change the speed by 0.1 so this
04:43 - button makes its peak go up and speed
04:46 - will make the Goldie transition slower
04:50 - so you need a 1 clicks let me fly click
04:54 - set the X and y position okay so now
05:00 - next we'll make the goal text we're here
05:04 - it's one it's a pause the video if you
05:07 - need time to write it out so you can
05:09 - rename this to full text so we will set
05:17 - the X and y position first on the click
05:21 - to go to this position and hide we'll
05:27 - need more code for this goal text later
05:29 - so now next we'll be working on the goal
05:35 - which is technically the hitbox I'm
05:37 - gonna troll the hitbox so I'm gonna make
05:47 - the hitbox for the goal
05:49 - [Music]
06:08 - okay so this should be good enough you
06:11 - could rename this to on hitbox hitbox
06:18 - the code for the hitbox really simple
06:20 - all you need is to go to this position
06:28 - and set the ghost effect to 100 what the
06:41 - ghost effect does is basically making
06:42 - this thing hide they're not really high
06:45 - because if you hide it won't detect
06:46 - anything so you have to set the ghost
06:49 - effect Oh subset that goes to 100 so it
06:54 - will disappear so if you play it the
07:01 - cool the hitbox is not there anymore
07:05 - so yeah and this is not the right
07:13 - position so let me change the X in my
07:15 - position of this okay now let's move on
07:23 - to the Goldie spring this sprite will
07:27 - need to custom blocks called one
07:29 - Tollbooth holy okay and you also need
07:39 - one more block of check ball so with
07:47 - check ball you first of all there's a
07:51 - move going to find the move of Goldie
07:53 - block first okay and we'll need a
07:56 - forever loop so what this basically does
07:59 - is just move the goalie randomly around
08:01 - this box right here this box okay so we
08:07 - need to get a glide speed speed is the
08:12 - variable of how fast or slow the goalie
08:15 - glides to the different place and pick
08:19 - random negative 85
08:23 - to 100 so that negative 85 to hundreds
08:30 - around this area into the box and then
08:34 - the Y picker in I'm reading 25 in 1850
08:43 - so this is move goal even announced to
08:47 - find the check ball function so you need
08:50 - a forever loop and you need it if then
08:55 - statement inside the forever loop saying
08:57 - if then it's touching the soccer ball
09:00 - which is the ball then we can broadcast
09:06 - a message called missed this is just to
09:15 - say that um if you hit if it the goalie
09:18 - touches the ball they'll broadcast a
09:20 - message called missed because you didn't
09:22 - make it to the goal your know when
09:24 - clicked go to this x and y position the
09:30 - goalie can go to the front layer and we
09:37 - need to call this the function roof
09:40 - goalie and we'll need another one click
09:43 - block call the function check ball the
09:49 - reason why we can't put check ball right
09:51 - here is because this is a forever loop
09:53 - so it will not call the check ball
09:55 - function so if you play this it will
09:58 - only play it will only play the this one
10:02 - and she just a one the default okay so
10:12 - now if you have to put this right here
10:15 - because if you put it down here it won't
10:17 - work so next we'll move on to the player
10:25 - player so for the player will need if
10:32 - the spacebar is pressed
10:35 - then if then ball moving ball is moving
10:42 - is equal to n which means no or you can
10:45 - write no balls moving ball is moving is
10:52 - equal to no then move ten steps so glide
10:56 - towards the goal then wait one second
11:04 - then we can broadcast a message called
11:07 - the kick kick and set the ball moving to
11:22 - Y because now the ball is colliding
11:24 - towards the goal and obviously it's
11:28 - moving set the x and y position off the
11:34 - player in the beginning it's in this
11:40 - position and then when clicked you know
11:43 - one clicked set the x and y position
11:49 - then set the hall to moving time no
11:52 - because in the beginning your ball is
11:55 - not moving to end next you want to do
12:05 - the movement left and right so go to
12:07 - events and drag in om left arrow key is
12:11 - pressed then I'll change the X by
12:16 - negative 10 so I'll move to the left
12:18 - side by negative 10 then we can
12:25 - duplicate this instead of just changes
12:28 - to right and change X by 10 now we need
12:37 - to go on to the Soccer Bowl
12:40 - so first we'll need to custom blocks for
12:44 - the soccer ball call one call set ball
12:47 - left set ball up and set ball right set
13:01 - ball right so you got to cussing blocks
13:04 - to find the left one first okay so good
13:09 - so you want it to go to x position and y
13:15 - position of X position of the player and
13:22 - Y position of the player so it will
13:26 - follow the player so player x position
13:32 - to have a player and y position the
13:37 - player Y position and we need to add 20
13:44 - so yeah add 20 Y position plus 20 then
13:56 - we'll need to we can duplicate this code
13:58 - oops
14:05 - but instead instead of this we need to
14:12 - add 25 for the x position we needed to
14:21 - add because you want it to follow the
14:23 - player and why this issue yep that seems
14:29 - right so this is an X in my position
14:32 - it took blocks we just defined now we
14:36 - have to call those functions so if the
14:38 - left arrow is pressed
14:47 - then if then statement if then the ball
14:52 - is moving is equal to no equal to n ball
15:00 - moving equal to n then set ball left so
15:06 - you call this function right here so if
15:09 - the what arrow is being pressed then you
15:13 - call this function right here then we
15:16 - can duplicate this code and right arrow
15:20 - is being pressed set ball and moving to
15:24 - know instead of calling the left one
15:25 - call the right one then we need a one
15:28 - clipped one flag click statement set the
15:36 - points to zero so the points will reset
15:39 - every game putting direction of zero and
15:42 - zero is upward so the so the ball will
15:48 - point upwards point direction of zero
15:56 - and go to this x and y position in the
16:02 - beginning okay now there's still some
16:09 - more code to the soccer ball so that's
16:11 - not all for the soccer ball so we'll
16:17 - need to receive the kick remember the
16:20 - kick one like hick it will point
16:24 - direction of zero
16:30 - pointing direction of zero yes then we
16:37 - need a repeat until touching the goal or
16:39 - goalie so the ball will keep on gliding
16:41 - until either such as the hitbox which is
16:45 - the gold technically and or touching the
16:49 - goalie
16:49 - okay so repeat until touching you need a
16:56 - or Steven operator touching gold hitbox
17:08 - touching the hitbox or touching the
17:13 - goalie then we'll need to move two steps
17:16 - so move it will move out a little bit if
17:23 - then if then is touching the goalie if
17:27 - then touching the goalie touching cool
17:34 - so if it's touching the goalie then
17:36 - broadcast goal and wait this this goal
17:45 - would broadcast to the coal tag so it
17:47 - will say you school if it if it's
17:55 - touching the hitbox right now you have
17:59 - to put this sir next you'll need to if
18:05 - it's touching the hitbox then go and you
18:11 - also need to add stop this script at the
18:15 - end of this so we won't keep on running
18:22 - so when this receives goal I'll let you
18:27 - seal the code so if you need to copy
18:28 - something down then you can do it right
18:31 - now
18:32 - then if you receive the goal the goal
18:38 - goal the goal message then
18:43 - each points by one because point the
18:47 - score will go up every single time you
18:49 - hit the hitbox point on set ball is
18:54 - moving to no post it's not moving
18:55 - anymore once it hits the goal wait two
19:01 - seconds and then call the function call
19:07 - the function set ball up again you can
19:11 - duplicate this and change the receive to
19:15 - miss change and take out the points
19:18 - because you don't score if you miss
19:20 - change it to n yeah that's right you can
19:24 - wait two seconds and set ball like it
19:30 - it's missed so now you can actually
19:35 - decree this two one one second if you'd
19:37 - like next we finally have more more for
19:43 - the goalie sprite a little bit more for
19:48 - the goalie so for the goalie if it
19:51 - receives Miss then stop other scripts in
19:57 - the sprite because he miss and it won't
20:00 - move anymore
20:01 - stopped other scripts in this bright
20:05 - then you can say say for like one second
20:11 - you missed you missed you guys and then
20:22 - you can broadcast a message and wait
20:29 - called start again
20:37 - start again
20:39 - um and then when you receive start again
20:46 - there you start again then it will check
20:51 - ball it will call this function of check
20:56 - ball if the soccer ball touches the
20:59 - goalie okay so now you need to receive
21:06 - another broadcast message when I receive
21:08 - gold then stop other scripts in the
21:13 - sprite so even if you make it then
21:16 - you'll also stop other scripts in the
21:17 - sprite and wait one second give it a
21:25 - little pause and you can start again
21:29 - drop test start again and wait start
21:33 - again
21:34 - it was so good and then when you receive
21:39 - start again they move the goalie use
21:46 - call the function neuticle so it will
21:49 - start moving again okay and one last
21:54 - chunk of code for the soccer ball so
21:57 - when I receive start again when I
22:03 - receive start again start again set ball
22:10 - left
22:12 - call the function set bola okay and last
22:16 - but not least we have more code for the
22:18 - context for the goalie we have this code
22:24 - when you make a goal merci cool yo show
22:32 - you can like wait two seconds then
22:34 - behind again wait two seconds and hi
22:41 - so this pretty much sums up the game so
22:44 - I'll play it one time for you guys so
22:46 - he's at your speed right now so if you
22:48 - want to increase the speed so there's an
22:54 - error right here instead of this you
22:57 - have to put a less than symbol I found
23:00 - out my mistake less than symbol speed is
23:03 - less than 2 then I'll change Europe
23:06 - advise 4.1 max speed you can go up to is
23:09 - 2 so if you try it now so if you try it
23:14 - now now he's at default speed which is 1
23:22 - but I thought I press subtract so well
23:33 - suppose he went sprite click see when
23:38 - you do it the next day you don't
23:39 - remember much
23:48 - so now if you try it and you shoot it
23:52 - says you missed and you can decrease the
23:56 - speed at the time so now he's really
23:59 - fast he waits very fast so it's harder
24:03 - if you decrease the speed but it's
24:05 - easier if you increase the speed so
24:07 - let's say I increase the speed see house
24:11 - see house house slow slow he goes he
24:15 - goes much slower than the one see if he
24:19 - put on one he goes a bit faster if you
24:22 - put it on 0.1 it's even faster and if
24:26 - you try to shoot it and you make it it
24:30 - was like goal up here as you can see so
24:34 - that pretty much sums up the video thank
24:37 - you guys for watching and please like
24:39 - share and subscribe to this channel and
24:42 - comment down in the comments below of
24:44 - what you think about this video thank
24:47 - you for watching
