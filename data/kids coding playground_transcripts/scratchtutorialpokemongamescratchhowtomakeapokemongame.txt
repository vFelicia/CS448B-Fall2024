00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:10 - playground here today we're back for
00:11 - another video
00:12 - of scratch so if
00:16 - um so i uh this is
00:19 - this is um the suggestion for us to make
00:22 - this pokemon game
00:24 - it's just called pokemon game and it was
00:26 - by swati pandy
00:28 - and aryan uggarwal said broke please can
00:32 - you provide a link where i can get
00:34 - pokemon sprites
00:35 - so we did do some pokemon sprites and
00:37 - swati pandy had such a good
00:39 - um uh suggestion for us to make
00:42 - a pokemon game so we decided to make a
00:44 - pokemon game today
00:46 - so um
00:49 - so this is basically our pokemon game
00:51 - i'm gonna demo it but first
00:53 - before i demo it i'm gonna show you the
00:56 - sprites
00:57 - by um by community
01:01 - and so
01:04 - so these are basically the sprites and
01:08 - what they are so there's like i don't
01:10 - know all the pokemon but i'm
01:12 - pretty sure this is venusaur this is
01:14 - like the
01:15 - exploding bomb coconut dude this
01:18 - is like blastroid i forgot his name
01:23 - i don't know uh so there's a bunch of
01:25 - sprites you can choose from the rat
01:28 - great shoe so and that we have um our
01:32 - this link and the link in the
01:33 - description you can douse or download
01:35 - how we made it
01:36 - and there's like gig bat and they have
01:38 - like wiggly puff and
01:40 - jigglypuff so and they also have a low
01:43 - end
01:44 - so to get one of these dudes you have to
01:46 - right click like psyduck you can just
01:48 - right click on
01:49 - psyduck and then save as a gif so
01:53 - i'm gonna do that
01:57 - so save images this will paris right
02:00 - there
02:05 - so i'm gonna do this the gif there's the
02:08 - gif so
02:09 - uh you can write whatever that is i i
02:11 - don't know how to spell
02:12 - psyduck i think it's spelled like this
02:14 - if i'm not mistaken
02:16 - and um just like that you click save
02:19 - and then you have your new psyduck
02:22 - so as you can see i can upload it into
02:24 - this game so i'm going to show you how
02:26 - to upload it i'm not going to use
02:27 - psyduck because i didn't code it at
02:28 - all yet so let's go slide up right here
02:33 - so psyducks yo you got all these cool
02:35 - costumes
02:36 - with them so you can use any pokemon you
02:38 - actually want from this
02:40 - link so this is basically how you get
02:44 - the pokemon
02:45 - at this i'll link in the description so
02:47 - you can just take that link and get
02:49 - like if you don't want pikachu well
02:51 - pikachu is the most known
02:53 - so if you don't want pikachu you don't
02:54 - have to use pikachu you can use psyduck
02:56 - if you want squirtle you could use paris
02:58 - if you don't if you yeah that's
03:00 - basically
03:00 - um what it is so i'm gonna demo the game
03:07 - [Music]
03:10 - so um
03:14 - uh so you have a little pointer and it
03:16 - follows your mouse
03:18 - so um so as you can see there's a bunch
03:22 - i have
03:22 - 20 pokeballs if i if i i think that's
03:25 - not what they're called
03:26 - it's there's like a bird i don't know if
03:28 - this is called i think it's called
03:30 - pigeon
03:31 - i don't know how to pronounce it okay uh
03:34 - and there's like charizard here squirtle
03:37 - pikachu
03:38 - and the pig joy so
03:41 - they pick a random position around here
03:43 - you got 20 pokeballs and there's pokemon
03:46 - pokemon caught so you can just do this
03:49 - and then catch one
03:50 - by clicking the up arrow key it says got
03:53 - it and if you don't get any it says mist
03:55 - and it makes a
03:56 - sound so you can catch
04:00 - some of these you catch charizard
04:03 - so some appear faster than others like
04:06 - pig joint
04:07 - he appears he goes away really quickly
04:10 - so
04:10 - you have to be on the lookout for you
04:13 - just
04:14 - catch these people without trying to run
04:16 - out of pokeballs
04:17 - so i'm gonna see we need 15 to win
04:22 - so if i make oh my god
04:26 - i only have exactly enough to win
04:28 - [Music]
04:31 - so i won you won and if you lose i'll
04:35 - just speed up the process for you guys
04:37 - so i sped up the process a little bit my
04:39 - three pokeballs left
04:40 - just throw it over here
04:44 - so obviously and if you run out of it it
04:47 - says you
04:47 - awesome simple game cool it's really
04:51 - it's really good it's similar to some
04:52 - other our games that we made
04:54 - earlier so all of these are
04:58 - links in the description the pokeball
05:00 - the bullseye the banner everything
05:02 - though
05:02 - backdrop the pokemon the pokemon
05:07 - and um let's start a new project
05:10 - i haven't played pokemon in a while so
05:14 - i mean like it's still a pretty fun game
05:16 - so pokemon
05:18 - game so the first thing you should do is
05:20 - just name this so before i start
05:22 - please like share subscribe um
05:25 - and comment um if you play pokemon
05:28 - in the comments below so yeah
05:31 - please comment if you play pokemon i'm
05:34 - pretty sure some kids still play pokemon
05:37 - so um
05:41 - let's just keep on going so first we
05:44 - have to delete the scratch cat
05:45 - and i do have some things in my backpack
05:48 - because i'm very bad artist in scratch
05:50 - so
05:51 - the bullseye because i mean like you can
05:54 - download this links in the description
05:56 - or you can draw yourself
05:57 - just um a circle you just erase
06:00 - you just don't have the middle and then
06:02 - you have another circle like that
06:04 - and then you just put the four lines
06:06 - that's basically how you draw it
06:07 - and um we have it in the description so
06:10 - don't worry
06:12 - you guys can always download that so
06:16 - i'm also gonna drag the pokeball in
06:19 - and the banner so i do have the banner
06:23 - so and i have the backdrop links in the
06:26 - description
06:33 - so
06:36 - i have it here so there we go the forest
06:40 - pokemon forest link's in the description
06:43 - too
06:43 - and that's all i have so
06:47 - let's get going so i also have my
06:52 - pokemon drag all my pokemon inside so
06:56 - links in the description again
06:57 - so i have pidgeoi pikachu the most
07:01 - well-known
07:03 - squirtle are really well-known as well
07:05 - venusaur is pretty well known but we
07:06 - don't have in this project because we
07:07 - already have pigeon
07:08 - we just wanted a flying one charizard is
07:11 - i think 289 costumes near 300
07:14 - this might take a while to load oh wow
07:16 - that was actually really quick for
07:18 - something that has like 300 something
07:20 - costumes so um
07:23 - let's start coding so the first thing
07:24 - i'm going to code
07:26 - is the bullseye so
07:30 - i'm just gonna get to the bullseye right
07:32 - here
07:35 - so i'm trying to get this quick quick
07:36 - quick quick quick because um it's
07:38 - already seven minutes and 31 seconds so
07:39 - i'm going to try to get this really
07:41 - quick done so you can
07:43 - feel free to pause it whenever you need
07:44 - to so when the green flag is clicked
07:46 - you'll set size to a hundred percent
07:49 - you'll go to the front layer because you
07:52 - always wanted to
07:53 - be at the front layer in front of like
07:55 - everything and
07:56 - show
07:59 - so i'm going to do go to so i
08:03 - i already have coordinates so go to 6
08:06 - 45 feel free to deposit
08:09 - i know this might i might try to go this
08:11 - in one go
08:12 - so i'm trying to be slow and quick at
08:14 - the same time
08:16 - so it'll go forever and go to
08:19 - mouse pointer so follow your mouse
08:22 - anywhere you go
08:22 - so next close next script so
08:26 - we need to make a variable x and y so
08:30 - x
08:34 - and y so um
08:38 - we go x exit y when the green flag is
08:41 - clicked they'll go
08:42 - clear all right graphic effects because
08:45 - yeah
08:45 - and then it'll go forever
08:50 - set x
08:54 - because you because you want it to
08:55 - follow your mouse so
08:57 - set x to x position and then set
09:00 - y to y position so y to
09:04 - y position actually might need a second
09:07 - part
09:08 - so i think so so it'll change
09:11 - color effect by 20 to show you where it
09:15 - is
09:17 - so we're done with the bullseye that was
09:19 - very quick quick two minutes
09:21 - so now we're gonna work on the pokeball
09:25 - we probably can do the pokeball next
09:30 - but not all of it has a bunch of code
09:33 - so when the green flag is clicked
09:39 - he'll set the pokeball we don't have the
09:42 - pokeball yet
09:51 - so make pokemon caught
09:58 - and then
10:03 - to zero so you have no score
10:06 - and go to the front layer
10:12 - and set size to 50.
10:18 - and i'll go to the position i have it
10:20 - already at
10:23 - and show
10:27 - it's been oh so i can do this one first
10:30 - so
10:31 - when the green flag is clicked go
10:33 - forever
10:35 - and turn 15 degrees
10:40 - so let's make it go back one layer
10:42 - because
10:43 - it'll be behind the bullseye
10:48 - i think it's actually over here
10:53 - go backward one layer
10:57 - and it will
11:01 - next we have to work on
11:04 - shoot so when the up arrow is pressed
11:11 - it will shoot it so if then
11:14 - pokey ball so you need to end
11:19 - so if the pokeball
11:27 - is more than zero
11:30 - and not
11:36 - not the pokemon is caught
11:42 - zero 15 i meant
11:46 - so it'll broadcast shoot and wait
11:57 - and then i'm gonna work on the sounds
11:59 - for shoot which is high whoosh
12:00 - if yeah so i think i already have it
12:04 - no i don't and then i was right here
12:06 - yeah i already have
12:07 - high wish so
12:17 - so we do have high whoosh inside this
12:21 - sprite library i mean the sound library
12:23 - so
12:26 - [Music]
12:27 - right there and this means that if you
12:30 - have
12:32 - not have more pokeballs
12:37 - then you still have pokeballs in your
12:40 - hand and you cannot win
12:41 - you don't win yet so that means you can
12:43 - still throw them so
12:44 - that's basically what it means and i
12:46 - also have a little
12:48 - cool effect
12:53 - oh so when i receive shoot repeat
12:56 - 12 times
13:00 - um change size
13:10 - minus two and then
13:15 - and so when you throw it it gets smaller
13:18 - and smaller next of the code is really
13:21 - really really really big so
13:22 - we have to work on that quick so in this
13:25 - whenever you shoot
13:26 - it'll change poke ball
13:32 - by minus one
13:36 - negative one now glide zero point
13:46 - five
13:48 - to x and y
13:55 - and then you need it if then else after
13:58 - if then else after if thanos so first if
14:00 - that mouse
14:01 - is touching pikachu so i already have
14:03 - pikachu inside here so
14:04 - picture and then
14:08 - we have to do broadcast hit pikachu we
14:10 - have to make that broadcast
14:20 - and then we have to duplicate this again
14:22 - but no no actually we need to
14:24 - wait so we gotta do hit pokemon
14:33 - and then we have to work on the
14:36 - um elsewhere to set
14:40 - the set mist so we're going to make
14:44 - the variable missed
14:50 - missed this is going to be the confusing
14:52 - part you put it in here
14:54 - to y or else you because
14:58 - you either hit it or you miss it so it's
15:00 - an else missed
15:01 - no broadcast miss
15:05 - and wait so this is so big this is when
15:08 - it gets really confusing
15:10 - so broadcast miss so
15:14 - we have it here i'm gonna go work on the
15:16 - pikachu
15:19 - so next we have to do uh when i receive
15:21 - hit pika
15:22 - no hit pokemon so any type of pokemon
15:28 - then it will uh start some coins or
15:31 - you can get that in this sprite library
15:33 - right here a coin
15:37 - so coin right here
15:40 - so you can get the sound coin
15:47 - and then next we have to do missing
15:49 - sound
15:50 - it's not it's i mean it is um
15:53 - high like a lug so glug is like a
15:56 - drinking
15:56 - sound but this sounds more like a defeat
15:58 - sound see it sounds like
16:02 - sad so so when i receive this it'll
16:05 - start sound plug
16:07 - and then when i receive hit pikachu
16:11 - i mean pokemon then it will change
16:14 - pokemon caught by one so
16:16 - we have it right here change pokemon
16:18 - caught
16:19 - by one so you get one score basically
16:21 - you know set
16:22 - i was saying got it
16:29 - for 0.3 seconds
16:33 - also hide because you're done
16:38 - and then i'll wait 0.5 seconds
16:46 - and i'll set size to 50.
16:54 - it'll go to the position i already have
16:56 - it at i think no i don't
16:58 - so we'll go to zero
17:01 - negative 104 it'll show
17:11 - so this is the position of the beginning
17:13 - so
17:14 - uh when i receive miss
17:18 - it's already happened
17:23 - i'm pretty sure i did that no i didn't
17:26 - when i received miss it'll wait 0.5
17:30 - seconds
17:33 - it'll if then the pokeball
17:37 - if the pokeball equals zero
17:47 - equals zero then it will broadcast
17:50 - and wait lose
18:00 - so this we're almost done with this just
18:03 - a few more scripts of code so when i
18:06 - receive hit pokemon
18:09 - it will wait 0.5 seconds
18:15 - and it will you need if then
18:20 - if then the pokemon caught equals 15.
18:31 - equals 15 then
18:34 - you broadcast win and wait
18:38 - broadcast win and wait so i'm make that
18:46 - win
18:51 - and wait and then if then
18:58 - you need to and
19:01 - if then the pokeball equals zero
19:12 - equals zero and and
19:17 - the pokeball equals zero and not
19:24 - not the
19:28 - pokemon caught so i'm gonna move this
19:31 - around first
19:32 - and then if it's not the pokemon card
19:35 - equals 15.
19:39 - then you lose because you didn't catch
19:41 - um 15 pokemon with
19:43 - the balls so
19:48 - and then i'll broadcast
19:51 - lose and wait
19:59 - we already have that i think if yeah
20:02 - sorry guys
20:03 - uh and i'm gonna move that here and the
20:06 - last thing we have to do
20:07 - is finish this script the code which
20:09 - still has a lot i think
20:13 - so i have to set the pokeball to 20 and
20:15 - forgot to do that
20:19 - so let's try it
20:25 - this has got it well we didn't code the
20:26 - pikachu yet so
20:28 - we have to code the pikachu next and
20:30 - then we
20:31 - code the squirtle the charizard and the
20:33 - pigeon so
20:34 - pikachu is very simple code
20:38 - when the green flag is clicked
20:42 - it will go forever and ever
20:45 - and next costume and when i receive hit
20:49 - pikachu
20:51 - it'll hide
20:54 - and then when the green flag is clicked
20:58 - it'll hide
21:01 - because it always hides in the beginning
21:03 - it'll go forever
21:06 - and wait for seconds
21:11 - and go to the position we want it to go
21:14 - so we have it so go to
21:18 - most of this is going to be the same
21:20 - except the page weight because it can
21:21 - fly in the air
21:22 - so go to a pick random of
21:27 - negative 200.
21:30 - top 200
21:33 - and pick random for this one for y
21:38 - is negative 75
21:42 - to positive 70 35
21:47 - and no show
21:54 - so i did this to make sure um the
21:57 - pokemon except pigeon
21:59 - will go over here picture it will be in
22:01 - the air so it'll be around here
22:03 - so that's why i did that and show and
22:06 - then when i receive hit pikachu
22:08 - that's it so i'm gonna try out pikachu
22:13 - i can't seem to find pikachu oh he's
22:16 - behind charizard
22:22 - so i got him
22:28 - so yeah so
22:32 - same thing let's work on squirtle and
22:34 - the pokeball so
22:36 - we have to do this duplicate this
22:43 - so i'm gonna do this
22:46 - and put this in here so this is a
22:49 - big piece of code
22:55 - let's put this over here we still need
22:56 - it and move this over here
23:00 - we actually do not need that because we
23:01 - have another one instead of pikachu
23:04 - squirtle instead hit squirtle
23:12 - and then hit pokemon and wait yeah
23:14 - that's correct and then we can
23:16 - do this
23:19 - and then we if then else this again
23:25 - and then i have to do this and put it
23:27 - into the if then else
23:30 - instead change this to charizard
23:36 - instead hit charizard
23:44 - and then you have to duplicate this
23:46 - again
23:48 - to do page load
23:53 - and then instead hit pitch rate
24:00 - and then put this finally inside here so
24:03 - that's
24:03 - a bunch of loops and this is the overall
24:06 - code
24:08 - a bunch of if i mean if else statements
24:11 - so
24:12 - let's work on squirtle because
24:16 - yeah basically the same code as pikachu
24:21 - slightly different
24:26 - so instead of hit pikachu
24:30 - you have to make this hit squirtle and
24:33 - then you can
24:33 - do any seconds you want to buy them do
24:36 - three
24:37 - and you can put that over here that's
24:38 - it's literally the same thing
24:40 - and it's the same code for charizard no
24:43 - not the same you
24:44 - do hit and you gotta change the times up
24:46 - a little bit
24:48 - it's slightly different for all three
24:52 - so instead of hit squirtle hit charizard
24:55 - and then this part i'm doing
24:59 - eight if i'm no six six
25:04 - six and then i'm going to do pigeon
25:09 - but pijoy is just a little bit different
25:12 - from the others
25:15 - because if you notice pidgeot has wings
25:18 - so
25:19 - it's going to be flying
25:24 - so if then hit pedroite
25:29 - then and then change this i'm pretty
25:32 - sure
25:33 - it's two and then
25:37 - instead uh it's a same same x but
25:42 - different y
25:43 - so it'll be different vertical so
25:46 - the vertical is negative 20
25:50 - to positive 150.
25:54 - we now have to code the banner so be
25:57 - somewhere up
25:58 - here first i'm just going to hide the
26:01 - the
26:01 - variables for now uh we don't need this
26:05 - it's just pokeball and pokemon caught
26:10 - and then we can work on the banner
26:13 - so the banner should be very simple
26:18 - so when i receive
26:21 - i mean when i receive you still need
26:24 - this i mean
26:25 - uh so when the green flag is clicked it
26:28 - will go to
26:29 - zero zero middle
26:32 - and it will i mean zero sixty
26:37 - see i mean zero zero and then they'll go
26:39 - to front layer
26:46 - it will switch costumes to start
26:52 - and so the start costume is
26:57 - the start costume is this costume catch
