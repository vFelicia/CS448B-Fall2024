00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids cutting
00:09 - playground here
00:10 - and today we're back for another video
00:12 - and
00:13 - um you're working on a lunar new year
00:17 - project
00:18 - so this um chinese new year is about
00:20 - coming
00:21 - uh so i'm pretty sure that uh in chinese
00:24 - new year
00:25 - people give envelopes and money inside
00:27 - envelopes and red envelopes
00:29 - to give to other people and they get
00:31 - money so
00:33 - yeah so i think this year's one is the
00:36 - bull
00:37 - yeah so we decided to do the bowl
00:40 - right here we made a chinese new year
00:42 - game so
00:43 - can we all appreciate how cool this blue
00:45 - looks
00:46 - it has all this wavy hair and it's
00:49 - really good graphics
00:50 - so whenever you touch a red envelope
00:54 - again uh pick random one to ten
00:58 - of money so and then yeah so it's
01:01 - basically collecting envelopes and if
01:03 - you die
01:04 - you see his firecrackers they put like a
01:06 - little sprite on you
01:07 - and that means you got hurt
01:12 - so uh if you can hear me that's good
01:16 - so there's the firecracker and i only
01:19 - have one life left
01:20 - and then it's on top right so
01:23 - i'm about to get killed it says sorry
01:25 - you're lost and everything stops
01:27 - so anyways i have to tell you some stuff
01:32 - um so first if uh many people are
01:35 - required they said that they have to
01:37 - request
01:37 - access for the sprites and honestly um
01:41 - the way to do it is use your not use
01:43 - your school account use your mom or
01:44 - dad's account
01:45 - or your account like your home account
01:47 - but not your school account
01:49 - so if you go in your school account
01:50 - they'll have to tell you to request
01:52 - access
01:52 - but if you don't have that um you can do
01:55 - that
01:55 - and if you do not understand you can
01:57 - watch our google sprites
01:59 - uh video links in the description so
02:02 - yeah and we also have other cows links
02:06 - in the description from the google drive
02:07 - and
02:09 - and this tab i just switched it so
02:12 - there's
02:12 - this cow oh so i'm gonna play it so it
02:16 - shows the graphics of all the moving
02:17 - tiles
02:18 - these don't move so you can use any of
02:21 - these cows
02:23 - but i i wanted this one this one looks
02:24 - the coolest like all the hair
02:26 - graphics so
02:30 - yeah you can take any of these links in
02:33 - the description
02:34 - this blue one looks cool too it's waving
02:36 - its tail when it's
02:37 - running this one is pretty cool the ones
02:40 - that don't move are still cool but you
02:42 - know you can
02:43 - i prefer the ones that are moving so
02:47 - uh let's get started so anyways let's
02:51 - keep on going
02:51 - so people told me to teach more slower
02:54 - so
02:54 - i mean like i'm going to teach a little
02:56 - bit slower
02:58 - i have everything in my backdrop so i
03:01 - have
03:02 - this just the backdrop
03:06 - right here i have that and then i also
03:09 - have the sound
03:12 - so uh the music
03:17 - the chinese music
03:23 - so that's basically the music and i
03:25 - don't need this right
03:27 - i'm going to put the bold the
03:29 - firecracker thing you can
03:30 - um go down the
03:33 - google drive links in the description
03:35 - and also have the firecracker the red
03:37 - envelope
03:38 - and the bowl let's reorganize everything
03:41 - is it loading that's oh it's over there
03:45 - so let's reorganize this just takes a
03:48 - while to use a bunch of costumes
03:50 - so first let's work on the bowl
03:54 - so the bowl is the most important it's
03:56 - the star of this project
04:00 - when the green flag is clicked
04:03 - uh let's make it go to
04:06 - around here
04:14 - and then so set rotation style to left
04:16 - right
04:19 - so it won't flip over while it's moving
04:22 - to the left
04:22 - nor the right um and
04:25 - they'll switch costs into bull one which
04:27 - is the first one so switch customers
04:31 - how much costumes does this thing have
04:34 - 132 costumes
04:36 - yeah i'm
04:40 - yeah 32 costumes anyways and never mind
04:42 - uh well let's just keep
04:44 - going so set money let's make a new
04:47 - variable
04:54 - money
04:56 - set money to zero and it'll set
05:01 - our life's lives
05:05 - um to
05:08 - five because five is a good number for
05:11 - lives i don't know why it's just good
05:12 - number
05:13 - and it'll have a forever loop
05:16 - this is the movement to make it look
05:19 - very wavy
05:20 - so it depends on what cow you're using
05:23 - if it's
05:23 - like a different cow um and smoothing
05:26 - then you might have to add some seconds
05:28 - into it so yeah
05:30 - one forever if then the key left arrow
05:36 - click
05:41 - then it will point and direction 90
05:46 - i mean negative 9 90 is right
05:50 - negative 90. move 10 steps
05:54 - and next costume
06:01 - i'm gonna duplicate that to make right
06:02 - arrow
06:04 - just like that changes the right arrow
06:06 - one direction
06:08 - 90 at this time and then move ten steps
06:11 - next costume
06:15 - so we're gonna work on the red envelope
06:17 - yeah yes
06:18 - next so has some code
06:21 - and so when the green flag gets clicked
06:27 - it'll go to a random position
06:33 - it will set y to 180
06:40 - so 180
06:43 - forever and ever and ever
06:47 - i change y by
06:50 - minus five
06:58 - and there's a if then
07:04 - so if then you need one of these symbols
07:08 - if then the y position is less than
07:12 - negative 170
07:14 - then i'll then it'll go back up because
07:17 - 170
07:18 - is down here so when it the y position
07:23 - is less than that
07:26 - then it will go back up so
07:30 - it'll go to random position
07:34 - instead why the 180 just duplicate this
07:39 - oopsies
07:42 - duplicate right here i want to use that
07:45 - thing
07:46 - uh set y to 180
07:49 - and you need a if then statement let's
07:52 - make this a little bit smaller so
07:55 - i can see better if then
07:59 - it's touching the bolt you'll get money
08:02 - so
08:02 - touching bull
08:07 - full one i'll start sound
08:11 - they have it for every single spray i
08:12 - don't know why except the scratch guy i
08:14 - think he has made me out
08:17 - so you know change
08:20 - money
08:23 - by pick random one to ten
08:27 - so it's a random amount of money because
08:29 - sometimes
08:30 - some people give you like 20 bucks some
08:32 - people give you like a hundred
08:34 - so but this is one to ten
08:37 - you know go to a random position and set
08:40 - y to 180 so i can just do this
08:45 - uh right there and then we're gonna work
08:48 - on the firecracker next
08:51 - so the firecracker
08:56 - has quite some code so it's a decent
09:00 - amount
09:00 - so let's start so when the green flag is
09:02 - clicked
09:06 - that's good nothing leave one out
09:10 - it will go to a random position
09:14 - anywhere random
09:18 - it will set y to 180
09:23 - um forever
09:31 - i will change y by minus five so keep on
09:33 - going
09:34 - down and down
09:41 - and you know if then statement
09:44 - if then
09:48 - if the if the y position is less than
09:52 - negative 170
09:54 - then it will
09:57 - yeah you go for the y position
10:03 - then it will
10:06 - hide
10:10 - go to a random position
10:15 - and set y to 180
10:21 - after that oh wait i pick random a
10:23 - second so
10:25 - wait pick random one to five seconds and
10:28 - then i'll spawn in again if i'm not
10:29 - mistaken let's see
10:31 - uh one to five seconds it'll show
10:38 - so our next trip to code is and then the
10:46 - bowl
10:47 - if it's touching the bowl
10:52 - i'll broadcast firecracker hit bull so
10:55 - this is
10:55 - like the main component of broadcasts
11:00 - oopsies
11:03 - what is this called again yeah
11:04 - firecracker ball
11:08 - fire cracker hit
11:12 - bowl
11:16 - and after that it will hide
11:21 - a hide it'll go to a random position
11:31 - you'll set wide of 180
11:35 - and i'll wait i'll pick random a second
11:38 - so
11:39 - white pick random one to five seconds
11:41 - duplicate this
11:46 - and no show
11:52 - now we have to do the sprite one which
11:55 - is really really simple and we also have
11:57 - to do the pull
11:58 - so let's actually do the ball first
12:03 - well i'm gonna show you i'm gonna show
12:04 - you this
12:06 - so the bowl the envelope
12:10 - the firecracker so my money's going up
12:14 - like 16 24. so pick random and then the
12:17 - firecracker
12:18 - isn't doing anything quite yet so let's
12:21 - just um continue
12:24 - in the bowl so when i receive
12:26 - firecracker hit the ball
12:30 - it will change life by -1
12:35 - so now you can start losing lives and
12:37 - they'll start sound
12:39 - snare beatbox
12:48 - i think
12:52 - yeah this one um
12:56 - the stair beat box
13:00 - and i'll switch costume to bull one
13:06 - so and now it'll do if then
13:10 - the life equals zero
13:19 - then it will stop at the scripts in the
13:22 - sprite
13:27 - it will say sorry you lost
13:31 - because you did lose so um say
13:34 - sorry you lost
13:42 - for one second stop all
13:48 - and now we have to work on the sprite
13:50 - one
13:52 - so when the green flag is clicked
13:56 - it'll go to the front layer front most
13:59 - front go to the front layer
14:05 - hide and go forever
14:08 - and ever and ever and go to bowl
14:14 - so it's already at the bowl and now if
14:17 - the firecracker hits the bowl
14:22 - it will show
14:26 - over here wait one second and then hide
14:33 - and now we have to put in the music
14:37 - so
14:41 - so um i'm let's test out the
14:45 - so i'm gonna actually show you how to
14:46 - draw spray one first if you don't wanna
14:48 - use hours links in description
14:49 - but if you think hours is not as good as
14:52 - what you can do you can draw your own
14:56 - so let's paint it
15:00 - so you need thickness five so
15:04 - you can yeah so let's just draw
15:10 - so you can skip you can skip a lot if
15:13 - you don't want to draw and you want to
15:14 - do your own
15:15 - so it's just a bunch of messed up lines
15:16 - everywhere so
15:18 - that's basically how explosions are not
15:21 - really
15:21 - um so if you can skip to a certain
15:24 - position if you do not want to watch me
15:26 - draw
15:27 - i mean like it's really quick so yeah
15:30 - it's basically the explosion
15:32 - we have to color it yellow so we already
15:34 - have it in yellow
15:35 - yeah so i'm just going to delete this
15:38 - and we can also reshape it
15:39 - to make some larger than others
15:42 - why not
15:47 - so yeah that's basically explosion so
15:49 - let's delete this costume
15:52 - and now let's add in the music
15:56 - so when the green flag is clicked it'll
15:59 - set
15:59 - volume to 25 plus sent
16:08 - 25 this is abnormally large so
16:12 - forever i'll play sound
16:16 - chinese music i think i already uploaded
16:19 - that in the beginning yeah
16:21 - so let's test it out
16:25 - [Music]
16:40 - so yeah so
16:50 - sorry you lost it says that and then
