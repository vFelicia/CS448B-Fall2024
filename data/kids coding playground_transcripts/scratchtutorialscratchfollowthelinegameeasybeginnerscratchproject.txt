00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:08 - playground today we'll be making a game
00:10 - called follow the line um so basically
00:13 - there's a truck and it will follow the
00:14 - black line so what you do in the
00:16 - beginning it follows your mouse and when
00:18 - you click it will just point to a random
00:20 - direction and once it hits the line it
00:22 - will start following it as you can see
00:26 - and every time you click the play button
00:29 - it will randomize a different map and we
00:31 - have three different tracks for the
00:32 - truck so let's click play again
00:34 - hopefully we'll get another one nope
00:36 - yeah see as you can see here we have
00:38 - another one
00:39 - all of them have different like uh
00:41 - different attributes this one has like a
00:43 - little
00:44 - swerve down here
00:46 - um
00:48 - and we have one more one last one this
00:50 - is our last one
00:53 - so you guys can make your own
00:55 - um it's pretty simple to make these
00:57 - tracks
00:58 - as you can see it'll try to follow the
01:00 - line
01:04 - so yeah it's pretty much what we're
01:05 - going to be doing today
01:07 - um
01:08 - it's going to be called the line
01:09 - follower
01:10 - so without further ado let's hop right
01:12 - into a new project so let's start a new
01:14 - project
01:15 - okay so first
01:17 - let's delete the scratch chat we will
01:18 - not need it and we're going to rename
01:20 - this project to follow the line
01:28 - follow the line
01:29 - and then uh we're going to get the truck
01:33 - the truck and then uh inside the truck
01:36 - uh we have
01:38 - this type we just basically drew this
01:39 - truck
01:40 - it's just uh
01:42 - like
01:43 - there's like let's duplicate this i'll
01:45 - show you what's in it we have some
01:46 - wheels these are the wheels and here we
01:48 - have like some like panel on the top i
01:50 - don't know what it's for but
01:51 - um
01:52 - basically it's just like let's ungroup
01:54 - it i'll show you it's one
01:58 - it's like one uh black
02:00 - like frame and then we have a white like
02:03 - gray square and then we have some lines
02:05 - so we don't want to put this all into
02:07 - one like one full like outline with the
02:10 - fill because it will actually cover this
02:13 - thing and if you make it go to the top
02:14 - this will actually be on top of the
02:16 - black and it will not make it look very
02:18 - good
02:19 - and then we have this is the base of the
02:21 - truck and these are the wheels this is
02:23 - the sensing the red triangle this we're
02:25 - sensing to move forward
02:27 - uh the blue circle stuff goes to the
02:29 - left right uh like the pink circles to
02:31 - the right and we made it a triangle
02:33 - because it's different from these two
02:35 - so you can it's straight so it faces the
02:38 - forward okay so that's pretty much it
02:40 - for the train i'm gonna draw the train
02:44 - so let's paint a new sprite
02:49 - [Music]
03:35 - do
03:43 - [Music]
04:25 - so here we have our train finally
04:27 - finished took us a while
04:29 - um truck i guess yeah it's a truck i
04:31 - guess we finally finished it took us a
04:33 - while um probably going to time-lapse
04:35 - this part
04:36 - so we time we're going to time-lapse it
04:38 - so then
04:39 - we'll speed things up we'll just give
04:41 - you a basic like understanding of how to
04:43 - draw a truck like this but you can
04:46 - always export it straight from our
04:47 - project or from the link in the
04:49 - description that's pretty much it the
04:51 - truck so we're going to delete it we're
04:53 - going to be using the original one
04:55 - and inside our backdrop we're gonna just
04:57 - like drag in our different costumes so
04:59 - we have different tracks what we do
05:01 - is just draw a giant square
05:04 - uh with outline with no fill with 20 and
05:07 - then we just use the reshape tool to
05:09 - reshape it to make it kind of look like
05:11 - a track
05:12 - so
05:13 - we make we just made three for now but
05:15 - you guys can make whatever you want
05:17 - how much ever you want so that's pretty
05:19 - much it
05:20 - for the tracks
05:23 - so to use the reshape tool i'm just
05:25 - going to show you real quick how to use
05:27 - it you select it and then you use this
05:30 - and then you can drag whatever you want
05:32 - you can maybe put this in or something
05:33 - yeah so basically that's how you do the
05:35 - reshape tool it's pretty easy to use but
05:38 - you have to be in vector mode to use the
05:39 - reshape tool so
05:41 - you should keep everything in vector
05:42 - mode okay so inside the truck we're
05:44 - gonna go to the truck and then in the
05:46 - truck for the code it's pretty simple
05:48 - so one green fly clicked let's zoom in
05:52 - we're going to get it forever
05:54 - go to the mouse pointer
05:56 - go to mouse pointer and if
06:00 - mouse down
06:03 - then we will broadcast a message called
06:05 - drop car so in the beginning you can
06:07 - you're able to like put wherever you
06:08 - want the truck to be so we're going to
06:11 - name it drop truck so we're going to put
06:13 - the truck wherever you want and then
06:14 - we're going to stop the script
06:16 - after you have dropped the truck so
06:18 - we're going to stop the script and then
06:20 - we're going to receive the message drop
06:22 - truck and then we're going to make it
06:24 - point direction to pick random so we're
06:25 - going to make it point direction pick a
06:27 - random negative 180 to 180 so negative
06:30 - 180 and then 180 right here and then
06:32 - we're gonna get a forever loop so
06:34 - forever
06:36 - if we're gonna get an if then no if else
06:39 - i'm sorry if else
06:41 - so
06:42 - if the color red which is the color of
06:44 - the triangle so we're gonna get like the
06:45 - little eyedropper so we can see get the
06:48 - color if the color
06:50 - so we're just gonna
06:51 - eye drop it there that red color
06:54 - is touching the color black
06:56 - this color
06:58 - if it's touching that then we're gonna
06:59 - move one step so that means it's gonna
07:01 - spawn moving forward
07:03 - so
07:04 - and then else we're gonna get another fl
07:06 - statement so
07:07 - in here if else so if the blue which is
07:11 - the left
07:12 - left ones or if the color blue we're
07:15 - gonna get the eyedropper
07:17 - the blue color
07:19 - and then if that's touching the color
07:21 - black which is the track
07:24 - then we're going to turn seven degrees
07:27 - to the left because the blue is on the
07:30 - left side so we're going to turn seven
07:31 - degrees to the left
07:33 - and then we're gonna move point five
07:34 - steps we're gonna make it move a little
07:35 - slower while you're turning so then it
07:36 - doesn't miss the term
07:38 - and then we're gonna get another if else
07:39 - statement if else
07:42 - um
07:43 - uh what's that called uh we're gonna get
07:45 - this sensing block
07:47 - and then
07:48 - when the color pink so we have the pink
07:50 - color right so we're gonna select the
07:52 - pink color
07:53 - see
07:55 - get the pink right there see the pink
07:57 - color if that is touching the color
07:59 - black
08:01 - then we will turn seven degrees to the
08:03 - right because the pink is on the right
08:05 - side and we're also going to move 0.5
08:07 - steps we can just duplicate that
08:09 - put that down there else when you're
08:10 - like dropping the cart
08:12 - um
08:13 - you're gonna move two steps and if it
08:16 - touches the edge then we're gonna bounce
08:19 - okay so that's all the code
08:21 - except oh yeah one more thing so in the
08:22 - beginning when three fly clicks inside
08:24 - the backdrop we're getting the vector up
08:26 - it's fairly simple switch the backdrop
08:28 - to pick random one to three
08:32 - so one two three because we have three
08:34 - backdrops
08:36 - okay let's put them in order
08:38 - two three four so yeah like that
08:40 - save the project
08:41 - make it big okay so we have the thing
08:44 - click it's gonna go over there
08:50 - so as you can see when there's like a
08:52 - little curve right there it'll go up
08:54 - sometimes like when it gets to the
08:55 - curves it won't detect it as well
08:58 - if you saw that
09:00 - but right now it's working okay
09:04 - um i don't think it's completely
09:05 - accurate it works but like i don't think
09:07 - i got the exact color of the cart so i'm
09:10 - actually going to make this like bigger
09:12 - make it like 500 size so then i can drop
09:15 - it better maybe i didn't do it as
09:17 - accurately so i'm gonna get the
09:19 - blue color you see that i think i think
09:21 - that was what the problem was
09:23 - the pink color make sure it's the
09:25 - correct pink
09:26 - all right now let's try it out but first
09:29 - we need to make this back to the
09:30 - original size
09:32 - okay save
09:35 - big screen
09:37 - play okay
09:40 - yeah so now as you can see it's working
09:43 - maybe it's because i didn't get the
09:44 - exact color because sometimes the color
09:47 - changes a little bit as you move so
09:49 - we're gonna play another one not a
09:50 - different one all right
09:53 - as you can see it's working yeah
09:58 - so yeah it's just a simple line follower
10:01 - uh project
10:02 - on scratch
10:05 - it's pretty simple
10:07 - um thank you guys for watching don't
10:08 - forget to like share and subscribe and
10:11 - ring the notification bell and i will
10:12 - see you guys in the next tutorial
