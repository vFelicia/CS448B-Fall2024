00:01 - [Music]
00:07 - thank you
00:08 - hey guys welcome back to kids clothing
00:11 - playground channel so today we'll work
00:13 - on the third part of this uh bubble tea
00:15 - making game
00:17 - so uh we're almost done maybe one or two
00:19 - more episodes should be done so let's go
00:22 - over what we had so far so let me just
00:24 - run the game real quick uh to just
00:27 - remind you guys Where We Are
00:28 - so here where we
00:30 - the cat saying that making the bubble
00:33 - tea and film the ingredients so what the
00:35 - customer came in and then we dropped the
00:38 - tapioca pearl in here
00:42 - and then we pour the tea
00:45 - and then what we have to work on is uh
00:48 - right now we're gonna have this syrup
00:50 - come in and we're going to drop the
00:51 - syrup and then shake the bubble tea
00:54 - and then after that we keep the straw to
00:58 - the customer I'll give the straw to put
01:00 - the straw on the bubble tea and give the
01:01 - customer but that pipe work on it for
01:03 - the next next one so let's finish the
01:06 - part where we add the syrup and then
01:08 - shake the cup
01:09 - all right okay so let's go over real
01:12 - quick because this is uh the code for
01:14 - the cat so if you miss anything just
01:16 - pause
01:17 - uh this is for the customer
01:21 - this part is for the tapioca uh scoop
01:25 - this is the actual tapioca pearl
01:30 - but this one is the cup where we have
01:32 - the tapioca on it
01:34 - this is the teapot
01:37 - this is the actual teacup with the
01:40 - tapioca together
01:42 - and this is the tico so right now we're
01:46 - gonna work on the syrup okay so the last
01:49 - part where we have stored syrup here
01:51 - that is where we're going to start our
01:54 - project so once we get that broadcast
01:57 - message we'll go to the syrup bottle and
02:00 - we'll apply the syrup bottle here and
02:03 - then we're gonna start putting the uh
02:05 - you know the syrup down to the pla to
02:08 - the cup all right so let's get started
02:11 - so let's go back to the syrup bottle
02:14 - [Music]
02:16 - so while we have the message say start
02:19 - zero break so let's go here so here
02:21 - let's put down the uh when green black
02:24 - is clicked
02:25 - uh so we're gonna put them at whatever
02:28 - position here like behind the cat here
02:30 - that's fine
02:31 - then we're gonna put in
02:34 - go to back layer
02:37 - uh so we want the syrup bottle to go to
02:40 - the back left but it's kind of have to
02:41 - be a little bit in front of the uh
02:44 - customer
02:45 - but also behind the cats right so that's
02:48 - what we say go to back land and we're
02:50 - gonna say go forward
02:53 - two layer
02:54 - so the bottle has to be in front of the
02:57 - table as well so we're going to go
02:59 - forward to there and then we say show
03:04 - then we're gonna have the message like
03:06 - the start zero
03:09 - so here we say start syrup so what we're
03:12 - going to do is we're going to make it go
03:14 - to here but uh what we have to do is
03:16 - we're going to take the same color and
03:17 - put it here right click duplicate so
03:20 - right click duplicate and then take it
03:21 - away so what happened is when we start
03:24 - the game again with that same go to
03:26 - click the green flag right because you
03:29 - know we saw the next customer we have to
03:30 - do the same thing so that's why we put
03:32 - it here
03:33 - okay all right next I'm gonna say Glide
03:36 - one second how we're gonna put it around
03:39 - 55 and negative 35 that's what I had so
03:43 - so this is kind of like you know you
03:46 - click on it you can see kind of like
03:48 - right there so you can just move your
03:50 - bottle anywhere you want until I get the
03:52 - perfect position
03:54 - okay
03:55 - all right so I put it back already so as
03:58 - you can see I can run the game without
04:01 - um test the code without running the
04:02 - whole game just clicking on the code
04:04 - block itself okay so that's a little
04:06 - trick
04:08 - okay so next we'll say wait
04:13 - a couple of events and wait
04:16 - until
04:18 - okay we're gonna wait until the mouse
04:19 - down just like how we had for the uh you
04:22 - know other stuff the tea
04:25 - all right and we're gonna broadcast a
04:28 - message
04:30 - oops sorry I've got the wrong code
04:33 - broadcast a message
04:35 - new message called poor
04:38 - serum
04:39 - okay
04:41 - so pause here and then we can make the
04:43 - drip sandwich then we have the strips
04:45 - down here I actually use the strip
04:46 - sample in the library but I kind of cut
04:49 - it short a little bit so that kind of
04:51 - match when the syrup drops down so you
04:54 - can cut it short just using the you know
04:57 - the sound and you can just drag it
04:59 - so like like example like this so you
05:01 - want to cut it short right you can just
05:03 - say hey I want to cut this part off
05:06 - then you can do it like this and then
05:08 - you can say delete so we do that it will
05:10 - become shorter okay
05:12 - all right so let's go back to our code
05:16 - so here Sam we're gonna play
05:19 - the drips down until done
05:21 - okay
05:23 - after that so for now let's go to the uh
05:26 - the part of the circle we later we'll
05:28 - put the bottle back so so here next
05:31 - we're gonna go to the syrup uh actual um
05:34 - Sprite
05:36 - [Music]
05:39 - okay so I'll say my green flag is Click
05:45 - when I say hi so we don't want to show
05:47 - the little serum you know drip and what
05:52 - we receive
05:56 - uh pour syrup so now we're gonna just
05:59 - put the syrup in so remember we had a
06:02 - prawn a pro up a variable we need to
06:06 - create so just like the T we have to
06:09 - create one of the counter for the uh for
06:12 - the syrup as well make sure you select
06:14 - this one I say counter I put a lowercase
06:17 - C so I know that this is for this Sprite
06:19 - only okay
06:21 - so here is a counter you can see the
06:23 - name as well okay I can hide it for now
06:26 - okay so next we're gonna set the
06:31 - set the counter to zero
06:35 - and then we are going to get into the
06:39 - position so 18 55 so you can see this
06:43 - somewhere here so if you see the bottle
06:46 - maybe I'll go back to the bottom right I
06:47 - click here so it's kind of like you can
06:49 - see that it's kind of dripping from the
06:51 - tip of the bottom kind of thing so
06:53 - that's how how I made it so you can put
06:56 - it anywhere but you know you can put it
06:58 - even like right here so I got the
07:00 - customer but you can put it right right
07:02 - here right
07:05 - or whatever
07:06 - okay
07:07 - so let me send my customer back sorry
07:10 - about that
07:12 - so let me put it back I think we cannot
07:15 - see the
07:19 - you cannot see this uh the uh now you
07:23 - can see it sometimes when you click on
07:24 - it it goes back and forth so that's kind
07:26 - of annoying okay all right so we're back
07:28 - over here and I'll go just continue
07:31 - all right so next we're gonna say repeat
07:37 - uh 10 times I'll say create a clone
07:40 - myself
07:43 - then we're gonna wait
07:45 - a little bit each time or wait um one so
07:49 - that you can actually see and then we're
07:52 - gonna increase the counter
07:54 - so change the counter by one
07:58 - now we're gonna use it uh if condition
08:00 - here
08:02 - so put that under here
08:04 - so here we're gonna go to operator and
08:07 - then we're gonna say use equal
08:09 - uh what we're going to do is we're going
08:11 - to say hey the counter is equal to 3
08:14 - that's where we uh you know send the uh
08:17 - send the broadcast message to fill the
08:19 - serum so we're gonna broadcast another
08:21 - message
08:22 - [Music]
08:25 - here and the message name will be fill
08:30 - zero
08:33 - okay
08:34 - and then at the end of this then we're
08:37 - gonna put purchase another message
08:42 - and this one we're gonna call it uh put
08:47 - syrup
08:49 - bottle
08:51 - back so make sure you guys give a good
08:54 - name for your for your message to you
08:57 - know what to do okay so we have to
08:59 - create a call myself right so we need
09:01 - that uh when I start as a claw
09:05 - yeah when I saw this clone
09:07 - uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to
09:09 - slide over a little bit here and then
09:12 - kind of use the
09:13 - if condition
09:16 - so similar to the change color that we
09:19 - have for the T and the and the cup so
09:21 - we're going to try to do this chain
09:23 - color so that we can fill the next uh
09:25 - person you know do a different color
09:27 - okay so I'm going to use the operator
09:29 - greater than
09:32 - we'll have to change color variable
09:35 - if it's greater than zero
09:37 - so zero without base color so after if
09:41 - it's changed like every time you can
09:43 - change like 50 or 25 whatever if you do
09:45 - that then you're gonna set the new color
09:47 - effect so we're gonna set the new color
09:49 - effect of that chain color variable okay
09:54 - so next we're gonna make it go to this
09:57 - position
09:58 - same position I think I move that you
10:00 - know a little bit so you can put it you
10:03 - can put it back 1855
10:07 - okay
10:08 - and then uh what I can do is hit show
10:13 - you don't actually have to be in the
10:15 - same position just you can't move
10:16 - whatever you like you know you can move
10:18 - a little bit higher a little bit lower
10:20 - you know
10:22 - and then we're gonna say repeat
10:25 - until
10:27 - so we only have the teacup for this one
10:30 - so we don't need to do the other one we
10:32 - just repeat until touching the teeth
10:34 - because the other one is high already
10:37 - okay and then we're gonna change the
10:41 - um y y minus five to make it drip down
10:45 - okay
10:47 - and then at the end we have to delete
10:48 - the clump so when you use clones you do
10:51 - that
10:52 - okay so we are done with this serum so
10:55 - now we go back to the skill
10:59 - oh bottle so we have the syrup in the
11:02 - beginning right then we're gonna say hey
11:04 - Glide syrup over here right and then you
11:08 - say pour syrup we're waiting for the uh
11:12 - poster right waiting for that so so you
11:15 - can see if I click on it the strip drop
11:18 - down but I made this serve to show right
11:20 - it should be high right in the beginning
11:22 - so let's we can test that again so we'll
11:25 - go back to the T we don't have to I mean
11:27 - we don't have to do the whole thing
11:29 - again right so we we can just click it
11:33 - click this let it go back so as you can
11:36 - see the syrup come in
11:38 - we're gonna say hey
11:40 - um
11:41 - so I'm gonna click on it
11:43 - so you can see that it drip right
11:47 - okay
11:49 - all right so we have all the coal ready
11:54 - [Music]
11:55 - okay all right so we have the syrup
11:58 - looking correctly but now we're going to
12:00 - change the cup right to match the syrup
12:03 - to fill up right so now we have to go
12:05 - back to the cup
12:07 - so we have something called broadcast uh
12:10 - field syrup right and then put syrup
12:12 - back right so for the broadcast uh fill
12:15 - syrup so we're gonna do that first and
12:17 - then we can put the syrup bottle back so
12:20 - here go back to the cup
12:25 - and we're gonna say when I receive
12:30 - uh field zero here
12:34 - so here what we're going to do is we're
12:36 - going to change the custom number to 11.
12:41 - so if you look at 11
12:44 - is this one you know without the T So 12
12:47 - I mean without the syrup 12 is starting
12:49 - to have the serum on time okay so we're
12:52 - gonna say 11.
12:55 - um because I repeat
12:57 - uh five times and then forecast next
13:01 - class two
13:04 - and then we will do a little weight
13:06 - [Music]
13:08 - uh 0.2 second
13:13 - uh and then what the very end wait 0.5
13:17 - so you kind of just make sure that you
13:19 - kind of sync the you know the syrup
13:22 - dropping down and sync the uh changular
13:24 - custom so you can adjust the the wait
13:27 - time okay so after that
13:30 - all the thing is done we're gonna
13:33 - broadcast a new message
13:35 - call
13:37 - oh yeah we have the podcast uh put the
13:40 - syrup back right uh yeah we don't need
13:42 - that actually uh yeah I think I made a
13:44 - small mistake before
13:47 - okay so let's go back to the syrup we
13:50 - can take this out we're gonna use a
13:52 - little bit of weight before we move it
13:54 - thing so we're gonna take this one put
13:56 - the syrup bottle back right just take
13:58 - this out sorry about that so I think I
14:00 - made a little mistake I have like
14:02 - podcasted twice on my original game so
14:05 - in the syrup we can take that out we can
14:07 - we we can do it over here so we have to
14:10 - say um
14:11 - [Music]
14:13 - so we're gonna say here a new message
14:15 - here
14:17 - we're gonna say put the put this your
14:19 - bottle back
14:26 - okay so that is actually a little bit
14:28 - better uh that way you would do a little
14:31 - bit of weight then we broadcast that
14:33 - then we'll do a wait one second so that
14:36 - way you know when you trip the Finish
14:37 - stripping the uh the syrup it doesn't
14:39 - immediately go back the the bottle so
14:42 - that looks a little bit better
14:44 - that will switch the costume to
14:47 - 17 which is the last costume before the
14:51 - I think it's a little one 17 yeah yeah
14:55 - the lids go on yeah okay
14:58 - and then we're gonna broadcast a message
15:00 - called Shake
15:03 - here we're gonna say
15:05 - um
15:07 - new message called Shake
15:09 - all right so we have podcast the uh put
15:13 - the bottle right now we're gonna go back
15:15 - to the bottle
15:17 - and here in the bottle we say hey when I
15:19 - received the
15:21 - put the bottle back
15:28 - they're not gonna apply back to my
15:30 - original position so glide back
15:32 - one second
15:34 - we'll glide back to
15:36 - 210 which is what we have in the top
15:39 - here in original position okay so we
15:42 - have it good right now let's let's test
15:45 - it out from the beginning
15:46 - so now let's see
15:48 - okay so we have the
15:51 - the customer walking in okay still works
15:54 - the cups comes in
15:57 - fill the bubble
16:01 - and then within t
16:05 - then the syrup Clyde here
16:08 - so we can fill up the syrup
16:11 - and now we have the lid and then you can
16:13 - see the syrup bottle came back okay all
16:15 - right so that is where we are so now
16:17 - we're gonna make the bottle Shake here
16:20 - all right so let's go back so where we
16:23 - have the cup
16:25 - oops sorry that's I can't so we
16:27 - broadcast Shake right so here what we're
16:29 - going to do is
16:32 - when I receive Shake uh we're gonna
16:35 - point in 90 Direction
16:38 - so basically when we shake the bottle
16:40 - what I'm sure that it's always going to
16:41 - start at the correct position so we'll
16:43 - put that 90.
16:46 - and then we say start the sound
16:51 - start the sound Shake sound so we don't
16:54 - want to block it we want to start it so
16:56 - just play until then you can block all
16:59 - the code down so we want to say start
17:00 - cell
17:02 - then we are going to say repeat 10 times
17:08 - motion we're gonna say turn to the right
17:12 - 30 degree
17:15 - and then
17:17 - do a little bit of weight 0.1
17:20 - and turn to the left
17:24 - 30 degrees
17:27 - okay so what this does is it's kind of
17:30 - move and turn the box I mean the top cup
17:34 - left and left and then I mean right to
17:37 - left so let's say if you click on this
17:39 - you can see that they're gonna shake and
17:42 - they have the shaking sound and then
17:44 - move left and right
17:47 - so now we're gonna do the other side so
17:50 - what you're gonna do is that you can say
17:51 - wait
17:53 - 0.5 right
17:56 - here we're gonna do the other side
17:59 - so this part we can kind of duplicate
18:01 - this on the side so we're gonna re
18:04 - reverse the code so this time we're
18:06 - gonna shake the opposite so we're gonna
18:08 - go like this
18:10 - and like that so this time we're gonna
18:12 - shake the opposite basically we shake to
18:15 - the right now we're gonna shake to the
18:16 - left so left weight and then right wait
18:19 - and then at the end okay all right
18:24 - so let's go back down we're gonna put
18:26 - this over here
18:28 - okay and then what we can do is we have
18:31 - to put the cup back straight let's put
18:33 - the cup back straight first before this
18:35 - one okay
18:37 - all right so let's test it out real
18:39 - quick so we all we have to do is click
18:42 - on this so you can see it shake to the
18:44 - left right
18:46 - left and then we'll put it back straight
18:49 - okay
18:52 - here after that we can start the sound
18:54 - again so we're gonna do up and down so
18:57 - we're gonna start the sound again
19:00 - uh and then we'll have the repeat
19:02 - [Music]
19:04 - hold it 15 times
19:08 - okay so here we are just gonna change
19:10 - the Y so I'm gonna say change y
19:14 - 'all by ten
19:17 - I'll wait
19:20 - 0.1
19:22 - and then we have to change y
19:27 - by negative 10.
19:30 - okay and then we'll do away again
19:36 - 0.1
19:39 - and then we can broadcast a new message
19:45 - here
19:47 - this one we're gonna call it
19:49 - put
19:51 - straw on so this will put the straw onto
19:55 - the cup okay so let's check it out real
19:58 - quick
19:59 - so now we have this on
20:03 - um so let's click on this thing to test
20:05 - it out so you can see the shape to the
20:09 - right the left and then it goes up and
20:13 - down
20:14 - okay so now what is next is we're gonna
20:18 - broadcast the straw to put the straw on
20:21 - and for the straw to come on uh we're
20:24 - gonna do that next so next one so we're
20:27 - gonna put the straw on and then we're
20:28 - gonna give it to the customer and we're
20:30 - gonna light up the icon
20:32 - and um and that's it should be the end
20:35 - of this tutorial so that we'll have one
20:37 - more tutorial coming for the end where
20:39 - we put the straw and then give it to the
20:41 - customer the T okay all right thanks for
20:44 - tuning in today and see you guys next
20:47 - time bye
20:48 - [Music]
