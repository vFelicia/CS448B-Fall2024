00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys welcome back to the channel
00:10 - so this is part three of the duckton
00:13 - game
00:14 - so the part two uh video we did was uh
00:17 - we actually make the duck kind of flies
00:20 - around on the screen
00:22 - um and then
00:24 - now in this part we'll work on shooting
00:26 - the ducks and then like uh if it gets
00:28 - shot then the duck falls down and the
00:31 - dog can pick up the ducks and then if
00:33 - you miss then it flies away so hopefully
00:35 - we have enough time to do this one and
00:37 - now maybe after this maybe one more
00:40 - tutorial thing should be done
00:42 - okay so without further ado let's jump
00:44 - right in
00:45 - so where we left off last time was the
00:48 - duck we got all the uh custom block here
00:51 - where we're calling when the game start
00:53 - so now we are going to work on the shot
00:56 - fire so this is where we should fire the
00:58 - shot you see the the target when we
01:00 - click on it with the mouse down
01:02 - uh with broadcast shot fire right so now
01:05 - let's go to the duck
01:07 - okay
01:08 - all right so we'll go right down here so
01:11 - when
01:13 - uh i receive shot fire okay let me zoom
01:18 - in a little bit
01:20 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
01:22 - going to drag in the if and else
01:25 - okay
01:26 - and then we are going to go to sensing
01:29 - uh if it's touching the mouse pointer
01:31 - basically we check if the if the shot
01:33 - fire and then it actually touched the
01:36 - mouse pointer uh what we're going to do
01:38 - is
01:39 - we're going to say replace
01:43 - so we're going to replace the index
01:45 - where we were using earlier right where
01:47 - we have it up here
01:50 - right where we're using create the index
01:52 - with the uh the like one two three i
01:55 - think i explained that before
01:57 - basically using the 10 minus the count
01:59 - of the duck
02:00 - cow right into the first stock then it
02:03 - could be it will be one second that
02:05 - would be two and so on right
02:07 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
02:09 - going to replace this thing
02:11 - uh
02:12 - with negative
02:13 - with positive one so that means the gut
02:15 - shot okay
02:17 - and then we're going to set this
02:21 - duck shot to one so that means it got
02:24 - shot so they will actually stop the loop
02:27 - here you see how this loop only works if
02:29 - the duct shot is zero basically the duct
02:31 - will continue flying also here duck is
02:34 - shot is zero that means the duck is not
02:36 - dead or content you're moving up and
02:38 - down
02:39 - but as as soon as you get hit by the
02:41 - ducks uh the by the bullets we'll set it
02:44 - to one so it will stop these two loop
02:46 - from executing okay stop this guy in
02:49 - this guy okay
02:51 - all right so i hope you understand that
02:52 - so now let's continue
02:55 - so what we're going to do is put a
02:57 - little bit of weight here
02:59 - 0.2 second
03:01 - and then
03:03 - what we're going to do is we're going to
03:04 - switch to costume
03:07 - so switch the costume to duck seven so
03:10 - duck seven is the duck that is getting
03:13 - hit
03:13 - right before it falls down on uh dot
03:16 - eight
03:17 - so i'm gonna switch it to duct seven
03:20 - and then we'll broadcast a message
03:25 - okay say
03:30 - die
03:31 - okay so the
03:32 - kill
03:34 - okay after that so else will replace
03:40 - okay down here so if you miss
03:42 - uh we are going to replace the the index
03:46 - position
03:47 - to negative one so resetting it to
03:50 - negative one like we had here okay so
03:52 - what it's going to do is going to if it
03:54 - misses it will set it back to negative
03:56 - one when the duct is flying we're gonna
03:58 - set it to zero so just like how we
04:00 - headed up here let me zoom back out
04:03 - right here so when the duct is flying
04:05 - was set to zero so if i run this the
04:07 - first time
04:08 - you you see that it becomes zero so that
04:10 - means that one is active so if it gets
04:13 - shot then we're going to change this to
04:16 - one if it miss or set it to the negative
04:18 - one so we're using this if we can
04:20 - control the uh the stuck getting the
04:22 - shot and then those sprites okay
04:25 - so
04:26 - after that uh we are going to grab a
04:29 - another condition here
04:32 - okay put this under here we are going to
04:34 - use a uh
04:37 - a n block so basically we are going to
04:40 - check if the duck has
04:42 - if the player have enough bullets okay
04:45 - so if the bullet
04:48 - is equal to zero
04:51 - or
04:52 - n
04:54 - the
04:56 - duck shot is zero so basically you did
04:59 - not shoot the duck and you have no more
05:01 - bullets okay
05:04 - block shot is zero
05:07 - then we're going to broadcast a message
05:10 - say
05:13 - no more
05:15 - bullets
05:16 - okay
05:18 - all right
05:20 - okay so we have broadcast.die right so
05:23 - we're gonna coat the duct die in no more
05:24 - bullets okay so let's move down a little
05:27 - bit here
05:28 - okay let's do it here
05:30 - so when i receive
05:33 - the die right
05:36 - i guess i don't have any more space i
05:38 - might have to move up
05:39 - later okay so when that when the ducks
05:42 - die we're gonna say change
05:45 - the score
05:46 - by one okay so we get one point so if
05:49 - you want to give more point you can
05:50 - change it to ten okay and then we're
05:52 - gonna have to use a little bit of weight
05:54 - so that way it will try to set
05:56 - everything correctly so we're gonna put
05:58 - a half a second away here point zero
06:00 - five seconds okay
06:02 - then we are going to change the ducts to
06:05 - number eight costume which is the duck
06:07 - dying which is
06:08 - this one okay
06:10 - dying like this
06:11 - okay i'm gonna change it to this guy
06:14 - and then we are going to use a repeat
06:16 - until loop
06:19 - and then we're going to use the sensing
06:22 - and we want to sense until it touched
06:24 - ground basically touching this this
06:26 - sprite you see this right when i click
06:27 - it so basically when the duck dying
06:30 - is flying down
06:32 - we and you touch this then we are going
06:34 - to hide it okay so
06:36 - repeat until touch that so we what we
06:38 - want to do is make every time you know
06:41 - subtract uh
06:43 - uh subtract the change of y by minus
06:46 - four so slowly falling down okay
06:50 - and then we can
06:51 - play the sound
06:54 - start the sound
06:56 - drop so let's look at the sound here
06:58 - with duck drop
07:00 - and duck sound so duck drop is like this
07:04 - okay like boom like that
07:06 - okay
07:07 - and we are going to hide this stuff
07:12 - and then we have to use a stop other
07:14 - script and sprite
07:16 - okay stop our script inspired basically
07:19 - stop this thing
07:20 - and with a broadcast
07:22 - a message
07:24 - so basically we want to stop this and
07:25 - then we'll broadcast a message so
07:28 - the duck will not be moving again okay
07:30 - so it says dog
07:33 - caught
07:36 - so the dog catch the ducks okay
07:39 - all right
07:41 - okay so for no more bullet we also need
07:44 - to do something here
07:46 - we'll say no more bullets
07:48 - what we're going to do is we'll set the
07:51 - duct shot
07:57 - to
07:58 - negative one so he did not shoot the
08:00 - ducks okay
08:02 - go negative one
08:03 - we are going to do a weight
08:07 - uh 0.2 second and then we're gonna
08:10 - broadcast a message
08:15 - okay so it's a new message
08:18 - and it says fly away so basically you
08:21 - miss and the flight it flew away okay
08:25 - all right
08:27 - so for fly away you miss the ducks then
08:30 - what we want to do is
08:32 - we're gonna use the two broadcasts
08:34 - actually we're gonna have to use two of
08:36 - them
08:37 - so the first one uh fly away
08:40 - uh what we're going to do is we're going
08:42 - to animate the ducks just like how we
08:44 - did for the uh you know when the duck is
08:46 - flying like uh let me see where it is
08:50 - just like how we did you know up here
08:52 - you see this so we do something similar
08:55 - okay
08:56 - all right so let's just copy this set of
08:58 - code here
09:00 - let's just take it down here for now
09:03 - and let's go back to this okay so we're
09:05 - not using a forever loop we're gonna
09:07 - have to use a repeat loop repeat until
09:09 - loop
09:11 - okay
09:12 - so repeat until
09:16 - sensing will be saying touching edge
09:19 - okay so basically
09:21 - making the duck slowly fly up or to the
09:25 - side here and then slowly go away so
09:28 - whenever i touch the edge basically the
09:30 - left side right side or the top
09:32 - since it will not be in the bottom so it
09:34 - doesn't really matter so repeat that
09:38 - and then just take this out
09:40 - okay so we don't need this we don't need
09:43 - that
09:44 - okay but we are going to change it to
09:46 - dot one
09:48 - dot two and duck three so that one dot
09:52 - two and duck three are the one that's
09:53 - flying away you see
09:55 - this one and
09:56 - this one okay
09:58 - so we're gonna use those three
10:01 - so this is for animating it and we need
10:03 - another one um
10:05 - to move him up and down so we don't want
10:07 - to touch this loop let this enemy it's
10:09 - going and then we're gonna use another
10:11 - broadcast
10:12 - that way you know this can do his own
10:14 - thing and then the other code can do its
10:17 - own thing okay
10:19 - so when i receive fly away again
10:23 - uh
10:24 - we'll switch to custom one
10:26 - just to be safe
10:29 - that should be okay but let's switch
10:31 - into cluster one first which is the
10:33 - flying ducks
10:34 - flying up
10:36 - right
10:37 - and then we have a repeat until also but
10:40 - i will not use this
10:42 - so repeat until touching edge
10:44 - we are going to change the y
10:47 - by five
10:50 - change point
10:52 - so basically it will slowly slowly
10:54 - moving up like this okay
10:56 - change the y by five
10:58 - and change x oops sorry change the x
11:04 - okay
11:05 - change the x by the duct speed so
11:08 - wherever
11:09 - however the duct was flying before
11:11 - however fast it is it can't do that
11:13 - and also we want to have a if and else
11:16 - condition
11:18 - okay
11:20 - so if let's check the operator
11:24 - and we are going to check the direction
11:27 - so basically if the duck is flocked
11:29 - facing the left side will continue to
11:31 - face the left side and fly away if the
11:33 - duck let's say face the right side
11:36 - then we'll continue to
11:39 - face the right side fly away that's what
11:40 - we want to do so we're going to check
11:42 - the direction
11:44 - so the direction is less than zero right
11:47 - less than zero meaning like negative 90
11:49 - or something then it will be facing to
11:51 - the left right this is positive 90. so
11:53 - if i change it to negative 90 you can
11:55 - see it facing to the left so negative
11:56 - 90.
11:57 - if it's positive 90 it's facing to the
12:00 - right so i'm checking if the direction
12:02 - is less than zero let's say less than
12:04 - negative 90 is less than zero right
12:07 - so that means it's facing to the left
12:10 - then we will say change x
12:14 - by
12:16 - what we're going to do is we're going to
12:17 - use the operator
12:18 - this is the multiply
12:21 - so we'll use a multiply we're gonna
12:23 - multiply by a negative one so
12:26 - it will
12:27 - whatever the duck speed is
12:30 - it will it will kind of go like kind of
12:32 - like moving to the left and keep going
12:36 - okay actually we actually don't need
12:39 - this sorry let's put this in here
12:42 - okay
12:43 - let's try like this
12:46 - i think my uh my oco has it up here as
12:49 - well and down here i don't think we need
12:50 - that i think this should be okay enough
12:54 - and then when it gets to the end we want
12:56 - to hide it
12:58 - so let me zoom out again you can see the
13:00 - whole thing
13:01 - so we'll say hi
13:03 - and then
13:05 - we're gonna broadcast a new event
13:08 - uh new message say dog
13:13 - so if you miss the ducks
13:15 - the dog's gonna laugh at you okay
13:18 - all right
13:19 - okay so we're gonna test it out a little
13:21 - bit what i did is i kind of moved this
13:23 - guy to the side here so we can see a
13:25 - little bit better let's test it out so
13:28 - as you can see the duck is flying
13:31 - uh shoot him let's see
13:33 - oh come on
13:34 - so we saw you see when i showed him we
13:36 - change that and it falls down you see
13:38 - this become one you see that so let's
13:40 - run it again so this is zero
13:43 - so you see that
13:44 - it changed these shapes so the duct is
13:46 - on left side kind of fall down to the
13:48 - left if it's right it'll fall down to
13:50 - the right so we only have one ducks
13:52 - right now okay so
13:54 - let's say i missed
13:56 - so you see the duck flew away right
13:59 - but what we have to do is we're going to
14:01 - change it to the background to make it
14:03 - fly away also
14:05 - right and the dog has to laugh at you we
14:06 - haven't done that yet but if you can see
14:09 - this is kind of working fine where we
14:11 - shoot the box if you're able to
14:13 - put the box you know it changed the
14:15 - costume
14:16 - and then fell down right just like what
14:18 - we coded for right we just coated this
14:21 - part
14:23 - so this is the way you have the ducts
14:25 - falling down right and it died
14:28 - okay all right let's zoom out a little
14:29 - bit
14:31 - so what we did was we did the shot
14:34 - okay
14:35 - uh when they shot the duck then then we
14:38 - did the duck dying
14:40 - and then we did the uh no more bullets
14:42 - and there's no mobile duck will fly away
14:46 - until so we see if the duck is on the
14:48 - left side will continue fly away on the
14:49 - left side the right side continue to fly
14:52 - the weight on the right side let's say
14:54 - i missed three times you see the duck is
14:56 - on the right side will continue to fly
14:58 - up
14:59 - so
15:00 - if i miss let's say the duck is on the
15:02 - left side let me see stuff is on the
15:04 - left side and
15:05 - this is it the duck is flying on the
15:07 - left side okay
15:09 - all right so that's what we had so far
15:12 - okay so now what we want to do is go to
15:14 - the backdrop
15:17 - okay so go to backdrop
15:19 - uh
15:20 - what we're going to say is if the
15:24 - fly
15:24 - away
15:26 - and we are going to change this to
15:31 - backdrop number two okay so backdrop
15:34 - number two is this pink backdrop fly
15:36 - away but uh what we're going to do is
15:38 - we're going to change back to the first
15:40 - backdrop later when we have started
15:41 - again so we'll call that for for now
15:44 - let's just keep that so if you missed it
15:46 - if you missed three shot so let's say
15:49 - when you still shot you say fly away
15:52 - okay okay all right so let's put him
15:56 - back on this one okay
15:58 - let's go back
16:01 - now let's go work on the dog catching
16:03 - the ducks right if you if you if the
16:06 - duck die we want to go where the duck
16:09 - fall down the dog is going to appear and
16:10 - pick it up so let me take out this part
16:13 - first for now we'll
16:15 - we'll show this later for you so let's
16:17 - take that out first so let's go to the
16:19 - dock
16:19 - so i took this out so that's faster so
16:22 - don't have to dock like kind of block
16:23 - and then jump to the back with
16:26 - with the green flag and start again but
16:28 - in reality this had to be like this okay
16:30 - but i just just disconnect this for now
16:33 - so it's faster for coding and testing
16:36 - okay so
16:37 - we uh we're here
16:40 - okay so when the dog when the duck uh
16:43 - when you shoot the duck and the duck die
16:45 - your dog caught duck right so we're
16:47 - gonna call this one first
16:49 - so let's go to the event
16:51 - stop caught the duck
16:54 - we are going to play a sound
16:57 - so
16:59 - called duck okay so basically it's like
17:02 - the sound and then something like that
17:04 - so when they cut the duck
17:06 - and we are going to say go to
17:10 - okay
17:11 - uh we are going to use the
17:14 - y we're going to put like negative 20.
17:16 - okay so the dog is somewhere there
17:19 - and then the x position we don't take a
17:22 - sensing we're gonna go to where the duck
17:24 - uh landed so
17:26 - we're gonna use sensing here use this
17:28 - block so be sure to select the back part
17:32 - first so you have to select duck
17:34 - and then you select the x position okay
17:37 - and you put that here
17:39 - so after that
17:40 - you switch it
17:42 - switch to costume
17:44 - okay
17:44 - switch the costume to dog number eight
17:48 - so number eight let's take a look
17:50 - so number eight is this
17:52 - this dog with one duck so we only have
17:54 - one ducks in our game right now so it
17:57 - shows only one ducks we don't have two
17:59 - ducks or three ducks so these maybe
18:02 - later so so for now
18:04 - we'll use this one duck okay
18:09 - and then we say go to
18:13 - back layer
18:14 - okay basically i want him to go behind
18:17 - the ground the ground sprite so the
18:19 - ground grass will cover a little bit of
18:21 - him and then he'll go in the back layer
18:23 - okay
18:24 - so let's go back here so after that
18:27 - we're gonna say show since we hide the
18:29 - dog right after the dog jumped in behind
18:31 - the dock we're gonna show it
18:33 - okay yeah we're gonna put a wait
18:36 - one second
18:37 - so the player can see the duck getting
18:39 - you know the dog pick up the ducks
18:42 - and we're gonna hide the ducks again i
18:44 - mean hide the dog again
18:46 - and then we're gonna broadcast a new
18:47 - message
18:49 - and this message is called start again
18:53 - okay start
18:55 - again
18:56 - okay so this will allow
18:58 - the dog the uh the game to start again
19:02 - so after this
19:04 - okay so let's test that really quick so
19:07 - let's see
19:08 - so we shoot the problem let's see
19:12 - so you see that the dog comes up and
19:15 - pick up the duck wherever you shot the
19:16 - duck so let's say you shot the duck over
19:19 - here you see he comes up over here
19:21 - so if i if the duck is on this side
19:24 - so
19:25 - he comes up right here okay all right so
19:28 - this is where we have the dog kind of
19:30 - pick up the ducks
19:33 - okay so next
19:34 - we are going to call the dog when you
19:37 - miss so the dog laughs
19:39 - so what we're going to do is we're going
19:41 - to switch the costume
19:43 - to 11 so 11
19:47 - is where the dog
19:49 - laugh at you okay
19:52 - all right
19:54 - and 12 is also left so too custom so
19:58 - what we do the similar thing we have
19:59 - this duct showing so we also want to go
20:02 - to the back layer
20:04 - okay go to the back layer
20:06 - and then we're gonna we are going to say
20:10 - uh same thing
20:13 - so we are going to say
20:15 - uh similar to what this position here is
20:18 - so what we're going to say is put this
20:20 - over here and then we'll put it at
20:22 - negative 20 as well
20:24 - but uh for the position we'll just do a
20:27 - random so some
20:29 - somewhere between negative 120
20:32 - to
20:33 - 120 so somewhere between the tree here
20:36 - and this bush here so all pop up and
20:38 - laugh at you
20:39 - and we
20:41 - still show
20:43 - and then start the sound
20:48 - okay and then this is dark left okay so
20:51 - if you missed the dog will laugh at you
20:53 - and then we need another one
20:56 - so when i receive
20:59 - knock knock again so we want to keep let
21:01 - this thing do its own thing and we're
21:03 - going to use another thing to animate
21:05 - the dot
21:06 - so
21:07 - i'm going to use a repeat
21:09 - three time
21:11 - and then we are going to switch the
21:13 - costume
21:15 - to dog 11
21:17 - okay both dog in 11 and 12 are laughing
21:20 - so what we're going to do is we're going
21:21 - to use this and i'll say
21:24 - 0.2 second
21:26 - and we're gonna duplicate that and we're
21:29 - going to put dot 12 0.2 seconds after
21:32 - that
21:33 - we are going to hide the dot
21:37 - and then we're going to broadcast the
21:38 - same message here okay start again okay
21:42 - so this is what we have so far so let's
21:45 - save it
21:46 - so we have the dog catching the ducks
21:50 - dog laughing at you and dog laughing at
21:52 - you as well so this is the uh
21:54 - showing up where to show up this is what
21:57 - is doing the laughing animation okay
22:00 - all right so let's continue with this
22:03 - so now let's let's try it out
22:06 - so
22:07 - so let's see what i miss
22:10 - so you can see fly away the dog laugh at
22:12 - you but where to change it back also
22:14 - right so let's go back to the background
22:16 - here
22:18 - okay
22:19 - so when i say receive start again where
22:22 - we are
22:23 - telling the the doctor
22:25 - if you miss or you get the dog right
22:28 - both both scenario we start again right
22:30 - both if you cut the duck or if you miss
22:33 - still start again right so when i start
22:35 - again we're gonna switch it back to
22:36 - background number one okay
22:39 - all right so let's test it out so now i
22:42 - said this
22:43 - is it fly away after that just switch it
22:46 - back to this so let's say if i catch the
22:48 - duck
22:51 - so this is correct right okay all right
22:53 - so this is how it looks like so let's
22:55 - code this last piece and then we'll
22:57 - probably call this a uh
23:00 - end of this tutorial and then we'll have
23:01 - to do one uh one more probably to finish
23:04 - up the rest
23:06 - okay
23:07 - okay
23:08 - okay so let's try to finish this real
23:10 - quick
23:11 - when green flap is clicked
23:14 - we are gonna go to um negative 35 150
23:18 - that is around this area here i think
23:21 - right now is behind it but uh once we
23:24 - code it you'll see it so
23:26 - what we're going to do is we're going to
23:27 - say hi in the beginning we don't want to
23:29 - show because the dog is kind of walking
23:31 - around
23:32 - and then when we say
23:34 - game start
23:37 - okay so next we have this one here
23:41 - when game start
23:47 - start game
23:49 - what we want to do is we're gonna do a
23:50 - little bit of weight first wait until
23:52 - the uh the hit and everything set up and
23:55 - then we're gonna place these guys on
23:56 - here okay so this is our first duck okay
24:00 - so we're gonna switch to
24:03 - dark white dark white is this costume
24:06 - here
24:07 - you can see it really well it's like
24:09 - kind of white here and then dark red is
24:10 - the red costume okay so we're gonna
24:13 - switch the ducks
24:15 - okay so we're to switch it to the duck
24:18 - white
24:19 - and what we're going to do is make it go
24:21 - to the front layer so that will show up
24:23 - and then we're going to use the shield
24:26 - okay after that we are going to use a
24:29 - repeat
24:31 - and we'll repeat five times
24:33 - uh what we want to do we want to flash
24:34 - it so make sure look like flashing a
24:37 - little bit so what we're going to do is
24:39 - use the set
24:42 - okay we're going to set the ghost effect
24:47 - 100
24:51 - okay and then we're going to use a
24:52 - little bit of weight
24:57 - 0.25
24:58 - one fourth of a second
25:01 - and we're gonna duplicate this
25:02 - and then we uh
25:04 - stop this thing we're gonna put it to
25:06 - zero
25:08 - okay
25:09 - after that we're gonna set the ghost
25:11 - effect
25:13 - back to
25:15 - zero okay so that will show up again
25:18 - okay
25:19 - and then
25:21 - so let's see how that works and then
25:22 - when the shot fire we have to because of
25:25 - this shot fire right you remember
25:27 - when the when the gunshot
25:30 - fire and we had to check if the the
25:32 - ducks got hit right here also right with
25:34 - the uh
25:36 - sharp fire we check if the uh
25:38 - the the uh the duck got hit or not it
25:41 - was get hit then we put one if it's not
25:43 - got hit with but negative one right so
25:46 - here we we have to check that so when
25:48 - the shot fire
25:53 - okay shot fire what we're going to do is
25:55 - we're going to wait one second so make
25:57 - sure let let let the uh let this cold
26:00 - finish to set everything first and then
26:02 - we'll we'll do this so
26:04 - so we'll let that wait put the wait one
26:06 - second there so we had to set the uh the
26:09 - list right remember we're using this
26:11 - list so we're gonna set this guy to one
26:13 - not zero or you know zero is when it's
26:15 - starting one is when it got hit negative
26:18 - one is if it missed or in the beginning
26:20 - we set it all to negative one right so
26:22 - basically here we need a um if and else
26:25 - condition
26:27 - okay
26:28 - come move this like this a little bit
26:30 - over
26:31 - so in here what we're going to do is
26:33 - we're going to check
26:35 - the operator
26:37 - uh here we're gonna check the item in
26:40 - the list so this is the item in the list
26:42 - so item
26:44 - item number one which is the first item
26:47 - here okay
26:48 - if it's equal to one that means the duck
26:51 - got shot
26:52 - then we're gonna change it to the red
26:54 - ducks so we're gonna say
26:57 - change the costume to red dogs
27:00 - otherwise we're gonna change it to the
27:02 - white ducks okay so now let's test it
27:05 - out real quick
27:07 - so you can see it's zero right now see
27:10 - this is the uh it blinks you so you can
27:12 - see right if i start you see the the
27:14 - dots kind of blink blink blink that
27:16 - means this is the duck that we are
27:17 - working with
27:19 - so let's see if i
27:21 - i missed it so i missed it it's still a
27:23 - white ducks but if i get it get the
27:25 - ducks then
27:27 - you see
27:28 - it becomes a better so you see that so
27:30 - that's how this works so we're gonna
27:32 - keep track of that okay so we have our
27:35 - first red ducks and then we can like
27:37 - next one we'll start again and then new
27:40 - ducks flies up and then shoot them so i
27:42 - think the video is already a little bit
27:44 - too long so we'll stop right here for
27:46 - now so the next video will completely
27:49 - probably complete the game i think that
27:51 - should be able to do for the next video
27:54 - and uh yeah if you enjoyed the video

27:58 - and share with your friends and put a
