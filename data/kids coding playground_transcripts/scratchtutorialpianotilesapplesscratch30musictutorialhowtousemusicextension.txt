00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys it's kids coming
00:08 - playground here today we'll be doing
00:10 - another video on our channel so we'll be
00:12 - working
00:13 - on a catching the apples game with the
00:15 - piano sound of course
00:17 - so um so what so like when you play it
00:22 - so uh you have five lives and if you
00:24 - don't catch any apples
00:26 - and then you'll lose all your lives and
00:27 - it'll be game over
00:30 - and um so the tune is supposed to be um
00:33 - jingle bells it's like jingle bells
00:42 - so i'll just let you guys see it
00:46 - okay yeah so we just added a little um
00:49 - sound right here it's like it'll play
00:51 - jingle bells
00:52 - um and for each apple you touch you will
00:55 - get
00:56 - um one point and it will play the sound
00:59 - corresponding to the note so if you guys
01:02 - play any instrument you will know
01:04 - what these notes are so we got this idea
01:06 - from my cousin
01:08 - so our cousin made a similar game but um
01:11 - his is a little different because
01:13 - doesn't play a specific
01:15 - sound okay so this is our cousin's game
01:18 - he's not using the sound he's not using
01:20 - the sounds from the
01:22 - scratch but he's using pre-recorded
01:24 - tunes
01:26 - so if you like let's say if you guys
01:28 - don't have a piano
01:30 - then this would not work so using the
01:32 - sounds and you can you just use the
01:33 - sounds in this
01:34 - sprite library in the library okay so
01:37 - now
01:38 - we have our new project so we just start
01:41 - a new project
01:42 - let's rename it to um
01:46 - catch the apple the apple
01:51 - with piano i don't know you guys can
01:53 - name it whatever you want
01:55 - i'm going to name it like this and then
01:58 - we're going to delete the scratch hat
01:59 - we'll not need that
02:00 - and let me make it new backdrop okay now
02:03 - let's import some sprites into here
02:05 - so we already have the apple sprite
02:08 - which is basically
02:10 - just the apple from the scratch library
02:13 - and we just
02:13 - put a b c e f g so in
02:17 - in any instrument um the notes are
02:19 - denoted as
02:20 - a b c d e f g all the way up to g
02:24 - so i just changed the colors and added
02:27 - the letter of each one
02:28 - into here and change the color and
02:30 - rename each one
02:32 - so yeah so this is the sprite and the
02:35 - apple
02:35 - so next we have to get the bowl
02:38 - so this is the bowl it's for like
02:40 - catching the apples
02:42 - bowl and use that okay
02:45 - and we need a backdrop
02:48 - we gotta get the blue sky blue sky
02:51 - this one okay so for the bowl we're
02:55 - gonna start coding in here first
02:57 - so we have to code the movement let's
02:59 - get it one green flag clicked
03:01 - i'm zooming i'm gonna go to
03:06 - let's go to zero negative 135
03:11 - so this is the position i used it's like
03:13 - somewhere down here
03:15 - and i'm going to set the rotation style
03:17 - to left and right
03:19 - so then the bulb will not flip over when
03:20 - it's moving around
03:23 - okay and then we're going to add for our
03:24 - blue
03:26 - and then we're going to set the x to the
03:28 - mouse x
03:29 - so it will follow the mouse on the
03:31 - x-axis
03:33 - so like that and then if on edge bounce
03:35 - so then the ball cannot go off the
03:37 - screen
03:38 - so after this you want to get an if then
03:41 - statement so
03:42 - this is for detecting the score so i i
03:46 - made it go up to 100
03:47 - for testing purposes we're only going to
03:48 - do up to 30. so you need like
03:51 - um 30 score to win so this is just a
03:54 - detect
03:54 - um score we'll use that later so we're
03:56 - gonna make a variable let's name it
03:58 - score okay score
04:01 - and then we're going to do if score is
04:04 - greater than
04:06 - um let's say
04:09 - 30 or equal
04:14 - to 30
04:17 - then we can um
04:20 - then we will broadcast a message
04:24 - okay so now let's make a new message so
04:26 - we're going to broadcast a message if
04:28 - the score is greater than 30 or
04:30 - equal to 30 then we're going to
04:33 - write you in so you win
04:38 - okay and then have one thing here so
04:40 - this is
04:42 - for the jingle bell song so this is all
04:45 - the notes for the jingle bells song
04:47 - so what i did was i made a list called
04:50 - jingle bell song
04:51 - and after that i also made a new custom
04:54 - block and jingle bells
04:56 - so these two and then i had to manually
04:59 - write out each letter
05:00 - of the whole song so
05:04 - if you didn't know this is the letter in
05:08 - order you can pause the video
05:09 - and put it down if you want
05:12 - okay so now we're gonna have to put this
05:14 - all into the apple sprite
05:18 - okay let's delete the sprite and then
05:21 - now we have the apple sprite we've
05:22 - duplicated all this code
05:24 - into the apple so now in the apple we're
05:26 - going to code here so this is the
05:30 - the stuff you need the notes
05:34 - so after this we're going to get one
05:36 - green flag clicked
05:39 - and then we're going to get i'm going to
05:41 - zoom in
05:43 - and we're going to i'll play the jingle
05:44 - bell thing so
05:47 - that so run this custom block and then
05:50 - we're going to hide
05:51 - with the apple in the beginning and
05:54 - we're gonna set the score to zero
05:58 - score to zero and then we're gonna set
06:00 - the lives to five
06:02 - i mean you guys can do any so we're
06:05 - making a variable
06:06 - in lives you guys can set how many lives
06:08 - you want but i'm just gonna do five
06:10 - now let's do five
06:14 - and then we're gonna make a new variable
06:15 - let's name it song index
06:18 - song index so what's on
06:21 - song index this is just to detect the
06:25 - the jingle bells song so we'll use this
06:27 - later
06:28 - i'll show you guys how to use it and
06:30 - then we're gonna set
06:31 - why do i have two of these and take out
06:32 - one of them we only set score to zero
06:35 - set lives and then song index to zero
06:38 - and then
06:38 - i set the size to the apple so 75 in the
06:41 - beginning
06:43 - just to be a little bit smaller and
06:46 - forever loop
06:51 - forever create a clone of myself
06:55 - so we're going to create a clone of the
06:56 - apple and wait 0.5 seconds
07:00 - so this is creating clones of the apple
07:03 - okay and then after that we're going to
07:05 - when i started clone
07:09 - okay and one last thing i forgot to
07:11 - mention is
07:13 - you can make any song you want i'm just
07:15 - doing jingle bells because i've already
07:17 - um we've already done it for another
07:18 - video so in the santa decorating
07:20 - um project we already used it so we're
07:23 - just going to use it again
07:25 - so yeah now when i start as a clone it's
07:28 - going to want to start as a clone
07:31 - okay when i start as a clone if the song
07:34 - index is greater than jingle bell so
07:36 - the whole list of the jingle bells right
07:38 - here the length of it is 75
07:40 - i'm 25 and um
07:44 - so the land length of this list is 25
07:49 - so so this length is 25 so if
07:52 - we're gonna get an if-else statement if
07:55 - the song index is greater
07:57 - than the length of this list so this is
08:00 - to detect
08:00 - all right so if the song index is
08:02 - greater than the length then i'll
08:04 - restart it again
08:05 - and if it's not it'll continue playing
08:06 - it so we're going to get a song index
08:09 - the song index is greater than the
08:11 - jingle bell um
08:12 - not this one um length of the song
08:15 - a jingle bell song then we're gonna
08:19 - set the song index to one
08:23 - so go back to the beginning
08:27 - and else will change it up by one
08:30 - so it will keep on going down the list
08:33 - on which which um you'll get the next
08:36 - note
08:37 - to play the song index by one
08:41 - i'm gonna switch the costume
08:42 - corresponding to which note it is so
08:45 - switch costume
08:48 - to item so in here we have the item
08:53 - item song index
08:57 - of the jingle bells list and then we're
08:59 - gonna show
09:02 - okay and then we're gonna make it go to
09:05 - a
09:06 - pick random area in the beginning so
09:07 - we're going to make it
09:09 - go to pick random negative
09:12 - 210
09:15 - to 210. so if you've ever played this
09:18 - game called uh
09:19 - piano tiles this game is kind of like it
09:22 - it's kind of like the same thing and
09:24 - then we're gonna get a forever loop
09:28 - and then change y by negative five
09:32 - so it'll keep on going down change y by
09:34 - negative five
09:36 - and after that we're gonna get if then
09:39 - if
09:40 - so if it's touching the brown we're
09:41 - gonna like make it lose a life
09:44 - let the player lose a life so if
09:45 - touching color
09:48 - touching color
09:52 - brown beneath the select tool select
09:54 - this brown color and we're going to
09:55 - broadcast a message called
09:57 - lose a life
10:01 - lose a life oops
10:07 - so lose a life and then we're going to
10:09 - delete this clone
10:12 - if it's touching the brown and then
10:15 - right now we're going to do the
10:17 - playing the notes so um we noticed
10:20 - something when we were doing this
10:22 - if you put the play note inside the in
10:24 - if that statement it'll have a little
10:26 - pause because it has to play the note
10:28 - so we're gonna use broadcast messages so
10:30 - it won't get stuck so we're going to get
10:32 - an if then statement
10:33 - put that right under here so if it's
10:35 - touching the bowl the apple
10:37 - touching the bowl bowl
10:41 - and put another if if
10:45 - the costume name is equal to a so i
10:47 - named all my costumes corresponding to
10:49 - what
10:50 - um note it is so if the costume
10:54 - number is equal to a as you can see
10:57 - right here
10:58 - i named abcdefg so the costume number is
11:02 - a which is the first costume and we're
11:03 - going to broadcast a
11:06 - broadcast a
11:12 - a okay i'm gonna just duplicate this
11:16 - if the costume number is equal to
11:20 - b i mean not costume number name we have
11:22 - to change it to name
11:24 - okay so to change it just click the
11:25 - little triangle and become name
11:27 - so costume name or number if you would
11:29 - like you can just number
11:30 - instead so instead of if you were to do
11:33 - number if cost of number is equal to one
11:35 - let me broadcast a but i just named it
11:37 - so it's easier to understand
11:40 - and then so if the cost numbers equal to
11:41 - b they're in broadcast b
11:45 - and then duplicate this do it all the
11:48 - way up until g
11:50 - so costume name is equal to c then we're
11:52 - gonna broadcast c
11:56 - keep on doing this costume number is d
11:59 - name i mean name is equal to d then
12:00 - we're going to make a new one
12:02 - called d and then just
12:05 - copy all this duplicate
12:08 - put it under here costume name
12:12 - is equal to e
12:15 - then we'll broadcast e
12:19 - and then if costume name is equal to f
12:22 - then broadcast f
12:26 - and finally if costume name is equal to
12:28 - g
12:30 - broadcast g so then we won't need the
12:33 - last
12:33 - one right here so just take this out
12:36 - okay
12:38 - now we have all this a b c d e f g
12:41 - and then one last part is to change the
12:43 - score by one
12:44 - so once touching it i'll change the
12:46 - score by one
12:48 - change score by one and delete this
12:51 - clone
12:53 - delete it okay i'm gonna zoom out show
12:56 - you guys how it's like
12:57 - so this is the code for the thing and
13:00 - now we're gonna have to broadcast a
13:01 - little messages for to make some sound
13:04 - okay so now we're going to go back in
13:08 - and when i receive a we're going to have
13:11 - to do this
13:12 - a lot it's a bit tedious so to get this
13:16 - music
13:16 - extension click here and there should be
13:19 - a music
13:20 - right here so you just click this thing
13:22 - and you'll get all of this
13:24 - so we're going to play the note um
13:27 - a so a is this one if you guys play
13:30 - piano then you'll know
13:32 - so one two three four five this is a
13:35 - so i play piano so i know this is a
13:39 - this a and if you want it to be
13:42 - and then the b and also if you want it
13:44 - to be lower or higher you can
13:46 - do this you have some low notes right
13:48 - here
13:50 - but i just keep it right here so b
13:53 - just in the middle area of the piano so
13:56 - in b
13:57 - i'm going to play b
13:58 - [Music]
14:00 - play this b 71 for 0.5 beats
14:04 - duplicate again so in c
14:08 - uh we're going to play middle c
14:12 - this one and then d
14:16 - we're going to play this one
14:19 - and e
14:24 - you're going to play this one
14:27 - and then f you'll play this one
14:32 - and then finally you got g so i will not
14:36 - if you guys don't play piano i will
14:37 - tell you guys what the numbers are so
14:39 - then you guys can copy it down easier
14:41 - so 67 right here
14:44 - okay so i'll do okay so the first one's
14:46 - 69 second 171
14:49 - third one is 60 d is 62
14:52 - e is 64. f is 65 and g is 67.
14:56 - okay now we can try it out okay let's
14:59 - try it out now let's play
15:01 - let me hide the list
15:04 - hide song index as well save it
15:10 - so as you can see it's playing at the
15:12 - jingle bell somewhere it might sound a
15:13 - little off too
15:14 - because this is scratch and
15:17 - it's not like real life you can't play
15:19 - each note for a certain
15:21 - amount of length
15:30 - so it kinda sounds like jingle bells not
15:32 - completely but like
15:34 - um i think it should do okay
15:39 - so it looks like we are finished with
15:40 - this we can
15:42 - go to the bowl so in the bowl we have to
15:44 - add one more script
15:46 - and right here in the apple we broadcast
15:50 - lose a life for here when it's touching
15:51 - the brown color so we're gonna have to
15:53 - receive it
15:54 - so when i receive the lose a life
15:58 - then i will change the lives
16:02 - by negative one
16:05 - and i will do this if
16:10 - lives is equal to zero
16:15 - lives is equal to zero
16:19 - then we can broadcast game over
16:22 - signifying that the player has lost
16:25 - game over
16:30 - game over so we're going to make a new
16:31 - sprite
16:33 - let's paint the new sprite so we're
16:35 - going to use the text
16:37 - so for the text we are going to write
16:40 - one for you
16:40 - in and one for you lose so usually for
16:42 - winning i usually do green
16:45 - and losing i usually do red
16:48 - so you win
16:53 - so you win you can make this bigger
16:58 - right here and then for the you lose
17:01 - just copy paste this
17:03 - and we can just do this you lose
17:07 - and then make this red so we're gonna
17:10 - make this red
17:12 - and then we're gonna just drag this to
17:14 - the center center all your sprites
17:15 - remember that now we have
17:18 - the two you win and you lose so now
17:21 - we're going to code for that
17:22 - when green flight clicks you want to go
17:25 - to zero zero
17:26 - with the sprite
17:30 - and then hide
17:34 - and after that when i receive
17:38 - um game over so right here in the apple
17:43 - um we have the you lose
17:47 - lose a life right here so broadcasting
17:48 - the bull and then right here we have
17:51 - to lose a life if lives are equal to
17:53 - zero then we broadcast game over
17:55 - and right here we have the you win if
17:58 - the score
17:58 - is greater than or equal to 30. for
18:01 - testing purpose we're going to keep it
18:02 - at 30.
18:03 - so next we're going to switch costume
18:08 - to costume one which is
18:12 - i mean so if you win if we switch the
18:15 - costume to costume one which is winning
18:18 - and we're gonna go to the front layer
18:19 - and stop all
18:22 - like this and show i forgot the show
18:26 - put the show before the stop all and
18:29 - then duplicate this
18:30 - when you lose game over then we're going
18:33 - to switch cosmic costume 2 which is the
18:35 - losing one
18:37 - and go to front layer show and stop all
18:39 - so we're going to play it
18:41 - so i'm gonna lose first
18:45 - so so as you can see when you get less
18:49 - than that then you lose
18:50 - so when you get more than 30 score
19:08 - so as you can see we got 30 score and we
19:11 - win
19:12 - so yeah that's it for this video
19:15 - and before we end the video we would
19:17 - like to tell you one more thing
19:19 - if you do not like the apple you can
19:21 - just make it a piano
19:22 - key or something like that and then
19:25 - our song jingle bells is only a section
19:28 - of the song so if you would like to make
19:29 - it even longer you may
19:31 - and um you can play whatever song you
19:34 - would like
19:35 - like i said earlier so yeah please like
19:38 - share and subscribe and ring the
19:41 - notification bell
19:42 - and we'll see you in the next tutorial
19:52 - [Music]
19:54 - you
