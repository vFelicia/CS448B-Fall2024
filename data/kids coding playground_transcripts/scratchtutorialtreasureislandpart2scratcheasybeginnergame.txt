00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys it's
00:08 - kidscodingplayground here
00:09 - and welcome back to another video this
00:11 - is actually part two of treasure island
00:14 - so in the last video we did all of this
00:16 - jazz
00:17 - um we did the sailboat coding
00:21 - and we also did the backdrop because the
00:22 - backdrop has barely any code
00:24 - and we also drew the backdrop and all
00:27 - that stuff
00:28 - so we also um so
00:33 - if you haven't watched part one yet
00:34 - please watch part one before you watch
00:36 - part two
00:37 - because um you probably don't know
00:39 - what's going on right now
00:40 - so i'm gonna drag around here if you
00:43 - have it if you missed any code
00:44 - so this is just it this is all the code
00:46 - for the sailboat
00:49 - so today first i will code
00:54 - the pirate ship so yeah you can change
00:57 - your pirate ship to 25 or whatever you
00:59 - want because
01:00 - some downloaded pirate ships are bigger
01:02 - than the other or they're too small
01:04 - so you can change whatever size you want
01:07 - so this one was a little bit big so i
01:09 - changed it to 25
01:11 - so when the green flag is clicked
01:17 - i always have to use zoom in oh go to
01:20 - l point in direction
01:24 - negative 90. i already put on the do not
01:26 - rotate
01:27 - a left right um important in direction
01:31 - negative 90.
01:36 - so and then you'll go to this position
01:38 - you can make it go
01:39 - anywhere let's go around here start like
01:42 - around here so that
01:44 - won't be that bad so go to here
01:47 - and then oh forever
01:52 - but forever um move
01:55 - 1.5 steps so that's a one and a half
01:58 - steps
02:03 - five steps and then if then
02:09 - touching
02:15 - touching that way touching's in here
02:17 - touching this cup
02:18 - any this collar right here
02:23 - because it basically there's an island
02:25 - right here so if it's touching here
02:27 - this island right here because there's
02:29 - an island right here so and it's green
02:31 - it'll point in direction 90 and go
02:34 - backwards
02:38 - and then if it's on the edge it will
02:40 - bounce
02:43 - so yeah so
02:47 - so my pirate ship was started out
02:50 - pointing on the right side i wanted it
02:52 - to be on the left side because it's
02:53 - walking left
02:54 - so i put it on negative 90. so let's try
02:57 - it out
02:59 - as you can see the pirate ship is moving
03:00 - but not shooting a cannonball yet
03:03 - so um as you can see
03:07 - you have to put an island right here so
03:08 - then you'll go backwards once it touches
03:10 - it
03:10 - [Music]
03:15 - okay so that's basically um and you also
03:18 - have to
03:18 - put the if you if they get the treasures
03:22 - i'll stop other scripts in this right
03:29 - so next sprite we're going to work on is
03:32 - the ball
03:32 - the cannonball um
03:36 - we have to always start off if flag
03:38 - clicked
03:40 - it always zooms out
03:46 - all right there i'll set the size to
03:48 - let's say about
03:50 - 70 or 75 or something like that let's do
03:53 - 70.
03:54 - um i'll hide in the beginning
03:59 - you need a forever loop but wait
04:02 - one second it'll create a clone of
04:05 - itself
04:06 - so you'll make like duplicates of itself
04:10 - and then when i receive got treasures
04:14 - whenever you've got treasures stop other
04:18 - trips in this sprite
04:26 - so this is for the clone it's a really
04:28 - big chunk of code
04:31 - let's move it down so it'll go to the
04:33 - pirate ship because the pirate ship
04:35 - shoots out the um cannonball
04:40 - a point in direction point in direction
04:46 - um i think it's actually point
04:53 - so it's actually this one so it's point
04:56 - in direction
04:57 - not 90. we have to go to sensing and get
05:00 - something pretty special
05:01 - it's called backdrop of stage you know
05:04 - as you can see if you change the first
05:06 - one um
05:08 - it doesn't it doesn't show you x
05:09 - position or anything like that
05:11 - so you gotta change it to pirate ship so
05:14 - then you can
05:15 - change the exposure position or all the
05:17 - stuff but we're actually using direction
05:20 - so we can put that inside there
05:26 - um let's make it move 40
05:30 - steps the cannon ball moves us 40 steps
05:36 - and then it'll set the y
05:41 - to negative 150
05:49 - so the um the move 40 steps is to put it
05:53 - at the tip of the pirate ship
05:54 - if yours is a bigger or smaller um
05:58 - then you have to make it different so
06:01 - if you you can set the y to negative 150
06:05 - is to adjust the cannonball around the
06:07 - ship to make it
06:08 - um shoot from the front because it's
06:11 - because you have to adjust it if it
06:14 - doesn't match later that means i have to
06:16 - make it around there
06:21 - and then you need to repeat until
06:25 - a or a or statement and another or
06:29 - statement it's touching
06:34 - the color
06:38 - this color
06:41 - the the cannonball will keep on going
06:43 - until it's touching this color
06:46 - touching
06:50 - touching edge
06:54 - or touching the sailboat
07:00 - oops and i'll move 10 steps
07:05 - and i'll delete the clone after
07:07 - afterwards
07:14 - so the ball is i i think it's way too
07:16 - big
07:17 - so let's test it out as you can see the
07:19 - ball is way too big
07:21 - so um i'm gonna decide to change it to
07:24 - 30
07:25 - to make it more smaller
07:31 - as you can see that's about the right
07:33 - size um
07:36 - let's make the y negative 130 instead
07:41 - let's save the project and you see it's
07:44 - like going from the top of the
07:46 - pirate ship let's test the game one more
07:50 - time
07:51 - so as you can see the sailboat is
07:54 - following the mouse point arc
07:55 - and if it bumps into the green it gets
07:57 - red or if it touches the pirate ship it
08:00 - gets wrecked too
08:02 - you can also gather the treasures in and
08:04 - it stops everything
08:06 - so let's see if the cannonball works as
08:09 - you can see it says
08:10 - the ship has been that's basically it
08:12 - for the game
