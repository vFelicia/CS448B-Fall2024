00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to kids cutting
00:09 - playground
00:09 - today we'll be making the second part
00:11 - for the space shootout game
00:13 - so i will be um i will be sharing this
00:18 - project so if you have any confusion on
00:20 - it
00:21 - you can just check it out on my scratch
00:23 - account
00:25 - so i'm just gonna review the code so
00:27 - this is the movement code
00:29 - and setting stuff in the beginning for
00:31 - the player one
00:33 - this is for player two
00:36 - the movement for player two and
00:39 - laser one over here
00:46 - so this is the code for the player one
00:48 - laser
00:49 - and this is the code for the laser laser
00:52 - for the second one
00:54 - laser one and laser two are pretty much
00:56 - the same thing except for some
00:57 - different sensing you just have to
01:00 - switch it
01:01 - switch it around and one more thing we
01:05 - have to add
01:06 - so this is if this is for if the player
01:08 - will die
01:09 - so if the shield will need this later
01:13 - so if uh the shield is less than or
01:17 - equal to zero
01:23 - the player one shield this is for player
01:25 - one so if the player one shield is less
01:27 - than or equal to zero
01:30 - then we can broadcast a new message
01:32 - we'll need this message later
01:34 - called hide player one shield
01:43 - hide player one shield will need the
01:45 - same code for player two
01:47 - if
01:51 - if the uh player two shield
01:55 - is less than or equal to zero
02:02 - player two shield is less than or equal
02:04 - to zero then we'll broadcast another
02:06 - message
02:10 - we'll call it hide player 2 shield
02:14 - so let's go here hide
02:18 - hide player to
02:21 - shield hide player two shield
02:27 - we'll need those broadcasts later so
02:29 - let's work on the shields right now so
02:30 - this is the outside shield the player
02:32 - one shield one
02:34 - so when flag clicked i want to show it
02:38 - and get a forever loop forever
02:42 - i want this to go to the player player
02:44 - one this is for the
02:46 - player one shield and i i made this
02:49 - uh outside shield turn five degrees
02:52 - at five degrees to the right
02:56 - and if it's touching if
02:59 - touching the player two shield one
03:03 - touching player two shield one so if
03:05 - it's touching this outer shield
03:07 - player two shield one so this is to
03:10 - prevent them from going
03:11 - near each other because i found it a bug
03:13 - where if you
03:14 - uh you um if there's no bounce if they
03:17 - don't go bouncy
03:18 - if they touch each other and they don't
03:20 - bounce apart then
03:21 - one player can get on top of the other
03:23 - and kill them immediately
03:25 - so we need to broadcast a new message
03:28 - called bounce
03:29 - we'll need that later
03:33 - bounce and right here from the
03:37 - player one we broadcasted hide player
03:39 - one shield
03:40 - so when i received that we want to hide
03:45 - and then for the player 2 shield it's
03:47 - pretty much the same thing
03:49 - except we do not need that last bit of
03:51 - script
03:52 - of the bouncing part we do not need this
03:57 - this part right here this part we do not
03:59 - need
04:00 - and instead of five degrees instead of
04:03 - turning right five degrees we can turn
04:05 - left i made it turn seven degrees to the
04:08 - left
04:08 - you guys can make it however slow or
04:10 - fast you want
04:12 - the faster it is the harder it is to get
04:14 - it through both the shields
04:18 - so i did um turn left one of them and
04:21 - for the right i did turn right on them
04:24 - so um we can so now you have to turn
04:27 - right
04:28 - and turn left so it's opposite
04:31 - and for player one when it receives
04:34 - bounce
04:37 - then we can like change the x by
04:39 - negative thirty so
04:41 - they cannot come together
04:45 - [Applause]
04:46 - okay and then for player 2
04:50 - it's um we also have to do the same
04:53 - thing
04:54 - for the bounce just drag and drop it
04:56 - into player two
04:58 - and instead of negative 30 we're going
05:00 - to do 30 since
05:01 - it's already pointing to the left so
05:03 - making it go even more to the left
05:05 - wouldn't make sense
05:06 - so we have to make it 30 since it's
05:08 - already pointing to this way
05:11 - and then finally for the um
05:15 - and then for the text we have text
05:19 - this for winning and losing so
05:22 - from the uh players we broadcast i mean
05:24 - the lasers we broadcasted a message
05:27 - called player two and player one dead
05:29 - right here
05:30 - so i already have the costumes so
05:33 - player one wins and player two wins i
05:36 - made one in red and one in blue
05:38 - because this one's blue and this one's
05:39 - red
05:41 - so i'm just gonna add the code so
05:44 - when i res when i receive player two
05:49 - player one dead
05:52 - when i receive player one dead switch
05:54 - costume
05:55 - to costume one which is the first
05:58 - costume
05:59 - which is player one um i'm sorry sorry
06:03 - um
06:03 - switch to the costume two because when
06:07 - the player one is dead we want to switch
06:08 - to the second one
06:09 - noting that the second second player has
06:12 - one
06:13 - and then we want to show and stop all
06:19 - and then we need to duplicate this
06:22 - instead of player one dead we'll use
06:25 - player two dead
06:27 - player two dead instead we'll switch
06:29 - costume costume one since the player two
06:31 - is dead that means the
06:32 - player one is winning and then we want
06:35 - to show stop ball
06:36 - and then when flat clicked we want to go
06:39 - to zero zero which is
06:40 - the center go to the front layer
06:47 - and hide in the beginning
06:51 - okay so
06:54 - next finally we have to do the ladybug
06:57 - alien code
07:02 - okay so first for the ladybug alien with
07:05 - whatever you want to call it we have to
07:06 - create a custom block
07:08 - called create alien
07:14 - create alien click ok
07:17 - and then for this one every uh every
07:20 - time
07:20 - you'll clone two of them so repeat two
07:22 - times create a clone of myself
07:26 - and then for uh get a one fly clicked
07:30 - when flag is clicked we want to set this
07:32 - variable we made in the beginning
07:34 - set the alien set for player 1 that
07:36 - variable to 0
07:39 - in the beginning and then i want to set
07:40 - the size to 50 percent
07:42 - the alien should be 50 so it's not too
07:45 - big
07:46 - and then i'm going to wait one second
07:50 - and then and then it'll start creating
07:52 - aliens after one second
07:54 - so you call this block this code right
07:57 - here create alien
07:59 - and then in the scrolling platformer i
08:02 - also
08:02 - did this so we want to set the x to
08:05 - negative 99999
08:06 - so then the actual alien not the clone
08:09 - will get off the screen
08:10 - sometimes the hide does not work and i'm
08:13 - just going to put the hide here just in
08:14 - case
08:15 - so after that we want to get when i
08:18 - start as a clone
08:20 - when i start as a clone let's make it
08:24 - soon
08:24 - a little bit when i started to clone i
08:26 - want to go to
08:29 - pick random
08:32 - i want to make it pick random negative
08:35 - 200 and
08:36 - oh no you don't need this one negative
08:39 - 200
08:40 - to 200. so the aliens will spawn
08:43 - from this x position so like this one
08:46 - somewhere in between
08:48 - and then for the y i made it 150 so
08:50 - it'll be like
08:51 - spawn like above here
08:54 - and i want to show after that
08:58 - show and then after that
09:02 - um we we need to make a variable called
09:04 - flying to spaceship name
09:06 - in the beginning i told you there's one
09:08 - in the first video i told you guys
09:10 - there's one
09:11 - variable for this spread only so
09:14 - since i already i got this from a
09:16 - backpack that's why it already has it
09:18 - but this is for this sprite only make
09:20 - this variable called flying to spaceship
09:22 - name
09:23 - and it should be only for this sprite
09:27 - so remember that and then we want to set
09:29 - the flying to spaceship name
09:31 - to blank in the beginning to nothing
09:34 - and then if get an if else statement
09:39 - if that uh alien set her player
09:43 - player one is equal to zero
09:49 - alien set for player one
09:53 - then we can set the flying to spaceship
09:55 - name to player one
10:00 - player one
10:04 - player one and set the alien
10:08 - set for player one to one
10:11 - else we will do set flying to spaceship
10:14 - name to player two
10:18 - so this is just to pick random which
10:21 - spaceship the alien will go for
10:24 - and you have to spell it exactly how
10:26 - it's like
10:27 - or it'll get messed up and then we need
10:30 - to get
10:31 - a point towards point towards
10:36 - the flying to spaceship name so it can
10:39 - be either
10:40 - the player one or the player two and
10:43 - then we wanna get a repeat until
10:47 - repeat until the um is touching
10:50 - the flying to spaceship name
10:53 - whichever one player one or player two
10:57 - and then we move three steps
11:01 - move three steps if touching edge
11:05 - if it's touching the edge
11:10 - touching edge then we'll move it back
11:14 - to pick random
11:17 - pick random uh go to pick random
11:21 - negative 200
11:22 - to 200 so if it's touching the edge
11:24 - we'll make it go back somewhere up here
11:29 - and the y is 150
11:32 - and duplicate this
11:36 - so
11:40 - oh my god oops duplicate
11:45 - at this right here get an ore
11:50 - if it's touching the laser one or
11:53 - laser two
11:57 - laser one or laser two so if it's
12:00 - touching either one of those we want it
12:02 - to disappear
12:04 - um so we'll make no not disappear but
12:05 - make it just respawn somewhere up here
12:08 - to make it look like the laser will kill
12:10 - it or something
12:11 - and then next we want to get if touching
12:14 - if if
12:19 - it's touching we need three oars
12:29 - actually we only need two i think so
12:32 - and then we'll need it to do um if
12:35 - touching player one
12:38 - player one or player one
12:42 - uh shield shield one player one shield
12:45 - one
12:46 - or the player one shield two
12:49 - then we wanna broadcast player1.hit and
12:53 - wait
12:56 - player1.hit and wait and then we want to
12:58 - make it
12:59 - go back to this random position
13:04 - and then we want to just duplicate this
13:06 - whole chunk of code
13:07 - put it under here instead of player one
13:09 - we'll do player two
13:10 - instead of player one shield one do
13:12 - player two shield one
13:14 - and instead of player one shield two
13:16 - we'll do player shield two
13:17 - uh player two he'll to and then we'll
13:20 - broadcast
13:22 - player 2 got hit and then we'll make it
13:25 - go back to random position
13:28 - okay so now we are done we can save our
13:31 - project
13:31 - and i will show you guys and i also
13:35 - forgot to do one last thing
13:36 - add the code for these so i'm just going
13:39 - to drag and drop
13:41 - it for the red red shields
13:48 - forgot about that drag
13:51 - right here so for here instead of we'll
13:54 - do hide player two shield
13:58 - instead this one's hide player one
14:00 - shield this is hide player two shield
14:02 - and instead of go to player one we wanna
14:04 - make it go to player two
14:06 - and if touching player one shield one
14:09 - instead
14:11 - and then right here
14:16 - hide player two shield go to player two
14:21 - and turn instead of turn five degrees we
14:24 - make it
14:25 - turn we do not need this piece of code
14:27 - as well
14:28 - make it turn to the left seven degrees
14:33 - there you go so now let's play it
14:38 - so as you can see oh yeah let me show
14:40 - the variables
14:41 - of the shield so that you can see the
14:44 - health go down
14:46 - so i'm just going to move this on this
14:48 - side
14:49 - move this on this side i'm going to
14:50 - double click on it so then
14:52 - i'll be like that so
14:55 - my dad will be playing here so it's wasd
14:58 - and spacebar
14:59 - and then i'll do i'll be playing as
15:01 - player two
15:08 - so as you can see you can't go together
15:10 - and actually shot
15:12 - he actually my dad actually shot me
15:13 - through here
15:15 - so yeah that's pretty much the game
15:18 - and i also forgot one last thing to add
15:22 - the music so i actually download a
15:26 - non-copyright music from the youtube uh
15:29 - audio list
15:33 - so i need to get the sound
15:36 - it's just i'm just gonna upload it you
15:38 - guys can do get whatever you want
15:42 - i just got a short song i guess
15:45 - i'm just gonna do that
15:49 - and the song is kind of soft so i'm
15:51 - gonna turn up the volume
15:53 - a little bit
15:56 - so okay um and also
16:00 - i'm gonna make the hp for this a little
16:02 - bit lower maybe
16:03 - like 500 just so i can show you
16:06 - how the shield disappears at the end
16:09 - when you lose all your health
16:14 - and then so i'm just gonna destroy one
16:17 - shield
16:18 - [Music]
16:20 - oops i actually shot through it okay
16:23 - [Music]
16:28 - i might as well also change the bullet
16:30 - damage
16:31 - so then i can have like
16:34 - maybe 50 negative 50. let's see
16:38 - [Music]
16:42 - so as you can see i just destroyed the
16:44 - enemy shield
16:46 - as you can see boom it's already gone
16:51 - so i'm gonna show you guys one more time
16:54 - oh i actually went through
16:56 - [Music]
16:58 - see now the shield is gone and you can
16:59 - just one shot them
17:02 - so that is the game the two-player
17:07 - a two-player space shootout game
