00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids going
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video of scratch and today we
00:11 - made this epic game called dragon's
00:13 - jungle which is a new game that we'll be
00:15 - posting on my uh scratch account and so
00:19 - you guys can play it and you guys can
00:20 - make it yourself in this tutorial i'll
00:22 - be telling you how to make dragon's
00:24 - jungle
00:25 - we were busy and we went on vacation so
00:27 - now we're back so then we can make some
00:29 - more content for the channel and now uh
00:32 - i'm going to be showing you
00:34 - what dragon's raid is basically about
00:37 - so you're this wizard
00:39 - and you try to blast out the skeletons
00:41 - and
00:47 - and then you see whenever they die they
00:49 - make a sound right and then the stars
00:52 - wherever you click they will go if you
00:54 - click up here they'll go and whatever
00:56 - skeletons
00:58 - [Music]
01:09 - yeah the skeleton has my
01:11 - life tool that it has it takes more time
01:14 - to kill than the bat and then once you
01:16 - wipe out the other peons the uh big dude
01:19 - comes out the dragon and then you see
01:22 - you have to start blasting the dragon
01:24 - and you see
01:26 - hp and he goes uh quite uh
01:29 - slowly but he will one shot you no
01:32 - matter how much lodge you are and you
01:34 - will always lose but if you kill him you
01:36 - win so we'll try to kill him right now
01:42 - okay i'm going to kill him real quick oh
01:43 - my gosh
01:46 - so close okay okay i'll be back i'll be
01:49 - back guys i'm killed so i forgot to tell
01:51 - you guys you have to get more than 250
01:53 - points to fight the epic boss battle so
01:56 - uh this time i'll actually beat the
01:58 - dragon i'll be right back
02:00 - so as you can see i'm about to kill him
02:02 - i'm taunting for a little bit loser
02:04 - loser
02:06 - player oh my gosh okay will you win see
02:09 - i did it in yellow color instead of
02:11 - green color because it's just
02:13 - like yellow because the background is
02:15 - green so anyways let's get started
02:19 - so i made a new project and guys let's
02:22 - be untitled 43 more like dragons jungle
02:27 - and
02:28 - now of course we don't ever need the
02:30 - scratch cat only in like rare occasions
02:32 - but we're going to start with
02:35 - we're gonna get these uh
02:37 - sprites quick uh so let's get the wizard
02:40 - which is uh over here
02:43 - the wizard i know it's kind of big i
02:45 - don't know how big my wizard is
02:47 - i don't know how big let me see uh 50 so
02:51 - move this 50 we'll get every we see all
02:53 - the sprites right now we should be good
02:54 - and um
02:57 - uh the star
03:00 - we have a star where's the stars
03:05 - and then we have the star
03:07 - and we have the
03:10 - skeleton i'll draw the gigantic hitbox
03:13 - i'll explain everything in a moment
03:15 - skeleton
03:17 - uh
03:19 - bat and dragon so
03:21 - let's go get the bat and dragon i think
03:24 - i need to
03:25 - change the size of some things like the
03:27 - bat i'm pretty sure this thing's 50
03:30 - not mistaken
03:32 - yeah 50 it is
03:33 - and
03:35 - and now let's get this done oh
03:38 - skeleton's also 50 i think let me see
03:41 - 75 skeleton 75
03:44 - and now let's get everything started so
03:46 - backdrop you want to get is forest
03:51 - it's the one that i use
03:52 - one yeah so it's because it's the
03:55 - dragon's jungle and another uh yeah so
03:59 - just get the dragon uh
04:00 - jungle the dragon's jungle and then now
04:03 - we have two sprites to make but i'll
04:04 - make the you win you lose bright later
04:06 - but let's right now uh paint a new
04:08 - sprite
04:11 - that is um
04:15 - so
04:16 - uh so you have this
04:18 - take a random like green color why not
04:22 - you make the sprite
04:24 - and
04:25 - no no outline so you make a
04:29 - gigantic
04:32 - uh
04:33 - green thing a more like a green
04:36 - uh sprite and it's the hit box actually
04:40 - not the hitbox the thing that lets you
04:42 - shoot your stars which is really useful
04:45 - because the stars normally uh like if
04:48 - you click it'll just go exactly where
04:50 - you click and it'll explode there
04:52 - but
04:53 - if you don't have this that means
04:56 - you won't be able to control your stars
04:58 - where you want your stars it'll just go
04:59 - straight forward so we don't want any of
05:02 - that so now let's get the
05:05 - code
05:06 - started so when the green flag is
05:08 - clicked
05:12 - we will
05:15 - uh
05:16 - go to
05:17 - zero zero because
05:19 - it's just a gigantic green screen
05:22 - and go to the back layer so then be
05:24 - behind everything go to back layer
05:29 - it will set ghost effect to 100
05:36 - to a hundo
05:38 - and
05:39 - hide
05:41 - because it has to be hidden the whole
05:43 - entire thing because nobody wants a
05:44 - green screen blocking wherever they're
05:46 - shooting and then forever
05:49 - it will if then the mouse is down
05:53 - like if it you click pull down if you're
05:56 - clicking right now if the mouse is down
05:59 - that means it'll set
06:01 - new variable
06:02 - x
06:04 - new variable y
06:07 - and
06:08 - yeah x and y so set x
06:12 - to mouse x which is
06:15 - basically the coordinates of your
06:19 - oh no
06:21 - you the coordinates of your uh
06:24 - mouse so you want to set y
06:27 - and instead of mouse x
06:30 - drag in the mouse y
06:33 - and broadcast
06:35 - shoot star and wait because this is this
06:37 - whole entire sprite is dedicated to the
06:39 - star
06:43 - and now we're done with this code now
06:47 - all we have to work on the wizard and
06:48 - the wizard should be quite easy it does
06:50 - not have
06:51 - much code so when the green flag is
06:54 - clicked
06:59 - uh it will go to
07:02 - x
07:03 - okay i have coordinates it's going to be
07:04 - on the right side
07:06 - so 1 90 negative 40. and it will set
07:10 - rotation cell left right
07:12 - if you remember in our old videos we
07:14 - always use this block so it will not
07:16 - flip over because if without this and
07:18 - you set that direction to negative 90
07:20 - that means it would flip over and we do
07:22 - not want that so set point direction
07:24 - negative 90
07:26 - because it's pointing to the left side
07:28 - and so the right side and then try to
07:29 - kill the bats and skeletons coming from
07:32 - the left side so and we have point
07:34 - direction negative 90 and then it'll set
07:39 - new variable
07:40 - lives
07:43 - and score so we're going to make set
07:45 - lives
07:46 - to five say five lives so if you get hit
07:48 - by five times from the skeleton or the
07:50 - bat that means you lose a life and if
07:53 - you get hit by the dragon you
07:54 - automatically lose and then score
07:57 - so if you set you have to set the score
07:59 - to zero because you don't you didn't
08:01 - kill anything yet so you start zero and
08:03 - then uh
08:05 - you'll
08:06 - go to
08:07 - front layer because
08:09 - it's just the wizard you don't want it
08:10 - to be like behind
08:12 - a bunch of stuff that you don't want it
08:14 - to be behind and when i receive shoot
08:18 - star i'll switch costume to
08:21 - wizard c so it's this costume
08:24 - like like pointing and then that's where
08:27 - it shoots the uh thing
08:30 - cost you to wizard c wait 0.5 seconds
08:33 - and
08:34 - switch back
08:36 - to
08:37 - wizard
08:40 - a
08:43 - and we're done with the wizard next
08:44 - thing up is the star and the star has a
08:47 - decent amount of code we're just gonna
08:49 - work on this real quick and
08:53 - when the green flag is clicked i'm not
08:55 - sure if you can see this i'm gonna zoom
08:57 - in for you guys this reflect is clicked
09:00 - it'll hide
09:02 - and then it will
09:05 - when i receive shoot star
09:09 - it will
09:11 - oh you need two shoots arms
09:13 - uh so when i receive shoot star it'll go
09:15 - to the front layer so then it's in front
09:17 - of like the dragon and all that stuff
09:19 - all that good stuff and go to the front
09:21 - layer
09:22 - and then go to the wizard
09:24 - because you want it comes out the wizard
09:26 - right he has magical spells so
09:29 - it gets out of the wizard
09:31 - and it will show
09:35 - and start sound magic spell but
09:40 - magic spell
09:44 - see look it's the star so start sound
09:47 - magic spell and then glide glides 0.5
09:50 - seconds
09:51 - to
09:54 - where the coordinates of the star is and
09:56 - remember that when we put it over here
09:59 - that's where mouse x in mouse y is so
10:03 - basically x
10:06 - equals mouse x
10:07 - and y equals mouse y so it will be like
10:10 - this
10:11 - and then you want to make it hide
10:15 - and next we have what another one i
10:18 - receive shoot star this time delete all
10:20 - this code and then repeat 30 times
10:24 - 30 costumes of itself to make those
10:27 - beautiful trailing stars and it'll
10:29 - create a clone of myself
10:32 - and then when i start as a clone
10:35 - it'll point in direction
10:38 - so it will point direction
10:42 - 0 to 300
10:44 - 360 because it could go all around it
10:47 - can keep on rotating because it's a star
10:50 - and it spins so you can make it like
10:53 - that and then repeat 10
10:58 - change color effect by 25
11:03 - and then it will move five steps every
11:05 - single time so then you'll go closer and
11:08 - closer to where your mouse was
11:10 - and it'll start blinking
11:12 - because the color effect will change it
11:14 - and then the ghost effect makes it way
11:16 - better the ghost effect is just really
11:18 - good
11:21 - the ghost effect makes it more dimmer
11:23 - and dimmer so it will go away and fade
11:25 - away so which makes it uh really
11:29 - effective and cool so you set ghost
11:31 - effect to five
11:34 - and delete this clone
11:38 - i think this game was dedicated to um
11:41 - actually halloween so as you can see we
11:44 - have
11:44 - mr wizard blasting my finger and we have
11:48 - the
11:51 - it's glitching right now sorry guys
11:53 - my computer's lagging really hard so i
11:55 - made this really big mistake and i found
11:57 - out why i was lagging and making all
11:59 - these lag sounds is because you need to
12:02 - wait so i always get mixed up with this
12:04 - so if you're new to our channel uh get
12:07 - used to that so broadcast shoot star and
12:09 - wait so then it won't have the lagged
12:12 - sound see look
12:15 - it won't create too many clones when you
12:17 - click on it and now it doesn't have a
12:18 - loud sound and
12:20 - get
12:21 - distorted and all that stuff
12:23 - and uh now
12:25 - next thing is the skeleton this is the
12:27 - biggest chunk of code
12:29 - in the whole entire game which is just
12:32 - takes a while to do so when the green
12:35 - flag is clicked
12:38 - it will hide
12:42 - go forever
12:47 - create clone of myself
12:49 - and it will wait a pick random seconds
12:51 - to spawn a skeleton in so wait how many
12:55 - seconds pick random you choose but i
12:58 - went 0.5 to 0.75
13:01 - so
13:02 - it's very consistent and makes the game
13:05 - a challenge and
13:07 - now we have this piece of code to make
13:10 - so when i start as a clone
13:12 - it'll set skeleton hp new variable
13:16 - for this sprite only
13:18 - because it's only the skeleton so
13:21 - uh skeleton hp
13:23 - i'm is that high small skeleton yeah it
13:25 - is i think yeah and then when i start as
13:27 - a clone it will
13:29 - set skeleton hp
13:32 - to 300.
13:34 - 300
13:35 - and
13:36 - repeat until
13:38 - so uh the reason of this is because if
13:41 - you set it for all sprites you'll
13:43 - deplete all the skeletons in line and
13:46 - the clones will be useless and so you
13:49 - want to make all the clones have its own
13:51 - set of 300 hp for you to use so and then
13:54 - now we have a repeat until lou
13:59 - uh
14:00 - it will touch the wizard
14:02 - still touching the wizard so it will
14:04 - always target the wizard and the next
14:06 - costume will start walking right
14:09 - i think i deleted a costume at this
14:11 - point no i didn't know that
14:13 - that was something next costume and wait
14:15 - 0.5 seconds
14:20 - and now we have
14:22 - when i start as a clone so this is the
14:24 - biggest chunk of code which is just
14:26 - gigantic so when i start as a clone it
14:30 - will go to
14:33 - x i have coordinates so negative 175 so
14:36 - that's around here right x what negative
14:39 - 175 but the y's pick
14:42 - random from 100 negative 100 which is
14:47 - down around down here
14:49 - to
14:50 - positive
14:52 - 25 so it's all like up here so they will
14:55 - start so then it makes it a challenge
14:57 - for you
14:59 - to
15:00 - um
15:01 - do that and let me hide these variables
15:02 - real quick score
15:05 - uh i think live lives here
15:08 - score because it makes it a challenge
15:10 - for you because if all the skeletons
15:12 - spawned just like that then you just do
15:15 - one projectile and you killed like all
15:16 - of them but then if they spawn like
15:18 - around around here you have to start
15:20 - moving your mouse around so yeah that's
15:23 - how you work that and then now it's show
15:29 - you have a show and it will repeat until
15:36 - it is touching
15:40 - the wizard
15:41 - and it'll point towards the wizard so
15:43 - it'll go towards the wizard and it will
15:46 - always try to target the wizard no
15:47 - matter what so it will point
15:52 - and i know point towards wizard
15:55 - and now we have move two steps so then
15:58 - it'll keep on moving towards the wizard
16:00 - and try to kill the wizard and
16:03 - or knock out the wizard and then if you
16:06 - need it if then
16:07 - this is really big guys sorry
16:09 - you need it if then
16:12 - um
16:15 - if then
16:16 - if you're touching the wizard
16:20 - then it will
16:22 - this is a very tricky part
16:24 - hit wizard you have to start this
16:28 - oh i don't know hi wizard hit wizard
16:34 - uh and then you have a sprite called hit
16:36 - wizard i mean variable it's called hit
16:38 - wizard it'll set hit wizard to why
16:40 - because whenever it touches the wizard
16:43 - it will hit it right so and oh broadcast
16:47 - hit wizard
16:49 - this new broadcast message so
16:52 - broadcast
16:56 - hit
16:58 - wizard
17:00 - and then now
17:02 - you delete the clone because whenever
17:04 - the skeleton attacks the wizard it will
17:07 - get deleted because we just want that
17:10 - because or else
17:12 - because like they had a fight with the
17:13 - wizards and then they decided and they
17:16 - got lost to the wizard because good guys
17:18 - always win and so that's what we did
17:20 - here so then uh now we need a if then
17:22 - statement
17:25 - down below the
17:28 - wizard the hit wizard and if then it's
17:31 - touching the star
17:35 - then it will change skeleton hp
17:39 - by minus 10.
17:45 - so don't worry guys i know the skeleton
17:47 - hp has a 300 and this is -10 so it does
17:51 - not take uh that many hits to kill the
17:54 - skeleton
17:55 - because there's multiple of those little
17:57 - star things so it will
18:00 - take like around three or four hits i
18:03 - would say or two
18:04 - two to three two to four so yeah that's
18:07 - what i'm estimating so don't worry it
18:08 - won't take that much hits and then you
18:11 - need a
18:13 - uh if then statement
18:18 - right inside there
18:20 - if then
18:21 - it's
18:22 - you know or
18:24 - i'll explain this after when i'm done
18:26 - coding and you need an or you need an
18:28 - equal sign
18:31 - and you need uh
18:33 - less than
18:35 - so if then the like we've done this so
18:38 - much time so
18:39 - so if the skeleton hp equals zero
18:43 - or if the skeleton hp is
18:47 - less than zero
18:49 - then it will start sound rattle it comes
18:51 - with the skeleton so
18:53 - it's easy to get and change score by
18:56 - five
18:58 - new variable no no we are
19:00 - change score
19:03 - by
19:05 - five
19:06 - and
19:08 - the bat only gets one so it's just like
19:10 - something different that we tried out
19:11 - today and
19:14 - we need it if then
19:17 - like right in there and then if then
19:21 - feel free to pause guys i might be going
19:22 - too quick for you guys or too slow for
19:25 - you guys so then you guys can speed the
19:26 - video up if i'm going too slow and pause
19:29 - if i'm going too fast
19:31 - and
19:32 - if the score is greater than 250 the
19:35 - dragon comes into play and we'll do the
19:37 - dragon in a minute we just have to do
19:39 - the bat which is really simple
19:41 - so let's make a new broadcast message
19:44 - show the dragon
19:47 - show
19:51 - and yeah and then now delete this clone
19:56 - where is that
19:57 - delete this clone
20:00 - there we go and we're done with this and
20:02 - another delete this clone in the end and
20:05 - now we have a one a few more scripts for
20:08 - the wizard i mean the skeleton so let's
20:11 - get that finished
20:12 - and so it's when i receive
20:17 - when i receive
20:18 - hit wizard all done to hide the variable
20:21 - when i receive hit wizard
20:24 - if
20:26 - you need a gigantic if then statement
20:29 - if the
20:32 - wizard was hit equals y so
20:36 - wizard hit wizard
20:38 - equals y everything's coming from the
20:41 - skeleton then it'll change lives by
20:43 - minus one because that's your lives
20:45 - going down by minus one
20:50 - so the thing is that the reason you need
20:52 - hit wizard is like say if there's a bat
20:55 - coming towards you
20:57 - like we've had this glitch so it's not
20:59 - really a glitch but like we've had this
21:01 - coding a bunch of times and it hits you
21:03 - you lose like what like 50 hp like 5 hp
21:07 - whatever how many times i was touching
21:08 - it so we want to make this hit wizard
21:11 - thing to make it better
21:15 - and it will only delete one life
21:18 - and now you need a if another if then
21:20 - statement and you put up or
21:22 - smack dab in the middle and you need a
21:25 - zero
21:26 - uh you need an equal sign if lives
21:29 - equals zero
21:33 - or if lives are
21:35 - less than zero
21:38 - zero is greater than your lives
21:41 - then it will
21:45 - broadcast game over so you lost
21:47 - if that happens to you
21:51 - game over
21:54 - we'll code the game over after we're
21:55 - done with everything and set
21:59 - hit wizard
22:02 - to a because you didn't hit him multiple
22:04 - times he only hit him once
22:06 - and when i
22:10 - received uh show dragon
22:16 - stop other scripts in this bite spray
22:18 - and delete this clone that's for a
22:20 - little bit later so
22:22 - if you don't mind coding this real scr
22:24 - uh real quick so you don't have to do it
22:26 - later
22:27 - a little bit later and
22:29 - now we're done with the skeleton now the
22:31 - bat is much simpler than the skeleton
22:34 - okay so um
22:37 - i'm gonna be
22:38 - doing the skill of the bat code so the
22:41 - bat code is just the skeleton
22:45 - rebound oh yeah i have to show you guys
22:47 - look as you can see look there's
22:48 - skeletons coming from all over the place
22:52 - and killing them
22:53 - and look they hit me i lose a life so
22:56 - yeah um that's basically the concept of
22:58 - this right now and right now we have to
23:00 - code the fat
23:02 - and we take this whole entire thing we
23:04 - need to make some changing
23:06 - but it's not much so bear with me
23:09 - and we take
23:12 - this whole entire thing
23:16 - and we take
23:19 - this whole entire thing
23:22 - it's not that much but like i'm just
23:24 - trying to and then
23:26 - we take
23:28 - this whole entire
23:32 - thing
23:33 - we have to do some changing when we get
23:35 - there so we should have four scripts
23:37 - here so let's see
23:39 - yeah we have four scripts i'm pretty
23:40 - sure
23:41 - this needs some changing so
23:43 - if you don't mind me
23:45 - uh i'll do some changing and then it's
23:48 - it'll go to this you know bats are
23:50 - flying right they fly so basically you
23:52 - want to pick the random by 50
23:55 - to 150 because it's in the air and
23:58 - touching wizard yeah that should be
24:01 - fine
24:02 - delete this phone oh yes and this part
24:05 - it doesn't have hp right so
24:10 - i'm actually going to take out
24:13 - all like basically all of this
24:16 - in this so
24:18 - we're gonna redo this and then it'll
24:20 - have starts
24:23 - it'll have start sound
24:27 - owl because that's the sound that it has
24:29 - here
24:30 - and then it will change score okay let
24:32 - me just take out all of this
24:34 - i'll just change score
24:38 - by one because you kill that that gives
24:41 - less score and you delete this clone
24:43 - and then you delete this clone so delete
24:45 - this clone and you have this delete this
24:47 - button down here so that's what you have
24:49 - for the album i mean the
24:52 - bat
24:54 - so
24:55 - this
24:56 - you take out
24:57 - okay so
24:59 - i'm gonna so you take out this because
25:02 - it does not have any skeleton hp because
25:04 - it's not a skeleton so you have this and
25:08 - yeah oh and that's fun slower than
25:11 - skeletons and we make that a whole
25:13 - entire one
25:14 - and
25:16 - yeah
25:17 - so this is basically the bat code
25:21 - so now
25:23 - let's see
25:24 - see
25:25 - there's bats and skeletons coming right
25:28 - at us
25:29 - and we have to take care of them
25:34 - and yeah this is basically
25:36 - what i coded so
25:40 - let's move on to the dragon
25:43 - so the dragon
25:45 - has some code as well
25:47 - some
25:49 - actually pretty much
25:51 - the same code as a skeleton
25:53 - that may not seem good but a lot like
25:55 - takes around the same time to code so
25:57 - let's start the dragon
26:00 - and um
26:02 - the dragon so
26:04 - you when the green flag is clicked
26:08 - you have to make a new variable called
26:10 - dragon hp
26:12 - the dragon has hp too
26:14 - and it'll set
26:16 - it'll show
26:18 - i mean it'll hide the variable dragon hp
26:21 - in the beginning because you haven't
26:23 - fought the dragon yet it takes
26:25 - awesome score to fight the dragon and it
26:27 - will go to
26:29 - x
26:30 - negative 170
26:34 - and negative 50.
26:37 - and it will
26:39 - go to
26:40 - no way i just did that and it will hide
26:45 - and set the dragon hp
26:47 - to 6 000 you can if you were looking for
26:50 - a challenge you can set it to like ten
26:52 - thousand or something but if you want it
26:54 - to be more easier decrease it to three
26:56 - thousand
26:56 - so it'll be easier for you to beat and
27:00 - for now i'm just gonna set this down to
27:02 - like maybe a thousand
27:04 - because i'm doing some testing in the
27:06 - end to show you guys that the dragon
27:08 - works and then when i receive
27:13 - uh show dragon
27:15 - then it will repeat until
27:18 - touching wizard
27:25 - touching wizard you know go next costume
27:30 - and wait 0.5 seconds
27:36 - and now we have that
27:38 - all right so i forgot to do something
27:40 - earlier and it keeps on changing
27:42 - costumes delete bat d and bat a so it'll
27:45 - just look like it's flying continuously
27:48 - so yeah and now we work on the dragon
27:51 - and
27:52 - the dragon
27:54 - so now we have the big script of code to
27:57 - work with
27:58 - and
27:59 - let's do this so we have two scripts
28:02 - finished
28:03 - and now we have
28:05 - when i receive
28:09 - show dragon
28:11 - it will show variable
28:14 - it'll show the variable
28:19 - of show variable dragon age speed it
28:21 - will show
28:25 - and it will repeat until touching the
28:27 - wizard and then you
28:29 - so repeat until
28:34 - touching wizard
28:37 - and it will
28:39 - move two steps
28:43 - for 0.5 seconds every 0.5 seconds it'll
28:47 - move two steps
28:50 - and now we have that finished we have
28:52 - another piece of
28:53 - thing to do um coding all the small
28:55 - scripts first so when i receive
29:00 - show dragon
29:03 - go forever
29:07 - and it'll play sound
29:09 - grunt which is a sound here
29:14 - and
29:15 - it'll play sound run
29:17 - until done
29:18 - and wait five seconds before playing the
29:21 - sound grunt again
29:25 - and now uh when i receive
29:29 - all right so and then now we uh do when
29:32 - i receive
29:34 - show dragon
29:36 - it'll go forever
29:39 - and
29:40 - you know if then
29:44 - uh
29:45 - it's touching the star
29:50 - it will change dragon hp by -10
29:58 - and since it attacks multiple times the
30:00 - star they'll do more than 10 damage
30:03 - and
30:04 - you need it if then
30:10 - you need if then
30:12 - under that
30:14 - if then the dragon hp
30:19 - the dragon hp equals zero
30:28 - equals zero
30:30 - or less than zero
30:35 - oh yeah
30:36 - uh
30:37 - then we will
30:40 - um
30:42 - hide
30:44 - because it died right
30:46 - and
30:47 - oh broadcast you win
30:57 - and we have broadcasting with and it'll
31:00 - stop this script
31:03 - because it has a forever loop and we do
31:05 - not like forever loops to be all broken
31:10 - stop the script so we put it right under
31:13 - here
31:14 - this script
31:15 - and then under two of these it will be
31:19 - an if then
31:23 - and
31:25 - if it's touching the wizard
31:29 - then it will broadcast game over
31:33 - so you automatically lose
31:35 - once
31:37 - the wizard
31:38 - i mean the
31:40 - dragon
31:41 - uh gets you
31:43 - so oh it's already game over i was like
31:45 - searching for that and then it'll stop
31:47 - the script
31:49 - right here
31:51 - we have two more scripts to code here
31:54 - and then when
31:56 - when i receive
31:59 - you win
32:01 - then it'll stop other scripts in the
32:03 - sprite
32:08 - and then if you lose it'll also
32:11 - stop all the scripts on the spread
32:14 - and now
32:16 - let's try this game
32:18 - we want to stop the forever loops too so
32:20 - that it will
32:22 - stop and we don't want forever loops
32:24 - going forever
32:25 - and now we just have to make the you win
32:28 - you lose right
32:30 - so oh yes uh please copy down this code
32:33 - oh yeah and please do not set your
32:35 - dragon hp to a thousand i'm just trying
32:36 - to prove my point that you can win this
32:38 - uh
32:39 - uh
32:41 - game by killing the dragon i'll show you
32:43 - guys later so
32:44 - uh you guys change it to whatever six
32:47 - thousand three thousand you can set it
32:48 - to a thousand if you want but like i'm
32:50 - just doing this for testing so
32:52 - if you wanna be original to the game go
32:54 - six 000 instead of 1000
32:57 - so copy down on this code feel free to
32:59 - pause and now let's
33:02 - do the you win and you lose sprite
33:06 - this was something different for me
33:08 - because instead of writing uh you
33:12 - lose
33:14 - i decided to write game over i don't
33:18 - know why but
33:19 - okay
33:24 - so let's write game
33:26 - oh this is
33:28 - i normally like to do handwriting for
33:30 - this so
33:32 - game
33:34 - and we
33:37 - i think that's big right is that good
33:39 - size that's good and then you duplicate
33:42 - this costume
33:44 - and you
33:48 - you
33:49 - shift and then you get the whole thing
33:53 - you
33:54 - delete it and write
33:56 - you
33:58 - win but instead you
34:00 - double click the uh you get all of it
34:04 - and you change it to the color you want
34:06 - but i decided to go a bright yellow
34:08 - because the background is green so we go
34:12 - that
34:13 - and we have you in
34:15 - so let's get the code done here so
34:19 - it's like every other game that we do so
34:21 - you should be able to
34:23 - follow along so when i receive this one
34:26 - of the green flags it's hide you know go
34:29 - to x0
34:31 - y0
34:32 - right in the middle and then when i
34:34 - receive game over
34:37 - it will go to the front layer
34:41 - switch costume to costume one
34:46 - uh show
34:49 - and
34:50 - stubble
34:52 - and you duplicate that we are so close
34:54 - to finishing
34:55 - you win go to the front layer switch
34:58 - costume to costume two
35:00 - and let's get this started
35:02 - okay
35:04 - so you see
35:05 - let's take get rid of these skeletons
35:08 - and
35:08 - [Music]
35:09 - uh bats so let's get rid of them and
35:12 - let's get
35:16 - so all right so i'm going to lose first
35:18 - let's just lose real quick and see if
35:21 - this works
35:23 - one two three four five and game over so
35:26 - i'm just gonna kill a bunch of things
35:28 - and
35:29 - i'll be right back i'm just gonna get to
35:31 - the dragon to show you guys you can win
35:33 - so i'm gonna change the score down to 50
35:35 - to prove my point that
35:37 - this works so let's do this and let's go
35:41 - and i just have to kill some mobs and i
35:43 - think it's pretty much finished
35:51 - and you see my life live went down just
35:54 - then and you see the dragon was 1000 hp
35:58 - and you know we're about to kill him and
36:01 - it says you win so the concept of this
36:03 - game works right now and let me just
36:05 - change all this thing and remember guys
36:07 - change this to 250 so it's back to
36:09 - normal or if you're looking for a
36:11 - challenge should you like 500 or if
36:13 - you're not looking for challenges like
36:14 - 100 or something and here uh i mean the
36:17 - dragon
36:18 - you have to change this
36:21 - to
36:23 - 6 000 if you're going original with the
36:24 - game and we have everything done here
36:27 - and please like share subscribe and
36:29 - comment in the comment section below
36:31 - what else games you want next and
36:33 - remember guys see you guys next time one
36:36 - more thing uh if you have any uh
36:39 - questions about the project or anything
36:41 - and if you want to compare the code to
36:42 - see if you're right uh go to my project
36:46 - uh go to my account scratch account
36:48 - gumball 098 and then go to my project i
36:50 - should have shared this one and you guys
36:53 - can copy the code down
36:55 - if you didn't get everything that we
36:57 - said in the video so any of you guys
36:58 - anyways guys see ya
37:07 - [Music]
37:10 - you
