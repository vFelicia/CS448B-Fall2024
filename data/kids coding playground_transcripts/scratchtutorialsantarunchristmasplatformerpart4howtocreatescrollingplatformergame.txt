00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to kids
00:10 - calling playground
00:11 - so today we'll be continuing with the
00:13 - santa platformer game
00:15 - uh this is part four of the series
00:18 - uh we'll be working on the anime
00:20 - character and then the ground and the
00:22 - virtual ground
00:23 - uh maybe some scrolling way up time if
00:25 - not we'll
00:26 - do that next episode but uh we're gonna
00:28 - do the uh custom changing color and all
00:31 - so here's a code for the uh main
00:33 - character so far
00:35 - so we're gonna move down a little bit so
00:37 - you guys can take a look
00:39 - if you have anything missed uh just kind
00:41 - of pause it and uh and uh
00:44 - jot it down okay so this is for the uh
00:47 - movement
00:50 - then we have the other side the uh the
00:52 - calling check
00:53 - platform and then we'll start the
00:55 - control and then this is moving the head
00:57 - box
00:58 - and this is checking the the ground okay
01:02 - so that's about it for this part and
01:04 - then you have the jump control on this
01:06 - side
01:07 - okay okay so this is so far what we have
01:10 - for this
01:11 - and then with the animated character not
01:14 - much going on here and then the ground
01:16 - and then this is the ground okay so now
01:19 - let's go to the anime character for now
01:23 - okay i'm gonna move this over here on
01:25 - this side so
01:26 - easier okay so what we're going to do is
01:30 - we're going to check
01:31 - the enemy uh enemy character got hit by
01:34 - the uh
01:35 - the uh uh the enemy or what not
01:38 - you know when they get hit it will
01:39 - forecast or change it to hit
01:43 - so the we haven't actually worked on the
01:46 - enemy but the enemy will later will
01:48 - broadcast if it hits the
01:49 - main character or broadcast hit so uh
01:52 - anyway when we're calling the anime
01:54 - character to make it a little bit easier
01:56 - i'll just code it uh for that code as
01:58 - well so later when
02:00 - we work on the enemy we'll just set the
02:02 - hit so
02:03 - for now let's uh just continue with this
02:05 - one
02:06 - okay uh just get the even else here
02:11 - and then get the operator
02:15 - and then we're gonna get the uh animated
02:17 - type so basically if the enemy got
02:19 - hit i mean if the center got hit by an
02:21 - enemy later i would set
02:23 - like in hit in the uh my enemy sprite
02:26 - and set the enemy hit
02:27 - and that means it got hit so we're gonna
02:30 - put it like this for now
02:31 - okay and then we have to
02:34 - reset the animated counter so what we're
02:36 - going to do is we're going to use the uh
02:39 - okay we don't actually have this
02:41 - variable we are going to have to create
02:43 - it
02:44 - okay so we're going to have to create a
02:45 - new variable
02:48 - for this sprite only so
02:52 - animation counter
02:57 - so what we're going to use this variable
02:58 - is using the animation and then we're
03:00 - going to
03:01 - use that to change the costume for the
03:04 - uh
03:05 - the uh in the center
03:08 - uh going uh movement or it's getting
03:11 - killed or whatever
03:12 - so we're gonna use this counter
03:15 - and then we are going to set this
03:20 - animation calendar
03:24 - okay to zero this one will be that so we
03:27 - get hit
03:27 - then we can set it to death
03:31 - okay okay we are going to get another
03:34 - uh if and else loop here put that in
03:37 - here
03:39 - now this time we'll check for if the
03:42 - animator
03:43 - character type is dead and basically got
03:46 - hit
03:46 - and dime and we are going to check
03:49 - another
03:52 - okay so we're gonna grab another one if
03:56 - and we're gonna use the uh equal sign
03:59 - here
04:00 - and then we are going back to look and
04:03 - look at the custom number
04:06 - and we're going to put 45. so 45 meaning
04:09 - the costume of a 45 minute
04:12 - lot it may be different for you if you
04:15 - did not use my costume
04:17 - but uh basically 45 is when it died this
04:20 - one
04:21 - this guy the last one is 45 when it died
04:25 - then we are going to change the life
04:30 - so change
04:33 - the life by minus one
04:36 - [Music]
04:38 - okay and then we gonna reset the counter
04:42 - [Music]
04:46 - reset the counter uh to zero the
04:48 - animation type also to zero meaning it's
04:50 - not dead
04:51 - okay
04:55 - okay this is good so far and then um
04:58 - after it died what we have to do is
05:00 - we're gonna broadcast
05:02 - to start a new level again
05:07 - okay broadcast
05:12 - start new level and then
05:17 - okay so we are going to add a if
05:20 - condition here
05:26 - we'll put it before this actually
05:30 - put this under here okay we're gonna
05:33 - check
05:36 - the live variable
05:42 - okay so we are going to uh pull this
05:45 - life out if life is zero
05:50 - we will broadcast game over
05:56 - okay game over and then we'll put this
05:59 - inside here
06:00 - okay so if this game if it's zero then
06:03 - broadcast game over else will
06:05 - start the new level okay
06:11 - i think maybe we'll use it if an else is
06:12 - probably better so let's
06:14 - just do it like this
06:18 - and then we'll do this like that okay
06:22 - okay all right so if it's live zero game
06:25 - over i also go to the new level
06:27 - okay broadcast new level and then
06:31 - under here we are going to add a code
06:34 - called change so
06:37 - put that in here
06:42 - okay we're going to use the division
06:45 - sign
06:46 - here so basically
06:49 - we're gonna increase by 0.5 or you can
06:52 - just
06:53 - i have division by two but you can
06:56 - really use like
06:57 - increase by 0.5 it's the same thing okay
07:00 - let's do that 0.5
07:04 - okay and then what we're going to do is
07:07 - we're going to do a switch costume
07:10 - [Music]
07:12 - okay switch costume put that here
07:17 - and then we're going to use some math
07:18 - function here
07:20 - okay okay so what we're going to do is
07:24 - we're going to get a
07:25 - plus symbol here put this here
07:28 - okay and we are going to choose this one
07:31 - floor meaningly yeah if uh
07:34 - some small number right because it
07:35 - increases by 1.5 right so they take the
07:38 - lower num part
07:39 - of the value okay uh and then it will
07:44 - add we'll do a mod here mark 17
07:48 - and then i say plus 29 and i'll tell you
07:51 - what it means okay
07:56 - okay sorry
08:00 - i missed that part sorry i forgot the
08:03 - mod so
08:06 - so i forgot the mod actually let's take
08:08 - that
08:10 - so we'll say mod 17 nope 17 here on the
08:14 - back sorry
08:15 - and this one we will put the counter the
08:18 - enemy counter
08:21 - here and then we gonna put this just
08:24 - delete that
08:25 - we'll put this back in so this is a
08:27 - little bit complicated so
08:28 - make sure we get it correctly so it's
08:30 - like this mod 17 is here
08:33 - um then you have the plus 29
08:36 - so like this okay and this is like that
08:40 - okay so mod 17
08:44 - okay so mod 17 plus 29
08:48 - and then the flow of that okay we'll put
08:50 - that here
08:51 - so what it means is uh 17 because
08:54 - actually we have a the dead costume
08:57 - we have 17 of those death costumes so we
08:59 - see here that one
09:01 - right to that 17
09:05 - right so we have 17 custom that's why
09:07 - we're gonna mod
09:08 - 17 basically mod mean the dividing the
09:11 - remainder
09:12 - of 17 whatever the remainder of 17 we
09:14 - take that value
09:15 - plus 29 so 29
09:19 - is the where it starts so if you see
09:22 - number 29 the dead costume number 29
09:26 - that's where it starts so that's why you
09:27 - do amount of 17-17 costume
09:30 - and plus 29 i mean that that costume
09:32 - started joining us or plus 29
09:34 - okay i hope that will help you guys
09:37 - understand that
09:39 - okay so we'll go to the else part
09:42 - okay we'll take a if and else here put
09:45 - this in here
09:46 - okay then we are going to check
09:52 - if the player is on the ground so you're
09:54 - gonna say
09:55 - uh g ground
09:58 - on the ground equal to one
10:04 - and then okay so we are going to coat
10:08 - this block
10:08 - what i'm going to do is going to coat it
10:10 - on the outside
10:12 - and i'll put it in so easy for you guys
10:14 - to see
10:15 - okay what we're going to do is we're
10:16 - going to grab this
10:18 - and we're going to grab one more okay so
10:21 - two even else here
10:23 - okay duplicate this
10:26 - part right click this one run
10:30 - so if it's running then
10:35 - what we're going to do is we're going to
10:37 - change
10:40 - this time we are not going to use 0.5 so
10:42 - we're going to
10:43 - use the divide sign this time so we can
10:46 - say
10:47 - 1 divided by 3 okay so go and go a
10:50 - little slower
10:52 - and then we are going to take the
10:55 - costume here
10:56 - and we're going to put it here so this
11:00 - time we'll floor and then we'll say 11
11:03 - plus 2 so 11 plus 2 because i have 11
11:07 - customer running costume
11:09 - plus 2 meaning starting number 2 where
11:11 - the running is happening which is
11:13 - this one number two custom music is
11:15 - number two so that's why it's a plus two
11:17 - and that's eleven running costume you
11:19 - see number eleven
11:21 - run eleven right so that's why
11:24 - so eleven do the mark of that plus two
11:27 - okay
11:29 - and then here you're gonna check the
11:32 - slide
11:33 - so duplicate that right click
11:37 - uh delta slide okay slice one
11:41 - then what we're going to do is we're
11:43 - going to use something similar
11:45 - we'll put this here we'll do one third
11:47 - also
11:48 - and this time we will use mod 11 also
11:52 - because that's 11 slide costume and i
11:54 - put
11:55 - 46 i believe let me see if it's 46
11:58 - so basically let's see if it's 46 is
12:00 - when the slide costume starts happening
12:02 - so
12:02 - you see number 46 is the where the slide
12:05 - costume happening
12:06 - so we put 46 and that's 11 of the slide
12:09 - costume
12:10 - okay okay else what we're going to do
12:14 - is we're going to change it back to idle
12:18 - so switch costume to idle
12:21 - okay all right so we're done with this
12:24 - part
12:26 - what we're going to do is move all this
12:28 - into here
12:30 - okay so pay attention this is a little
12:33 - bit complicated so
12:34 - that's why you know make sure you guys
12:37 - got everything down
12:39 - okay all right so next
12:42 - we're gonna work on the jump okay
12:48 - uh what i'm going to do is i'm gonna do
12:51 - a
12:52 - if and else uh control
12:57 - okay so this is gonna go here
13:00 - okay this part
13:04 - if we are going to say
13:09 - the um
13:12 - the g velocity
13:17 - okay is greater than zero meaning it's
13:20 - jumping
13:21 - up it's going to go up what we're going
13:23 - to do is we're going to switch to the
13:25 - costume
13:28 - let's see just pick one i mean i pick
13:30 - number three jump number three basically
13:33 - the center is about to jump number three
13:36 - which is this costume it's about a jump
13:39 - and then i'm gonna use another one when
13:41 - he's up in the air
13:43 - number ten okay so we're gonna use three
13:45 - and ten for now
13:47 - so here we're going to grab another if
13:50 - condition here
13:52 - put this inside here and then we have
13:56 - to do the reverse check here less than
14:01 - duplicate that less than zero
14:04 - meaning he's gonna go up then start
14:07 - going down right
14:08 - so what we're going to do is we're gonna
14:11 - select
14:11 - jump number ten okay
14:14 - and then at the end over here with the
14:17 - set the animation counter back to
14:19 - zero and then what we're going to do
14:23 - is we are going to put all this back
14:26 - into the else block
14:28 - okay so this is what we have so far the
14:32 - else block
14:34 - okay and then after that we're gonna add
14:37 - two more
14:38 - uh if condition
14:41 - okay two more if condition here one
14:44 - and two and this time we're going to
14:48 - check the left and right position
14:52 - so you remember we're using the g
14:54 - direction
14:55 - earlier so i will want to use that i'll
14:57 - show you later
14:58 - so for now just code it like this first
15:00 - so g direction
15:02 - right and then
15:05 - next one duplicate here g direction left
15:11 - and then we are going to say point
15:14 - in direction 90
15:18 - and duplicate that point direction
15:20 - negative 9
15:21 - okay so all this so all this you have to
15:25 - put it under this
15:26 - okay under here like this okay
15:30 - under this counter you see that's the
15:32 - animated counter outside this
15:34 - if condition put these two in there okay
15:37 - so now we have all of our coal
15:41 - so far so let's just take a look make
15:43 - sure you guys got it all down
15:45 - it's a little bit complicated this coat
15:47 - here so this is checking the depth
15:49 - if it's not the depth then you're gonna
15:51 - check if it's underground
15:53 - if it's running if it's running gonna do
15:54 - the animation to the running costume
15:56 - it is sliding through the sliding
15:58 - costume right
16:00 - if it's not doing any of those it will
16:01 - say the uh
16:03 - idle costume and then if the velocity is
16:05 - greater than zero will do the jumping
16:07 - costume
16:08 - and then i also put it back and then
16:10 - we're gonna put the direction left and
16:11 - right
16:12 - okay so let's
16:28 - [Music]
16:38 - okay we're gonna give it a try here
16:39 - right now so uh
16:41 - let me save it okay let's run it
16:44 - so as you can see the center is can move
16:48 - using the animated characters counter
16:51 - you see that the counter is moving
16:53 - so uh if i push the down and slide it's
16:55 - sliding
16:56 - sliding jumping you see he's jumping
17:00 - and then has that costume you see that
17:02 - it's like uh
17:03 - jumping off and then it has that moving
17:05 - hand costume so the three and ten
17:07 - and uh walking working kind of fine
17:10 - sliding
17:11 - and sliding is fine okay good
17:15 - i hope you guys got that correctly if
17:17 - you did then it should be working fine
17:19 - if not just kind of go through the
17:21 - tutorial of this part again
17:22 - and make sure you get it correctly okay
17:26 - all right so we have podcast game over
17:27 - right so we will do that
17:29 - over here uh when i receive
17:33 - game over for now we are just gonna say
17:35 - stop all
17:36 - okay so if you want to be more fancy you
17:39 - can have a
17:40 - in screen or whatever you like but uh
17:42 - for now we're gonna
17:44 - just say broadcast stop all okay so
17:46 - we're pretty much done with this except
17:49 - you know later when they get to the
17:50 - igloo
17:51 - you have a victory dance it jumped up so
17:53 - we can kill that for later
17:58 - so what we had we have coated up the uh
18:01 - the the
18:01 - running which is working fine the
18:03 - jumping also walking behind the slide
18:05 - also working mine
18:06 - so we want to test the depth see if it's
18:08 - working fine or not
18:10 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
18:11 - going to grab one of this animal uh this
18:14 - is a monster here we'll put them
18:15 - somewhere here
18:16 - so for now we this is a temporary code
18:19 - so not a real code
18:20 - okay so um what we're going to do is
18:23 - we're going to put the
18:24 - monster somewhere here and then see if
18:26 - our character jumps on it does it die or
18:28 - not
18:29 - right so this is just temporary we'll
18:31 - remove it later on but uh for now we're
18:33 - just for testing
18:34 - purposes okay so let's do uh when green
18:37 - flag is clicked
18:39 - uh and then we have this uh go to this
18:41 - position
18:43 - uh what we're going to do is we're going
18:45 - to say
18:46 - a forever loop okay and then we're going
18:50 - to
18:50 - get an if condition here
18:52 - [Music]
18:54 - and then we'll go to sensing
18:57 - let's say touching main character
19:00 - and then we are going to say g animation
19:03 - type
19:04 - i'm gonna say hit okay
19:07 - uh for now we're gonna put a wait for
19:09 - two seconds um
19:10 - we don't really need to do that in the
19:12 - actual game itself but for now we're
19:14 - testing so i don't want it to broadcast
19:16 - hit multiple times once it hit the
19:18 - uh the the player so let's just
19:22 - do a three second two or three seconds
19:23 - that's fine so for testing purposes
19:25 - so now let's take a look so you see the
19:28 - center is moving right so if i touch the
19:30 - tiger
19:31 - you see it died right the center fall
19:34 - off
19:34 - and the the live get to uh four right so
19:38 - i tried again
19:39 - died three two
19:45 - one and then game over right
19:49 - so see game over see there you go so it
19:52 - is working working fine okay so this
19:55 - part is just a testing code we don't
19:57 - really need it
19:58 - i'm just showing to you guys that it is
20:00 - working when they get
20:02 - hit it's gonna play the death animation
20:04 - and it can subtract the life
20:06 - and then of the life is uh equal to zero
20:09 - broadcast game over it also start the
20:11 - new level which put the center back to
20:12 - the left
20:14 - so that's how it works okay
20:17 - and this a little water will fix that
20:19 - little water this is the background
20:20 - scrolling we're gonna use that later
20:23 - okay so don't need to worry about that
20:27 - okay all right so this is where we're
20:29 - gonna stop here for now
20:31 - and uh be sure to uh give us a like and
20:34 - thumbs up on our video if you enjoyed it
20:37 - okay if you don't enjoy it please also
20:39 - give us a like okay
20:40 - all right just kidding all right anyway
20:44 - okay have a good day and i'll see you
20:46 - guys next time
