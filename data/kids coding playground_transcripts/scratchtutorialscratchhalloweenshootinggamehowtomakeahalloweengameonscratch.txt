00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here and today we'll be
00:10 - making a halloween game uh for halloween
00:13 - so we're making a halloween shooting
00:15 - game um
00:16 - basically the point of the game is just
00:18 - to get as much score as you can so i'll
00:20 - just show a demonstration
00:23 - okay so use target you just basically
00:26 - shoot these
00:27 - things on a shelf
00:32 - like that and there's a timer in the top
00:34 - left
00:36 - that is the like how much longer you
00:38 - have and in the top right is the score
00:41 - you can
00:42 - see so
00:45 - as you can see when i when you're
00:46 - finished it'll say thanks for playing
00:48 - your score is 770. so our final score
00:51 - was 7.70
00:53 - also one more thing um
00:55 - the pumpkins you get the least points
00:57 - these you get a little bit more than a
00:58 - pumpkin and this you get the most points
01:01 - and as you can see um the pumpkins won't
01:04 - uh regenerate until you take them all
01:07 - out so you see this one that i just shot
01:09 - it won't come out until you take them
01:11 - all out and then once you take them all
01:13 - out they'll all come back
01:15 - so
01:16 - you have to um
01:18 - so basically you have to shoot the whole
01:20 - line before you can have them all
01:22 - regenerate at once
01:24 - um
01:25 - and when you shoot one it'll just be
01:27 - gone until you shoot them all yeah
01:30 - okay
01:32 - so let's get coding onto the game so
01:34 - let's start a new project
01:36 - all right so inside our new project we
01:37 - just don't need the scratch
01:39 - rename our project we're going to name
01:41 - it
01:42 - hollow bean shooting
01:45 - game
01:47 - halloween shooting game so we're gonna
01:50 - get some sprites in my backpack with the
01:52 - targets
01:53 - and the pumpkin
01:55 - and we have the backdrop so let me show
01:57 - this
02:00 - and then the backdrop we have just like
02:02 - this
02:03 - so what i did was let me just duplicate
02:06 - this to show what i did so right here is
02:09 - the shelf we drew it
02:10 - so we have
02:12 - uh let me ungroup it so we have the
02:17 - we have the brown this is just like a
02:19 - ground square or rectangle and then we
02:21 - have a darker line and then a lighter
02:23 - colored line right here
02:25 - as as like the shelf
02:28 - and then right here we have the frame of
02:30 - the shelf
02:31 - and then for the background we just pick
02:32 - some
02:33 - green and brown color like that
02:36 - so yeah that's pretty much how you drill
02:38 - the backdrop or you can just export it
02:39 - from our project in the link in the
02:41 - description so
02:43 - that's our backdrop and our pumpkin
02:46 - we actually made this remember last
02:47 - year's halloween game the smash the
02:49 - pumpkins game so if you have not watched
02:51 - that um be sure to watch it we show how
02:53 - to draw it
02:54 - in that video and we also have like the
02:56 - other sprite so when you destroy it
02:58 - you'll break
02:59 - this is a broken pumpkin and the normal
03:02 - pumpkin okay so we're getting we'll be
03:04 - getting the other sprites for this
03:05 - project
03:06 - so we also have the skeleton and the
03:08 - ghost they're both inside the sprite
03:10 - library
03:11 - so the ghost
03:14 - and then we have the skeleton
03:19 - okay
03:21 - and then so
03:22 - you saw when i shot the skeleton it
03:24 - would like break into pieces so
03:26 - basically what you do is you duplicate
03:28 - the costume and you just like drag all
03:30 - the pieces apart
03:31 - so i'm going to go to the costumes for
03:33 - the skeleton we're going to delete these
03:35 - and you can duplicate the first one
03:37 - and with the first one basically you can
03:39 - just like i guess
03:42 - break it its body
03:44 - [Music]
04:07 - okay
04:08 - so move it however you want so i'm just
04:10 - gonna do it like that
04:11 - okay so now let's start get start on the
04:14 - code so we're going to go to the target
04:16 - inside the target we're going to get a
04:18 - one green flag clicks let's zoom in
04:22 - we're going to get a set
04:24 - game timer so we're going with a new
04:26 - variable called game timer so we're
04:28 - going to set the game timer to 20 in the
04:29 - beginning
04:30 - um so this is the not to get confused
04:32 - with the other timer we'll have later in
04:34 - the video
04:35 - game timer is like the timer for the
04:37 - game
04:38 - so we're going to set it as a 20.
04:41 - make another variable to score so this
04:43 - is just the score
04:44 - uh for the game so we're going to set
04:46 - the score to zero
04:49 - and we're going to make another variable
04:50 - called show score so show score is
04:52 - basically you know how at the end it
04:54 - says um thanks for playing your final
04:57 - score was and we're basically just kind
04:59 - of set the show score to the score
05:02 - so we're gonna just set the show score
05:04 - to zero in the beginning
05:06 - for now and then we're gonna broadcast a
05:08 - message called start game again
05:12 - start game and then we're going to make
05:15 - the target go to the middle in the
05:16 - beginning
05:20 - and we're going to set another variable
05:22 - so we're going to make another room
05:23 - called fire shot
05:25 - so basically it's to detect if the shot
05:27 - is being fired or not so we're going to
05:29 - set hard shot to be in zero in the
05:31 - beginning
05:33 - we're going to wait 0.2 seconds before
05:34 - actually starting the game
05:36 - so i'm gonna wait for that a little bit
05:40 - and then we're gonna get a forever loop
05:43 - forever we're gonna
05:44 - get the go to go to x
05:47 - we're gonna go to x
05:50 - i'll set x sorry
05:52 - set x to the mouse x
05:56 - and then we're also going to set the y
05:58 - and that's why
06:00 - so it will follow your mouse
06:03 - as you can see
06:04 - the target's following our mouse
06:08 - and then we're going to make it go to
06:09 - the front layer so it's in front of the
06:11 - sprites those uh monsters
06:14 - it's going to go to the front layer
06:18 - and then
06:19 - we're going to do an if mouse down so if
06:23 - if you're like pressing down so if mouse
06:26 - down
06:28 - then we are going to
06:30 - get a sound this toy zing sound whatever
06:33 - this is sounds like that that's the one
06:35 - we had
06:36 - and then we're gonna broadcast a message
06:38 - after this
06:39 - and name it shot fire
06:44 - shot fired and then we're gonna set the
06:45 - fired
06:46 - fire shot to one meaning that a shot is
06:49 - being fired
06:50 - and then we're going to wait 0.1 seconds
06:52 - and then we're going to set it back
06:55 - to
06:56 - zero so one means a fire
06:58 - a shot is being fired
07:01 - and zero means it's not being fired okay
07:05 - so here's the first part of the code
07:08 - and
07:10 - when you click you just played that
07:11 - sound that's all we have
07:13 - you can see the fire shot is changing
07:15 - when you click
07:16 - okay
07:17 - so
07:18 - next we are going to go to the pumpkin
07:20 - so let's go to our pumpkin
07:23 - um so inside the pumpkin we are going to
07:25 - make a new block so this is just a setup
07:27 - block to set up everything inside the
07:30 - setup so we're going to name it setup
07:33 - game
07:35 - and click ok and we're going to define
07:37 - this block
07:39 - and we're going to set
07:42 - pumpkin counter
07:44 - which is a new variable
07:46 - sorry a new variable called pumpkin
07:48 - counter
07:50 - so this is basically how many pumpkins
07:52 - are in each row
07:54 - let me hide all these variables around
07:56 - set a pumpkin counter to zero
07:58 - i mean four sorry there's four pumpkins
08:00 - in each in the middle row
08:02 - there's gonna be four we're gonna evenly
08:03 - space them out by 100 steps
08:06 - and then we're going to make the first
08:08 - pumpkin
08:09 - go to the exposition of negative 155
08:13 - and the y position of zero
08:15 - and we're gonna hide it and we're gonna
08:17 - make clones of it so we're gonna do hide
08:19 - clear graphic effects
08:21 - uh set the size of the pumpkin to about
08:24 - half the size of 50 percent
08:26 - and then after that we are going to
08:28 - repeat four times because we're making
08:30 - four uh four pumpkins so we're gonna
08:32 - repeat four times
08:34 - uh we're going to
08:37 - set the
08:38 - create the clone of myself
08:40 - and then we're gonna
08:41 - move 100 steps so the pumpkins are
08:44 - evenly spaced between each other so move
08:46 - 100 steps
08:49 - okay
08:51 - um if your pumpkin is like smaller or
08:54 - bigger you might have to adjust the
08:55 - number of steps
08:56 - and the number of clones you create
08:59 - because it's not going to be the same as
09:00 - hours ours pumpkin is
09:03 - um
09:04 - about 100 steps apart
09:06 - so you can actually just like export
09:08 - their pumpkin if you want but you can
09:09 - draw your own if you'd like as well
09:12 - so now we're going to get a
09:14 - when i start as a clone which is what
09:16 - the clones is like the code for the
09:19 - clones
09:21 - in the beginning switch the costume to
09:22 - costume one which is the non-broken
09:24 - pumpkin
09:26 - as you can see
09:28 - and then we're gonna set the color
09:29 - so we're just gonna make it like the
09:31 - pumpkins pick random color
09:32 - so we're gonna change i'm set
09:36 - i'm going to set the color effect
09:38 - pick right here one
09:39 - to 300
09:41 - so it's like a random color let's make
09:43 - the pumpkins
09:44 - random color and we're going to make a
09:46 - show
09:48 - and after that we're going to get a
09:50 - forever loop forever
09:52 - um if it's touching the targets
09:55 - and the fire shot is equal to one that
09:57 - means the shot is being fired
10:00 - so we're gonna get an and so we're gonna
10:02 - do
10:03 - if touching target
10:08 - and fire shot is equal to one
10:15 - fire shot is equal to one
10:18 - fire shot's equal to one then we're
10:19 - gonna change the pumpkin counter by
10:21 - negative one
10:24 - because one you just shot a pumpkin so
10:26 - we're gonna decrease the amount of
10:28 - pumpkins
10:29 - so since pumpkins are the easiest to hit
10:32 - we're going to change the score by 10
10:34 - which is the lowest score i guess we can
10:36 - make the other ones with more
10:38 - and then we're gonna switch the costume
10:40 - to costume two which is the broken
10:41 - pumpkin
10:43 - and
10:44 - we're gonna wait one second
10:48 - and then we're gonna wait one seconds
10:49 - and then delete this clue so when you
10:51 - shoot it it's gonna be broken wait one
10:53 - second and then we'll delete it so you
10:54 - can see that the pumpkin is broken
10:57 - so you can see the pumpkin got shot okay
11:00 - and then we're going to get a one green
11:01 - fly clicked
11:03 - uh we are going to use call the block
11:06 - setup game
11:07 - and then we are going to
11:12 - forever if the pumpkin pounder is less
11:15 - than one so that means you have like no
11:17 - more pumpkins
11:18 - if pumpkin counter is less than one so
11:20 - like i said earlier
11:22 - um the pumpkins don't respawn until you
11:24 - take them all out so we're gonna do if
11:27 - pumpkin counter is less than one
11:30 - now we are going to
11:32 - broadcast and wait we're gonna wait
11:34 - because we don't want let's say you take
11:36 - them all out we don't want them all to
11:38 - respawn at the same time
11:40 - so we're gonna wait and
11:42 - make broadcast another message called
11:44 - start
11:45 - pumpkin again
11:48 - again
11:50 - and then
11:51 - in start pump spun start pumpkin again
11:53 - we are going to
11:55 - when i receive
11:56 - start pumpkin again we're going to wait
11:59 - two seconds
12:01 - before
12:02 - we set up the game again so after two
12:04 - seconds it will restart
12:08 - and when i receive start pumpkin again
12:10 - we're going to delete all the clothes so
12:13 - make sure everything is deleted
12:16 - start bumping again
12:18 - delete
12:19 - this clone
12:22 - okay
12:25 - and now we're gonna have to do um
12:27 - another when i start as a clone so
12:30 - um
12:31 - so if the pumpkin is not hit within a
12:34 - certain time the pumpkin will be hidden
12:36 - and then reappeared later so
12:39 - this is the script we'll be working on
12:40 - next so
12:42 - when i start as a clone
12:43 - we're going to set the new variable so
12:46 - we're going to name it timer fill this
12:48 - spread only so select this
12:50 - for the sprite only
12:52 - and then so we're doing it for the
12:54 - sprite only because each one will have
12:56 - their own timer
12:57 - so
12:58 - like i said earlier don't get confused
13:00 - with this with the game timer so this is
13:02 - not the same thing at all so this is
13:04 - just to check
13:06 - um if the pumpkins not hit within a
13:08 - certain time it will
13:10 - reappear later so
13:12 - we're going to
13:13 - get select the timer and then we're
13:15 - going to set it to zero in the beginning
13:16 - and then
13:18 - forever if
13:21 - not
13:22 - so if it's not touching the target
13:26 - not touching target
13:28 - then
13:29 - we'll change the timer by 0.1 to 0.5 so
13:34 - it'll go up by a little bit every time
13:36 - it is not touching the target so
13:38 - i'm going to change the
13:41 - timer
13:44 - pick random 0.1 to 0.5
13:51 - and
13:52 - if the timer is greater than 3 so
13:55 - if it's
13:58 - so if
13:59 - the
14:00 - timer is greater than three so this is
14:02 - just a number we're using
14:04 - so it's not technically three seconds
14:06 - because
14:07 - um
14:08 - some it doesn't like let's say you like
14:11 - touch the target
14:13 - so you have to like not touch the like
14:15 - the pumpkin
14:16 - before it's like go up
14:19 - so that's pretty much it so we're just
14:20 - gonna use three
14:22 - and we're gonna wait a point one second
14:24 - right here
14:25 - let's just add that real quick
14:27 - so you just have to not be touching it
14:30 - for it to constantly go up
14:31 - that's what it is
14:33 - and then we're going to get timer
14:34 - greater than three we're going to high
14:37 - hide uh wait two seconds and then we're
14:40 - gonna like set it back to zero set the
14:41 - timer back to zero and i'll make the
14:43 - pumpkins reappear again so
14:46 - set the timer to zero and then
14:48 - show it
14:51 - make them reappear again
14:53 - okay i think that is it for this part
14:57 - let's
14:58 - maybe try it out okay let me hide these
15:00 - sprites
15:02 - okay so now let's play it as you can see
15:04 - the pumpkins are spawning they disappear
15:06 - randomly
15:07 - you shoot one of them
15:09 - they get
15:10 - destroyed yeah our game is working so
15:13 - once all the pumpkins are gone they all
15:15 - respawn again as you can see
15:17 - you shoot them all
15:19 - they all
15:20 - gone they all respawn again
15:22 - so this is exactly how you want it it's
15:24 - working perfectly fine now this is
15:27 - so this is working so now i'm going to
15:28 - zoom out so you guys can see if you
15:31 - missed anything so
15:32 - might be a little bit smaller
15:35 - but i think you can see
15:38 - and right here okay
15:40 - so you can pause the video if you want
15:42 - to uh check your code
15:44 - and then basically the ghost and
15:46 - skeletons are basically almost the same
15:48 - concept
15:49 - so
15:50 - we can basically just so inside the
15:52 - ghost
15:53 - let's go to the ghost first
15:55 - so
15:56 - inside the ghost we are going to
15:59 - basically we can just drag in everything
16:01 - from the pumpkin just change some small
16:03 - things so we can drag the setup game
16:07 - it's the ghost
16:08 - but obviously instead of pumpkin
16:10 - counters we're using ghost time
16:13 - so we're going to make a new variable
16:16 - called ghost
16:18 - counter
16:20 - and instead of setting the pumpkin
16:22 - counter we're going to set the ghost
16:23 - counter
16:24 - so since coasts are a bit smaller than
16:26 - the pumpkin we're going to
16:28 - six ghosts
16:30 - and then we're going to make the
16:31 - position negative 165
16:34 - and then we're going to make the black
16:35 - position 100.
16:37 - okay
16:38 - and that should be repeating six times
16:41 - because there's six clones and it should
16:43 - be 65 steps instead
16:45 - okay
16:47 - next we are going to get a one green
16:48 - flag clicks
16:51 - uh this is like setting up the game
16:53 - setup game
16:54 - forever oh yeah we can just drag this in
16:59 - so
16:59 - just like drag this in
17:02 - and we have this right instead of
17:05 - pumpkin counter we're gonna use the
17:06 - ghost counter
17:07 - and we're gonna have to broadcast
17:09 - another message instead of star pumpkin
17:10 - again we're gonna call it you guessed it
17:12 - start
17:13 - ghost again
17:16 - again start ghost again
17:20 - and then when i re uh when i start as a
17:22 - clone
17:24 - drag and drop this
17:26 - um into the it goes
17:30 - okay
17:33 - so we have
17:34 - instead costume one we're gonna switch
17:35 - to ghost a
17:37 - and then we're gonna set the color
17:39 - that's the same
17:40 - if it's touching the target and fired
17:42 - shot is equal to one meaning this is
17:43 - getting shot at then we're to change the
17:45 - ghost counter by negative one
17:47 - and since ghosts are a little bit harder
17:48 - to hit i guess not really but okay we're
17:50 - going to change the score by 30 and
17:52 - we're going to switch the costume to go
17:53 - c which is the one where the ghost is
17:55 - raising his hand
17:57 - so
17:58 - and then wait one second delete this
18:00 - clip that is all the same
18:02 - and then we are going to get a pumpkin
18:06 - go back to the pumpkin we're going to
18:07 - get
18:09 - this
18:12 - so
18:13 - right here
18:14 - remember the timer is for the sprite
18:16 - only
18:17 - so you click it it's only for the ghost
18:19 - as you can see
18:20 - so remember
18:22 - set it for your this spring only
18:25 - so this is all the same
18:26 - we can keep this all and then instead of
18:29 - greater than three we can do four
18:30 - because there's more ghosts
18:32 - than pumpkins so we're going to do that
18:35 - okay
18:36 - and then
18:37 - remember the start ghost again we can
18:39 - just
18:41 - receive the message when i receive start
18:43 - start uh
18:44 - closed again
18:46 - we are going to
18:48 - delete this clone
18:50 - and then we can just duplicate this
18:52 - and when i start we can just do
18:55 - wait two seconds
18:57 - and then we're gonna set up game
18:59 - to restart
19:01 - the clones
19:03 - okay
19:04 - now i'm gonna zoom out so i can show you
19:05 - guys the code
19:07 - it's basically the same thing as the um
19:11 - the pumpkin
19:12 - but you just have to change some of the
19:13 - variables
19:15 - so make sure you have all the variables
19:16 - correctly or this will not work
19:20 - now to the skeleton finally so
19:23 - in the skeleton we just drag and drop
19:25 - the code from the ghost i guess
19:27 - oh and before we go on i forgot to show
19:29 - you guys the ghost so now the ghost and
19:31 - pumpkins both work as you can see they
19:34 - all disappear
19:36 - shoot them
19:38 - shoot the ghosts
19:42 - if you see all the ghosts as you can see
19:43 - they're all gone they all respawn
19:44 - together at the same time
19:46 - you shoot all the pumpkins
19:48 - they all respawn okay so now it's
19:50 - working so
19:53 - in the skeleton it's basically the same
19:54 - concept so inside the skeleton
19:57 - we can just drag and drop this setup
19:59 - code
20:00 - game into the skeleton
20:03 - so
20:03 - right there
20:05 - but instead of all this of course no
20:07 - ghost counter i'm going to make another
20:08 - variable
20:09 - i'm going to make the variable scala
20:11 - skeleton counter
20:14 - skeleton counter
20:15 - instead of ghost camera we're going to
20:17 - be using the skeleton counter variable
20:19 - and then we're going to go to
20:22 - that negative 155 and negative 100
20:26 - instead one shelf lower than
20:29 - the
20:30 - um
20:31 - well
20:32 - the lowest shelf is where the skeletons
20:33 - are actually and then we're going to
20:35 - hide this is all the same except we're
20:37 - going to repeat five times and go 75
20:38 - steps right here because we're only
20:40 - making five clones of the skeletons
20:43 - these skeletons are a little bit bigger
20:44 - than the ghost so we're gonna make five
20:46 - clones repeat five times move 75 steps
20:49 - okay
20:50 - drag and drop this
20:52 - into here
20:53 - so instead we're here we're obviously
20:55 - going to do the skeleton counter
20:58 - skeleton timer and instead of this we're
21:00 - going to make another variable i'm going
21:02 - to call it start skeleton
21:05 - again
21:06 - start skeleton again
21:09 - and
21:09 - in here drag and drop this
21:12 - into the skeleton
21:16 - and right here we're in the beginning
21:18 - we'll switch the costume to skeleton a
21:21 - which is the non-broken one
21:23 - and then this is all the same
21:25 - um we're gonna change the skeleton
21:26 - counter by negative one
21:28 - once it's getting shot
21:30 - and how about let's change the score by
21:32 - 20
21:33 - for your skeletons
21:36 - and then uh
21:38 - and then we'll switch costume to
21:40 - skeleton b which is the skeleton a2 or
21:43 - whatever which is the one that's broken
21:46 - so yeah
21:48 - okay
21:49 - and finally we have to drag and drop
21:51 - this last piece
21:53 - of code
21:54 - into the skeleton
21:56 - timer is for this sprite again
21:59 - and then forever not this is all the
22:01 - same
22:02 - except let's make it
22:04 - greater than five for here since there's
22:05 - more skeletons
22:07 - as well
22:08 - um
22:10 - so yeah that's pretty much it for this
22:13 - what else could we add oh yeah i forgot
22:15 - we have to
22:17 - do the start skills and again so we have
22:19 - to
22:20 - when i receive start skeleton again
22:24 - we're going to delete this clone
22:29 - duplicate this
22:31 - and then wait two seconds and then
22:33 - before setting it up again okay
22:38 - yep so now we've got it
22:43 - now one more
22:45 - um
22:46 - let's go back to our
22:49 - target so inside the target we're going
22:51 - to
22:52 - code something else so
22:54 - right here we still have something to
22:56 - code like the game timer and all that so
22:58 - when i receive start game inside the
23:00 - target we're going to
23:04 - forever
23:07 - um
23:08 - actually
23:09 - yeah we're gonna have to put something
23:11 - in front of that
23:13 - and it's not a forever loop sorry we
23:14 - have to make the timer first actually
23:16 - so we're gonna go to game timer and 20
23:19 - so 20 seconds i'll give them 20 seconds
23:22 - repeat 20 times
23:26 - times and we're gonna wait one second
23:28 - before changing the game timer by
23:31 - negative one
23:32 - so this is basically a timer for 20
23:34 - seconds
23:37 - and next is duplicate this
23:40 - remove that just take the start game
23:43 - forever
23:44 - so we're going to detect if the timer is
23:46 - less than or equal to zero so
23:48 - if we're getting or so
23:52 - the game timer is less than or equal to
23:54 - zero less than
23:57 - or equal to zero so
23:59 - we're equal to zero
24:02 - so game timer
24:06 - less than
24:07 - zero
24:11 - we are going to broadcast
24:14 - start game i mean a new variable
24:16 - actually no this is going to be stop
24:17 - game you have to
24:19 - stop game is basically when you finish
24:22 - when there's no more time you're gonna
24:23 - stop the game
24:24 - so we're gonna have to do stop
24:28 - other scripts in the sprite and we're
24:31 - gonna get a stop
24:34 - this script okay
24:36 - and since it's all done let's go into
24:38 - the pumpkin we have the stop game
24:41 - so inside here
24:42 - stop game when i receive stop game
24:48 - then we will um stop other scripts in
24:51 - this sprite
24:55 - and just drag and drop this if it goes
24:57 - drag and drop it to the
24:58 - skeleton all right they all have it
25:03 - okay
25:04 - and then we're going to paint a sprite
25:07 - let's make uh
25:09 - i don't know whatever color red whatever
25:11 - and then we're going to say let's see
25:13 - what should we write
25:15 - oh yeah let me just copy what i got from
25:17 - before so thanks for playing
25:20 - thanks for
25:22 - playing
25:24 - your score
25:26 - is okay and then we're gonna put the
25:28 - game timer
25:29 - right there
25:30 - let's see
25:34 - all right so
25:35 - inside the code for this thing we're
25:37 - going to
25:38 - get the code for it
25:40 - drag this
25:41 - here one degree five clicks
25:44 - i'm going to
25:45 - go to zero zero
25:50 - and then hide the variable
25:52 - we can hide the variable uh
25:54 - show score
25:57 - in the beginning and then hide the
25:58 - sprite
26:00 - and then when i receive stop game
26:06 - then we will set the
26:08 - show score
26:12 - to the score
26:14 - and we're going to show the show scored
26:16 - variable
26:19 - and show
26:21 - this sprite
26:22 - okay
26:24 - so let me show the variables we need so
26:27 - we'll put the score in the top right
26:30 - we input the
26:32 - game timer in the top left
26:34 - uh and the show score in this thing
26:38 - double click on it
26:39 - and put it right here
26:42 - okay
26:43 - let's go full screen
26:50 - yeah so it's working
26:54 - see how much we can get
27:04 - as you see the time runs out thanks for
27:06 - playing your score is 820. as you can
27:09 - see that matches up with the score up
27:10 - here
