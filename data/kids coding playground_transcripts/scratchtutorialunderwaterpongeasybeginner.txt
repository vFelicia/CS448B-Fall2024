00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys in today's another
00:08 - kids coding playground video and today
00:12 - we will be making a new game called
00:13 - underwater pong so an underwater pong we
00:18 - will be learning these following
00:20 - concepts and scratch understanding
00:22 - broadcast message you know we still have
00:25 - to learn these type of things because
00:26 - it's really important to make animations
00:28 - as well using variables it's like
00:31 - game-like scores using random operator
00:34 - like pick random touching sprite if
00:38 - there's a sprite and you can touch it
00:41 - with like a ghost in like a thing you
00:43 - know move loops like forever loops and
00:46 - if-then loops and random position like
00:50 - it goes anywhere like something
00:52 - somewhere random so here we are in the
00:56 - project in the untitled project so we're
01:02 - gonna rename this first top underwater
01:05 - pong then we're gonna start and delete
01:13 - the cat we're gonna take the backdrop go
01:17 - to the backdrops you can pick a backdrop
01:19 - let's pick on somewhere under water
01:24 - because it's under water pong let's take
01:26 - underwater one so first lets me get
01:30 - there are sprites so we have the beach
01:35 - ball sprite we have the paddles paddles
01:42 - right we have the diver sprite you take
01:53 - any one you want but I'll take one we
01:56 - have the
01:59 - don't cry and these are all our sprites
02:08 - so we always have to start with the
02:10 - events we always have to start so first
02:21 - we're gonna work on the paddle sprite so
02:23 - I'm gonna go along it closer I think
02:25 - that's the next so let's take the if
02:28 - when clicked flag the flag right here
02:31 - you'll do a command let's make it go to
02:35 - around here around here it's got a
02:39 - motion go to negative to negative 140
02:43 - then forever loop this will make it go
02:48 - on and on forever
02:49 - then set X the set X so it'll stay there
02:55 - you know now we'll make my paddle pole
03:03 - follow my mouse so let's go to sensing
03:05 - and drag the mouse X book so let's see
03:10 - if it's working as you can see it's
03:12 - following my mouse so so let's work on
03:23 - the dive learn next
03:24 - the diver is just diving around so let's
03:28 - put him around like here and let's get
03:33 - the wooden start then let's take the
03:40 - forever loop so I'll do it forever
03:45 - no so let's zoom in a little bit more so
03:50 - let's take the go to so it'll stay there
03:55 - and then let's make it point in
03:58 - direction 90 so I'll point the way where
04:02 - it's pointing and I'm gonna make it
04:07 - glide around like here let's take
04:12 - glide or let's say three seconds and
04:19 - that point in direction negative 90 so
04:24 - you can also do that negative 90 so you
04:30 - got to click that so then it won't flip
04:32 - over so make sure make sure you click on
04:45 - this right here so it won't flip over so
04:48 - let's go negative 90 that's it
04:55 - then let's glide three seconds back okay
05:05 - so that's the divert code oh yeah yeah
05:08 - yeah so let's make it like a good number
05:11 - one is too quick so let's make it three
05:13 - again okay so let's move on to the beach
05:20 - ball let's see what code
05:22 - so first let's drag the when start let's
05:26 - zoom out a little bit that's a little
05:28 - bit to help
05:29 - let's go like around here yeah okay
05:34 - so let's make a variable let's make the
05:37 - variable oh okay variable school so
05:43 - that's how this gonna say how much score
05:46 - has so let's make its score 2-0 in the
05:50 - beginning go to go to X let's say around
05:58 - here because it's around the middle turn
06:01 - 15 degrees this way
06:05 - let's make it go forever so then it
06:08 - won't keep up it will keep on bouncing
06:10 - move 15 steps if I'm edge bounce so we
06:22 - might so we're going to take
06:25 - if on edge bounce then let's make
06:30 - another events another start so forever
06:35 - we need to go forever again you need an
06:39 - if-then statement so then if then it's
06:43 - touching the paddle so if it's touching
06:47 - the paddle that means it will bounce and
06:54 - turn 180 degrees so let's get that one
06:57 - turn a hundred okay and it's gonna move
07:03 - fifteen steps you have to put it in the
07:07 - if-then statement if you got you've got
07:11 - put in the if-then statement loop and
07:14 - and wait 0.5 seconds let's make it wait
07:18 - a little bit then you need another
07:24 - if-then statement make sure not to
07:27 - overlap it like this make it like right
07:29 - here so then it also won't work out so
07:33 - let's if then touching the star touching
07:38 - the star so we gotta make a message
07:48 - called and a variable called run again
07:55 - let's make a variable run again this
07:59 - variable is to make it so if you hit the
08:04 - star it'll wait a few seconds before it
08:06 - shows up or else it won't or else if you
08:10 - hit it it will just keep on showing up
08:12 - so yeah so you got to make this one so
08:15 - let's set set the run again to zero if
08:19 - it's touching the store then broadcast
08:22 - hit star let's make a new message hit
08:29 - stop
08:33 - so if you receive hit star that means it
08:39 - would change the score by one so then
08:41 - you got one piece of score like one
08:43 - score that's good
08:45 - by one and you have to wait pick random
08:50 - seconds for it to run again
08:53 - so wait pick random so this is where we
08:57 - learned pick random let's do one two
09:00 - five yeah so and set run again to one
09:07 - run again to one so pick one to five
09:11 - seconds before the star shows up again
09:17 - okay let's move on to the star guys so
09:22 - you always have to start out with the if
09:25 - flag clicked and yeah let's zoom in a
09:32 - little bit so then you can see it more
09:34 - better
09:35 - so set run again let's get here set one
09:40 - again to one forever let's put the four
09:47 - upper loop this is a loop mm-hmm and
09:49 - then you take the if-then statement and
09:54 - use to run again run again equals you
10:01 - got to use this one right here you wanna
10:03 - run again equals one then it goes to a
10:08 - random position go to random position
10:12 - anywhere it can be anywhere and show
10:16 - it'll show so then you can see it go
10:19 - wait three seconds let's make it wait
10:22 - three seconds and make it high so it
10:31 - won't come that often okay so
10:39 - so the star those wait three seconds it
10:43 - will appear for three seconds and you
10:45 - could hit it
10:46 - go hide so if you hit it so remember
10:49 - that hit hit star thing we had and then
10:53 - it makes it go it makes it hide so let's
10:58 - go in and let's run the game as you can
11:03 - see the paddle you hit the diver
11:05 - swimming around you can get the star it
11:09 - gives you three seconds to hit it and as
11:11 - you can see my score is going up see
11:15 - it's to score oh yeah and you also have
11:21 - to you might have to hide the run again
11:25 - the run again variable so you cannot see
11:30 - so let's save the project don't forget
11:33 - to save the project or else it won't be
11:35 - saved and let's play it so the ball can
11:41 - bounce off the bottom as well so the
11:47 - ball it's just like forever and then you
11:53 - just get score okay so that's the end of
