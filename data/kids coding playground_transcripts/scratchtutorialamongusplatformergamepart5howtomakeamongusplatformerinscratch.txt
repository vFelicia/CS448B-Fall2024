00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to kiss
00:09 - coding playground so today we are going
00:12 - to work on the next platformer
00:15 - part five of the among us platformer
00:17 - game
00:18 - uh so if you guys miss anything you can
00:20 - like pause the video and
00:23 - get the code here
00:26 - okay so
00:27 - here is all the custom block on this
00:29 - side and the main function is this uh
00:32 - broadcast a start game with start to
00:34 - broadcast to other
00:36 - uh message here which will start the
00:38 - game
00:39 - so here's all the code on this side so
00:42 - and then we have some code in the bottom
00:44 - here
00:48 - okay so let me move down a little bit
00:50 - more so
00:51 - here's all the code
00:53 - uh this is like when the player actually
00:55 - drop off uh drop off the to the bottom
00:58 - uh and then this is when they move from
00:59 - one stage to the next to change level
01:02 - and this is the player when it uh you
01:04 - know it got killed and then it reset the
01:06 - game
01:08 - okay so let's see on top here this is
01:11 - the movement control jump control here
01:14 - okay
01:16 - and then this is the checked if it hit
01:17 - the ground this is the move the um
01:20 - the hitbox which is this one then this
01:23 - animated character follows that
01:25 - so this is this is the the part of the
01:28 - the end of the main character so now
01:30 - let's move to the anime character so
01:32 - animated character you have some code on
01:34 - the right here
01:37 - where it starts
01:39 - and then the
01:40 - when green flag is clicked this is like
01:42 - moving uh
01:44 - the right or left and then changing the
01:45 - costume okay
01:48 - okay
01:49 - all right
01:51 - and then you have the ground this is
01:53 - just changing the level
01:55 - and you have the jump pad and this is
01:58 - all the code for the jump pad
02:00 - okay
02:01 - let me move them all together
02:03 - look
02:05 - okay so that's about it
02:09 - so next we'll be working on the other
02:11 - part of the uh the other other
02:15 - spikes and stuff like that other traps
02:17 - [Music]
02:18 - okay we'll work on the uh
02:21 - so we'll walk on the sprite uh for the
02:23 - spike so we're gonna paint a new block
02:26 - here
02:26 - uh just make it seven here uh you can
02:29 - use the line
02:31 - just draw up like this
02:33 - and then
02:34 - down
02:36 - and then up
02:39 - down
02:42 - up again
02:44 - you know however you want to draw
02:47 - okay and then from here
02:50 - maybe a little bit longer so this one
02:58 - so here just kind of draw this across
03:02 - so as you can see
03:04 - it's not really good
03:05 - but but you can kind of connect it okay
03:09 - all right so once you get this you can
03:11 - move them to the center or whatever
03:13 - right
03:14 - uh as you can see mine's not really
03:16 - straight i'm just doing it real quick
03:18 - but uh you can you can get it perfectly
03:20 - you like and then you can just feel the
03:22 - color
03:24 - and then fill this
03:26 - okay like this let some spike
03:28 - so for now let me put this spike here
03:30 - like let's say you want a spike here or
03:32 - something like that then you can you can
03:34 - make it smaller a little bit so that you
03:36 - know you can maybe use it
03:38 - for
03:41 - something else
03:44 - okay as you can see there's a little
03:45 - thing here you cannot really erase it if
03:47 - you use an erase tool like this
03:49 - it doesn't erase so you have to actually
03:52 - erase it you see how the line won't
03:54 - erase correctly so if you actually want
03:56 - to erase it you just have to convert the
03:57 - bitmap but it looks a little bit bad
04:00 - i'll just try to play around draw it a
04:02 - little bit better maybe the line a
04:03 - little bit down you know so that you
04:05 - don't have this problem but if you want
04:07 - to change the bitmap you can
04:09 - and then you can just erase that little
04:11 - piece
04:12 - but it won't look good right this is a
04:14 - little blocky but you know but uh i do
04:17 - have my own i drew earlier it looks
04:19 - better i'll just use that um but
04:22 - as you can see just draw any way you
04:24 - like okay
04:25 - so once you draw the the
04:28 - the spike then you can put the coin okay
04:31 - all right
04:32 - so the spike is done
04:34 - okay let's do the code
04:37 - for the spike
04:38 - so similarly for the trampoline really
04:41 - close the coast should be looking like
04:43 - similar to what we have in the
04:44 - trampoline so what i'm going to do is
04:46 - going to take the coal from here okay
04:49 - and move it to the spike okay i'll take
04:52 - everything here
04:54 - two
04:55 - three i'm gonna change up the code a
04:57 - little bit later
04:58 - four
05:00 - and
05:01 - five okay so mine has it like this
05:05 - i'm gonna
05:06 - move it up a little bit spread them out
05:09 - okay
05:11 - okay all right we'll make some change to
05:13 - it
05:14 - okay so since the custom only have one
05:16 - costume right we don't really need a
05:18 - chain custom we can just
05:20 - throw this away
05:21 - put it here like that
05:23 - and then the setup should be the same
05:24 - this x and y should be just for this
05:26 - sprite only okay make sure you when you
05:28 - create the variable that x and y you can
05:31 - see right sprite one only right so make
05:33 - sure you create it for this sprite only
05:35 - right here okay select this select this
05:38 - when you create a variable
05:40 - okay so you can rename this to like
05:41 - spikes or something like that
05:49 - okay
05:50 - okay all right so let's say at the
05:52 - location one let's say this is your
05:54 - first level you want to put it at this
05:56 - location
05:57 - then you know just use the uh
06:00 - use the uh m key kind of thing and it
06:03 - will tell you where it is so let's say
06:05 - 80 80
06:06 - 87 85 whatever 85 97 so you can try that
06:11 - fills for level one you can say like
06:13 - negative 85
06:15 - negative 97 so we're gonna put one on
06:17 - this
06:18 - we'll put this under here we don't need
06:19 - level three yet we don't know where that
06:22 - three will go right so i have to go
06:24 - there and well to see so the other part
06:26 - is the reset delete the clone we still
06:29 - need that
06:30 - and then this forever loop will be
06:32 - different so when it touch the main
06:34 - character is not going to bounce right
06:36 - we actually want to say broadcast die
06:39 - right just like how we did on the other
06:42 - uh
06:43 - sprite when they fall off the edge so so
06:45 - now let's just test it out so as you can
06:48 - see this is not a little bit off right
06:51 - so you want to move it back up then
06:53 - change it up you know like maybe
06:55 - negative 90 right
06:57 - let's see
06:58 - okay so it looks good negative 9 looks
07:00 - good so if i hit that i get killed right
07:04 - just like this it'll start again so i
07:07 - had to jump over that i guess
07:10 - this is a
07:11 - yeah this is too big actually
07:13 - this um
07:14 - [Music]
07:15 - this little thing yeah i guess i did
07:17 - make it over but you know you can change
07:19 - the size of the spike a little bit
07:21 - smaller
07:22 - and uh you know you don't have to do 100
07:24 - you can do like you know maybe size like
07:26 - 50 or something like that when you start
07:28 - as a clone
07:29 - you can do that
07:30 - right let's do that
07:32 - maybe
07:33 - or you can just change it inside here as
07:36 - well change the sky size highlight the
07:38 - whole thing and then make it smaller or
07:40 - you can do it with the code so let's say
07:42 - um maybe i say
07:45 - the size is uh maybe 75 okay let's start
07:48 - tm again
07:49 - so you see if the 75 is smaller then you
07:51 - have to move your your
07:53 - thing differently i would say just leave
07:55 - it at 100 and then just kind of
07:58 - you know change the uh
08:00 - change the uh
08:02 - the picture inside itself so that you
08:04 - don't have to send different size you
08:06 - know when you're going to different
08:07 - level so let's just kind of resize this
08:10 - a little bit
08:11 - maybe
08:13 - so that this guy can jump over right
08:16 - easier
08:17 - okay
08:18 - all right so and then i think my
08:20 - original get my size a little bit bigger
08:22 - so let's see
08:23 - 100 this time we'll move it back down so
08:26 - let's see
08:27 - [Music]
08:29 - negative 97 98 95 i don't know 97
08:35 - let's try again so yeah it looks good so
08:39 - [Music]
08:41 - still a little bit tough to jump over
08:43 - that yeah okay i did make it over
08:46 - so so there you go so that is for the
08:49 - spine
08:51 - so for level two we have the laser we
08:52 - can work on that right now
08:55 - uh what we can do is just paint
08:58 - call it a laser
09:01 - okay
09:02 - and then here in this paint we can just
09:04 - make a one
09:06 - one one dot in the middle somewhere in
09:09 - the middle
09:11 - yes whatever that is okay
09:14 - so one dot in the middle okay one dot in
09:17 - the middle that's good enough
09:19 - so that will be our red laser now let's
09:23 - copy the code from here to here uh the
09:26 - code for the laser a little bit
09:27 - different so we'll we'll try to change
09:30 - it up a little bit
09:31 - so let's copy this
09:33 - copy that
09:35 - this
09:37 - copy this
09:38 - and copy this
09:40 - okay now we have the laser
09:42 - uh let's spread the code out a little
09:44 - bit
09:46 - set up
09:48 - and then the clone and
09:51 - my high is missing so let me get that
09:53 - again
09:55 - okay all right so we have everything
09:57 - that we just copied from the spike but
10:00 - we are going to change it up a little
10:01 - bit
10:04 - okay so for the laser we actually need
10:05 - to do something a little bit different
10:07 - um
10:08 - we need the pen right so let's add the
10:10 - pen block okay
10:12 - so here for the reset with this say
10:16 - erase all
10:19 - and then um we need to have another one
10:22 - say stop
10:24 - all script and sprite
10:26 - and then delete this clone
10:28 - okay the start is the same
10:30 - any change over here
10:32 - uh setup we're gonna do uh something a
10:34 - little bit different here
10:37 - uh so the setup we're gonna have to make
10:39 - it run the laser multiple times so i'm
10:42 - gonna break this apart i'm gonna create
10:45 - my block okay
10:47 - okay it's called start
10:50 - laser
10:52 - again
10:53 - okay
10:56 - okay so we don't need to check this
10:57 - checkbox for this one we can let that
10:59 - run like that
11:02 - i'm gonna put in the bottom here
11:04 - and now what i'm going to do is gonna
11:06 - get this so i'm not gonna go to level
11:08 - one level one doesn't have a laser so
11:10 - level two has a laser so we want it
11:12 - somewhere on top here control m like
11:15 - let's say
11:16 - this is c like 0 124 something like that
11:19 - right 0 0 position should be okay
11:22 - so let's just do 0
11:26 - 120
11:28 - okay
11:29 - so this is level two sorry i don't know
11:31 - why i have two m sorry i think i push
11:33 - the mouse button so level two
11:36 - okay
11:36 - and we have the same one just like this
11:39 - um what we're going to do is we're going
11:41 - to call this from here um
11:44 - so that we can reuse this code so that's
11:46 - why i made a cell block
11:48 - [Music]
11:50 - okay so for the laser come back to the
11:52 - variable whether make another variable
11:54 - called timer
11:56 - so this one select for this sprite only
11:58 - okay
12:00 - so this is like we're gonna put some
12:02 - time on the laser so like after a
12:04 - certain time you know the laser will go
12:05 - away
12:06 - so here
12:08 - we're gonna say set
12:12 - set the timer to zero well we're gonna
12:14 - take out this one so we'll show
12:16 - okay we need the forever loop we can't
12:18 - take this one outside for now we'll
12:20 - change it later
12:22 - uh we can set the color for the pen
12:25 - uh for right now you can set it like
12:28 - some red color or whatever
12:30 - color right oops sorry
12:34 - so you see red something like this
12:37 - whatever okay
12:39 - this is you can use a darker red if you
12:40 - want and maybe
12:42 - this if you like okay
12:44 - all right so
12:46 - and then you have to set the pen size
12:49 - oh not change set set the pen side by
12:53 - one
12:54 - and we're gonna say we erase all
12:58 - and we're gonna do like pen down
13:02 - okay so we're gonna use a loop here
13:04 - repeat loop here repeat 10
13:08 - and we are going to use the position y
13:12 - change y
13:16 - uh do it like 250
13:18 - and then do change y
13:21 - minus 250 so it makes it go up and down
13:24 - like this you see these are forming that
13:26 - stop this again
13:30 - okay
13:31 - and then um
13:33 - what we can do is um we can change the
13:35 - pen size here oops
13:38 - change pen size
13:43 - make it three
13:44 - it's a little bit fatter
13:46 - and we can do a wait
13:50 - so i'll wait
13:52 - 0.1 a second
13:55 - and then we're going to change the timer
13:56 - here
13:57 - [Music]
14:00 - change timer
14:01 - by one
14:03 - and then we're going to put our if
14:04 - statement under this thing
14:07 - go to our control
14:11 - up to this
14:12 - and go to operator get this one
14:18 - variable go get the timer put it here so
14:21 - we will just say greater than 15
14:24 - some random thing and then we're gonna
14:26 - broadcast a message
14:31 - say
14:34 - stop
14:36 - laser
14:38 - okay
14:41 - and then we'll say delete this clone
14:44 - [Music]
14:50 - after that
14:53 - okay
14:54 - so
14:55 - and then we are going to say when i
14:59 - receive
15:02 - a stop laser i'll move this down for now
15:05 - [Music]
15:08 - uh what we have to do we're going to
15:09 - have to stop other script in the sprite
15:12 - in the control here
15:19 - stop all the script in the sprite
15:21 - and whether go depends that you raise
15:23 - all make sure you do that if not it
15:25 - won't work correctly
15:26 - and then we can do a wait like maybe a
15:29 - one and a half second before it starts
15:31 - again
15:33 - depending on how you like it
15:35 - and then we say broadcast
15:40 - start laser
15:43 - again
15:45 - okay stop laser again what we had is uh
15:47 - earlier right we have this uh stop laser
15:50 - again right so what they call this
15:52 - so same like what we did for this right
15:54 - we can do this here say start laser
15:56 - again we'll call
15:59 - this one this block
16:01 - all right let's put more down here
16:05 - okay so we're going to add this sound to
16:06 - this laser go to sound i'll upload this
16:09 - sound later for you guys this is like
16:11 - the zap sound i got
16:14 - so sounds like this
16:16 - it's like laser sound so you can add it
16:18 - to your
16:20 - laser so what we need is uh we are going
16:23 - to
16:24 - we actually don't need this and we'll
16:26 - delete this part let's touch it we're
16:27 - going to use color touch so we have the
16:29 - laser here we need another one start as
16:31 - a clone
16:34 - here when i start as a clone
16:37 - [Music]
16:40 - okay so let's scroll down here
16:43 - uh
16:44 - we're gonna set the volume if you want
16:46 - you can set the volume like not to allow
16:48 - or something like that it depends on how
16:51 - much you have on yours how high you have
16:54 - on your volume as you play on your
16:56 - screen okay
16:58 - and you can you can do that it's
17:00 - optional um you can use the forever loop
17:04 - [Music]
17:06 - here
17:07 - and now you can do a weight so it's
17:09 - gonna wait some
17:11 - half a second
17:12 - and then we'll play this down until done
17:18 - okay and then we'll do another wait
17:22 - so it's kind of like have a little bit
17:24 - of a delay in between of the laser so
17:27 - let's just try it out
17:31 - okay i'm gonna make the spike a little
17:33 - smaller okay for now
17:36 - let's just oh okay let's just try this
17:38 - let me show you i can jump over this
17:40 - thing
17:40 - okay i'll jump over
17:43 - okay
17:45 - so you can see the laser is kind of
17:47 - going like this you see it goes away
17:51 - as a sound but we still see this little
17:52 - dot here right
17:54 - so let's see if we can fix it
17:56 - so let's put our laser sprite here first
18:00 - okay
18:01 - okay so what we can do is this uh we can
18:04 - say take this one
18:06 - put this here and put it in the back
18:08 - layer
18:09 - so you can see the little dot went away
18:12 - okay
18:13 - all right so you have your laser going
18:15 - you know you don't like the color you
18:16 - can get a little bit brighter i guess
18:21 - so
18:22 - maybe like this yeah i think this looks
18:24 - better right brighter okay
18:26 - all right so we are good with that
18:29 - so now we just want to make sure that
18:31 - when the sprite jump here will die right
18:33 - we have to hit the laser so let's go
18:36 - back to the uh
18:37 - our character here
18:39 - [Music]
18:40 - okay so in the character let's change it
18:42 - to like a stage two for now so change it
18:44 - to level two so we can test this
18:46 - so every time it runs always test this
18:49 - uh what we're going to do is we're gonna
18:51 - find the code where we are seeing like
18:54 - if the okay die yet we can change this
18:55 - to kill here so what we're going to do
18:58 - is this
19:00 - we're going to say touching color
19:06 - okay let's see touching color
19:10 - we're going to use the all condition
19:12 - here first
19:15 - okay
19:16 - touching color
19:18 - or
19:20 - this position
19:22 - okay so make sure you don't use the same
19:24 - color so if you use the same color it
19:26 - might it will not work correctly right
19:28 - so uh what you can do is just click on
19:30 - this
19:31 - do the little thing oops let's just wait
19:33 - until that thing comes up
19:35 - [Music]
19:38 - there we go
19:40 - okay so we got the color
19:42 - all right so now let's try it out so
19:45 - let's see
19:46 - [Music]
19:48 - we got kill right we jump over right
19:52 - we cannot do the color with then we can
19:54 - jump okay
19:56 - so this is working fine so we can put a
19:59 - spike here also for number three so
20:02 - let's say this is level three when we
20:03 - want to put a spike here push the m key
20:06 - some way around at 130
20:09 - and 84 something like that so let's go
20:12 - back to the spike
20:15 - take this out duplicate this so do that
20:18 - for level three
20:20 - and you can say like 130
20:23 - right
20:24 - 84 i don't know just try it negative 84.
20:28 - if it doesn't work you know you can just
20:30 - always adjust it okay
20:32 - so let's run this again
20:35 - jump over this
20:37 - so this is so high right so 84 is high
20:40 - so we want to do something i don't know
20:42 - but we have 97 let's just try that
20:46 - so let's try that again
20:51 - so you see
20:53 - okay all right
20:55 - so jump over that cool so same thing for
20:58 - level four you want the laser to be
21:00 - around here or something like that push
21:02 - the m key
21:03 - you see 2 and 127 right
21:06 - so we'll hold our laser
21:08 - go back over here we'll go level 2 now
21:11 - it's level 4.
21:12 - [Music]
21:13 - duplicate
21:14 - this now we can put like two with 120 or
21:18 - something that's fine
21:21 - so now let's run it for level four let's
21:24 - go here and test it out level four here
21:28 - so we're gonna start
21:29 - four
21:32 - nope it's not working yet let's see
21:34 - what's going on
21:37 - okay so let's see what's going on that
21:38 - did not work right when we did this
21:40 - there's no coming okay let's see i made
21:42 - a mistake
21:44 - duplicate the code forgot to change it
21:46 - now let's try it
21:47 - so the laser is coming
21:50 - so level four is working fine
21:52 - okay level five let's say you want a
21:54 - laser here
21:56 - push the m key 3 and 120 or something

22:12 - let's try that again
22:14 - so this is level four
22:17 - okay the level four is done
22:19 - you see level five it has the laser
22:21 - you can adjust it right whatever you
22:23 - like so
22:25 - no fights the end can't go any further
