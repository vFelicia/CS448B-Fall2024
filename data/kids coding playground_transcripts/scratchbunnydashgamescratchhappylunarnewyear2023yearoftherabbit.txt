00:00 - thank you
00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's kids from the
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video on Scratch and today we'll
00:12 - be making a Lunar New Year game project
00:14 - because it is almost a Lunar New Year
00:17 - Lunar New Year is on January 22nd 20
00:20 - 22nd 2023 yep so this is our game for
00:24 - Lunar New Year and
00:27 - there's some music that's a little bit
00:30 - loud
00:31 - so uh we have some music and this Lunar
00:35 - New Year the um
00:38 - it is a rabbit so we use the rabbit for
00:42 - this project and basically there's this
00:44 - wooden barricade that slides up and down
00:45 - in a random position and you have to try
00:47 - to get the red envelopes which would
00:49 - basically have money inside so uh
00:54 - you the purpose of the game is trying to
00:56 - get these without hitting the barricade
00:58 - and losing all of your lives so let's
01:00 - try so you see I got a red envelope over
01:02 - there it makes a little sound it goes
01:04 - somewhere random on this section but it
01:06 - might have been a little bit close oh if
01:08 - I hit the barricade there's a stunned
01:10 - rabbit and I lost a life but I have one
01:13 - money right now so I can do that again
01:15 - and get another one and then now the
01:17 - envelopes at a different place and your
01:19 - objective is try to get a high score for
01:22 - this project
01:24 - and if you lose all your lives on the
01:26 - barricade the game ends and it says game
01:29 - over
01:30 - so that is our game that we have today
01:36 - so we started our new game and now we're
01:38 - gonna load all our Sprites so Sprite
01:41 - um scratch has a
01:44 - um Sprite called the hair which is a
01:46 - rabbit that we're basically using here's
01:48 - rabbit same thing so we have our hair
01:50 - over here
01:52 - and uh you might have noticed from our
01:54 - demo that we had two hairs because it it
01:58 - uh so it's in like an infinite Loop
02:00 - there's a another hair that's right
02:01 - behind that goes in front so to do that
02:05 - we will have to
02:07 - do uh select that group
02:10 - and Ctrl C Ctrl V and put it somewhere
02:13 - in the neighborhood behind the hair
02:16 - so now we have that finished so that's
02:20 - just the representation here it and now
02:24 - we get another hair
02:27 - and we can just rename this hair to The
02:29 - Dashing here because this hair will be
02:31 - dashing
02:33 - it's the Clone basically and
02:36 - it's the one that tries to get the
02:38 - envelopes
02:39 - and so we have to get some Stars so just
02:44 - to make the stunned version of the
02:47 - rabbit so we're gonna do that group Ctrl
02:50 - C go to the dash in here Ctrl V Ctrl V
02:53 - Ctrl V and get three of them but we
02:56 - don't have to shrink it because it is
02:58 - quite large so we're gonna put it like
03:01 - that
03:03 - like that
03:06 - like that so yeah we got our three stars
03:10 - for our stunned rabbit and we still have
03:12 - these two costumes which are basically
03:14 - running hairs so and we have our Dash in
03:19 - here now we are going to add our red Red
03:22 - Envelope there's no Red Envelope
03:24 - um Sprite on scratch sadly so you have
03:27 - to uh get our own from online we you can
03:30 - get it from online or just come to my
03:32 - project Gumball zero nine eight now just
03:35 - come to my profile it's Gumball 098 and
03:37 - I will have a project up there uh that
03:39 - is this game and you can get this Red
03:41 - Envelope just export it or you can go
03:43 - online find your own or use carrots if
03:46 - you do not want to use red envelopes and
03:48 - we have our barricade which basically
03:50 - blocks it and we drew this by ourselves
03:52 - and our game over text so that's our
03:55 - that is all of our Sprites and this
03:58 - project
04:00 - so
04:02 - let's start out and get the backdrop
04:07 - so now we're going to drag in our
04:08 - backdrop for this project so it's just a
04:10 - hay field and we have our very custom
04:12 - made backdrop so we're gonna make a
04:15 - quick representation on how to make this
04:18 - backdrop so you click choose a backdrop
04:20 - and
04:22 - um we chose the hay field
04:24 - and this looks very different from the
04:26 - other one but this is what we did so
04:28 - first we converted the bitmap and then
04:31 - we took a large portion of that place
04:34 - Ctrl C Ctrl V and move it a little bit
04:37 - more up so then we make sure the hair is
04:39 - not floating in the sky so we just do
04:41 - this repeat
04:43 - and as needed until you basically cover
04:47 - the whole entire place with hay
04:50 - so that's a lot of hay so you have all
04:54 - your hay over here and this is basically
04:56 - our backdrop and you might have noticed
04:58 - on our other hey field that we have we
05:00 - have also added uh flowers and and we
05:03 - also have a grasshoppers which are
05:05 - available in the Sprite library and our
05:08 - flowers are just pretty easy to draw or
05:11 - you can just uh we have some projects
05:13 - that you can find with flowers in them
05:15 - and before you duplicate any
05:18 - grasshoppers or any of that you have to
05:20 - get to your backdrop and from bitmap you
05:22 - convert back to vector and then you can
05:25 - use this and then get
05:27 - um any Sprite you want so let's just get
05:30 - a grasshopper
05:32 - and
05:33 - we can just go to the costumes and
05:36 - duplicate it to our backdrop
05:39 - you can use any costume you want
05:41 - and basically just add it to your
05:43 - backdrop shrink it a little bit group it
05:45 - and yeah basically add some decoration
05:48 - to your project
05:50 - and we're now going to delete our
05:52 - backdrop and our grasshopper right there
05:56 - so
05:57 - I have a whole entire thing set up so
06:00 - now we're gonna get onto the wooden
06:02 - barricade and teach you how to draw it
06:03 - so this part you can draw this pretty
06:06 - simply just by creating uh so let's just
06:10 - make a new costume so Ctrl V so that's
06:13 - just a rectangle if you ungroup that I'm
06:16 - going to put that apart it's just a uh a
06:19 - reshaped rectangle and the top is I
06:22 - swear so let's just those are the colors
06:24 - and
06:26 - uh we have a little rectangle over here
06:29 - and then just reshape it a little bit
06:31 - and you have basically
06:36 - um a cylinder more like
06:38 - maybe and for the little cone you have
06:41 - up there you have to get these colors or
06:44 - you can use other colors if you want
06:45 - make a square no outline then you could
06:48 - click the reshape Tool uh click one on
06:51 - the corners delete move that one to the
06:53 - top and then you have basically your
06:56 - little cone over here which you can add
06:58 - to your
06:59 - cylinder
07:01 - so now we have that
07:04 - uh you group it and then you can control
07:06 - C control V and copy paste as needed
07:11 - or you can just come to my Sprite or
07:13 - increase some size and you can come to
07:16 - my project Gumball zero nine eight and
07:19 - just duplicate my wooden barricade I
07:21 - will have shared up in for you
07:25 - and we have also have some extra logs so
07:28 - that's just uh
07:30 - um
07:31 - oopsies so that's just a rectangle
07:35 - like that so we're just going to ungroup
07:37 - that for you just a rectangle it's kind
07:39 - of reshaped and a circle and and a
07:44 - lighter Circle so that's basically our
07:46 - wooden log for
07:49 - group it and then we can just that's our
07:51 - basically our added decoration for the
07:54 - barricade
07:56 - just make that go to the back and you
07:58 - basically have already built your
08:00 - barricade so
08:02 - just add another log if you want
08:05 - and yeah
08:06 - pretty cool barricade
08:10 - yep
08:13 - so yep so this is how you draw your
08:16 - barricade
08:18 - and pretty simple and we're going to
08:21 - delete that we're just gonna use our old
08:22 - one
08:25 - okay so we might
08:28 - move this one
08:31 - to the back because it just looks better
08:33 - with contrast with others so
08:36 - now we will be starting our code
08:42 - and we're going to the hair first
08:45 - so when the green flag is clicked
08:48 - we do everything for the hair first
08:50 - set rotation style left right just in
08:53 - case it doesn't flip in all that crazy
08:55 - stuff that might happen
08:57 - and then switch costume to Hair A which
09:01 - is the standing here which looks like
09:03 - that because we already added another
09:06 - rabbit to there and then we're gonna go
09:09 - to a certain position so let's just go
09:11 - to here and go forever
09:15 - we're gonna go to
09:18 - X
09:21 - negative 176 so that's where we are and
09:24 - Y Mouse y so that's just basically
09:28 - so it's just gonna go up and down with
09:31 - your mouse
09:32 - and if then so we need if then right
09:35 - real quick if then Mouse down so if you
09:40 - click
09:41 - then switch costume to hair B
09:46 - which is this one
09:49 - please put that back here and
09:53 - broadcast Dash forward
10:02 - Dash or
10:07 - now we have that
10:08 - we wait 0.2 seconds
10:14 - and switch costume back to Hair A
10:16 - act like nothing happened and there's a
10:18 - new hair for us to use
10:21 - and then we have another green flag so
10:24 - when the green flag is clicked
10:26 - so we will create two new variables
10:28 - first money so that's just collecting
10:31 - your money
10:33 - uh so we're gonna set money to zero
10:34 - because you don't start off any money
10:36 - and then lives
10:39 - and then set lives to three
10:42 - you can add more or less if you want to
10:44 - make it more challenging or easier
10:46 - and then we will go to control get a
10:49 - forever Loop and then if then
10:53 - you need to ore
10:56 - so if then lives are equal to zero
11:00 - lives are equal to zero like
11:03 - or lives are less than zero
11:12 - then it will broadcast game over
11:14 - basically you lost all your lives
11:19 - and you need to restart
11:21 - so we are done with the hair
11:25 - so now we're going to move on to the
11:26 - dashing here
11:28 - so when the green flag is clicked zoom
11:30 - in a little bit it's gonna hide because
11:31 - we just want the regular hair to show in
11:34 - the beginning not The Dashing one and
11:36 - then when I receive Dash forward which
11:39 - is the broadcast that we received from
11:41 - the hair to move and then we'll create
11:44 - clone of myself
11:46 - and then when I start as a clone
11:49 - we'll set rotation Style
11:52 - where is it that left right and then go
11:56 - to hair so it'll just
11:59 - go to the hair when it starts out
12:02 - and then it will show
12:07 - and then it'll start sound Gallop so we
12:09 - might have to get that from the Sprite
12:15 - like yep perfect
12:17 - cover gallop oh yeah and
12:21 - um we thought it was a little long so we
12:23 - increased the Gallup speed
12:26 - and made it faster
12:28 - it's because it's just better It just
12:30 - fits in more with the project so we're
12:32 - gonna actually start sound gallop
12:36 - and we're going to have a repeat until
12:40 - I'll explain this in a minute repeat
12:43 - until you need to or
12:46 - repeat until touching Red Envelope or
12:51 - envelope whatever we call it
12:53 - touching Red Envelope so basically the
12:56 - rabbit will disappear when it touches
12:58 - the Red Envelope or
13:01 - need a greater sign where's the greater
13:03 - sign
13:05 - yeah there we go so or
13:08 - the X position
13:11 - is greater than 225.
13:15 - basically if it reaches this end it will
13:18 - disappear basically the X position of
13:20 - 225 back here
13:22 - and we cannot use and then it'll move 15
13:24 - Steps we cannot use touching Edge
13:27 - because you can drive your rabbet all
13:29 - the way up to the edge and we do not
13:31 - want it to disappear and stuff so and
13:33 - then you need a if then if then touching
13:37 - wooden barricade
13:40 - please
13:41 - wooden barricade
13:43 - it will stop other scripts in the Sprite
13:49 - so stop other strips in the Sprite and
13:52 - it will switch costume
13:55 - to Hair A
13:58 - which is the stunned one so basically if
14:00 - you hit the wooden barricade it'll be a
14:01 - stunned rabbit
14:03 - and weight 0.2 seconds
14:12 - 0.2 seconds and delete this quote
14:17 - and then delete this one
14:20 - so now we have another thing to use so
14:22 - I'm going to zoom out real quick see if
14:24 - you can copy down this code feel free to
14:26 - pause
14:28 - and then we're gonna put a when I start
14:30 - as a clone
14:31 - it'll go to the front layer
14:34 - I'm gonna have to move that soon
14:37 - go to the front layer and then switch
14:39 - costume to hair
14:42 - B
14:45 - this one so it's basically running
14:49 - and then
14:50 - we have to repeat until
14:54 - move a little bit over here repeat until
14:57 - you know or again
15:05 - so we're going to repeat until and use
15:07 - this over here and put that in here oops
15:13 - put that in here
15:14 - and then we're gonna go switch costume
15:18 - to hair B
15:21 - and wait 0.1 seconds
15:29 - and then switch costume
15:32 - to here C
15:34 - so it's basically Galloping back and
15:36 - forth between these two
15:40 - and
15:41 - you might ask why don't I just put that
15:46 - 0.1 seconds over here why don't I just
15:47 - put that over here so wait to do block
15:50 - the
15:52 - the other scripts in the Sprite because
15:53 - of the small weight so that is not going
15:57 - to be good so you have to make it a
15:59 - different separate
16:01 - place
16:02 - and now we have that done with we are
16:05 - done with the hair so I'm gonna try to
16:09 - group up these code if you can see it
16:13 - so feel free to pause right here oh not
16:16 - here here so yeah basically all the code
16:19 - for the dashing here
16:24 - so now we're moving on to the red
16:26 - envelope envelope
16:29 - so when the green flag is clicked
16:33 - we will go to
16:36 - go to this position you can do whatever
16:38 - position starts out with it'll go
16:40 - forever
16:43 - show
16:47 - go to and you need this one
16:51 - go to x210
16:53 - which is over here so that's the 210x
16:56 - and then y so it was just pick random
16:59 - from negative 135y all the way down here
17:03 - but positive 135y all the way up there
17:06 - so it has a lot of
17:08 - um differences in where the envelope is
17:11 - going to be
17:12 - and then we're going to put wait until
17:16 - touching dashing here
17:20 - touching Dash and hair
17:22 - so just wait until it gets touched and
17:26 - then it will change the money
17:30 - money if I pick random one to ten
17:36 - cool and now we're gonna play a quick
17:39 - sound a coin sound pretty sure you can
17:41 - find this in the Sprite Library
17:43 - just right there and you should sell a
17:46 - quick little coin sound so we will use
17:49 - play sound coin until done
17:52 - and then hide
17:55 - then wait 0.2 seconds
18:03 - so yep feel free to pause right here
18:09 - and we'll be moving on to the wooden
18:13 - barricade
18:15 - and so when the green flag is clicked
18:20 - oopsies I don't know why I always zooms
18:23 - out like that and grief like is clicked
18:25 - I'll go to whatever position
18:28 - you wanted to start out at
18:30 - probably gonna make a start out over
18:31 - here because that looks like a little
18:33 - too far
18:34 - and then
18:38 - let's actually make yeah I think that's
18:40 - good
18:43 - maybe up here it doesn't really matter
18:45 - but
18:46 - let's just put it over here and then go
18:48 - forever
18:50 - it'll Glide
18:53 - use this one
18:54 - Glide 0.5 seconds
18:58 - to okay so I'm gonna make it Glide 0.5
19:01 - seconds to x 100 make this one 102 so
19:05 - it's matching and why pick random
19:08 - negative 180 all the way to the bottom
19:12 - all the way to positive 180 all the way
19:16 - to the top
19:17 - and we're gonna wait
19:20 - wait pick random
19:24 - 0.5
19:26 - to 1 second before it starts moving
19:29 - again
19:30 - and then after that we will have when
19:32 - the green flag is clicked
19:34 - we'll go forever
19:36 - and then if if then
19:39 - if it's Touching The Dashing hair
19:46 - then it will change the lives by minus
19:49 - one
19:50 - basically losing a life
19:53 - and wait 0.5 seconds
20:00 - so we're going to zoom out one and feel
20:01 - free to pause right here
20:06 - and now we'll be going to the text
20:09 - this one's pretty simple when the green
20:11 - flag is clicked
20:14 - it'll go to
20:15 - the middle
20:17 - and it'll hide
20:20 - because you don't lose the game in the
20:21 - beginning and then when I receive
20:24 - game over
20:26 - it will go to the front layer in front
20:29 - of everything
20:31 - show
20:33 - and then
20:35 - stop all
20:37 - now we're done with that we can move on
20:39 - to the backdrop our final one
20:42 - and then when the green flag is clicked
20:43 - oopsies
20:46 - green flag is clicked okay so now I will
20:49 - be uploading a sound so that we can use
20:51 - so I'm going to use this one
20:55 - and we have that and that's basically
20:57 - the side I'll be using for this project
20:59 - you can use whatever from the Sprite
21:01 - library or whatever you want
21:04 - and we can change set volume
21:08 - to 25 percent
21:10 - and go forever
21:14 - and play sound
21:16 - Chinese happy New Year until then
21:19 - so we have that done and finished
21:23 - so now we're gonna drag the money down
21:26 - same with the live so it's not
21:28 - interfering with the rabbit as much
21:31 - so I found a really big bug inside the
21:33 - game and I'm just here to tell you that
21:35 - so when I coated this in the wooden
21:37 - barricade this is incorrect and we might
21:40 - have to trash all of that and instead go
21:43 - to the hair and instead lose change the
21:46 - lives back here so it's actually working
21:49 - because like it wasn't working because
21:51 - when it touched the thing sometimes it
21:54 - lost lives but sometimes it didn't so
21:56 - now it should guarantee a loss of life
21:59 - so I should try it out my lives are
22:02 - losing so that's perfect and dealer so
22:05 - the game should work now so uh
22:08 - let's just test out the whole entire
22:10 - game so we have our money and let's just
22:14 - try to get the money
22:16 - and yeah
22:17 - [Music]
22:19 - because I missed
22:21 - okay
22:25 - and yeah oops oops there we go so yeah
22:31 - this is basically our game that we made
22:33 - today
22:35 - so please like share subscribe and
22:40 - comment in the comment section below
22:42 - um what project you want next and if you
22:45 - do celebrate the Lunar New Year please
22:47 - share with us that is very cool so yeah
22:51 - have a great day
22:53 - see you guys next time
22:55 - [Music]
