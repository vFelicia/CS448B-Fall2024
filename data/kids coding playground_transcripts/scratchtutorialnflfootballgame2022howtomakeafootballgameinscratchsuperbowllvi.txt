00:04 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys kids on playground
00:08 - here and today we're back with another
00:09 - video in scratch and today we will be
00:11 - doing an nfl football game 2022 on
00:14 - scratch and right now the semi-finals
00:17 - are on for our time zone and it's
00:19 - bengals versus chiefs and 49ers of rams
00:22 - so
00:23 - this is our nfl game so our football
00:26 - comes in and you use arrow keys to move
00:28 - and cpu tries to follow you and you get
00:32 - tackled
00:33 - or um you can touch down so
00:39 - so as you see you have infinite tries
00:41 - you click on the football it goes and
00:43 - you can click space to dash and then it
00:45 - will say
00:47 - so if you always follow your football
00:50 - and if you let the football go that
00:51 - means you'll lose uh then you'll
00:53 - automatically lose the max
00:57 - and or if there's a cpu sample
01:00 - [Music]
01:02 - and you can touch down
01:06 - so
01:07 - yeah you get seven points from doing
01:09 - that
01:20 - [Music]
01:24 - wow so let's go
01:28 - so i created my new project here and the
01:30 - first thing i'm going to do is name it
01:32 - nfl
01:35 - football
01:38 - game 2022
01:42 - and now i'm going to delete a scratch
01:44 - chat and get our sprites ready
01:46 - so we have the player sprite which is
01:47 - taylor actually
01:49 - this sprite right here and
01:52 - uh we have to rename it to player
01:56 - and then we have our football which is
01:58 - in my backpack
02:00 - you can act always come to my project
02:01 - i'm gumball 098 and export the sprite
02:04 - football
02:07 - and we have
02:10 - the
02:11 - another taylor
02:13 - which is the cpu
02:20 - cpu and we're gonna change the color of
02:24 - the hair
02:26 - to yellow so
02:37 - and
02:38 - saturation
02:40 - like that
02:44 - so yeah
02:46 - and now we're going to color it
02:50 - for every single tailor
02:56 - and now we have our cpu
03:00 - and we set the size to 50 for the cpu
03:04 - football is already 25 so no need to do
03:06 - that and 50 for the player
03:11 - and now i'm going to try to attempt to
03:12 - draw the backdrop but i do have the
03:15 - uh one in my backpack to put in
03:18 - so yeah let's try to draw
03:23 - so we have our backdrop one
03:27 - so we have actually a light green in the
03:30 - back a light green square
03:34 - a gigantic light green square and then
03:37 - we fill it in with dark green uh
03:39 - rectangles inside
03:43 - like that
03:45 - and with a white border
03:48 - outline is white
03:50 - and we just conti repeat
03:54 - we can make the 10 yard line the 20.
03:58 - so we're not going to show the whole
03:59 - thing but we have to also add the
04:01 - numbers on it so
04:04 - uh so here we have the colors 36 81 and
04:08 - 50.
04:10 - and
04:12 - the
04:13 - box outside is 36 81 and 60. so a little
04:16 - bit more bright than the other one
04:19 - and yeah we just have to use text
04:22 - and put in
04:25 - white
04:26 - and put in our text
04:28 - 20 10 whatever the first one
04:32 - 10
04:32 - and then 20 and then so on
04:36 - remember you can always come to my
04:37 - project and export the sprite
04:40 - uh my name is gumball098 so come to my
04:44 - uh
04:45 - account to that and click on this
04:47 - project and export the sprite for your
04:49 - own project
04:51 - so and we have the touchdown in the end
04:53 - just write text and rotate it so we have
04:56 - our
04:57 - text here
04:58 - if it's just rotated
05:01 - it's touch down but then you just rotate
05:03 - it
05:04 - so yeah
05:06 - that's the gist of making your
05:08 - background so have that done
05:11 - let's move on
05:14 - and rename this to backdrop
05:18 - and also
05:19 - i also have my tackle spread this should
05:21 - be really easy to make just
05:23 - draw the thing i just decided to do this
05:24 - because
05:25 - we have so this take this project may
05:28 - take a long time to make so we don't
05:29 - want to waste any time drawing it so
05:32 - here's our so just write touchdown or
05:34 - tackles or you can just come to my
05:36 - project
05:38 - so tackled you have to make it bigger
05:40 - than touchdown because touchdown is
05:41 - going to
05:42 - spin around and make become bigger so
05:46 - that's the point
05:47 - so now we're going to start out with the
05:49 - player
05:51 - so we have to start with
05:53 - our
05:54 - grand green flag is clicked and then we
05:56 - have to get a variable called speed
05:59 - and
06:01 - and it's for this right only
06:04 - and we have
06:06 - a score as well so let's get that
06:09 - finished
06:11 - and we're gonna set
06:13 - speed to five so it starts out as five
06:16 - speed so it's pretty quick
06:18 - i know broadcast restart because you get
06:20 - infinite tries to get as much points as
06:22 - you can
06:23 - so
06:24 - broadcast restart
06:27 - so when i receive restart
06:33 - so we have our research we're just going
06:34 - to move this to the side we're going to
06:36 - get a my block first called animate
06:38 - player
06:42 - and we have our animate player
06:44 - and
06:45 - when i go forever
06:49 - it will go next costume
06:52 - and wait 0.1 seconds so it's constantly
06:55 - moving its feet
07:00 - and
07:01 - now we do
07:03 - restart
07:07 - or wait one second
07:09 - and then it will do animate player
07:12 - now we have that finished we're going to
07:13 - move on to move player so i'm going to
07:15 - show you the what it is so
07:19 - you see it's moving yep so now we're
07:22 - going to define move player
07:28 - and because you have infinite choice you
07:29 - need these defines so define move player
07:32 - go to x
07:34 - you have a position for it so negative
07:36 - 210
07:37 - y zero
07:39 - and now the point in direction 90.
07:43 - and go forever
07:47 - so we're gonna go here and click left
07:49 - right so it doesn't turn over when it
07:51 - goes to the other side so now it's on
07:53 - left right we have to continue so
07:55 - forever
07:57 - if it's on the edge you'll bounce so you
07:58 - can't go into the edge
08:00 - and then if then
08:03 - if the
08:05 - up arrow is pressed
08:11 - then
08:14 - it will
08:15 - point in direction zero
08:18 - because that's up on the top
08:20 - as you can see it's up here
08:23 - and it'll move speed steps
08:27 - so move all
08:28 - amount of steps
08:32 - and our down arrow is basically the same
08:34 - thing we do that
08:37 - and
08:39 - we switch it to down arrow point
08:41 - direction
08:42 - 180 so that's on the bottom
08:45 - and then move speed steps
08:48 - and our
08:48 - [Music]
08:51 - uh
08:52 - right
08:52 - arrow is
08:55 - about the same so that point direction
08:57 - is 90
08:59 - and it will move speed steps
09:01 - and now we have left arrow which is
09:03 - basically the right arrow but we change
09:05 - it to left arrow and point negative 90
09:08 - no move speed steps
09:11 - and now
09:12 - so and now
09:14 - if then
09:17 - the x position
09:19 - is greater than where
09:25 - 180 which is
09:27 - right here
09:29 - and it will become a touchdown so we'll
09:31 - broadcast touchdown but we'll
09:33 - use that broadcast
09:35 - for later
09:43 - and now we've done the touchdown
09:46 - uh you need when i receive restart
09:50 - you need to wait one second instead of
09:52 - animate player
09:53 - go down here and use move player
09:58 - so we have that finished
09:59 - so when i receive touchdown
10:06 - touch down then it'll stop
10:10 - other scripts in the sprite because you
10:11 - don't want them to move after the
10:13 - touchdown
10:14 - and now i'm going to do the speed thing
10:16 - so whenever you hold a space then you'll
10:18 - go quick
10:20 - it'll set speed
10:24 - to seven
10:26 - wait one second and set it back to five
10:28 - so you go a little bit quicker you boost
10:31 - for a second
10:34 - and now i've done that let's work on
10:37 - other sprites so let's see if it works
10:39 - or not so
10:41 - i'm moving and i'm about to boost a
10:43 - boost and it stops all descriptions
10:46 - right i can't move
10:47 - when i get touchdown
10:50 - so yeah we haven't got the restart code
10:52 - completely finished yet so
10:57 - all right so let's work on the football
11:02 - so
11:07 - so when the green flag is clicked
11:09 - no not when the green flag is clicked
11:12 - so we have to define a new block called
11:14 - move football because after every single
11:18 - time we do it
11:19 - it will move the football back over here
11:22 - so move football it'll go show
11:28 - uh go to the front layer
11:32 - and it will go to
11:34 - x
11:36 - 210 so it has to be
11:39 - over here
11:42 - and then it'll pick random the y
11:44 - from negative 130
11:47 - to positive 130 so it can be from down
11:50 - here to up here
11:52 - and a point in direction 90.
11:56 - negative 90
11:59 - because it's on the left side and
12:01 - we'll repeat until touching the player
12:04 - so
12:05 - repeat until touching
12:07 - or you foresee an or because it could
12:09 - either touch the edge or the player
12:13 - and now uh you have to do repeat until
12:16 - let's first change this to left right
12:17 - real quick oh it's already on left right
12:19 - okay repeat until touching edge
12:23 - because you can touch the edge
12:25 - or touching the player
12:28 - and it'll move seven steps until it is
12:30 - touching that so the football is pretty
12:32 - quick same speed as the player when you
12:34 - boost
12:36 - now you need if the now statement
12:39 - and if then
12:41 - it's touching the player
12:44 - then it will broadcast catch because you
12:46 - can't caught the ball because
12:48 - you got the ball
12:52 - broadcast catch
12:54 - and the also broadcast restart because
12:56 - you did not you failed to get the ball
12:59 - now we have to when i receive restart
13:03 - i'll hide
13:06 - and it will stop all the scripts in this
13:08 - sprite
13:10 - so it's double
13:12 - and then
13:14 - wait one second
13:17 - and move football
13:23 - so now let's finish this so when i
13:25 - receive catch
13:28 - let's move to the site a little bit
13:30 - when i receive
13:31 - catch
13:33 - then it will go to the back layer
13:39 - and it will
13:41 - go forever
13:44 - and if then else
13:47 - if then uh the di
13:49 - i'll just explain it so if then
13:52 - the direction of the player so this is a
13:54 - tricky block
13:56 - it's this backdrop of stage
13:59 - instead you go
14:01 - of player direction of player
14:05 - is greater than zero
14:10 - which is the right
14:11 - then it will go to
14:16 - x
14:21 - so
14:23 - and i'll go to
14:25 - x
14:27 - x position plus okay so i'm going to
14:30 - explain this
14:31 - so
14:32 - you do this and you have to do this
14:34 - player and exposition of player plus 20
14:37 - because you do not want the football
14:39 - on to the player but onto the side of
14:41 - the player which is going to be on the
14:43 - back of the player which means it's
14:44 - under its arm
14:46 - so you want to go to the x position of
14:48 - player plus 20. so
14:50 - it's going to be somewhere here
14:51 - and the y
14:54 - is the
14:55 - x position of
14:57 - not the player the y position of the
14:59 - player but we need a minus 20
15:03 - so the y position of player
15:06 - minus 20
15:09 - so it's
15:10 - somewhere over here because the x
15:13 - position is like this the x so it's here
15:18 - and the y is down here so it's going to
15:20 - be somewhere over here
15:22 - and else it will go to
15:26 - x i think this is the same
15:28 - but you just have to swap it
15:30 - it'll go to
15:32 - x position
15:34 - so let's take this out real quick
15:36 - so a y position stays the same so it's
15:38 - going to go into here and now we need
15:40 - another minus instead of a plus
15:44 - and it is the x position minus 20.
15:52 - so
15:53 - we are
15:55 - i think done the football
15:57 - i actually put a negative before this so
16:00 - it's supposed to be minus 20. this
16:02 - negative negative is a positive so let's
16:04 - see if this works the football's coming
16:06 - and look our person is getting the
16:08 - football
16:10 - now we're done the football we have to
16:12 - move on to the cpu so
16:14 - the cpu
16:17 - so yep we're going in here so we have to
16:19 - make a block called
16:23 - move cpu
16:30 - so now we have this block we will repeat
16:34 - three times
16:39 - it will create a clone of myself because
16:41 - there's going to be three clones trying
16:43 - to tackle you
16:45 - it'll hide
16:48 - and now we're done with that
16:51 - and now we have when i start as a clone
16:55 - so let's do that whereas when i started
16:57 - when i start as i clone it'll go forever
17:04 - oh next costume
17:06 - so it has the same moving animation as
17:10 - our player here
17:11 - oh wait little button
17:14 - and now
17:15 - when i started as a clone
17:19 - uh it'll set speed so it's also gonna
17:22 - have a speed we're gonna make a variable
17:23 - for itself and remember
17:26 - for this sprite only this is very
17:28 - important so speed
17:30 - for this right only and then it'll set
17:32 - speed
17:35 - to
17:36 - pick random two to four so they are
17:38 - slower than the player but this game is
17:40 - still quite challenging because of the
17:42 - fact that
17:44 - there's three of them so yep we have
17:46 - that and now we have show
17:49 - and it'll go to x
17:55 - it'll go to a pick random position
17:57 - pick random
18:00 - 140
18:02 - to
18:04 - 210
18:05 - and the y is pick random
18:08 - negative 130
18:11 - to positive 130. so it's going to be
18:13 - somewhere here let's just start
18:15 - somewhere there
18:16 - so since it's pointing this way i'm
18:18 - going to change the direction to
18:20 - negative 90
18:21 - and switch left right on the way and
18:26 - uh it'll
18:27 - repeat until
18:29 - it is touching player
18:36 - and it will point towards player
18:40 - because you'll start to try to get the
18:43 - player
18:44 - it'll move speed steps
18:50 - yo broadcast tackle
18:55 - which is a new thing so we have tackle
19:00 - and when i start as a clone this is to
19:03 - make them quicker when you pass the
19:06 - when you pass 50 on the 50 yard line and
19:09 - when i start as a clone it will go
19:10 - forever
19:13 - and if then
19:17 - you need greater than if then
19:21 - the x position of player
19:25 - this tricky ball
19:27 - x position of player is greater than 10
19:32 - which is somewhere here in the 50 yard
19:33 - line
19:34 - now set speed it'll start dashing
19:38 - so set speed
19:39 - to
19:40 - pick random three to five
19:47 - if you want this game to be extremely
19:49 - challenging you can do three to six or
19:52 - if you're or four to six or five to six
19:54 - or whatever but that's really hard
19:57 - uh and we have
20:00 - uh when i receive touchdown
20:05 - it'll stop all the scripts in sprite
20:10 - uh wait two seconds
20:15 - and i'll broadcast restart
20:21 - and now when i receive tackles which is
20:24 - basically the same thing
20:26 - touchdown i'll stop the scripts in white
20:28 - right in broadcast restart
20:31 - yeah so that's our new uh broadcast
20:34 - and we have when i receive when i
20:37 - receive
20:38 - restart it'll wait 1.5 seconds so i have
20:41 - a little wait
20:45 - and then it will move cpu
20:49 - and then when i receive restart
20:53 - so what if
20:55 - minus you restart
20:56 - i'll delete clone
21:00 - so
21:01 - yeah
21:02 - the reason for delete this cloud is
21:04 - because if you don't have it
21:05 - the clones will start multiplying and
21:07 - multiplying and multiplying until
21:09 - there's a lot of people chasing you so
21:11 - you do not want that to happen so you
21:12 - want to delete the clone and make it
21:13 - back to three
21:15 - and then you get restart and it'll wait
21:17 - the 1.5 seconds it'll move cpu and
21:19 - create the three clones all over again
21:21 - okay so here's all the code feel free to
21:23 - pause the video
21:25 - if you need to pause so yeah feel free
21:28 - to pause and we're going back to the
21:30 - player actually
21:31 - and we're going to code one last bit of
21:33 - code for the tackle
21:35 - so when i receive tackled
21:38 - then it will stop other scripts in the
21:40 - spread
21:43 - and also when i receive touchdown but i
21:45 - might have that already let me check
21:49 - oh i already have that
21:51 - so
21:52 - yeah
21:54 - so this is all our code feel free to
21:56 - pause for the player
21:59 - so let's get a deeper look at that one
22:01 - two three
22:04 - so feel free to pause remember
22:06 - and now we're gonna work on our last
22:08 - sprite tackled
22:11 - and
22:12 - to do tackled
22:14 - you you need to do
22:16 - when the green flag is clicked
22:19 - it'll set the score
22:22 - to zero
22:23 - you know go to x00
22:26 - xyz 0 and you know how to draw this
22:28 - right you should use text
22:31 - and it'll go hide
22:34 - and after that when i receive touchdown
22:41 - then you'll go to the front layer
22:45 - and set size to a hundred percent
22:49 - and change score
22:52 - by seven so this is actually the change
22:54 - score
23:00 - so a normal touchdown is six points but
23:02 - the field goal is seven
23:04 - is one point so it's seven but we're
23:06 - just going to give seven here supposing
23:08 - that they got the
23:10 - fieldable so now we're gonna switch the
23:11 - costume back to costume switch costume
23:14 - to costume one
23:16 - and it will show
23:19 - and i'll point in direction 90
23:23 - and repeat 10 times
23:27 - change size by five so it's going to
23:28 - gradually get bigger
23:31 - and it will turn
23:34 - right 36 degrees so 36 degrees means 36
23:38 - times 10 which is 360. so it's going to
23:42 - do a full circle
23:44 - and now we have wait two seconds
23:48 - hide
23:51 - and now when i receive tackle
23:57 - i'll go to the front layer
