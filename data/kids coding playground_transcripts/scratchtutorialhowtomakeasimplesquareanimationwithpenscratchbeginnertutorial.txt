00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys
00:08 - today we'll be doing another tutorial on
00:10 - how to use pen so this is a beginner's
00:12 - project
00:13 - on how to use the pen pencil
00:17 - so like this is a game i mean a project
00:19 - or animation i made a long time ago
00:22 - so let me demonstrate the game or
00:24 - project
00:25 - so when you click the green flag the pen
00:27 - will just go around the screen drawing
00:29 - squares around it's kind of like a
00:30 - little animation made this
00:33 - a very long time ago but we decided to
00:36 - teach it today
00:39 - this is a beginner's tutorial so yeah
00:41 - that's basically the
00:43 - project just a pen drawing squares
00:45 - around
00:46 - the backdrop and i'm pretty sure they
00:49 - don't have this pencil spray anymore so
00:51 - i think we're going to use the pen
00:52 - because i did this back in 2.0
00:55 - okay so let's start a new project
01:00 - so i'm going to rename it to simple
01:02 - square
01:03 - animation
01:10 - okay because i had pen in my old project
01:13 - the pen extension is already here but if
01:15 - you're new to scratch
01:16 - just click the extension right here
01:20 - and select the pen there's also a bunch
01:23 - some other
01:24 - extensions but we'll not get into that
01:26 - today just get the pen
01:27 - and 2.0 uh head was actually part of one
01:30 - of these blocks
01:31 - so now you have to add the extension to
01:33 - get it so
01:34 - let's start out deleting the scratch cat
01:38 - and see if they have a pen
01:41 - they used to have a pencil oh they still
01:43 - do have a pencil okay
01:45 - um we're going to be using
01:48 - the more cleaner pencil looks better
01:52 - in my opinion you can also resize this
01:55 - pen
01:56 - so it's just 75 all right
02:00 - so let's start out in the pencil with
02:03 - getting a one green flag clicked
02:05 - make it bigger um we're going to go to
02:07 - the pen
02:08 - and in the beginning we want to erase
02:10 - everything so we're going to get the
02:11 - erase
02:11 - all block and then let's go to control
02:15 - forever loop pen up
02:21 - and then we're going to go to we're just
02:23 - going to make it go to
02:24 - random positions so go to pick
02:27 - random
02:30 - x negative 190 or you can do a negative
02:35 - 240 let's do negative 240 actually um
02:39 - i'll just i'm just going to play with
02:40 - some numbers i think this is a good
02:42 - amount
02:43 - negative 240 to 240 which means from the
02:45 - left all the way to the right side
02:47 - i'm going to duplicate this let's pick
02:49 - random from the y
02:50 - negative 180 to 180 so it's basically up
02:55 - and down
02:55 - so it could either be down here or up
02:57 - here
02:58 - okay after we do this we can do pen down
03:02 - so it's actually going to draw the stuff
03:05 - so pen down and then we're going to
03:07 - change the pen color
03:09 - by 10
03:12 - we're going to change the pen color by
03:13 - 10 so it'll just
03:16 - change color the color of the squares
03:18 - will vary
03:20 - okay so now let's get a repeat four
03:23 - times block so it'll draw squares so
03:25 - repeat four times move 50 steps
03:29 - and we're going to turn 50 steps and
03:32 - turn
03:32 - left negative 90 degrees turn left 90
03:35 - so it will actually draw a square
03:38 - all right and we want to make it when
03:41 - you click the space bar it will clear
03:43 - everything on the board so let's get
03:46 - this
03:46 - whenever when spacebar is being pressed
03:50 - go to pen and we're going to do erase
03:52 - all
03:54 - okay so that's all the code it's pretty
03:55 - simple save it
03:57 - now let's go full screen so as you can
03:59 - see it's working perfectly fine it's
04:01 - going around the screen
04:03 - drawing squares all around
04:07 - so yeah it's pretty cool simple
04:08 - animation for beginners if you're new to
04:10 - scratch this is a perfect starting
04:12 - project for you
04:14 - and if you press space bar it clears
04:16 - everything and restarts
04:17 - so yes that's exactly what we want so
