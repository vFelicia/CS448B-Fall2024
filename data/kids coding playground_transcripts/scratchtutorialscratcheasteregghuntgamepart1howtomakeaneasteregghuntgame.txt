00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:08 - playground and happy easter today in
00:10 - america it is uh easter sunday so we
00:13 - made an easter egg hunt game in scratch
00:16 - so let's start the projects
00:19 - so when you play the game
00:20 - you use the i'm turning this music
00:23 - so you can either use a and d or the
00:26 - arrow keys to move like scroll around
00:29 - and you're trying to look for the eggs
00:30 - so you click on the eggs you see there's
00:31 - an egg right here so click on it
00:33 - so i'm just going to find all the eggs
00:35 - this one right there
00:38 - and also there's going to be 12 eggs so
00:41 - we already found three right now this
00:43 - one right here
00:45 - uh
00:46 - one right here one right here so
00:47 - basically it's just like an egg search
00:49 - game over here
00:51 - one on the scratch plus
00:52 - [Music]
00:55 - that's
00:56 - ten eggs okay we have two more there's
00:58 - one in the tree and
01:00 - one and the duck and then once you get
01:02 - all of them it says you win
01:03 - and then up here we have the timer so
01:05 - like that's how long it took you to get
01:06 - it and here we have the fastest time so
01:08 - that's my fastest time so far so
01:10 - basically this is like high score kind
01:13 - of
01:13 - okay now let's start a new project
01:16 - so
01:17 - let's get into a new project and we're
01:20 - gonna first let's
01:21 - rename this project let's name it
01:24 - egg
01:26 - uh easter egg hunt
01:28 - easter egg
01:30 - hunt
01:31 - okay
01:33 - all right so next let's get stuff from
01:34 - our library we're gonna delete scratch
01:36 - cat so it took us a really long time to
01:38 - get all these sprites so if you don't
01:40 - want to do it we have a cost a copy of
01:42 - this project down below you can remix it
01:45 - so you have a template to do so you
01:47 - don't have to like do all the code like
01:49 - i mean make all the costumes and get
01:51 - them all by yourself or you can download
01:53 - it if you want and draw if you would
01:54 - like but we have a copy in our
01:57 - description so you can download it to
01:59 - get a template of it so here we have our
02:01 - ground
02:02 - so it took us a long time to get all of
02:04 - these and make it look well here are the
02:06 - eggs
02:07 - this is the
02:08 - uh scrolling background
02:10 - and then here we have the you win
02:11 - sprites and the other ones we can just
02:13 - draw
02:14 - um so here we have the ground right so
02:16 - costumes
02:18 - so we have a lot of them so basically we
02:19 - just like use the acids from the ninja
02:21 - platformer to um do this
02:24 - and this is actually wrong i forgot to
02:27 - change it it's actually supposed to be
02:28 - 12 eggs
02:29 - so uh
02:30 - here we have all of our costumes so we
02:33 - use some other acids from the scratch
02:34 - library and some from the ninja platform
02:37 - here we have the eggs it's just
02:39 - we just drew a
02:40 - oval kind of
02:42 - and then we drew two rectangles and
02:44 - tried to reshape them to make it look
02:46 - like an easter egg kind of
02:47 - and then here we have the
02:49 - background scrolling okay let me like
02:51 - click on here yeah so it's kind of like
02:53 - that we just reshaped it we use the
02:55 - reshape tool you can like change the
02:57 - edges of the thing
02:58 - here the background scrolling this is
03:00 - also like acids from the ninja
03:01 - platformer so like this is like so you
03:04 - have like the
03:05 - background this is like the one all the
03:06 - way in the back
03:08 - um and then next you have the you win we
03:10 - use the cool text to make it look better
03:13 - okay so these are all our different
03:14 - sprites
03:16 - let's get into the code so
03:18 - first let's start out with the player so
03:20 - with the player we just have to paint
03:22 - the sprites and nothing just make it
03:24 - blank
03:25 - and we'll name it player
03:28 - i'm gonna actually make a second costume
03:30 - uh and then i'm going to draw a black
03:32 - circle in the middle to show you guys
03:34 - how it works you do not have to do this
03:36 - i'll show you how it works afterwards
03:38 - so we're going to hold down shift and
03:40 - get a circle let's make it bigger a
03:42 - little bit okay that's good enough
03:44 - okay so we have a 10 by 10 circle
03:46 - you don't have to do this step but i'm
03:48 - just going to show you how it works
03:49 - after we get the scrolling mechanics
03:51 - done
03:52 - so here
03:53 - we've
03:54 - okay
03:56 - now i'm using the second costume of the
03:57 - dot later i will delete this once i'm
03:59 - done showing
04:01 - now that i'm done explaining the
04:02 - costumes let's get into coding so i'm
04:04 - going to first create all the variables
04:06 - so
04:07 - so like to reduce mistakes and stuff
04:09 - like that so i'm going to create all the
04:11 - variables at first and we'll all use
04:13 - them later so
04:14 - for for the sprite we're in the players
04:17 - right right now right so we're gonna
04:18 - have to do
04:19 - uh change x
04:21 - change x
04:22 - so that's for this right only
04:24 - and then next we can do the start
04:28 - position
04:30 - x that's also for the spring only
04:31 - everything with the lower case first is
04:33 - for the spray only and then finally we
04:35 - have start
04:37 - position
04:39 - y
04:40 - that's for the sprite only as well and
04:42 - apparently 91.1 percent of you that are
04:45 - watching this video are not subscribed
04:47 - so please subscribe to our channel
04:49 - it really helped to support our channel
04:52 - and leave a like if you enjoyed watching
04:54 - this video and then next we have g
04:57 - scroll x g speed x
04:59 - and then with the mouse position so
05:01 - we're gonna get the g underscore
05:03 - uh scroll x this is for all sprites
05:07 - and then next we have the g
05:09 - and then we're going to get the speed x
05:11 - so this is the speed on the x axis
05:13 - and then next we have
05:14 - the
05:15 - g mouse positions this is the mouse
05:17 - position that's it so you know where to
05:18 - put everything
05:20 - g master position
05:23 - position
05:25 - okay and then we have a few more
05:26 - variables this is for the egg and all
05:28 - that stuff we can do that after we
05:30 - finish all the movement and coding so
05:33 - let me hide the variables
05:34 - okay so now let's one group if i clicked
05:36 - i'm gonna it's already zoomed in we're
05:38 - gonna go
05:40 - broadcast a message and wait we're gonna
05:42 - name it
05:43 - start level so we're gonna
05:45 - name it start level
05:48 - and then next we're gonna show it
05:51 - and then after that we're going to get
05:53 - a new custom block so we're going to
05:55 - make a new custom block and movement
05:58 - movement control
06:02 - so movement control click ok and then we
06:04 - have to define it so we're going to get
06:06 - an if else statement so we're going to
06:07 - get if
06:09 - so we're going to get if the so we're
06:11 - going to and
06:12 - so right here is the movement so we're
06:14 - going to put an or some people like
06:15 - using the wasd keys so that's when we're
06:17 - doing the or so we're going to do
06:19 - um if key right
06:21 - or the key
06:24 - d is being pressed
06:26 - so we have this
06:27 - that and so basically next we're going
06:30 - to make it have a maximum scroll limit
06:32 - so you can't scroll past a certain place
06:35 - so we're going to do
06:36 - um and the g scroll x is less than 3
06:39 - 360. so i got the 360 because in the
06:43 - background right
06:45 - i laid them all out and i found that the
06:47 - end is 3360 about
06:50 - approximately so
06:52 - um
06:53 - depending on how much costumes you have
06:55 - and how big they are this uh part will
06:58 - change for you but if you're using the
06:59 - same
07:00 - uh background and stuff then it will be
07:03 - 360. so
07:05 - so we're going to make the g scroll x
07:07 - less than that so you can't scroll past
07:09 - this limit
07:10 - scroll x and then next we're going to
07:12 - get a set
07:14 - speed x
07:15 - so this is the movements of the player
07:17 - so speed x we're going to set it to 10.
07:19 - and then next we're going to get another
07:21 - if-else statement so we're going to put
07:22 - it inside the else so this is the
07:24 - movement for the left and right
07:26 - left and a keys so we're going to do
07:29 - left key
07:31 - and then a he
07:33 - then next we're going to get we're going
07:35 - to set the speed
07:37 - x to negative 10
07:39 - p speed x to negative 10 so
07:41 - this is scrolling to the left so it'd be
07:43 - negative 10
07:44 - and then after that we're gonna make it
07:45 - if it's standing still then it will not
07:48 - move so we're gonna set the speed x
07:50 - right here to zero
07:52 - so this is if none of the keys are being
07:54 - pressed down
07:55 - so here we have this code right here
07:56 - this is the movement
07:58 - the start
07:59 - okay next after this we're going to get
08:01 - uh when i receive
08:03 - so when i receive start level we're
08:04 - going to start coding in here
08:06 - we're going to set this player to go to
08:08 - negative 200
08:10 - and then y 0 in the beginning and then
08:12 - we're going to set
08:14 - uh g scroll x to zero so in the
08:16 - beginning you're not scrolling so we're
08:18 - going to set it as zero and we're
08:19 - broadcast three different messages
08:21 - so we'll use them later so first we're
08:23 - gonna broadcast reset and wait
08:26 - broadcast another one we're going to
08:27 - name the setup
08:29 - setup and then next we're going to name
08:31 - one start game so broadcast start game
08:34 - so we're going to use the start game
08:35 - right now actually so start game
08:38 - so
08:39 - right here let me move this down when i
08:41 - receive start game
08:44 - whenever you start the game
08:46 - uh
08:47 - we are going to
08:48 - change the ghost effect by zero
08:52 - so we're setting the ghost effect to
08:53 - zero because we i want to show the dot
08:55 - later i'm gonna uh like delete it and or
08:58 - ghost it to 100 so we're just going to
09:00 - set it to zero for now
09:02 - uh change ghost effect
09:04 - by zero
09:07 - and then next we're going to show it
09:10 - show the dot and then after that we're
09:12 - going to get a forever loop so forever
09:15 - and then we're going to get a set
09:17 - um
09:18 - we have the variable i think start
09:20 - position x right so we're going to do
09:22 - forever
09:23 - set
09:24 - start position x to x position so it's
09:27 - going to set this variable to the x
09:28 - position of the dot
09:30 - and then we're going to broadcast three
09:32 - other messages we're going to broadcast
09:33 - a message
09:34 - i'm going to name it start all control
09:36 - so this is going to start the control
09:37 - the movement control off the player
09:40 - start
09:41 - all control
09:43 - and then next we're going to do another
09:44 - one so broadcast
09:46 - and rename it calculate scrolling
09:56 - so calculate scrolling and then one more
09:58 - we're going to name it move ground so
10:00 - this is moving the back room
10:02 - moving like the ground where like you
10:04 - can click on the eggs of course so we're
10:05 - going to move ground
10:08 - move around and then
10:10 - here we have our broadcast we're going
10:11 - to broadcast and i receive start control
10:14 - start all control we're going to
10:16 - call this block right here
10:18 - movement control
10:19 - and then we're gonna change the x by the
10:22 - g speed x so it will actually move
10:27 - to speed x
10:29 - so now i'm gonna play the project
10:32 - as you can see the dot is moving
10:34 - so it's going to be scrolling with the
10:35 - background
10:36 - okay
10:38 - next let's get on to the calculate
10:40 - scrolling
10:41 - so right here is we're going to when i
10:43 - receive
10:44 - maybe i'll do it here that's better
10:47 - when i receive
10:48 - calculate scrolling
10:50 - we're gonna set the change x
10:54 - uh to the x position minus the start
10:56 - position so we're gonna do
10:58 - the subtraction
11:01 - x position
11:02 - which would be set to the start position
11:05 - so we're going to do the exposition of
11:06 - this thing minus that
11:10 - so basically this script basically just
11:12 - points to wherever the dot is
11:14 - based on the zero so it's like it could
11:17 - be like right here it's going to be
11:19 - pointing towards the center so
11:21 - so x position minus
11:23 - the
11:25 - start position
11:27 - x start position x
11:30 - and then next we're going to get a
11:32 - uh
11:33 - if so if
11:35 - so if the x position is greater than
11:36 - zero then we're going to allow it to
11:38 - scroll so like as you can see in the
11:39 - demonstration if we scroll too far to
11:41 - the left uh you would have to uh you it
11:44 - would not scroll anymore
11:46 - uh so
11:47 - we're gonna do if
11:49 - exposition is uh
11:51 - we're gonna duplicate that exposition is
11:53 - greater than zero then we'll allow to
11:55 - scroll to the right so we're going to
11:57 - change the g scroll x
12:00 - g scroll x
12:02 - to
12:03 - by
12:03 - change x
12:06 - and then next we're going to change the
12:07 - x
12:09 - so this is uh going to change the x by
12:12 - zero minus the change x
12:15 - zero minus the change in x
12:21 - okay and then next we're going to get if
12:23 - then statement so if
12:25 - so we're gonna do if the x position is
12:28 - less than zero so and
12:30 - g square x is greater than zero so we're
12:33 - gonna do if
12:35 - x position
12:36 - less than zero
12:41 - and
12:42 - g scroll x is greater than zero
12:46 - so we're gonna get
12:47 - [Music]
12:49 - g scroll x is greater than zero so we're
12:51 - going to put the g scrolling right here
12:53 - zero then we're gonna change the g
12:55 - scroll x by change x
12:58 - so this is the scrolling we're gonna
12:59 - change this
13:00 - scroll x
13:03 - by the change in x oops i want to
13:05 - duplicate that oh i can't get it from
13:07 - here
13:08 - and then next we're going to change the
13:10 - x same thing right here and duplicate
13:12 - this
13:13 - so this just basically this script is
13:15 - just basically checking if the player is
13:18 - allowed to scroll
13:19 - so it's going to check
13:21 - okay
13:22 - so here we have all the code i think
13:25 - for
13:26 - the player
13:28 - save project
13:31 - so right here
13:32 - doesn't really do anything right it just
13:34 - moves so
13:35 - we have to get the uh
13:37 - like the background and stuff like that
13:39 - to start scrolling for this part to work
13:41 - so
13:43 - so as you can see if you open the
13:44 - variable g scroll x as you can see after
13:47 - you pass a certain point it will start
13:49 - scrolling so when you get it back to
13:51 - zero
13:52 - it will stop scrolling
13:54 - so basically it just stops there and now
13:56 - it just starts scrolling
13:58 - so that's how the scrolling works
14:00 - okay so we're finished with all the code
14:03 - in the player
14:04 - i think this should be good enough for
14:06 - our part one of this
14:08 - easter egg hunt tutorial for our scratch
14:11 - project so
