00:07 - welcome back guys it's
00:09 - kidscodingplayground here and today
00:10 - we're back for another video scratch and
00:12 - today we're making a very simple project
00:14 - called dice simulator
00:18 - so this project um you might want to
00:20 - code if you don't have a dice at home or
00:25 - if you don't have a dice at your
00:27 - disposal and you're playing a board game
00:29 - with your friends and then you don't
00:31 - have a dice right now so then you decide
00:33 - to get on your computer and go under
00:36 - virtual dice dice simulator and um
00:39 - i'm going to show you what this is so
00:41 - let's click on the green flag
00:44 - so just click on green flag you click on
00:46 - tara the person who's uh and this is
00:48 - really cool because it also calculates
00:50 - uh if you don't know math
00:53 - as your strongest subject you click
00:57 - and it goes by a six sided dice so
01:00 - um if you want to make a 12-sided dice
01:02 - you can if you want to uh it's pretty
01:05 - simple and uh click on this
01:08 - this is five right so and it says five
01:10 - and then if you're playing a game where
01:13 - you move stuff you move five places well
01:16 - so that's basically what we have for you
01:19 - today
01:20 - so i'm going to create a new project
01:23 - create a new project and um
01:26 - let's name this dice simulator this is a
01:29 - beginner project and
01:32 - um
01:33 - it's beginner so like if you're a
01:34 - beginner just learning scratch you can
01:36 - make this project
01:38 - so yeah delete the scratch cat we never
01:41 - need the scratch cat go to your backpack
01:44 - and get the dice so remember you guys
01:46 - you can go to my shared project and
01:47 - export the sprite
01:49 - and that's how you get the dice and dice
01:52 - one this die one
01:54 - die two
01:56 - and then they're gonna make dice so um
01:59 - go you can go to my project my profile
02:01 - account is gumball0098 and just get on
02:04 - my project and export these two sprites
02:08 - export and then you can download them
02:10 - and make them for your own project
02:12 - so let's put them in such a position
02:17 - and we have a good position set up we're
02:20 - gonna get a backdrop
02:23 - chalkboard you can do any uh backdrop
02:25 - you want but i'm just i'm just
02:27 - going with the chalkboard
02:30 - and i think i use terra i've never used
02:33 - terra we use like nico and all those
02:35 - people
02:36 - uh but we haven't used terra yet so it's
02:38 - interesting to use them so you put them
02:40 - over here
02:41 - and um we're gonna work on tara
02:45 - when the green flag is collect
02:48 - um it'll go to x wherever it is
02:52 - and then it'll switch costume
02:55 - to tara a because we're going to make
02:58 - him talk the thing
02:59 - uh so yeah costume a oh yeah delete
03:01 - costume d this thing is useless and um
03:06 - when this sprite is clicked
03:10 - it will
03:11 - set random one and random one is the
03:16 - first die
03:17 - so random one is the first die so random
03:20 - one
03:21 - nice one same thing so uh you set random
03:25 - one first dice
03:27 - to pick random one to six because if you
03:30 - know a dystic excites but if you're
03:32 - playing a game with 12 sided dice you
03:35 - can change this to 1 to 12.
03:37 - uh and now we have set random 2
03:42 - oh new variable
03:44 - random 2.
03:48 - two
03:50 - and we
03:51 - do that
03:54 - so the two dice and then we broadcast
03:56 - roll
03:57 - new message and wait
04:00 - and
04:01 - broadcast roll
04:05 - and wait and then say
04:09 - we'll have to go do the die one
04:12 - and die too first so
04:14 - when the green flag is clicked go to the
04:16 - position oh my gosh it's really small i
04:18 - have to zoom in
04:20 - and when i receive roll
04:24 - repeat 20 times
04:29 - uh they'll switch costume
04:35 - to
04:36 - pick random one to six because there's
04:38 - six costumes on this dice one to six and
04:42 - it'll switch costume
04:45 - to random one which is whatever the
04:48 - random uh
04:50 - roll you got
04:53 - now you drag that to die two
04:57 - and you have that we i just have to make
04:59 - some
05:00 - tweaks and then we're done with random
05:02 - two and when the green flag is clicked
05:04 - it'll go to the position it is already
05:06 - at
05:07 - and
05:09 - repeat 20 and instead switch costume to
05:11 - random two because that's the second
05:12 - dice
05:14 - i mean the second die
05:16 - and you go back to tara and we're going
05:18 - to finish up tara right now and
05:20 - when the sprite is clicked broadcast
05:22 - roll and wait and then you'll say
05:26 - whatever random one or two is
05:30 - because what is one say random one what
05:33 - is one
05:34 - uh oh oh yeah you have to have a plus
05:36 - a plus operator first
05:39 - so random one and then you have a random
05:43 - two so we have these two so they'll say
05:46 - whatever plus whatever of these two
05:50 - to make whatever
05:52 - you rolled
05:53 - and now we have to make them talk
05:57 - so when i receive
05:58 - roll
05:59 - let's switch costume
06:02 - to tara and
06:07 - repeat six times
06:10 - this is just an estimated number to make
06:13 - a good type of thing so repeat six
06:17 - we have three costumes so it'll repeat
06:19 - against the same costume twice so we
06:21 - have that and it'll be next costume
06:26 - and we have a wait 0.2 seconds
06:32 - and we are done with the code so um oh
06:35 - yeah one more thing we have to write
06:37 - dice simula in the back this is optional
06:39 - but you know makes it look better
06:43 - and convert to vector
06:45 - this thing
06:48 - use any color you want my favorite color
06:49 - is just blue so i decided to
06:52 - do that and handwriting is my favorite
06:54 - one
07:04 - that fits perfectly
07:06 - oh yes yes
07:12 - but there we go we just have to hide the
07:14 - variables and then we're good we're all
07:16 - set so we go here and
07:19 - variables and bam bam and now we have
07:21 - dice simulator
07:25 - and now let's test it out so green flag
07:27 - is quite terror a see the day simulator
07:30 - you see these two die click on him
07:33 - four
07:34 - and click on him
07:36 - and he does all these costumes to look
07:37 - like he's talking seven
07:40 - and that's ten so
07:42 - we have um this set
07:44 - so
07:46 - please like
07:48 - share subscribe and comment in the
07:50 - comment section below whatever games you
07:51 - want so we can make it and you can code
07:54 - it and
07:55 - uh see you guys next time
