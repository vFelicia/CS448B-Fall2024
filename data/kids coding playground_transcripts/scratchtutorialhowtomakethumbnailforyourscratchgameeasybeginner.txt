00:07 - so welcome back to another video on the
00:09 - channel kids coding playground
00:11 - today i'll be teaching you guys how to
00:12 - make a thumbnail so
00:15 - let me demo this game first to show you
00:17 - how it's like
00:18 - so as you can see i just use the apple
00:21 - game
00:22 - apple catcher game but i just added the
00:25 - thumbnail
00:28 - so let me just get 25 points really
00:30 - quick
00:31 - so just say you win wait three seconds
00:34 - then i'll show the thumbnail
00:36 - okay so for the thumbnail we want to get
00:39 - a one clicked in the beginning
00:42 - i'll just explain the code so in my case
00:45 - i want to hide these two variables in
00:46 - the beginning
00:47 - because i don't want it to show so it
00:49 - won't look that great
00:50 - if it shows so i wanted to go to the
00:53 - front layer because it's the thumbnail
00:55 - go to zero zero set ghost effect to zero
00:59 - so you can see it
01:00 - wait two seconds so as you can see i'll
01:04 - wait two seconds before switching to the
01:06 - play
01:07 - button screen and
01:10 - it'll repeat 10 seconds and change the
01:12 - ghost effect by 10
01:14 - so it'll fade away see looks cool
01:19 - so it broadcasts a message called
01:20 - thumbnail so it'll receive a
01:23 - message called thumbnail and forever it
01:25 - will go to the zero zero
01:26 - and go to the front layer so when you so
01:29 - when you and it'll set the ghost effect
01:30 - to 100
01:33 - so as you can see when you stop it it
01:35 - shows like that because i
01:36 - had to go to front layer when i received
01:39 - the thumbnail
01:40 - so if you want to do this you first you
01:42 - gotta make about another backdrop
01:44 - i just need to play and you just wrote
01:47 - click on the play button to start
01:50 - the play button
01:53 - so when it receives the thumbnail it
01:56 - will show
01:57 - which is the the green background with
02:00 - the click
02:01 - this one when it switches to this one
02:07 - next you want to um switch backdrop to
02:11 - play
02:11 - go to zero zero when it's when the flags
02:14 - clicked
02:15 - when the sprite is clicked it'll switch
02:17 - to the blue sky background
02:19 - hide and broadcast start so this one
02:22 - broadcasts the start one so
02:23 - as you can see when you press play we'll
02:25 - switch to blue sky
02:28 - the apple will receive start and run the
02:31 - code down here
02:33 - and the same goes for the bowl
02:37 - start the start message
02:41 - starts the apple code
02:44 - and the bowl code
02:48 - so from a thumbnail i just like
02:52 - copy pasted the backdrop for this one
02:55 - painted a new sprite pasted it here
02:59 - just wrote apple catcher on top put a
03:01 - couple apples
03:03 - and a bowl so that's pretty much sums up
