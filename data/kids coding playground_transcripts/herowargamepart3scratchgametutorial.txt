00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids cooking
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video in scratch and today we
00:12 - will be making the third part of the
00:14 - hero war game I've been making a series
00:17 - so we have the first part which is just
00:19 - a drawing of all the Sprites and we have
00:22 - the second part which is just sub coding
00:24 - for these Sprites we have just a few
00:27 - coding and then now we're starting on
00:29 - the third part of the
00:33 - series so we're going to go to our
00:35 - Sprite one and get started right into it
00:38 - go to Sprite one and then it's just a
00:40 - green screen just like
00:41 - that and then the code is when I receive
00:44 - start game we'll go to the middle x0 y0
00:48 - and then it'll go to the back layer so
00:52 - go
00:53 - to back
00:55 - layer and set it to Hidden mode but we
00:59 - can also set it here so so set ghost
01:01 - effect to
01:03 - 100 and then we also have a high to make
01:06 - sure it's completely hidden and not
01:08 - blocking anything then we have a
01:11 - forever if
01:14 - then the mouse is
01:17 - down if I can find it if then Mouse down
01:22 - um it will set we need new variable so X
01:26 - this will determine the location of the
01:28 - projectile X and Y so it will
01:33 - set X to Mouse
01:38 - X and then it will
01:42 - set our other one y to
01:46 - Mouse y just like that then we
01:53 - broadcast we need a new broadcast so get
01:55 - a broadcast in
01:56 - wait
01:58 - broadcast
02:01 - shoot
02:03 - Arrow so it'll broadcast shoot arrow and
02:05 - wait and when we mean Arrow we mean all
02:07 - types of projectiles that it will be
02:09 - shooting so now let's move on to the
02:14 - projectile so when I receive shoot
02:17 - Arrow it will
02:20 - show and it will go to the
02:25 - player then it'll Point towards the
02:28 - player
02:32 - and it will repeat until repeat
02:38 - until touching the
02:43 - edge it will move 30 steps until it
02:45 - touches the edge so let's get move 30
02:51 - steps and then so we do have this extra
02:54 - additional part of code which is we need
02:57 - if
02:57 - then so the fairy Queen since it's
03:00 - really weak it's base attack we made it
03:02 - so the attack I mean the arrow goes
03:05 - quicker so you can get more shoots in so
03:09 - if hero selected is equal to three which
03:11 - is the
03:12 - fairy then it will repeat
03:17 - until touching
03:22 - Edge uh it'll move 55 steps until it's
03:25 - touching the edge so this one's a lot
03:27 - quicker than the other two cuz the F
03:31 - Queen is kind of weak on this base
03:32 - attack and then we have a
03:35 - hide and it will go to the
03:43 - player so the projectile that we're
03:45 - shooting from the heroes is actually not
03:47 - a clone instead it's a single Sprite so
03:50 - you can't shoot a lot of arrows at once
03:52 - it's because the enemies are also clones
03:55 - and we do not want to have like two
03:58 - clones together which it won't work so
04:02 - let's just add this extra part of code
04:04 - when the green flag is clicked
04:08 - hide so
04:11 - forever if
04:15 - then uh hero select is equal to one so
04:18 - take the equal
04:20 - sign so if hero select is equal to one
04:23 - which is the elf Warrior then it will
04:25 - switch costume to costume one which is
04:28 - the first
04:30 - costume as you can see over which is the
04:32 - arrow so and then we just duplicate this
04:37 - if you select is equal to two and we
04:39 - switch costume to costume two and if
04:42 - hero selected is equal to three it'll
04:45 - switch cost tube to cost tube
04:48 - 3 so now let's move on to the first
04:51 - ability the second ability and the third
04:55 - [Music]
04:56 - ability so the first ability on the
04:59 - Green flag is clicked it will
05:01 - hide and it'll we need a new uh variable
05:06 - which is timer
05:10 - first and this timer first is the first
05:13 - ability timer which will give you um the
05:17 - the powerups after a certain allotted
05:19 - time so it will set timer first to zero
05:22 - so it's always zero cuz you haven't
05:24 - started the game yet and it'll set a new
05:27 - variable power up one these are really
05:31 - important uh variables so power up one
05:35 - and also set the power up one to zero
05:36 - because you have zero power
05:38 - up and it will hide the variable power
05:41 - up
05:43 - one then let's get started on this part
05:48 - so when I receive this will determine
05:50 - when you get each of the uh powerups so
05:54 - when I receive the start game it will
05:57 - show the
05:58 - variable
06:01 - power up one and it will
06:06 - set timer first to
06:10 - zero you also
06:14 - forever and we need this so wait 1
06:16 - second forever for wait one second it
06:19 - will change timer
06:22 - first by one so it'll add one it'll
06:26 - change the timer timer will go up and up
06:28 - and up and then that's when it
06:29 - determines when you get a power up you
06:32 - need if
06:33 - then so you'll get one power up if then
06:37 - timer
06:38 - first is equal to 8 so after 8 seconds
06:43 - because after one sec wait 1 second
06:44 - you'll change the timer first then it
06:46 - will
06:48 - change the power up one by one and
06:51 - that's how you get one and then it'll
06:53 - set the timer first back to zero so you
06:55 - can restart the timer counting up to
06:57 - eight and then until you get another
06:58 - power up that's how the power up works
07:01 - and then now we have each of the power
07:02 - up parts so when space key we get this
07:07 - one but we change it to one cuz to
07:09 - activate the first ability it's the key
07:12 - one and you need a if
07:15 - then hero selected is equal to one so
07:18 - each of them have different powers so
07:20 - this one's just going to be the elf
07:22 - order so hero selected equal to one then
07:26 - if then take it if then right here if
07:30 - then get a greater
07:32 - sign if then the power up one so if you
07:35 - have is greater than zero so if you have
07:37 - more than one uh more than zero powerups
07:40 - you can use them then it'll switch the
07:43 - costume the costume
07:46 - one cuz that's the first ability so it's
07:49 - this
07:50 - one and then it will
07:55 - show and then now it will
07:57 - show and then then it'll go to the
08:03 - player player and It'll point
08:07 - towards Mouse
08:11 - pointer and it will repeat until so the
08:13 - first stability for the elf is the
08:14 - spectral Arrow which goes through all
08:17 - the enemies and does a huge amount of
08:19 - damage so we'll repeat until touching
08:22 - the
08:24 - edge and it will move 30 steps until
08:28 - it's touching The
08:31 - Edge and then now it will
08:35 - hide right there and then it'll go back
08:38 - to the player after it touches the
08:41 - edge go to the
08:43 - player and then it'll change the power
08:45 - up one by minus one so change power up
08:49 - one by minus one cuz you used one power
08:54 - up
08:56 - so I'm sorry but it's actually if then
08:59 - statement so we go to if then else and
09:02 - then we just take out this if then sorry
09:04 - and then we put this power up equals 1
09:08 - and we put this all this code back into
09:10 - here and then just just like that we put
09:12 - it back into here and then we have else
09:14 - right
09:15 - here and it will broadcast a new message
09:20 - no item to
09:27 - use no item to
09:31 - so that's just the first ability it'll
09:32 - just go through all the enemies just
09:33 - like
09:34 - that and now and now will'll code the
09:38 - second one so if then hero selected is
09:43 - equal to two which is the
09:47 - Mage equal to two then it will so you
09:51 - need another if then else and since this
09:53 - one's a different power up then we'll
09:55 - just code it like this so we take if
09:57 - then else then we take this if the power
10:01 - up one is greater than
10:03 - zero then it will switch costume to the
10:07 - costume
10:09 - 2 it will
10:12 - show it'll go to the
10:17 - player go to
10:19 - player and It'll point
10:21 - towards the mouse
10:23 - pointer and it will repeat until so we
10:26 - need to repeat
10:27 - until repeat
10:30 - until touching
10:34 - Edge after that it'll move 40 steps
10:37 - until the edge so this one goes a little
10:38 - bit quicker for the second
10:42 - ability for the first ability for the
10:44 - second
10:45 - person and then after that it will
10:50 - hide it will go to the
10:52 - player go back to the player go to
10:57 - player and it will change
11:00 - change power up
11:04 - one by minus
11:10 - one else it will broadcast this no item
11:14 - to use
11:16 - broadcast and now let's code the third
11:19 - ability so third ability is completely
11:22 - different it's not a projectile instead
11:23 - it heals the fairy queen so we have if
11:27 - then
11:30 - hero selected is equal to three
11:33 - so hero selected is equal to
11:38 - three and we'll take this if then else
11:42 - and then we'll take this if power up one
11:44 - is greater than zero so and then move it
11:46 - down here so if power up one is greater
11:49 - than zero then it will go to the front
11:52 - [Music]
11:54 - layer it switch costume to costume
11:57 - three
12:00 - and then it will
12:03 - show and it'll go to the
12:08 - player then it will set the lives back
12:13 - to 850 so heal was the fairy queen all
12:15 - the way back up that's why the fairy
12:18 - queen is good so set lives to
12:20 - 850 it'll
12:23 - wait 6
12:26 - seconds and then it'll hide
12:30 - then it will change power up by minus
12:35 - one and then it will wait one
12:40 - second then it will
12:43 - broadcast no item to use again so that's
12:47 - basically the
12:49 - first uh ability it's a huge hunk of
12:53 - code just like
12:55 - that okay so now let's move on to the
12:57 - second ability
12:59 - so the second ability is kind of similar
13:02 - to the first ability so let's just
13:05 - um move some of
13:08 - the uh some of the code into the second
13:11 - one let's just move that we just need to
13:14 - do some quick
13:15 - changes to these pieces of
13:21 - code okay when the green flag is
13:24 - clicked it will
13:26 - hide and then it'll set timer second so
13:29 - this is a different one timer
13:36 - second it will set the timer
13:38 - second to zero so it's just like the
13:41 - timer first but the second ability and
13:43 - then it'll
13:45 - set the power up to which we need make
13:49 - that to power up
13:51 - [Music]
13:52 - two and it'll set the power up two to
13:55 - also zero and it'll hide the variable
13:58 - power up two
14:01 - then when we start the game it will show
14:04 - the variable power up two it will set
14:07 - timer
14:08 - second to zero and Forever Wait 1 second
14:12 - change timer second by
14:15 - one and then if timer second so we if
14:20 - timer second is equal to 12 so after 12
14:23 - seconds it will change timer or not
14:26 - timer second power up two by one then
14:29 - it'll set timer
14:31 - second back to
14:33 - zero so zo in that yeah and then now
14:38 - let's move on so when two keys
14:41 - pressed which is to activate the second
14:43 - ability if then hero select is equal to
14:46 - one and if power up is greater than
14:50 - zero it'll set size to
14:57 - 45% and then it will switch to costume
15:01 - to costume one which is the first one
15:03 - which is the death arrow and we have the
15:04 - lightning and then we have the fairy
15:07 - queen teleport so have that switch
15:09 - costume to costume one show it will go
15:11 - to the player Point towards the mass
15:13 - pointer and then it'll repeat until
15:14 - touching Edge but it'll move 50 steps
15:16 - instead and this is a one shot arrow and
15:18 - it'll hide go back to player and then
15:20 - change power up two by minus one L so
15:25 - broadcast no item to use so it's just
15:26 - easy to change from here and then if the
15:29 - hero is equal to two it's also a
15:31 - projectile so if the power up
15:35 - two is greater than
15:37 - zero it
15:39 - will set the size to
15:43 - 45% it'll switch costume to lightning
15:46 - which is the second one it will show
15:49 - it'll go to the player Point towards the
15:50 - mouse pointer it'll repe until touching
15:52 - the edge but it'll move
15:55 - 25 so Lightning goes a little bit slower
15:57 - and it'll hide go to player and then
15:59 - change power up to by minus one and
16:02 - it'll broadcast no have to use and now
16:04 - we're already on the third one the third
16:05 - one's different though cuz it's also a
16:08 - projectile so let's take this out so it
16:12 - will go to
16:15 - player go to player player player yeah
16:19 - it'll go to the player It'll point
16:21 - towards Mouse
16:23 - pointer it will
16:27 - show there switch costume to costume 2
16:31 - which is the fairy one even though
16:33 - because Lightning's in the middle switch
16:35 - costume to costume two and it will Glide
16:39 - so take this
16:41 - Glide 75 seconds to Oh wrong one sorry
16:46 - that's this one with the X and Y so
16:51 - Glide 75
16:53 - seconds to X Mouse
16:57 - X
16:59 - and then Mouse
17:01 - Y and then it will change the power
17:05 - up
17:07 - 2 by minus
17:11 - one and then it
17:14 - broadcast Fairy Escape and this is when
17:17 - the fairy
17:18 - teleports to wherever the arrow lands so
17:21 - Fairy
17:24 - Escape and it will
17:26 - hide it does a lot of damage too and
17:29 - it'll
17:31 - broadcast yeah so all of this goes here
17:34 - it goes in the if then place and then in
17:36 - the lse it's going to be broadcast no
17:39 - item to you so sorry for that it's just
17:42 - you move it back up there and then you
17:44 - have the no item to use in the
17:47 - house so yeah so this is the second
17:50 - ability it's a big
17:52 - hunk and then now let's go back to the
17:54 - player and let's code the Fairy Escape
17:57 - so when I receive receive Fairy
17:59 - Escape it will go to x we need this one
18:05 - so go to x get a plus sign so put two
18:09 - plus signs just like that it will go to
18:12 - x position so use the tricky block so
18:16 - it's this one the backdrop number of
18:18 - stage it's this tricky one if you change
18:20 - the second one you have to go to Second
18:24 - ability so go to exp position a second
18:27 - ability Plus
18:29 - 10 so it lands on the place we want it
18:31 - to and then duplicate this it
18:36 - will and then it's y position of second
18:40 - position a second ability and then it'll
18:43 - plus
18:46 - 40 then we will Point towards Mouse
18:49 - [Music]
18:51 - pointer switch costume to costume 4
18:56 - which is the teleport beam
18:59 - it'll wait
19:02 - 1.2 seconds and it'll switch
19:07 - costume back to costume
19:10 - three and that's what we have here and
19:13 - that's the Fairy Escape Code so now
19:16 - let's work on the third ability so third
19:19 - ability we just take what's from the
19:20 - second ability and change it a little
19:23 - bit so let's just move it here let's
19:27 - move it here
19:29 - here move it here so we have everything
19:32 - in the third
19:34 - ability and then you just have to make
19:37 - some changes of course so in the green F
19:39 - click it will hide and it will set timer
19:42 - third so we do have another timer we'll
19:46 - set timer
19:49 - third it will set timer third to
19:54 - zero and then it will set power up three
19:57 - we also power up
20:01 - three set the power up three to zero as
20:06 - well and then we also can't put two at
20:09 - once so we have to set a new variable in
20:12 - progress
20:14 - sorry set in
20:19 - proess to zero and also hide the
20:23 - variable power up
20:25 - three okay and we'll set the in progress
20:28 - to zero and it'll hide the variable
20:30 - power up
20:31 - three so when I receive start game it'll
20:35 - show the variable power up
20:37 - three it will set the timer
20:40 - third to zero and then forever it'll
20:44 - wait 1 second it would change timer
20:48 - third by one and then this is every 30
20:52 - seconds you get the third ability so we
20:55 - need to change this to timer third to so
20:57 - if timer third is equal to 30 then it'll
20:59 - change timer 3 by
21:05 - 1 no I mean power up three sorry power
21:08 - up three by one and then it will set
21:11 - timer third back to zero so this should
21:14 - be all
21:16 - three and then when the key three is
21:20 - pressed if it was set in
21:24 - progress to zero all the way up
21:27 - here
21:30 - so
21:32 - Z okay so and then so let's get started
21:35 - in this part so if then hero select is
21:37 - equal to one
21:40 - then we actually have it'll switch the
21:42 - costume to Griffin a it will set the
21:47 - size to 65% so it's not that big when it
21:50 - comes down and it will point in
21:54 - Direction
21:57 - 90
22:01 - and then so we have this if power up
22:05 - three is greater than one zero okay we
22:09 - also have to change the second ability
22:11 - so we actually need to change this to
22:13 - two so this is should all be two so this
22:15 - is actually power up two is greater than
22:16 - zero this also power up two and then we
22:19 - also need to change this to power up
22:21 - two so this should all be
22:25 - two and so over here we have power of
22:28 - three is greater than zero then it
22:32 - will
22:37 - change it will change power up
22:41 - three by minus
22:46 - one and then we have an in progress
22:48 - thing so you can't use two at one time
22:51 - so we have if then statement just like
22:53 - that so if
22:55 - then we have it here over here here if
22:58 - then in progress is equal to
23:02 - zero then it will
23:08 - wait1
23:09 - seconds and it'll set the in progress to
23:12 - one so that that shows it is in
23:19 - progress and then it will go to you have
23:22 - a position for this it we go
23:25 - to I put 213
23:28 - y 144 so it's on the right side and it
23:31 - will come down like that and it
23:33 - will so let's just take this out real
23:35 - quick it will
23:38 - show and it will Glide 1
23:43 - second to X2 2492 so right
23:48 - here and we'll have this code right here
23:51 - so it will repeat so under the
23:54 - Glide it'll repeat two times
23:59 - it will switch costume to Griffin
24:03 - a it will wait 4
24:09 - seconds and then you duplicate this put
24:13 - it under and it switch costume to
24:15 - Griffin
24:16 - B and then you duplicate it again switch
24:19 - costume to Griffin
24:22 - C and then we do have a broadcast that
24:25 - goes with this so it'll broadcast right
24:28 - under the repeat to it'll broadcast a
24:31 - new message bomb this but it explodes
24:34 - everyone on the map and then after that
24:38 - you'll switch the costume to Griffin
24:42 - B
24:44 - and it will Glide one second so it'll
24:48 - Glide away Glide one second to I have a
24:52 - position for this
24:55 - negative 183
24:59 - y
25:00 - 157 so it's just up
25:03 - here then it'll
25:08 - hide and it'll set in progress to zero
25:13 - in
25:14 - progress to zero so that's when you can
25:17 - use it again since it's zero
25:19 - now and then we have a else and then
25:21 - broadcast no item to use okay and now
25:24 - let's continue working so if hero select
25:26 - is equal to two and it'll do if power
25:30 - up is power up three is greater than
25:34 - zero then it
25:37 - will let's just take this all out it
25:40 - will change power up three by minus
25:44 - one and then we have this whole in
25:46 - progress part so we need if
25:49 - then if then in
25:53 - progress is equal to zero which means
25:55 - it's not being used at this moment so so
25:57 - you can use it in progress is equal to
26:01 - zero then it will wait .1
26:08 - second wait one second and it
26:11 - will set in
26:14 - progress to
26:19 - one after that it will have point in
26:25 - Direction 90
26:28 - then it'll switch costume to The
26:29 - Apprentice so when it say Apprentice it
26:32 - will shoot these Apprentice it will
26:35 - shoot these stars to damage
26:37 - enemies and then after that it'll set
26:40 - size to 20% so it's a pretty small
26:42 - turret set size
26:47 - 20% Then it will set rotation style left
26:50 - right so it doesn't like flip over all
26:52 - over the place so right then it will go
26:57 - to x I do have a position for this x
27:03 - 199 or at this point just write 200 go
27:05 - to
27:06 - X200 y
27:11 - 9 and then it will
27:16 - show then it'll repeat 15 times so it'll
27:19 - shoot 15 turret balls at the enemy
27:22 - repeat 15 times let's just throw this
27:24 - all way it will broadcast
27:28 - shoot apprentices star so we will get
27:31 - into the apprentices
27:35 - star and all the other parts the uh bomb
27:40 - and all that stuff and we'll code that
27:42 - next part so repeat 15 times and it'll
27:45 - broadcast shoot a pares star right under
27:47 - the
27:47 - show then it will
27:51 - hide just like that and it will
27:56 - set
27:58 - in
28:01 - progress back to zero so you can use it
28:05 - again so now let's work on the third
28:07 - ability for uh for the third hero so if
28:10 - hero select is equal to
28:12 - three uh you need if power up
28:17 - three is greater than
28:20 - zero then it will change so we need
28:23 - change change power up three
28:29 - by minus
28:33 - one then you need this if then so if
28:38 - then here sorry up here if then in
28:45 - progress is equal to zero so in progress
28:49 - is equal to
28:50 - zero then it will wait 0.1
28:56 - seconds
28:58 - it
28:59 - will set in progress to
29:05 - one then it will go
29:08 - to x I do have a position for this
29:15 - x19
29:17 - -10 and I'll point in Direction
29:21 - 90 we will switch costume to the
29:23 - defender chip let's just delete all this
29:26 - actually switch costume to Defender chip
29:30 - it will set size to 100% so large Shield
29:33 - that blocks and it will
29:37 - show then it will Glide 1 second to we
29:42 - do have a position for this
29:45 - -60 y 9
29:50 - 9 and after that it'll wait 10 seconds
29:52 - over there and teleport people back it
29:57 - will
30:00 - hide and it will set in
30:06 - progress back to
30:08 - zero okay and now we will have when
30:13 - key oh sorry when the key three
30:20 - pressed then if
30:24 - then if then we need equal
30:28 - sign so if then in progress is equal to
30:34 - one then it will broadcast in progress
30:38 - and this is when you have like the
30:39 - weight oh this thing's in
30:41 - progress
30:44 - thing okay so let's look over all the
30:48 - code and I'll show you the game okay so
30:50 - I looked at the game and it's actually
30:52 - so you go to the projectile I messed up
30:54 - here so when I receive shoot Arrow it's
30:57 - not Point towards player it's Point
30:59 - towards M pointer so sorry about that
31:01 - that's the only thing that doesn't seem
31:03 - to be working but I just change it now
31:06 - so let's just go hide all the variables
31:08 - so clear it up a little bit so let's
31:10 - hide all
31:12 - this
31:13 - progress
31:15 - okay let's take a look so we have the
31:18 - three
31:19 - Heroes shows you the lives okay so we
31:23 - have the elf Warrior okay it does seem
31:24 - to be
31:25 - shooting like
31:28 - that and then let's just wait until we
31:30 - get more power ups let's hide let's show
31:33 - Power up one again where is Power one
31:37 - there it
31:40 - is okay so I didn't put this in the a
31:44 - part earlier so let's add it over here
31:47 - so it will set the lives so if hero s is
31:51 - equal to one it set lives to
31:54 - 1,200 I remember I added it but I don't
31:56 - know maybe it didn't save so and then
31:59 - it'll set the lives to
32:03 - 1,000 and then it'll set the lives to
32:06 - 850 so that's the third one the second
32:09 - one and the first
32:11 - one so since I didn't add that in the
32:13 - last part just add it over here it'll
32:15 - set the lives in the player it'll set
32:17 - the lives 1,200
32:19 - 1,850 so let's choose the hero that we
32:23 - want so let's see if it
32:26 - works I'll just uh I'll pause the video
32:29 - and then I'll come back after when I get
32:31 - a few power
32:32 - ups okay so we have powerups for all of
32:35 - them so let's see if it works projectile
32:36 - seems to be working
32:38 - um the normal power up one you see that
32:41 - works and then we have the death arrow
32:44 - and then we have the Griffin so it seems
32:46 - to be
32:47 - working and it should work for all the
32:49 - other ones as well so anyway please like
