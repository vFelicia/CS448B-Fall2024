00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so
00:08 - welcome back guys to another video on
00:10 - kids coding playground
00:11 - today we'll be doing a two-player
00:13 - shootout game
00:14 - so in this uh game the objective is to
00:17 - uh shoot at each other using
00:19 - the spaceship to uh you can use the
00:21 - spaceship to move around
00:22 - so player one you use wasd and spacebar
00:25 - to shoot
00:26 - player two use arrow keys and zero the
00:29 - button the key zero to shoot
00:31 - and then uh these some alien bugs will
00:33 - fly
00:34 - around and try to hit uh hit the
00:36 - spaceships
00:37 - and you lose hp when they hit you and
00:40 - if your opponent hits you as well you
00:42 - also lose hp on your shield
00:44 - and when your shield is destroyed um you
00:47 - will only have the spaceship left
00:49 - and you'll be a one shot and each side
00:52 - gets 2000 hp for the shield
00:54 - and um the shields will rotate
00:58 - so in such a way so that um if you are
01:01 - lucky enough you can shoot a bullet
01:02 - through both of the
01:04 - shields and you can hit your opponent
01:07 - so in this video we'll be learning these
01:10 - following concepts
01:11 - variables repeat until loops
01:14 - broadcasting messages
01:16 - touching other sprites controlling
01:18 - sprites with
01:19 - keys and then we'll use custom blocks so
01:22 - without further ado let's get to the
01:24 - project so let's make it full screen
01:27 - oops so my brother is here to play with
01:31 - me
01:32 - he'll be player one which is the blue
01:34 - one i'll be playing which is the red one
01:36 - and the player one uses wasd and
01:38 - spacebar to shoot
01:39 - and player two uses arrow keys and zero
01:41 - to shoot
01:42 - ready set go
01:48 - [Music]
01:49 - oh i shot through i shot through it see
01:52 - i killed i i beat my brother
01:54 - because i shot through you want to do it
01:55 - one more time sure
01:57 - and there's music oh you shot through me
01:59 - oh my god
02:00 - okay let's try one time this is too fast
02:07 - and you can shoot the aliens as well
02:10 - [Music]
02:12 - you shot through me okay so that's
02:15 - pretty much the game
02:16 - so if you want to make the game a bit
02:18 - harder you can make the second shield
02:19 - rotate faster
02:21 - and also the raw we got this game
02:23 - inspired by the rock blaster game
02:26 - so um which has been doing really well
02:28 - lately
02:29 - so if you want to check that out you can
02:31 - check it out in the description below
02:33 - or from our channel so without further
02:35 - ado let's start a new project
02:38 - start a new project
02:43 - so first we want to create some
02:44 - variables so
02:46 - we'll make three global variables and
02:48 - one um for this sprite only variable but
02:51 - we'll
02:51 - worry about the for this sprite only
02:53 - variable later we'll just need to make
02:55 - three variables so um let's make
02:59 - one player oops i
03:02 - caps lock on player one
03:06 - shield so for all sprites click
03:09 - ok and we need to make another variable
03:12 - called player 2 shield
03:18 - player two shield and one more
03:21 - called alien set
03:26 - for player set for player one
03:33 - we do not need another one for player 2
03:35 - since we're using if else statements
03:38 - but yeah that's all the variables you'll
03:40 - need for now
03:42 - and i'm just going to get a backdrop
03:44 - real quick from the sprite library
03:47 - i mean backdrop library so let me get
03:50 - the nebula one this one's the one i've
03:52 - been using
03:55 - you of course you can pick anything else
03:57 - and i'll add the sound later
03:59 - but just right now i'll just have the
04:01 - backdrop and
04:02 - make sure um let's get some sprites real
04:05 - quick delete your scratch tab we will
04:07 - not need that
04:08 - and um they do not have this um
04:11 - spaceship in 3.0 anymore it's from 2.0
04:15 - um so i just got them from 2.0
04:19 - and you notice how i rotate it to the
04:21 - side so in the sprite you want to rotate
04:24 - it to the side
04:25 - and this one should be point
04:28 - 90 in the direction of 90 so it'll be
04:30 - pointing to the right side
04:32 - and this one should be pointing to
04:33 - negative 90 so i'll be pointing to the
04:35 - left side
04:36 - i'm also going to get this ladybug
04:39 - sprite i'm not sure if they happen 3.0
04:42 - but uh you can just get something i
04:44 - think it's
04:45 - i think it is but i'm not really sure
04:47 - but you can just get anything you want
04:49 - and i notice how i note rotated it as
04:52 - well because
04:53 - these spaceships are rotated as well so
04:56 - if these bishops are rotated let's also
04:58 - rotate
04:58 - the ladybug so it'll be pointing to the
05:00 - spaceship
05:02 - and i also colored their eyes red um
05:06 - you can do that if you want it's
05:08 - optional just to make the ladybugs look
05:10 - a little bit better
05:12 - and i have the lasers
05:15 - these are for the player one and player
05:17 - two's lasers
05:18 - so all i did was just get the button
05:20 - sprite from the
05:22 - sprite library and then i have the
05:24 - shields
05:25 - so for the shields i just drew a uh
05:28 - i just drew like a circle so i'm going
05:31 - to show you guys
05:32 - how to draw the shields for the
05:34 - spaceships
05:36 - so i'm just going to select the color so
05:39 - i'm
05:39 - the color was 54 saturation 100 and
05:43 - brightness 76
05:45 - and the outline is 10. so what you want
05:48 - to do
05:48 - is get the circle tool and then you want
05:51 - to draw a circle like that
05:52 - hold down shift key so then you get a
05:54 - perfect circle and then you just
05:56 - center your sprite and then you use the
05:58 - erase tool
06:00 - right here and then you can just erase
06:02 - how ever much you want
06:03 - like maybe that much maybe a little bit
06:06 - more
06:07 - select that like that
06:10 - yeah something like that you can draw it
06:13 - like that
06:13 - so that's how you draw the shield for
06:17 - the game so first we will work
06:20 - on the alien remember told you to turn
06:23 - it
06:24 - uh for player one actually let's work on
06:26 - player players first
06:28 - can work in the alien later so let me
06:31 - toggle this backpack so when flank
06:33 - clicks
06:36 - i want to set my uh player one
06:39 - to be at negative 160
06:42 - at y0 so it'll be somewhere like right
06:45 - here
06:47 - like right here near the end of the
06:50 - screen
06:50 - and then i want to set the rotation to
06:53 - left and right
06:54 - so then it won't flip upside down or you
06:56 - can just select it right here
06:58 - the default is this just click this
07:01 - it'll
07:01 - be only to left and right and i want to
07:05 - set the
07:05 - player shield to 2000 player 1 shield
07:10 - 2 000 i mean you can do any as much
07:13 - health as you want or as little health
07:14 - as you want
07:15 - it's up to you guys and let's get a
07:18 - forever loop
07:20 - forever point in direction of 90
07:24 - so always face the right side we always
07:26 - want this to face the right side
07:28 - and if on edge bounce so then they can't
07:30 - go inside
07:31 - behind the screen i guess um
07:34 - and for the player one i'm doing it wasd
07:38 - so if
07:42 - the key d is clicked
07:47 - p d is clicked pressed that we can
07:50 - change the x by 10
07:53 - let's change the x by 10 and
07:57 - let's just duplicate this if
08:00 - the key is a press
08:04 - then we want to change the x by negative
08:06 - 10. so we'll go to the left side
08:09 - and let's duplicate both of these
08:14 - if the key w is clicked
08:17 - it's pressed that we can change the y by
08:19 - 10 so it'll go up
08:23 - and if the key s is clicked
08:28 - then we can make the y change the y
08:32 - by negative 10.
08:36 - so yeah so this is the
08:39 - um movement code for the player
08:42 - so as you can see it moves around the
08:44 - shield has not
08:45 - gone to the player yet because we have
08:47 - not done the code for that but now you
08:49 - can have simple movement for the player
08:51 - and when it's touching this edge of the
08:53 - screen it cannot
08:54 - or just bounce off so that's what we
08:57 - have for the player for now
09:00 - and we will need uh
09:04 - the code for the laser let's go to the
09:05 - laser when flag clicked
09:09 - get a forever loop if
09:12 - the key space is pressed because this is
09:14 - for player one
09:16 - if you like you can name this to player
09:17 - one laser or something like that so you
09:20 - won't get confused
09:21 - and if the space bar is pressed
09:25 - then i'll create a clone of myself
09:28 - uh wait until not key space is pressed
09:31 - so this is to prevent them from spamming
09:33 - the uh space bar
09:36 - as you can see um so
09:40 - if you have this wait until not space is
09:43 - clicked
09:44 - so wait until not
09:47 - space key is pressed
09:53 - and i need to mention one more thing so
09:56 - if you want these sprites
09:57 - and you don't want to like draw them
09:59 - because it's a bit hard to do
10:00 - i guess you can go to our google drive
10:02 - in the link in the description
10:04 - to download them um and i've seen a lot
10:07 - of people
10:08 - uh trying to request for access using
10:10 - their school accounts
10:11 - your school accounts will not work since
10:13 - it's for school so you have to use your
10:15 - own personal
10:16 - google account so after the laser we
10:20 - need to
10:20 - when it's created a clone we have to
10:22 - when i start us clone
10:25 - we want to go to player one
10:28 - go to the player one go
10:32 - to player one and we want to point
10:35 - point in the direction of the direction
10:37 - of player one so point and direction
10:40 - of the direction of player one
10:43 - um direction pretty sure it's this one
10:50 - direction wait it's not this one
10:54 - this one right no this is distance
10:59 - sorry about that it's actually this one
11:00 - you have to select this one first
11:03 - so now you have direction like that so
11:05 - you just when you want to find the
11:07 - player you have to always select this
11:08 - one first
11:10 - so put that right there let's move 50
11:13 - steps
11:14 - to like move it to the front i guess so
11:17 - move
11:17 - 50 cent steps
11:21 - and then we want to show
11:29 - so next we want to get a repeat until
11:31 - loop let's go here gonna repeat
11:33 - until so if it's touching
11:37 - since this is in the player ones
11:39 - perspective perspective
11:41 - we have to do everything for player two
11:44 - so you're just going to drag two or
11:46 - statements right here
11:48 - so repeat until touching edge
11:52 - touching edge
11:55 - touching edge or touching
12:00 - uh player two shield one
12:03 - player two shield one is the first big
12:06 - shield
12:06 - or it's touching oops or it's touching
12:10 - the player 2 shield 2 which is a small
12:12 - shield for player 2.
12:16 - then we can move 10 steps so move to it
12:19 - move 10 steps and if
12:24 - and then this is if touching
12:27 - the player 2 shield 1
12:30 - or the player 2 shield 2. let me just
12:34 - duplicate this actually so i don't have
12:37 - to re
12:37 - do it if it's touching that then we can
12:40 - broadcast the message
12:42 - we can call broadcast and wait a message
12:45 - called player 2 got hit
12:52 - player 2
12:55 - got hit player 2 got hit
12:58 - i'm just going to duplicate this if it's
13:02 - touching player 2
13:03 - so as i mentioned earlier once you
13:05 - destroy their shield
13:07 - you if they're one shot so if you touch
13:09 - them then they're dead
13:11 - if touching player two
13:14 - if touching player two we can broadcast
13:16 - another message
13:18 - call it player player to
13:21 - dead and then we can delete this clone
13:26 - and we have to add and delete this clone
13:27 - right here
13:29 - right here we're gonna have to add that
13:31 - and then we have to add one at the end
13:32 - like that so this is for shooting
13:37 - so as you can see now you can shoot
13:40 - you can move around and you can shoot
13:43 - and
13:43 - remember i told you earlier this thing
13:45 - is to prevent them from spamming if you
13:47 - take that out
13:48 - you can just spam like this which you do
13:50 - not want
13:51 - and that's not that's not very good so
13:54 - let's so remember to put this in
13:58 - and and then if you want um
14:01 - for the uh when i received player two
14:04 - when i received player two got hit
14:06 - which is from here to got hit that we
14:09 - can change the player to shield by
14:11 - five player two shield by negative five
14:18 - and for the other laser it's pretty much
14:20 - the same thing
14:21 - so i'm just gonna drag and drop this
14:23 - into the player two
14:26 - so just drag and drop this into the
14:28 - player two
14:30 - except you have to change the x and y
14:32 - position and all that stuff
14:34 - so instead of negative 160 i'm gonna do
14:37 - 160 so it'll
14:38 - appear on the right side of the screen
14:40 - instead of player one shield you have to
14:42 - set the player to shield
14:46 - so so let's just go instead of point
14:49 - direction of 90 we want to go negative
14:51 - 90
14:52 - so point to the left side
14:55 - and then um right here instead of d we
14:58 - want to do right arrow kit
14:59 - clicked because it's the player a 2
15:02 - so if right arrow is pressed instead of
15:04 - a let's do left arrows pressed
15:07 - instead of w while the up arrow is
15:09 - pressed and instead of
15:10 - s we'll do down arrows press
15:14 - and and then we'll do um
15:18 - for the lasers
15:21 - for the lasers i'm just going to drag
15:22 - and drop this into laser 2
15:25 - so drag that drag that
15:30 - and drag that except we'll need to
15:33 - change a couple broadcast messages
15:35 - and um uh player
15:38 - things these things this thing instead
15:40 - of player one we have to do player two
15:44 - and instead of go to player one we want
15:46 - to go to player two because it's the
15:47 - other laser
15:49 - and instead of uh and instead of oh yeah
15:52 - and it's supposed to be direction not x
15:53 - position
15:55 - and then um this should be player one
15:57 - shield one and this should be player one
15:59 - shield two
16:01 - instead of player two shield one and
16:03 - player two shield two
16:05 - and then if touching player one shield
16:08 - one instead oops player one shield one
16:12 - and player one shield two and then we
16:15 - wanna broadcast a new message
16:18 - player one got hit instead player two
16:21 - got him
16:26 - player one got hit and instead of right
16:29 - here we want to do player one
16:32 - player one dead
16:36 - one dead
16:39 - and instead right here player one got
16:42 - hit
16:42 - we want to change the player one shield
16:44 - by negative five
16:46 - okay so now we have
16:50 - the movement all done and now instead of
16:53 - spacebar oh yeah one last thing
16:55 - this should be zero i set it to zero so
16:57 - it's easier to play
16:59 - so now
17:03 - let's play
17:06 - oh yeah and this is supposed to be zero
17:07 - as well as you can see there
17:09 - i forgot to do that um and now
17:13 - as you can see you can shoot and shoot
17:16 - with the other character
17:18 - move around so yeah that's what we're
17:21 - gonna do in this video
17:23 - um thank you guys for watching don't
