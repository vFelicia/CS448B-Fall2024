00:03 - [Music]
00:09 - all right guys welcome back to kids
00:11 - calling playgrounds so today we are
00:13 - going to continue our uh the center
00:16 - platformer
00:17 - uh scrolling platformer game uh
00:20 - this time we'll probably work on the
00:22 - enemy and then i think we might have one
00:24 - more episode for the
00:25 - item so this is the main character i
00:29 - have
00:30 - so far let's see i have all the code
00:32 - here
00:33 - yep let me just kind of zoom in just go
00:35 - over it a little bit
00:37 - so these are called uh for the uh for
00:40 - setting up the uh the game here
00:42 - to clean the list restarting this is
00:45 - detecting the uh
00:46 - the sprite uh jumping and then
00:49 - over here we have the uh hitbox moving
00:52 - basically this main character
00:54 - and then we have the platform detection
00:56 - here
00:58 - and then also these are the code for the
01:01 - uh making the scrolling
01:03 - uh doing the calculation here
01:06 - and this is for the next level when the
01:08 - center we made to the end where we see
01:10 - the eclipse
01:12 - uh then the center jumps up so that's
01:14 - what that's for
01:16 - um this is the uh starting the control
01:18 - that's the kind of the main thing that
01:20 - starts kind of
01:22 - all the control for the other movement
01:24 - jumping and all
01:25 - so this is the movement
01:29 - uh on the top here i think that's the
01:31 - same the reset
01:32 - so this is the jump on this side
01:35 - okay and then the movement control
01:38 - if you guys missed anything kind of
01:40 - pause the video
01:42 - just kind of copy it down make sure you
01:44 - get all of them
01:45 - okay and then we have the animated
01:47 - character um
01:49 - that's the animated character code
01:52 - i can already explain how what this
01:55 - means in the counter
01:56 - making the animated uh characters lie
01:59 - and all that
02:00 - and then the jumping and running uh this
02:03 - is the ground
02:04 - uh so the ground you all might be
02:06 - different so basically
02:08 - you know just whatever how many crown
02:10 - you have so i have eight
02:11 - eight ground so that's why i have a zero
02:14 - to seven here
02:15 - um basically zero times
02:18 - 480 will be zero so it starts at zero
02:21 - zero
02:22 - and then it goes like another 480 480
02:25 - keep on
02:25 - stitching up the ground okay
02:29 - make sure you have this at the end to
02:31 - hide it okay
02:33 - uh sanding for the virtual ground very
02:35 - similar to the ground
02:36 - so uh but the virtual ground will go to
02:39 - the back layer okay
02:42 - and then you have the background
02:44 - scrolling so background scrolling we use
02:46 - a division here making the scroll a
02:48 - little bit slower
02:49 - okay uh we have the spike
02:52 - so this is like the spike if you like to
02:54 - put into your game
02:56 - where you want to clone it and i think
02:59 - that's about it and we have the
03:01 - mute sound so sound is where we like you
03:03 - know jumping
03:04 - getting hit or you know falling off the
03:07 - water
03:07 - and then this the igloo includes the
03:10 - code is to just
03:11 - like broadcast the next level when when
03:14 - you touch the main character
03:16 - basically going from level one to level
03:18 - two so now let's go on and work on the
03:21 - enemy
03:21 - so the enemy is gonna be a little bit
03:23 - complicated so let me just trash this
03:25 - code here
03:26 - i have some code earlier when we're
03:27 - doing some testing
03:30 - okay so we're gonna attract some of the
03:32 - stuff uh from let's say
03:34 - um this one uh the spike
03:37 - to the enemy and then we're gonna work
03:39 - on it so uh we're gonna get the
03:41 - reset so we always need that we need to
03:45 - set up
03:46 - okay we need to uh placing the clone at
03:51 - the place the position
03:55 - uh we don't need the moving ground so
03:57 - we're gonna use another thing and then
03:59 - we're gonna use
04:00 - when i start as a clone okay so
04:03 - let's kind of spread this out a little
04:05 - bit so we're gonna
04:07 - have to call all this out so it will not
04:09 - be exactly the same
04:11 - we're gonna have to make some changes to
04:13 - the code
04:16 - okay so let's see so so far
04:20 - uh you know you can put your tiger
04:21 - anywhere it doesn't really matter
04:23 - right we were just doing it earlier so
04:26 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
04:27 - remove this
04:28 - don't need that uh we're going to make
04:31 - the tiger
04:32 - rotation left to right and then high
04:35 - okay
04:37 - okay next we're going to look at the
04:38 - reset code delete the clone that looks
04:40 - correct
04:41 - and then we have the position that is
04:43 - also correct within not doing anything
04:45 - much
04:45 - with that uh so next we'll go on to the
04:48 - uh
04:49 - placing the clone and setup so let me
04:53 - kind of move this thing around a little
04:54 - bit
04:55 - we're going to work on these things
04:56 - later these two so these
04:59 - these three on top is good so far
05:01 - they're good
05:02 - okay so these three so i'm gonna work on
05:06 - this placing the clone so i'm gonna
05:08 - change it out a little bit and also
05:10 - gonna have to change out some of these
05:12 - things so right click
05:13 - say edit here we are gonna add more
05:17 - um we're gonna add a label
05:20 - okay i'm gonna call it distance
05:23 - so adding a label you can actually
05:25 - easier to see
05:26 - if you want to add the label so for your
05:29 - game for your variable
05:31 - if you don't want to add the label it's
05:33 - fine it doesn't matter i just try add a
05:35 - label
05:37 - so label is just kind of like before the
05:39 - variable you can tell what is about
05:42 - distance and
05:45 - you can say next you can have next label
05:49 - so speed then you can add it
05:52 - speed and then add one more label
05:57 - type and then
06:00 - we have the variable type okay
06:04 - so i'm go it's gonna look like this okay
06:07 - and then we are gonna work on it okay so
06:10 - before we go
06:11 - we're gonna make the uh a variable for
06:13 - or for the monster
06:15 - okay so we already have this x and y uh
06:18 - which is for this sprite only right for
06:20 - the enemy
06:22 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
06:23 - rename this
06:25 - okay i'm going to rename everything with
06:28 - monster in it so that's going to be
06:29 - easier to see
06:31 - okay monster x i'm gonna go
06:34 - capital x here camo case
06:38 - uh rename this one
06:42 - monster y okay
06:46 - so where the monster x monster y uh what
06:49 - we're going to do is we're going to make
06:50 - more variable
06:52 - for the sprite only monster
06:55 - um animation
06:57 - [Music]
07:00 - with a new variable for the sprite only
07:04 - monster uh
07:07 - we did i think we we don't wait i didn't
07:11 - use it but uh you know going forward
07:13 - different game we can track keep track
07:15 - of the monster dying or not
07:17 - i think we we might not need this i
07:18 - didn't do anything with it you know like
07:20 - maybe another game we can like kill the
07:22 - monster and they die then you need that
07:24 - so let's not create it now for my main
07:26 - game i actually have it but
07:27 - for for teaching you guys let's not have
07:30 - it right now
07:31 - and that monster that let's create
07:32 - months the distance that is
07:35 - okay monster distance
07:38 - okay next um
07:43 - we're gonna use um for this sprite only
07:46 - again
07:48 - oh sorry monster
07:52 - distant counter
07:56 - so this is going to use this counter
07:58 - kind of like a delay
07:59 - we're going to count uh the monster
08:02 - moving
08:03 - uh the distance and then keeping track
08:05 - of that how far it's going to go
08:08 - and then this is a monster speed so
08:12 - everything start with monster we're
08:13 - gonna fold this sprite only okay
08:17 - then we're gonna make one more
08:21 - monster type okay
08:25 - so i think we have all of it
08:29 - okay so let's just take this guy out
08:33 - not showing up okay even the g
08:36 - position we can move that away
08:40 - okay all right so let's go back to the
08:42 - monster we have all the
08:44 - sprite here okay so we're going to
08:46 - change this up a little bit
08:49 - i'm going to use the if and else
08:50 - statement here
08:53 - put that here get the operator
08:57 - uh get the speed
09:01 - make it greater than zero so what we're
09:04 - going to do
09:04 - is we're going to make the monster
09:06 - either turn into a left or right
09:08 - based on the speed so for this one
09:12 - we're gonna make it point direction 90
09:16 - and this is negative 90. okay
09:20 - all right so i'm going to put this under
09:23 - here
09:23 - [Music]
09:24 - and then i'll remove this i'm going to
09:27 - use that later
09:28 - so what i'm going to do is going to use
09:30 - the go to
09:33 - and we are going to use go to the
09:36 - monster
09:36 - x and monster y position
09:39 - of the monster now we are going to set
09:43 - up
09:43 - the variable
09:47 - so set up monster distant
09:51 - okay so we're gonna grab this drag this
09:54 - here
09:54 - okay duplicate this
09:58 - monster speed so you can make this
10:01 - months ago faster or slower you know
10:05 - okay duplicate that and then we have one
10:08 - more
10:09 - monster type
10:12 - okay grab this
10:16 - okay and then we're gonna have another
10:19 - one
10:22 - uh month the distance count we're gonna
10:24 - reset to zero
10:27 - and uh we don't have months the debt i
10:29 - don't need that
10:30 - so let's go on to the next one make it
10:32 - go the front layer
10:34 - show and create this clone okay
10:37 - so this is what i have so far for the
10:40 - for the placing the clone down
10:42 - okay let's work on the setup next to it
10:45 - we have set up i think i'll move this
10:46 - out a little bit
10:48 - so set up or level one where you want to
10:50 - put the monster
10:52 - at okay i already have to coordinate
10:54 - down but uh what you can do is you're
10:56 - gonna have to
10:57 - you know find your coordinate where you
10:58 - want to put the monster so for me
11:00 - i have uh putting it 400
11:04 - and then negative 20 so for my first
11:08 - tiger and the distance i want him to
11:10 - travel is
11:11 - 75 this is kind of like a delay
11:15 - counter that we're gonna use and the
11:17 - speed is five meaning that's monster
11:19 - let's go on travel five
11:22 - and two uh this is type two monster so
11:25 - for me
11:26 - i have you see how this monster uh so
11:28 - type two is the
11:29 - running of the white tiger so type one
11:32 - is the yellow
11:33 - so we have more months so you can
11:34 - actually create more and put your
11:36 - costume here
11:37 - and then you can actually create you
11:39 - know different monster for your level
11:41 - okay so for my example i only show the
11:44 - white tiger
11:45 - and the yellow tiger so that's all i had
11:48 - but you can have many many more
11:49 - so let's say we want one tiger here and
11:52 - another tiger somewhere at
11:54 - this position
11:58 - oh one three
12:01 - four five and then this is uh i say
12:04 - negative eighty
12:05 - so that means it's lower on the ground
12:07 - so one two twenty i think it was up
12:10 - at the a little bit higher so this thing
12:12 - i want him to travel a little bit
12:14 - further
12:15 - i will give like 150 and then i say
12:18 - monster one that means the yellow tiger
12:20 - so for level one
12:21 - i have three tiger in my main game so i
12:24 - just gonna put this
12:26 - position 200 2800 this is the x position
12:30 - the y position and then i put another
12:32 - one
12:33 - this is two so meaning white tiger
12:35 - yellow tiger
12:37 - white tiger okay for level one okay
12:41 - okay let me drag this drop this all this
12:43 - delete all that stuff
12:45 - and level two we can have different one
12:47 - um
12:48 - for my level two i also have it i just
12:50 - gonna coat it up for now
12:52 - we can just take a look later okay
12:55 - so for level two i have um at this
12:58 - position
12:59 - negative eighty i made it uh 150 that's
13:03 - the distance
13:04 - five and one and then this one i made it
13:08 - is
13:08 - two i made 85 as a distance you have to
13:12 - kind of try it i'll show you what i mean
13:14 - later
13:15 - and then this is i had it as two one
13:18 - five zero
13:19 - uh so if your stages haven't gone too
13:22 - too far
13:23 - you might have to have it differently
13:25 - okay so let's
13:26 - just for now let's have this as the one
13:29 - and i'll show you later what i mean
13:31 - okay okay so we're gonna work on when i
13:34 - start as a clone
13:36 - so no i don't need this go to uh what
13:39 - we're going to do is
13:40 - if you touch the main character you're
13:42 - gonna die right so
13:44 - main character gonna so same thing make
13:46 - sure the main character
13:48 - is moving not dying and then if it if we
13:50 - touch it it will play this sound
13:53 - and then we're gonna mark it as hit it
13:54 - got hit okay so same code
13:57 - very similar okay so now we have this
14:00 - setup
14:01 - now what happened when we have the
14:02 - monster
14:05 - okay so let's see we have everything
14:08 - okay seems like we do
14:09 - so what we're going to do is not going
14:11 - to work yet so um
14:12 - if we're going to start you can see kind
14:15 - of like the tigers somewhere over here
14:17 - using these three tigers not really
14:19 - correct right then generate the right
14:21 - tigers not
14:22 - you have three tiger but it's not not
14:24 - correct you see we want two white and
14:26 - one yellow right it's not correct
14:28 - so what we're going to do is we're going
14:30 - to have to animate the
14:31 - monster so let's go on to the
14:34 - uh go back to the main character
14:38 - okay so in the main character so go look
14:42 - for the
14:42 - start game so let's go over here we have
14:45 - start game here
14:47 - uh you see after the move ground uh what
14:50 - we're going to do is we're going to get
14:51 - another
14:53 - broadcast message put in here and
14:57 - we're gonna make it called animate
15:04 - monster okay
15:08 - so this will will make the monster move
15:11 - and set up the
15:12 - correct position now go back to here
15:16 - okay all right so we broadcast the
15:20 - animated monster right
15:21 - so what we need to do is we're going to
15:23 - set the position of this guy
15:25 - so say when i receive animated monster
15:29 - i'm gonna have to call this position
15:31 - block
15:32 - okay and then we are going to use the
15:36 - operator the minus
15:40 - duplicate this put one over here and
15:43 - then we are going to use the
15:45 - x position the minus x
15:48 - minus the um where's the scrolling
15:55 - x and then we will use minus the y
16:01 - minus the scrolling
16:07 - okay and the original game have the
16:09 - g-score i don't think i have that right
16:11 - on the
16:13 - oh i have speed okay this is wrong
16:17 - need to get the uh scrolling right
16:23 - yeah so i got the wrong one so so many
16:26 - variable in this game so just make sure
16:28 - you grab the right one so it's the
16:29 - scrolling okay
16:30 - not the speed okay so answer x minus the
16:34 - scrolling x minus the y
16:36 - minus the square y so this is going to
16:38 - put the monster at this location
16:41 - so let's try to run it for now let's see
16:44 - how it actually look
16:45 - does it even put the monster you see we
16:47 - have the monster tiger over there
16:49 - but he's not moving you see he's not
16:51 - moving but if we jump on it
16:53 - we'll die and we'll go back to the
16:55 - beginning right and we lost one life so
16:58 - this part of the code is working right
17:00 - uh placing down the monster is working
17:03 - but it's not moving so we want to make
17:04 - the monster move right we don't want the
17:06 - ones in the state
17:08 - okay so what we need is
17:11 - we're gonna have to do another block of
17:13 - this so um
17:15 - when i receive anime monster
17:20 - okay so here we are going to use some if
17:22 - condition
17:24 - okay so grab this go to the condition
17:26 - here
17:28 - so get this even else okay
17:32 - and then let's grab this one delete this
17:34 - clone put that in the else block
17:38 - okay get the condition here
17:45 - oh okay so let's just create this
17:47 - monster
17:48 - dead actually i might need that because
17:50 - i'm actually using
17:51 - that in my game actually so let's create
17:54 - monster
17:56 - dead okay for this sprite only
18:00 - so let's use that just don't want to
18:02 - complicate it the uh the condition here
18:04 - so let's
18:05 - use it like that we'll we'll try next
18:07 - time
18:08 - another way so let's put this so if the
18:11 - monster is not that so it
18:13 - may be later we can make it months to
18:14 - die so uh
18:16 - you know you can kill the monster but
18:18 - for now we're gonna set up like this
18:21 - uh so since we created a new variable
18:23 - right make sure you put this back over
18:25 - here
18:25 - sorry about that guys so here um
18:28 - grab this
18:32 - just duplicate this one for now and
18:35 - select
18:36 - monster dead say no
18:40 - okay okay all right let's go back over
18:44 - here
18:45 - okay so if you notice so the monster
18:47 - want to create is not that right so
18:49 - move okay grab this uh
18:53 - change put it in here
18:56 - um monster distance counted by one
19:01 - so what we're going to do is you're kind
19:02 - of using a delay calendar
19:04 - keep going up and then we're going to
19:06 - use it to check against the monster
19:08 - distance
19:09 - okay okay so what we're going to do is
19:13 - if i get some if condition
19:17 - put it in here and then you're going to
19:21 - use the operator
19:22 - here what we're going to check is going
19:25 - to check the type of monster this
19:27 - monster type equal to one
19:32 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
19:34 - gonna we're going to
19:36 - for the first one the minus the one i
19:38 - have is a yellow type right
19:40 - so let's define a block
19:46 - yellow oops sorry tiger
19:50 - okay so select this run without refresh
19:55 - and then we are going to
19:56 - [Music]
19:58 - do it over here for now so here
20:02 - we say change
20:07 - change the monster animation
20:12 - and then use the device symbol make it a
20:14 - little slow
20:15 - here because we don't want this to go
20:17 - crazy so i'm gonna divide by four
20:20 - one divided by four and then we're going
20:23 - to use this switch costume
20:26 - okay then
20:29 - similarly that we're using the switch
20:31 - custom for the other one right
20:33 - before so what we're going to do is use
20:35 - this floor
20:40 - okay okay so grab this
20:45 - plus sign put this here
20:48 - okay then we have to get this mod
20:53 - uh grab the monster animation
20:59 - and then we can mod 10 since we have uh
21:06 - since we have 10 costume so if you look
21:08 - over here
21:09 - i have the yellow tiger up to 10 right
21:12 - so 10 before i change the white type
21:15 - so we're going to do mod 10
21:18 - and then we're gonna put plus one since
21:21 - this is where i start at
21:23 - the first one so mark 10 will be like
21:26 - the the remainder
21:27 - of whatever plus one okay
21:31 - so and then we're going to take the flow
21:32 - of that meaning the lower
21:34 - number okay if it's a decimal then take
21:37 - a lower number
21:38 - okay so put that into here
21:41 - okay then
21:45 - if
21:48 - and then we are going to say
21:52 - use the end condition
21:56 - and then we're going to use the greater
21:57 - than
22:00 - and then we're going to use the less
22:01 - than
22:05 - okay and then we are going to get this
22:08 - costume
22:11 - i'll use a custom number we're going to
22:14 - say we're going to randomly put i mean i
22:16 - want to put something between the uh
22:18 - the middle of it so uh what i'm going to
22:21 - do is three
22:22 - between three and eight i'm gonna set
22:25 - the uh
22:27 - set the speed for the monster
22:30 - okay monster speed
22:35 - so we're gonna use the
22:38 - another operator here a plus
22:43 - uh sorry not monster speed sorry monster
22:47 - x
22:47 - sorry so we're gonna try to adjust the
22:49 - monster x actually
22:52 - made the mistake over there so use
22:54 - monster x
22:56 - plus the monster speed so whatever that
22:59 - was set
23:00 - so if you if you want the monster to go
23:02 - faster
23:03 - i think we have five right so we will
23:05 - try to adjust that um
23:07 - position plus five so this this monster
23:10 - every time the costume go between uh
23:13 - greater than three and less than
23:15 - eight will adjust the the monster x
23:17 - position
23:18 - okay okay so what we're going to do is
23:22 - we're going to
23:23 - call the yellow tiger so we don't have
23:26 - the white tiger yet
23:28 - we'll do the white tiger later okay but
23:31 - now we'll just test with the yellow
23:32 - tiger
23:33 - and then we're going to get the if
23:34 - condition put that under here
23:36 - [Music]
23:38 - and then we're going to use the operator
23:40 - here greater than
23:43 - what we're going to do is kind of check
23:45 - the
23:46 - monster distance counter if the amount
23:49 - of this encounter is greater than
23:53 - the monster distance basically um
23:56 - basically kind of got delayed keep on
23:57 - going but
23:59 - let's say you want the monster to travel
24:01 - it will
24:02 - saying the distance is 475 right after
24:04 - 75
24:05 - what we want to do is we're gonna make
24:08 - the monster go backwards so to do that
24:10 - what we're going to do is
24:14 - say set monster
24:17 - speed uh we're gonna use the operator
24:22 - uh multiply so what we're gonna do we're
24:25 - gonna multiply by
24:26 - negative one so if there's a positive
24:28 - speed going to the right
24:30 - we're gonna multiply by negative one it
24:32 - will become negative speed so the
24:33 - amounts will go to the left
24:35 - okay so we're gonna multiply the monster
24:38 - speed
24:41 - take that out okay
24:44 - and then we're gonna have to reset this
24:47 - because uh
24:49 - we're gonna have to reset the counter
24:51 - back to zero so that'll start again so
24:53 - it will turn around and start running
24:55 - the other way
24:56 - and then to make it turn around use the
24:59 - opponent direction
25:02 - uh what you want to do is you can use
25:04 - the negative sign actually here
25:06 - and put 0 and then
25:09 - put the direction of the
25:12 - of that monster so if it's going to the
25:14 - right it will go to the left it's going
25:16 - the left will go to the right
25:18 - okay so we have the yellow tiger done
25:21 - now let's just check it out so i
25:22 - think in the beginning i actually have
25:24 - the white tiger in my first game
25:26 - but let's just try the yellow tiger and
25:28 - see how it works
25:30 - okay so let's say we move over here we
25:33 - should see a yellow tiger running you
25:35 - see it
25:36 - you see that so this tiger will run
25:39 - so so so he scratched me i died but
25:42 - anyway you see this tiger running right
25:44 - so if you want the tiger to be somewhere
25:47 - here or something like that you have to
25:49 - adjust it so let's say you
25:50 - click on the mouse button you have a 80
25:53 - and uh
25:53 - negative 74 right i think i'll highlight
25:56 - it
25:57 - actually you need negative 80 to
25:58 - position the tiger to be on the ground
26:01 - so let's say if i want the tiger to run
26:03 - between the end here and i
26:05 - want to put it like somewhere you know
26:08 - here or whatever right so whatever it is
26:11 - so let's say you want the tiger to be
26:14 - here you can do like 180
26:16 - you can try to change this right um
26:19 - whatever the position is
26:24 - so now let's let me move back so let's
26:27 - say i stop let's say i want to start
26:29 - again
26:30 - let's say i have my mouse here and i
26:32 - push the m
26:34 - so unless i want the tiger to be at this
26:36 - position
26:40 - so let's say i want that so let's say
26:42 - we'll put it 100
26:43 - right sides 100 and then let's put it at
26:46 - negative 80.
26:47 - so the title will start running around
26:49 - here
26:50 - so the tigers running around this
26:54 - this area so if you want him to go
26:57 - further right
26:58 - because i i put 75 because it was on the
27:01 - top
27:02 - over there did not have much space and i
27:04 - did not want him to run and
27:06 - pass that past the ground right so you
27:09 - want the tiger to run more right you can
27:11 - put
27:13 - this to like let's say 1 200
27:16 - or whatever right 200.
27:19 - so now i if i started again
27:22 - you see the tiger's gonna come back
27:24 - you're gonna run further away
27:26 - so he might run through so you see he's
27:28 - running through the uh
27:29 - do the thing you do not want to do that
27:31 - right so you're gonna have to
27:32 - just try to adjust it correctly i mean
27:36 - it i already adjusted but you're gonna
27:38 - have to adjust the
27:39 - tiger correctly so that you know it
27:41 - doesn't run off the screen
27:42 - or whatever okay so
27:47 - so there you go so really quick we're
27:50 - gonna put the uh
27:51 - put back the same coordinates uh for the
27:54 - tiger
27:55 - that i had initially for my game so i
27:58 - had it at 400 position
28:01 - x and negative 80 and negative 20
28:06 - and then i have this thing was 75
28:09 - and then i have number two as a white
28:11 - tiger so now let's work on the white
28:13 - tiger
28:14 - i think we are already a lot of time
28:16 - almost 30 minutes on this video
28:19 - so let's finish this up real quick
28:22 - let me find my code okay this is my
28:24 - yellow tiger here
28:26 - okay so we're gonna create something
28:27 - similar
28:30 - what we're going to do is we're going to
28:31 - make a new block
28:33 - called our white tiger
28:38 - okay so run it without refresh
28:41 - so what we're going to do is we'll take
28:43 - this code duplicate here
28:46 - um we're going to change this a little
28:49 - bit
28:50 - so since um you see my costume here i
28:52 - have 10
28:53 - and number 11 is where the tiger white
28:56 - tigers start right
28:57 - so we're going to do mark 10 because 10
28:59 - costume since inside one you put 11.
29:02 - and here um i earlier i was using 13 and
29:06 - 8
29:07 - i mean 3 and 8 we'll use 13 and 18.
29:10 - so somewhere within this um
29:13 - within this costume number 13
29:16 - and number 18 we're going to set the
29:18 - speed
29:20 - back the master speed x i mean set the
29:22 - nonsense position with the speed
29:24 - okay so now we have the white tiger now
29:26 - let's just test the game out
29:28 - real quick let me hide the mouse
29:31 - position
29:32 - for now okay so let's open the
29:36 - bigger screen so let's see so we have
29:39 - the
29:40 - first white tiger so i'm lagging a
29:43 - little bit i think it's because of the
29:47 - um because i'm recording i think
29:50 - let's see oh there's some issue with my
29:53 - white tiger actually
29:55 - let's see maybe i forgot to reset some
29:57 - variable let's see
30:00 - okay you know what i actually forgot to
30:02 - do this condition here right
30:04 - there's no white tiger so don't forget
30:08 - to do that
30:09 - put this over here put this back in here
30:13 - sorry about that throw this away
30:16 - call the white tiger here and call that
30:19 - number two
30:20 - okay so let's see now should work now
30:23 - i forgot to call the code okay so now
30:26 - let's
30:27 - test it out so even though like when
30:29 - you're making the code right the first
30:31 - time you did everything right
30:32 - but then you know when you're teaching
30:34 - it again sometimes you mess it up
30:36 - so you can see the white tigers here
30:38 - that was my first one
30:40 - i think i have one more over here so
30:42 - here this guy
30:43 - that this guy runs a little bit further
30:45 - you see he runs further than the white
30:47 - one
30:48 - because his distance 150 so as you can
30:50 - see
30:51 - we have the tiger two i think that's one
30:54 - more white tiger something right here
30:55 - see
30:56 - so we put two or three right so just
30:58 - depending on
30:59 - where you want to put and then on the
31:02 - second level i put
31:03 - the tiger at this position i believe
31:06 - somewhere here see
31:07 - so this tiger is running so there you go
31:11 - so um this is the animating the monster
31:14 - for this tutorial uh so
31:18 - so you can see right so um
31:22 - so the first level i have three tiger
31:24 - right at this position
31:25 - this is a distance this is the speed and
31:27 - this is the type of the tiger the enemy
31:30 - number two i have only two one at this
31:32 - position
31:33 - one at this position okay so this is
31:36 - pretty much
31:37 - all the code for the animating the uh
31:41 - the um we call it animating the monster
31:44 - okay so let's look at the let's i'm just
31:48 - going to scroll down
31:49 - i mean go around the code let you guys
31:51 - uh pause down if you miss anything
31:54 - okay just in case because this is a
31:56 - little bit
31:57 - more complicated than you know like a
32:00 - spike or something like that
32:02 - so okay hopefully you guys understand it
32:06 - and then this is the uh animating the uh
32:10 - monster which is uh broadcast by the
32:12 - main character
32:14 - okay and then this is uh making the
32:16 - custom switch
32:17 - custom for you know making look like
32:19 - it's running okay
32:21 - all right so that is it for this video
32:24 - uh so next video we'll probably work on
32:26 - the items and other stuff and then we'll
32:28 - be done
32:29 - okay all right if you guys like this
32:31 - video please give us a thumbs up
32:33 - that really help out the help us out and
32:35 - uh you know they'll push this video more
32:37 - to other people
32:39 - who are interested in learning scratch
32:41 - and stuff alright thank you guys see you
32:43 - guys next time bye
