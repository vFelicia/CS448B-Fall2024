00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - welcome back guys it's kids going
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video in scratch and today um
00:13 - we'll be making uh make your own snowman
00:15 - and thanksgiving just passed so happy
00:17 - thanksgiving everybody and uh hope you
00:20 - guys had a good thanksgiving and uh
00:22 - christmas is uh
00:23 - around the corner so we made a christmas
00:25 - game
00:26 - make your snowman
00:30 - so it plays a
00:31 - xylo some type of sound and you see snow
00:34 - is constantly falling
00:36 - and um you have the
00:39 - the sticks you can
00:41 - drag them onto your snowman
00:45 - this one's on the back because you know
00:46 - like it's like that
00:48 - and um the scarf
00:50 - as you can see you can change the color
00:52 - of the base like the three buttons
00:54 - so we got black we got gray we got blue
00:56 - we got red and yeah basically that's for
00:59 - the body as well as the head no the head
01:02 - we have the carrot only changing orange
01:04 - yellow red purple and blue and there's a
01:07 - random button which randomizes all the
01:09 - colors on the
01:11 - i succeed the carrots red on this one
01:13 - the hat is yellow
01:15 - scarf is yellow and the boots are red
01:18 - the boots always are the same color so
01:21 - yeah
01:24 - i just checked the snowman's right and
01:25 - i'm pretty sure
01:26 - the right boot is supposed to be in the
01:28 - back of the snowman and not the front of
01:30 - the snowman just as this stick uh it was
01:33 - in the front i'm pretty sure it's in the
01:34 - back so we put another bag and now we're
01:37 - gonna change the
01:39 - thing so we'll be right back so we just
01:41 - fixed the problem so
01:43 - as you can see it's behind the snowman
01:45 - now so we could
01:47 - uh put the behind it and the stick is as
01:49 - well so
01:52 - you can make a fairly decent snowman
01:54 - using the random you know
01:58 - so yeah
01:59 - this is what we're gonna be making today
02:01 - okay so now uh we have started a new
02:04 - project so
02:05 - let's write make your
02:10 - snowman
02:12 - and we're going to delete this
02:15 - and uh we have everything in the
02:17 - backpack but this is how you're supposed
02:19 - to do it it takes a while to do it but
02:22 - shut up snowman and we're gonna be doing
02:24 - the base right so you go to costumes
02:28 - and you delete
02:29 - everything
02:32 - until you have the base and then you
02:35 - rename it of course you name this like
02:38 - base one
02:39 - or whatever
02:40 - and this like base two and
02:43 - uh
02:44 - just change the color of the buttons or
02:47 - the snow if you want to and this is
02:49 - basically how we made our bases so
02:54 - we have everything in the backpack
02:56 - so like what if i wanted to do a body so
02:59 - we have snowman
03:02 - uh by the way everything is here is uh
03:06 - 200
03:08 - uh the size so
03:10 - what if i wanted to do the body well
03:12 - delete everything but the body
03:15 - and
03:16 - just
03:17 - rename it of course but i'm not going to
03:19 - rename it because like it takes too much
03:21 - time and
03:22 - you just change the button color
03:24 - so that's basically what we're going to
03:26 - be doing and uh
03:29 - i have everything inside the backpack to
03:31 - do the process for you so man and if you
03:34 - wanted to do the boot or anything this
03:36 - is how you do the boot
03:37 - so you go here
03:40 - delete everything
03:44 - and what the left boot and this is how
03:46 - you make the left boot and then
03:48 - search it up and snowman you do ripe so
03:51 - that's basically how we're going to be
03:53 - doing things today so delete all of this
03:56 - and we're going to get everything in the
03:57 - backpack so
03:59 - yeah since this is too time consuming
04:01 - and we don't want to waste your time uh
04:03 - watching me draw a bunch of stuff we
04:05 - have the base and black gray
04:08 - we just put that in the backpack so uh
04:10 - we have everything set up here so
04:13 - let's get start on code
04:15 - and yeah if you don't want to make uh to
04:17 - change the base or the body or the head
04:19 - or uh yeah if you want to do that you
04:22 - can make next scarf and just do the same
04:24 - thing for the scarf so let's work on the
04:27 - base so let's just show you guys
04:29 - all right so the base
04:33 - here so all we have to do
04:36 - is when the green flag is clicked
04:41 - we will
04:43 - go to the position of course if you put
04:44 - things in the backpack they'll be in the
04:46 - right position so just find a position
04:48 - around here that is reasonable and of
04:50 - course change the size of everything to
04:52 - 200 except the buttons you can uh just
04:55 - export it from my game and
04:59 - yeah and we have to get the backdrop so
05:02 - uh any backdrop
05:04 - but i'm gonna take the winter one i
05:07 - think it's fun
05:10 - i don't know what it's actually called
05:11 - uh i think it's called winter yes this
05:14 - one
05:15 - and
05:16 - yeah so we have that and just delete
05:18 - this backdrop so now we have that so we
05:21 - have we're gonna work on the base now so
05:23 - everything's 200 remember that keep in
05:25 - mind and export you just go to my
05:28 - project i will share this by the time
05:30 - this is out click the export button and
05:32 - it should be there and you should be
05:34 - able to
05:36 - um
05:37 - yeah able to import your sprites into
05:39 - your own project so
05:41 - since we have this go to right here i'll
05:43 - switch costume to base one which is the
05:46 - regular base
05:48 - which is brown brown buttons so
05:50 - switch costume to base one
05:54 - and
05:56 - yeah
05:58 - so now uh we're gonna move to the next
06:00 - base
06:01 - uh sprite so we have this when the green
06:04 - flag is clicked
06:08 - we'll make this go to this position
06:10 - and when this right is clicked then it
06:13 - will broadcast
06:18 - change based
06:23 - yeah you can change scarf change boot
06:25 - whatever you want change left boot uh
06:27 - and we have we go to the base now so
06:30 - when i receive change base
06:33 - it will
06:34 - next costume
06:37 - and uh
06:39 - now we're gonna work on the body
06:42 - all right so i'm just gonna demo it to
06:43 - show you
06:45 - if it works or not so yeah it's working
06:48 - fine so now we're gonna
06:50 - move on to the body so
06:52 - let's get this done so when the green
06:55 - flag is clicked
06:58 - it will go to this position i already
07:01 - have it
07:02 - so and then it'll switch costume to body
07:05 - one
07:08 - that's the default
07:09 - and then
07:10 - we move back to the next body
07:14 - and we have
07:16 - the when this sprite is clicked
07:20 - it will
07:23 - broadcast a message
07:28 - change body
07:34 - oh yeah i forgot to do the go to when
07:37 - the green flag is clicked go to
07:40 - and now we're going to move to the body
07:42 - and when i receive change body
07:46 - then it will
07:48 - next costume
07:51 - and now we're gonna go to the head
07:54 - and
07:55 - we have the head so when the green flag
07:57 - is clicked
08:01 - um
08:03 - basically we go to
08:07 - and then switch costume to head one
08:12 - and
08:13 - now when i receive change head which is
08:15 - basically we just go to next head
08:18 - and
08:19 - when the green flag is clicked
08:22 - go to
08:24 - and uh
08:27 - when the sprite is clicked
08:31 - then it will
08:33 - broadcast change head so we're gonna do
08:37 - change head
08:43 - and now we have to change head we go
08:44 - back to the head and when i receive
08:46 - change head it will go next costume
08:49 - and now we're gonna work on the
08:53 - randomized one the random
08:55 - so
08:57 - because the random really is the base of
08:59 - all almost everything here so
09:02 - when the green flag is clicked
09:05 - it will go to this position we already
09:07 - have it
09:09 - and it when the sprite is clicked it
09:11 - will randomize
09:16 - randomize
09:19 - is this iceberg randomizer uh
09:22 - and okay uh
09:24 - randomize we go back to the base this
09:27 - has a lot of transitioning
09:29 - so when i receive
09:32 - randomize
09:34 - pick random
09:37 - repeat until
09:39 - it will pick random 10 to 20.
09:44 - so that was the accident uh instead of
09:46 - repeat until sorry guys it's repeat with
09:49 - a number so this one and we have pick
09:52 - random 10 to 20.
09:55 - so it will show you as it's changing
09:58 - it's transition
10:03 - i'm gonna go to next costume
10:05 - and wait 0.1 seconds so
10:09 - we have this done and basically we just
10:12 - have to copy this code to
10:14 - the body
10:16 - the head
10:18 - and the left arm and right arm you
10:19 - cannot change the color so
10:21 - so now we're gonna do the
10:25 - hat so we're gonna put this to the hat
10:27 - we're gonna put this to the scarf
10:29 - we're gonna put this to the left boot
10:31 - but please do not skip this part
10:34 - uh
10:36 - we have
10:37 - something special for the left and right
10:39 - boot so the left boot and right boot we
10:42 - want to make them have the same color
10:43 - because um basically it's matching so we
10:47 - go i'll repeat 15 times so a number in
10:50 - the middle
10:53 - because and they'll be
10:55 - technically the same color so let's do
10:57 - this see
11:00 - so random
11:01 - as you can see it's changing color
11:04 - alright so now we're gonna code the
11:07 - um the hat so the hat we have to make
11:10 - this draggable so
11:13 - when the green flag is clicked
11:16 - we will
11:18 - go to
11:22 - this position
11:24 - and then go forever
11:25 - [Music]
11:27 - oh first we have to do something very
11:29 - important and switch costume back to
11:31 - hack number one because it's gonna be
11:33 - different you're just gonna start
11:34 - randomizing so we go forever and
11:37 - set mode to draggable
11:42 - oh where is that
11:44 - set dragon road to dragon ball and since
11:46 - we have that we put it to the scarf
11:49 - the left boot
11:52 - and the right move yes and we have to
11:54 - change the position
11:55 - so what is the position of the scarf
11:58 - right now
12:03 - so i'm gonna
12:05 - the position has to change and this
12:07 - change back to scarf one in the left
12:09 - boot and right boot so instead of hat
12:12 - one we left root one
12:14 - and we have a go to specialized for this
12:17 - one
12:18 - and for the right boot same story uh
12:23 - change the go to
12:24 - and the costumes
12:27 - right boot one so
12:29 - yeah so feel free to pause
12:32 - i'll go back to all of these so if you
12:34 - need a pause
12:37 - feel free
12:39 - and these this is the code
12:42 - here's the code for the hat
12:44 - so we have things specialized for the
12:46 - right boot so the right boot um
12:49 - we will make this go to the back later
12:51 - of course
12:52 - because it's behind the snowman it's
12:54 - supposed to be behind the snowman so
12:56 - we're going to make this go to the back
12:57 - later so we put that
13:00 - right
13:01 - inside here
13:03 - and so front layer backward and now i'm
13:05 - going to code the left and right arm so
13:08 - let's get to the left arm
13:10 - and when the green flag is clicked this
13:12 - should be simple enough we go to
13:16 - go forever and ever and
13:19 - we will set mode to draggable
13:24 - and we're going to put this with the
13:25 - right arm but remember to change the
13:26 - position
13:27 - we put this on the right arm
13:30 - and remember to change the position
13:32 - position should be
13:34 - this
13:35 - and
13:36 - we will
13:38 - put this to go to the back layer because
13:40 - the right arm is supposed to be
13:42 - on the back layer
13:47 - so
13:48 - yeah feel free to pause
13:51 - so right now i'm going to do the snow
13:53 - sprite it's going to be constantly
13:54 - falling down so let's draw the snow
13:58 - white
13:59 - do this
14:00 - i mean i do this and then shift
14:04 - and make a small circle
14:09 - and we center this let me see if i can
14:11 - center is this in the center
14:14 - yeah this is centered and now we have
14:16 - the white bright one which is also known
14:18 - as snow
14:20 - and we will go to the snow and
14:23 - we will code it so
14:26 - when the green flag is clicked
14:29 - okay so i'm gonna drag in my forever
14:31 - loop and this is a very important part
14:33 - of the thing so
14:35 - set wind our new variable wind please do
14:39 - not skip for this sprite only and it'll
14:43 - set wind to
14:45 - pick random negative one to positive one
14:48 - so it's going to be
14:50 - yeah the wind will be scattered around
14:54 - and
14:55 - when the green flag is clicked
14:57 - it will set ghost effect to 20
14:59 - to give it some effect
15:03 - i mean not not 20 100
15:06 - uh and then you'll go to
15:11 - 0 20 0
15:13 - which is uh x0 is over here but we're
15:16 - going to use the y and make it 220
15:19 - so right here on the coordinate plane
15:22 - like around this one and it'll go
15:24 - forever
15:27 - it'll create a clone of myself
15:30 - and i'll wait i'll pick random amount of
15:33 - seconds so
15:34 - wait
15:35 - pick random
15:38 - 0.005
15:42 - to
15:44 - 0.01 so that's how long it'll take to
15:47 - create another clone
15:48 - so
15:50 - when i start as a clone
15:55 - it will
15:56 - set size to
15:59 - um
16:02 - set
16:04 - this is the right one no no this isn't
16:05 - the right one this is this set size to
16:07 - pick random 70 to 80. you can make it a
16:10 - larger range of what's big and small
16:12 - pieces of snow
16:15 - but 70 to 80 or you can do whatever you
16:18 - want so um i did 70 to 80 in my other
16:21 - one but then the spring was smaller so
16:22 - i'm gonna do 70 to 100 on this one and
16:25 - then it will go to i pick random
16:26 - position so
16:28 - um goes to
16:31 - x
16:32 - oh y should always be on the top it's
16:33 - always going to be up here uh go to x
16:36 - pick random negative 240 and
16:41 - to positive 240.
16:44 - so as you can see negative 240 to
16:46 - positive 240
16:47 - and it will repeat for
16:54 - it will change ghost effect by
17:01 - most effect my
17:03 - minus 20
17:06 - and it will repeat two times
17:12 - and change y
17:15 - by
17:16 - where's the change by um here i said
17:18 - change y by
17:21 - minus five and it will go down and
17:23 - change x by wind
17:30 - and now this is going to be the big
17:31 - chunk of code so bear with me here
17:34 - you have a repeat until you have to zoom
17:36 - out for this
17:37 - and since there's so much things we have
17:40 - to use repeat until put up or
17:42 - repeat until it's touching the base
17:47 - or
17:48 - or you put another or to make it three
17:52 - because you do that and you put or
17:55 - touching body so if this is only if you
17:58 - want the snow too
18:00 - when it hits like the arm or the head or
18:02 - the base body or the scarf or anything
18:05 - it will disappear and um it's only if
18:08 - you wanted to do that but you don't have
18:10 - to do it if you
18:11 - want it to phase through the um thing so
18:16 - so we have this and when it is touching
18:21 - body
18:24 - or we have another or touching body or
18:30 - the
18:31 - head
18:34 - and we drag another or
18:37 - and then from the head we put the left
18:41 - we put the left
18:43 - arm
18:44 - [Music]
18:46 - and then we put another
18:50 - ore
18:52 - and we put the right arm
18:58 - and we put the right arm so put that
19:00 - inside there
19:01 - right arm go back and put another
19:05 - or
19:07 - and
19:08 - duplicate that instead of right arm
19:11 - do
19:12 - um
19:14 - the hat that's the hat there it is
19:17 - and another or and instead of that we've
19:20 - got the duplicate instead of using the
19:22 - hat we go do the scarf
19:26 - and um
19:28 - after that we put another ore
19:31 - and we put the
19:35 - left
19:36 - boot
19:38 - and we put
19:39 - another ore
19:43 - we put the
19:45 - right boot
19:48 - and we put
19:49 - no more ores and then we put
19:52 - right next to the right boot
19:54 - we have the edge
19:56 - so it'll also disappear when it's
19:58 - touching the edge so
20:00 - um
20:01 - base
20:02 - body
20:03 - head
20:05 - um left arm
20:07 - right arm hat
20:09 - scarf left boot right boot and edge so
20:13 - get that in and
20:15 - let's continue so
20:18 - and let's put and we're going to
20:21 - duplicate this so change y by minus 5
20:23 - and change x by wind
20:25 - so let's put that there and
20:28 - repeat 10 times
20:31 - it will change ghost effect
20:39 - by 10.
20:43 - and now we will delete this clone
20:46 - right under there and now we're going to
20:48 - get the sound in so when the green flag
20:51 - is clicked
20:54 - i always set the volume to 25 because
20:57 - i'm talking and
20:59 - yeah uh
21:00 - i think i use xylo 2 if i'm not mistaken
21:04 - get this one
21:05 - and
21:06 - it will play xylo 2 until done for wait
21:08 - first go together forever lou i forgot
21:10 - the forever loop where's the forever
21:11 - there we have it and play sound xylo 2
21:14 - until done and now we are done with our
21:17 - project so let's see if it works or not
21:19 - so
21:23 - so let's do this
21:24 - oh yeah i gotta change the
21:26 - change the variable
21:31 - okay and now we'll start so now let's do
21:34 - this
21:36 - snail is already falling disappearing
21:38 - and it's touching the arms everything
21:40 - pushing the boots touching the edge and
21:42 - we can change the snowman base black
21:44 - gray
21:45 - blue
21:46 - red you get the white body
21:49 - uh head
21:50 - which is just the carrot on the nose and
21:52 - drag on the scarf
21:57 - [Music]
22:09 - so you created your own snowman with
22:13 - your own features that you like like the
22:15 - base if your favorite color was blue
22:18 - uh why not change this to blue
22:20 - when i change this to blue why not keep
22:23 - this blue
22:25 - [Music]
