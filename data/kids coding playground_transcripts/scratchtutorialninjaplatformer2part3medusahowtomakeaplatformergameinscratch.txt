00:02 - [Music]
00:14 - mm-hmm
00:16 - [Music]
00:22 - hello and welcome back guys to kiss
00:24 - coding playground so today we'll work on
00:26 - the third part of this ninja platformer
00:29 - the newer version
00:31 - uh so today we're gonna probably work on
00:32 - the uh matusa which is the monster
00:36 - so we'll work on that today so let's go
00:38 - over last time so last time we got
00:41 - everything working
00:42 - with a ninja able to jump
00:45 - it will do a slash it will throw the
00:47 - kunai
00:48 - and he can kind of
00:50 - fly up
00:52 - okay
00:53 - all right so let's get started so we'll
00:56 - work on the medusa today okay so be sure
00:58 - you go to the medusa so here we're gonna
01:01 - have to create some variable
01:03 - so for the medusa so let's make some
01:05 - variable so make it for the sprite only
01:08 - so we're gonna try to get all all the
01:11 - variable in one go
01:13 - okay
01:13 - so the first one we're gonna have is
01:18 - so the first one
01:19 - will be
01:20 - each
01:22 - character
01:24 - so we're going to use a list and then
01:26 - we're going to keep track of where the
01:28 - medusa is and then we're going to use a
01:30 - loop so we're going to have to use all
01:31 - these uh to get the data out of their
01:34 - list and pause it so so first one is
01:37 - each character so for the sprite only so
01:40 - next make another variable for the
01:41 - sprite only
01:43 - enemy
01:46 - enemy exists
01:50 - okay
01:52 - so next
01:55 - for this sprite only
01:58 - i'm going to call index
02:03 - another variable for this sprite only
02:06 - and we're going to say uh my
02:08 - deuce
02:10 - custom
02:12 - index
02:15 - okay
02:16 - i think on my original code i had it as
02:19 - all variable but i think it's better to
02:21 - keep it at the sprite only so that way
02:23 - you know we don't have to look at other
02:24 - variables when we go to other sprite
02:27 - so here with everything we're going to
02:29 - put it in the
02:31 - medusa
02:34 - hp okay
02:36 - for the sprite only
02:43 - okay so next
02:46 - uh we've got methods here we're going to
02:48 - do a medusa
02:51 - i'm going to copy this word so that way
02:54 - you know we can
02:56 - use it better so medusa
02:58 - left
03:00 - position
03:02 - okay
03:04 - then we're going to create another one
03:07 - called medusa
03:10 - position
03:13 - and we'll pick another one
03:16 - for this probably medusa
03:20 - position
03:23 - then we're gonna have some more
03:26 - uh we're gonna use another vehicle
03:29 - called position
03:32 - and then
03:34 - we're gonna have another variable x
03:38 - not a variable
03:40 - y
03:41 - okay so i think that's all the
03:43 - new variable that we had for the medusa
03:47 - okay so let's just can hide these
03:51 - um so basically we're gonna use it to go
03:53 - through the loop to find our position
03:56 - for where to put the medusa
03:58 - and now using the left and right
04:00 - position we can kind of move more medusa
04:02 - to the left and the right and then they
04:04 - can turn around
04:05 - okay so let's get started so let's go
04:08 - with the when green black is
04:10 - [Music]
04:12 - clicked so here
04:15 - we're gonna say hi
04:18 - okay i forgot to create my list also so
04:21 - i'll create one more variable the
04:24 - variable
04:25 - and this time make a list
04:27 - called medusa
04:29 - positionless okay i think my medusa
04:31 - already had it when i pulled her in
04:33 - so uh this medusa so if you guys don't
04:36 - have it make a list so you can say make
04:38 - a list and you can for this friendly or
04:41 - for all sprite doesn't really matter so
04:43 - uh basically we're going to use an adult
04:46 - position this i think i had it as a
04:48 - for uh this glass for this sprite only
04:51 - as you can see medusa colon so this is
04:53 - for the
04:54 - medusa position list so if you don't
04:57 - have this be sure to make one so you can
04:59 - just select this and put the name medusa
05:01 - position this here okay like this medusa
05:05 - position
05:07 - like that okay so since i have it i
05:09 - don't need to do it
05:10 - okay so let's go with this
05:13 - so delete all
05:15 - so we're going to clear that so what
05:17 - we're going to do is add some position
05:19 - uh where we want to put medusa so
05:23 - we're gonna put zero so wherever we
05:25 - don't want the medusa to appear for that
05:27 - stage we put zero
05:29 - okay so this is basically stage one so
05:32 - basically like level one so this this
05:34 - stage here so
05:36 - so let's say you want to put medusa on
05:38 - the second level and you want to put a
05:40 - certain position
05:42 - uh you can say
05:44 - uh the x position
05:46 - and then we'll get a pipe character a
05:48 - straight line
05:49 - and then we're gonna put in the y
05:51 - position basically let's say we're on
05:53 - the
05:54 - second costume here second stage and
05:57 - we're going to put medusa on the top
05:58 - here somewhere here on top here so
06:01 - that's why i picked that position
06:04 - but you can always find the position
06:06 - by picking uh by hitting the uh
06:09 - the m key so let's say we're over here
06:12 - say we want to put medusa here push the
06:14 - m key
06:15 - uh i think i haven't worked on that yet
06:17 - so let me do that for now
06:21 - okay so for the m key you can put in the
06:23 - background or the anywhere i think in my
06:26 - old code i actually had it in the main
06:28 - character so let's just put it in there
06:30 - so in the main character you can say
06:32 - when
06:35 - m key is pressed
06:37 - so basically this is the mouse so we're
06:39 - going to try to find the mouse position
06:41 - for this
06:42 - so i'm going to say set
06:47 - and we're going to say set global mouse
06:49 - position
06:51 - i'm going to use the join condition
06:54 - and then get another one
06:56 - and then we're going to get the
06:59 - mouse x i think it's in sensing
07:02 - so mousex
07:04 - i'm going to put a comma
07:06 - a couple of space
07:08 - and then i'm going to put mouse y
07:14 - okay
07:15 - all right and then you can put this
07:17 - inside here
07:18 - okay
07:19 - so when the
07:21 - m key is pressed we're gonna get the
07:22 - mouse position wherever it is and then
07:25 - we're gonna show the variable so we're
07:27 - gonna say show
07:30 - the
07:30 - global mouse position okay so let's say
07:33 - i want to put the methuselah here at
07:35 - this location i can push the m key you
07:38 - can see that is negative 5 negative 78
07:41 - if i want to put it in here that the
07:43 - negative 200 negative 35 okay so that is
07:46 - how you find the position where you want
07:48 - to put the medusa so for me i already
07:50 - had some of those old uh position i had
07:53 - already so that's why i'm using it if
07:55 - you don't have it then you're to try to
07:57 - find where you want to put it
07:59 - okay
08:01 - all right so let's continue so we're
08:04 - going to add a couple so
08:06 - so this is stage 1 stage 2 stage 3
08:10 - and let's put him at 15.
08:13 - uh let's go pipe
08:15 - uh negative 23 and that's what i have
08:17 - and i have like stage four and five so
08:19 - for now let's not let's not put anything
08:21 - else let's say we don't want anything at
08:24 - stage four let's say one two three
08:26 - number four we don't want the
08:28 - medusa to appear we can put zero okay
08:32 - so let's have these for now actually
08:34 - okay so let's go next part we are going
08:38 - to
08:38 - work on getting the position from the
08:40 - medusa
08:42 - all right so what we're going to do is
08:44 - we're going to try to uh get these uh
08:47 - variable uh
08:48 - get this position out from this list for
08:50 - each of the level so you can click on
08:53 - this or run and then set it up so i've
08:55 - issued to uh put a check mark at these
08:58 - uh variables we're going to try to use
09:00 - this to look at it so this our position
09:03 - position x and y okay so have these
09:06 - little check marks after this so let's
09:08 - go let's make a new block
09:11 - and we're going to call it get
09:13 - medusa position
09:16 - okay
09:18 - click on that
09:19 - so forget medusa position we are going
09:22 - to go to
09:23 - set the variable
09:26 - let's zoom in a little bit
09:29 - so i'm going to say set
09:31 - enemy access to false
09:34 - so we're going to use this to determine
09:36 - if we show the enemy on the stage or not
09:39 - then we're going to sell index
09:42 - to one
09:43 - so that's how scratch works is start the
09:45 - index by one
09:47 - and say each character i'll make that to
09:50 - blank so delete that so i'm gonna use
09:53 - this to pull the go to the loop and pull
09:56 - this each character out
09:58 - okay
10:00 - so next
10:01 - duplicate set uh position
10:05 - to blank okay
10:08 - duplicate
10:10 - set medusa position we're gonna use the
10:13 - list
10:15 - and we're gonna get one of the items
10:16 - from the list so i'm going to say
10:19 - get this one and then we're going to use
10:21 - the variable level
10:23 - so basically go through each level it
10:25 - will pull out level one will power 0
10:28 - level 2 will pull out this number here
10:30 - okay
10:32 - all right
10:33 - so next we're gonna have the if
10:35 - condition
10:41 - sorry
10:43 - put the if condition here
10:45 - and then for this one what we're going
10:46 - to do is we're going to use the end join
10:49 - so you're going to use a not join
10:52 - and then we're going to use the equal
10:53 - not
10:54 - equal
10:55 - and then we'll duplicate that put this
10:57 - here and over here
11:00 - and then we're going to say um
11:04 - not methuselah position with methuselah
11:07 - position
11:08 - okay
11:09 - so methuselah position is not equal to
11:12 - zero
11:14 - or
11:15 - duplicate
11:18 - and or not equal to blank
11:20 - okay
11:23 - then we're gonna go in
11:24 - i'm gonna set the
11:26 - enemy access
11:28 - to true
11:31 - okay
11:32 - and then we are going to do the repeat
11:34 - loop
11:38 - so i'm going to repeat the number of
11:39 - times
11:41 - we're going to use the length
11:42 - [Music]
11:47 - and then we're going to duplicate the
11:48 - master position
11:51 - so basically we're going to go to the
11:52 - loop look at each of the position which
11:55 - is like negative
11:56 - negative and then 37
11:58 - i mean three and then seven
12:00 - so on and so forth okay
12:03 - and then when you're doing the repeat
12:05 - loop
12:07 - you always have to increase the index
12:09 - right at the end so uh remember to
12:11 - always do that but for now we'll we'll
12:14 - call other stuff first at the end we'll
12:15 - add it okay so next we want to say set
12:21 - each character
12:23 - and then we're going to use the
12:26 - letters
12:28 - we're going to use the index here so
12:34 - okay
12:35 - and then we're going to use the medusa
12:37 - position here
12:40 - so it will go through each character
12:43 - pick up one letter from the
12:45 - whatever the position is and then it
12:48 - keep on going
12:50 - okay and then we're going to use the if
12:53 - an else control
12:56 - uh if an else statement here
12:58 - here we're going to check
13:02 - uh if each character
13:06 - is equal to the pipe symbol
13:08 - which is i'm using that the pipe symbol
13:10 - is on the top of your enter key you just
13:12 - shift and then hit that
13:15 - so that's it's going to match if you use
13:17 - a comma then you have to put your comma
13:18 - here okay
13:20 - so i'm using pipe so that's why i'm
13:22 - using that so i'm gonna say set
13:26 - i'm gonna set the x
13:29 - equal to
13:30 - position
13:34 - and then we're going to say set
13:37 - position
13:39 - it goes to blank
13:44 - okay so next we're going to say
13:46 - set the position else block
13:49 - kind of set the position we're going to
13:50 - use the join condition here
13:53 - so here we're going to join the
13:56 - variable position
13:58 - plus each character
14:00 - while going through so every time you go
14:02 - through the first time will be zero uh
14:04 - it will be blank blank join with the
14:06 - first character which is let's say
14:08 - negative
14:09 - and then the next time we go down and
14:11 - get three
14:12 - the next time we're gonna go get seven
14:14 - so until it gets to the pot first pipe
14:16 - symbol we're going to set the position
14:18 - to the x
14:19 - and then we're going to reset the
14:20 - position to blank and then at the very
14:22 - end we're going to set the uh the last
14:25 - position to y
14:27 - okay so here what we're going to do is
14:30 - going to say change index
14:34 - change index by one
14:37 - okay put that under the else block here
14:40 - and then at the very end we're gonna say
14:42 - set y
14:44 - so we're going to set y to the position
14:48 - and put that at the end here okay
14:51 - so let's take a look we should look at
14:53 - everything
14:54 - i hope we got it doing right
14:56 - so this is everything okay
14:59 - all right so let's go through this and
15:01 - let's try to call our block
15:04 - okay so our level is one right level one
15:07 - so when we call this we're not getting
15:10 - anything right because the level is one
15:12 - this is zero so now let's change our
15:15 - variable change our level so let's set
15:17 - the level to two
15:20 - so it's level two
15:22 - so i set it to two so it should pick up
15:24 - this negative 37 34. so i click on this
15:28 - you can see you pick up negative 37 34
15:31 - then it goes through and it goes trying
15:33 - to find the position so you see that x
15:35 - is negative 37 this is 34. so let's say
15:38 - i go to number three set level to three
15:42 - so it should be 15 and negative 23. so
15:44 - let's click on this again
15:46 - so you can see it picks up 15 that's the
15:49 - x
15:50 - negative 23 is a y okay
15:52 - all right
15:54 - so let's drop this away
15:57 - so now that we had that done
16:00 - so next part we're gonna move the uh
16:04 - create another uh
16:06 - custom block
16:07 - so this time we are going to
16:10 - make a block called medusa
16:12 - stop
16:16 - start
16:17 - [Music]
16:18 - okay
16:19 - all right so click that
16:23 - so for medusa start this is making
16:25 - medusa to move
16:27 - uh we're gonna say set
16:30 - set the size to
16:32 - 125
16:37 - okay
16:38 - and then we're gonna say go to
16:40 - front layer
16:43 - and then we're gonna say show
16:46 - then we're gonna say clear graphics
16:48 - effect so we'll make them blank when
16:50 - they get hit
16:52 - next we're going to set the
16:54 - medusa hp
16:57 - to 3
16:59 - and then we're going to set the
17:02 - medusa
17:04 - custom index to one okay
17:10 - okay so next we're gonna have a forever
17:13 - loop
17:19 - and then we're going to use a
17:21 - operator
17:23 - i'm going to use the if first sorry
17:29 - so if
17:31 - and then this all operator we're going
17:33 - to use a n also
17:35 - put in the first operator okay first r
17:39 - so this is um if it's touching
17:44 - the kunai
17:47 - so this is gonna damage the uh
17:49 - the medusa or
17:53 - if it's touching
17:56 - the
17:58 - ninja
18:00 - and
18:03 - we're gonna say greater than
18:08 - so we're gonna call 51
18:11 - so i'll explain why that is it so be
18:14 - sure to select the back first and then
18:16 - select the ninja
18:18 - custom number
18:20 - okay
18:21 - so basically
18:23 - uh what we want to say is if it's
18:25 - touching the ninja and the custom number
18:27 - is greater than 51 so the 51 is actually
18:30 - the custom number where the ninjas are
18:33 - doing the slicing using the sword so i
18:35 - put everything at the end you can see
18:38 - so 50
18:40 - 50 51 right 51 is starting 51
18:44 - um so i think mine here is a 53
18:48 - right so i should say greater than 52
18:51 - because i think i have to slice so
18:53 - basically if it's greater than 52
18:55 - which is uh this slice or this attack so
18:59 - any of these attack it hits the medusa
19:02 - will be uh it will be done damage on him
19:05 - on her okay so we're gonna say greater
19:07 - than 52 right because 53 is where the
19:10 - attack starts
19:12 - so we're going to say change it to
19:14 - greater than 52
19:16 - i think originally my game had 51 but
19:19 - later we got we added the slide so so is
19:22 - it greater than 52 and then we're gonna
19:24 - say broadcast
19:26 - message
19:27 - and wait
19:29 - say
19:30 - got hit
19:37 - okay so next
19:39 - we're going to say
19:42 - on move
19:45 - say move three step
19:48 - and then we're gonna use the if
19:50 - condition again
19:51 - i mean if uh if statement put it under
19:54 - here
19:55 - i'm gonna say use the greater than sign
19:59 - okay
20:00 - and we're gonna say x position
20:06 - is greater than
20:10 - we got the medusa right so methuselah
20:12 - right
20:14 - position
20:15 - so basically
20:17 - if the x
20:18 - exposition is greater than but there's a
20:20 - right position
20:22 - we're gonna turn it around
20:24 - so we're gonna say point it through
20:29 - okay so here we are going to
20:32 - turn around so uh point in direction
20:35 - negative 90
20:38 - and then similarly we're gonna do it for
20:40 - the other side
20:44 - and then we're gonna use the less than
20:48 - and we are going to use the x position
20:55 - and then this is less than the
20:59 - medusa left position we're going to turn
21:02 - it back around turn it back to the right
21:04 - side
21:06 - and also make sure your medusa is having
21:09 - this thing in the middle so it doesn't
21:11 - flip over
21:12 - otherwise you're going to have to use
21:14 - the
21:15 - set rotation style left and right okay
21:19 - okay next um
21:22 - gonna say if
21:28 - so i'll put that under here
21:32 - so if
21:33 - i'm gonna use the uh condition here
21:37 - and then we're gonna use the index
21:41 - i'm gonna do the custom index greater
21:43 - than four
21:45 - we're going to set the
21:48 - set the methuselah custom index
21:53 - back to one
21:56 - okay
21:57 - and then so you can see medusa here's
22:00 - the depth animation
22:02 - so
22:03 - here
22:06 - here we're using the walk so the walk as
22:08 - one two three four right so after it
22:11 - gets to the full walk we're going to go
22:13 - back to the first walk okay
22:17 - okay so next i'm going to say switch
22:20 - costume
22:23 - okay
22:24 - and then we're going to use the join
22:26 - operator
22:28 - i'm going to put block here
22:30 - so that has to match
22:33 - the name of the costume so i have walk
22:35 - right so you see walk one
22:38 - so that's why i put walk one and then
22:41 - here in cell one except the level one
22:43 - we're gonna use the index because
22:45 - they're gonna start at one and then
22:47 - we're gonna keep going
22:48 - right
22:49 - and then we're gonna put a little weight
22:54 - 0.1
22:57 - and then change custom index
23:02 - jt methods are custom index pack one
23:05 - okay so this is for the methuselah to
23:07 - walk
23:09 - so what i'm going to do next is we're
23:12 - going to try to get this medusa 11 left
23:15 - and right um
23:17 - position okay
23:18 - so this is the code for the custom block
23:20 - if you missed anything write that down
23:23 - so next we're going to have the
23:24 - broadcast
23:29 - when i receive
23:35 - start new level
23:38 - gonna say stop
23:41 - other script and sprite
23:43 - [Music]
23:45 - hi
23:46 - so basically if
23:48 - you start a new level you want to kill
23:50 - the medusa right so high
23:53 - then we're going to call this block
23:55 - get the custom get the medusa position
23:58 - and then we're going to have the control
24:00 - here if
24:02 - we're going to use the operator equal
24:05 - then we're going to check if the enemy
24:07 - exists
24:08 - is equal to true
24:11 - you know once we found it we set it to
24:13 - true right so that's what we did here
24:15 - right so if you go back to this one
24:18 - right and we find it set to true
24:21 - so here that's what we did so if that's
24:24 - set to true then we're going to say go
24:26 - to
24:31 - go to
24:33 - uh we got the x and y right don't do the
24:35 - x and y here so i'm gonna use the x and
24:37 - y
24:38 - so x and
24:40 - y
24:42 - okay
24:43 - then we're gonna say set
24:47 - the medusa left
24:49 - position
24:50 - we're going to uh
24:53 - for the lap position we're going to use
24:54 - a minus
24:56 - so we're going to use the x
24:59 - subtract 70
25:02 - and then we're going to get the right
25:03 - position
25:05 - i'm going to use the x and i'm going to
25:07 - use the plus
25:11 - so let's say plus 70
25:15 - so basically i'll move left and right 70
25:17 - steps
25:20 - after that we're going to call
25:23 - the
25:24 - stock medusa basically tell it to move
25:30 - okay we are almost done
25:33 - so next
25:34 - i know this is going to be a little bit
25:36 - long
25:37 - so it's a little bit complicated so next
25:39 - we're going to say got hit basically
25:41 - that's when the medusa got hit by the
25:43 - kunai or something like that
25:44 - so we're going to say change
25:48 - change the medusa hp
25:51 - by -1
25:54 - okay
25:56 - and then we're going to use that if an
25:57 - else condition
26:02 - and then we're going to use the greater
26:03 - than sign
26:05 - i use the metusa hp
26:08 - if is greater than zero
26:12 - so that's greater than zero uh we're
26:14 - going to start the sound
26:17 - squeak
26:20 - ah this is just screaming mature
26:22 - screaming got hit okay he's not dead yet
26:25 - so what we do is we're gonna say switch
26:27 - costume
26:31 - so it's costume
26:33 - death number one
26:36 - uh weight
26:41 - uh 0.5
26:45 - let's switch to
26:50 - death number two
26:53 - so this is not completely dead yet so
26:55 - medusa is just getting hit so you gotta
26:58 - go with this one and then this one okay
27:03 - so three and four she's about to die
27:05 - right so we don't want to do that
27:07 - so this is completely dead so we're
27:09 - gonna use these two for getting hit
27:13 - okay
27:14 - otherwise i wanna say
27:17 - stop
27:21 - stop other script in the sprite
27:25 - so
27:27 - so it produces no more hp we'll stop by
27:29 - the screen spray
27:31 - and i'm going to set
27:36 - here i'm gonna do the custom index back
27:39 - to one so we'll reset everything here
27:44 - and then we're gonna set the
27:47 - switch costume to the first costume
27:50 - which is the death costume so when it's
27:53 - dying
27:54 - okay
27:57 - and then we're gonna repeat five times
28:04 - so because they have six costume total
28:06 - right so if you look at medusa he has
28:08 - six costumes of death one to test six
28:11 - so we start the first one so we're gonna
28:13 - repeat five times
28:17 - okay um
28:20 - because the depth has zero okay that was
28:23 - one
28:24 - so we can either use a let's start at
28:28 - zero
28:29 - and then we start at one that's correct
28:30 - so one equal to three right so we're
28:32 - gonna say
28:35 - [Music]
28:38 - actually i think we can do two
28:42 - because uh what happened is the first
28:44 - one is def one right so we're gonna
28:46 - listen to two
28:48 - here i think my original one i have one
28:50 - i think we can do two here
28:52 - so we're gonna say
28:55 - repeat five times i'm gonna say change
28:57 - close effect
29:02 - close effect by 10
29:06 - and then switch cost 2.
29:13 - join
29:17 - i use that death
29:21 - by the uh
29:22 - madusa
29:24 - custom index so the first one is one so
29:28 - we can say two
29:29 - and then three four five then we'll
29:31 - change t
29:34 - i'll change the uh
29:36 - i do the custom index
29:39 - by one
29:40 - and then ones that i'll repeat all five
29:42 - times
29:44 - and say play the sound
29:48 - okay so we have the magic spell sound
29:51 - basically that medusa got killed
29:55 - and then we can say hi
30:00 - i think in my old game has played sound
30:02 - until done but you know it doesn't
30:04 - really matter
30:05 - but yeah we can use that
30:09 - let's just
30:12 - i think it really doesn't matter i think
30:14 - we're gonna wait for this to be finished
30:15 - anyway and then we're gonna broadcast
30:17 - the message
30:22 - and then this is a new message called
30:24 - start
30:26 - medusa
30:29 - starting
30:31 - so basically we kill the medusa
30:34 - after some time you know we have not
30:36 - completed the station because i can come
30:38 - back again
30:39 - so i'm going to say
30:43 - so this is where we start again right so
30:45 - let's say when we do that start again
30:49 - um i'll use the if condition
30:53 - and we're going to check if the enemy
30:57 - equals
31:00 - now we're going to use enemy exists
31:05 - they call it true
31:08 - and we're going to say let's say weight
31:13 - you can put random
31:16 - i think on my original game i have like
31:18 - wait five to seven seconds
31:21 - you know whatever
31:23 - like oh you can do four to seven three
31:26 - if you want it faster and then you can
31:28 - call the medusa start again
31:30 - okay so i think we have all the code for
31:33 - medusa
31:35 - let's test it out let's see so let's say
31:38 - the first one
31:39 - let's say let's hide this variable right
31:41 - now hopefully it works
31:45 - and let's say number one we're gonna put
31:46 - the medusa here let's click on the m key
31:49 - we're gonna put it negative 30 and 74
31:52 - negative 74.
31:54 - so let's go back to our
31:57 - list
31:59 - so let's say negative 30
32:01 - and then put the pipe symbol
32:04 - 74.
32:06 - okay let's see what
32:09 - so you can see the medusa is walking
32:11 - this way after that she's walking the
32:14 - other way you can see right
32:17 - and then
32:19 - you can see if i hit the kunai
32:22 - some dudes that's getting damaged after
32:24 - three times
32:26 - she died and goes away so after uh if
32:29 - you wait for some more time then it will
32:30 - come back up
32:34 - so you can see the tools that come back
32:36 - up again
32:37 - we can use the slice
32:41 - so we can slice her and then she dials
32:44 - okay i think we'll stop here for now i
32:45 - think there's a lot of work we have done
32:47 - right today so we'll stop and see you
32:50 - guys next time thank you
32:56 - [Music]
33:02 - you
