00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here
00:09 - today we'll be doing the fourth part for
00:11 - the apple dash game
00:13 - we've been working on so before we begin
00:16 - i'm just going to review some of the
00:17 - code
00:18 - so right here we have the player this is
00:20 - the movement for the player
00:22 - and this is the setting up for the
00:25 - player
00:26 - and then here we have the bomb so right
00:28 - here is
00:30 - the if the bomb hits the player it will
00:32 - play the sound effects and
00:34 - do this and this is the bombs falling
00:37 - down to the ground if it's the basket
00:40 - then it will broadcast this and this
00:42 - will happen then we have the health
00:44 - which is the each piece so every time
00:46 - you hit a bomb this will
00:47 - one will get red so once you get all
00:50 - three of them filled with red then you
00:52 - lose
00:53 - and then we have the basket which is
00:55 - basically just to follow
00:57 - the player and then we have the fruit
01:01 - so right here's the setting up for fruit
01:02 - and then right here
01:04 - we have the fruit falling down and if it
01:06 - hits the hitbox on the bottom
01:08 - then it will disappear and go back to
01:09 - the top then we have the begin button so
01:12 - this
01:13 - just to click it it'll start the game so
01:15 - this is just the spin button to make it
01:17 - spin
01:18 - if you click on it this will happen
01:19 - it'll broadcast a message
01:21 - okay um and then next we have the coin
01:26 - and in the coin we have um the falling
01:30 - speed and all that and we have a wait
01:32 - time so
01:33 - only every few seconds a new coin will
01:35 - spawn
01:37 - and then if a coin hits basket this is
01:38 - what will happen so
01:40 - this is the coin code another with the
01:42 - hitbox really simple just ghost effect
01:44 - 100 and goes to that position
01:47 - over the shop button so what this does
01:50 - is if you hover your mouse over it it
01:51 - will
01:52 - appear to be bigger and smaller and then
01:55 - yeah
01:55 - and then down here if you click on the
01:57 - shop it will lead you to the shop
02:00 - and then there's shop backgrounds just
02:02 - when you click on the shop
02:03 - it will show this backdrop instead of
02:05 - this spectrum and there's the exit
02:07 - button so
02:08 - if you want to leave the shop just click
02:09 - the exit and same concept here
02:11 - when you hover your mouse it will go
02:13 - bigger and smaller
02:15 - and when you click it and you're not
02:18 - hitting a bomb
02:19 - then it will let you start game again so
02:21 - that's what the exit button is
02:24 - okay so first we want to let
02:27 - go to the shop button and we need to add
02:30 - one small script right here to um
02:32 - allow the player to access the shop
02:35 - whenever they want so
02:37 - um let's say s okay so
02:40 - when the s key is pressed
02:44 - because s for shop so when
02:47 - key s is pressed then we are going to
02:51 - broadcast
02:53 - end game so then when a broadcast end
02:57 - game then
02:58 - it will show the shop and then you can
03:00 - click it so
03:01 - i'll show you real quick right here so
03:04 - let's play it let's begin
03:08 - yes as you can see when you click s the
03:10 - shop icon shows up you can click it
03:12 - and it will lead you to the shop
03:14 - immediately and you can exit and play
03:16 - again
03:16 - so so this thing um lets the player
03:20 - access shop whenever they want
03:22 - all right so now we can work on the shop
03:25 - upgrades
03:26 - and stuff for your shop okay you can
03:28 - make different upgrades but
03:30 - we um just have these for now
03:33 - so i have the um the
03:36 - wings is 25 coins so what it does is
03:40 - make the player move faster
03:43 - so what i did inside the costumes we'll
03:44 - put this in the link in the description
03:46 - inside the
03:47 - google drive so you don't have to worry
03:49 - about making it but if you would like to
03:50 - make your own then sure you can make
03:52 - your own
03:52 - so we just got some png wings from
03:54 - online attached it to a circle
03:57 - with filled and then we put 25 as the
04:00 - cost
04:01 - and once you purchase the thing
04:04 - we want it to be grayed out so you can't
04:06 - purchase any more so it'll switch to
04:08 - this costume
04:10 - and then we also have the basket bigger
04:13 - basket 50
04:14 - uh 50 coins or whatever so it just makes
04:17 - a
04:17 - basket bigger so you can catch more
04:19 - fruit but it also increases the chances
04:22 - of catching a bomb but 50 coins and same
04:25 - concept here
04:26 - when you buy it you can't buy it anymore
04:27 - so we gray it out and then we have
04:30 - the skin pigskin so for a hundred points
04:34 - you can get a pig skin
04:35 - so this is from our channel banner if
04:38 - you've seen it we have that pig
04:39 - in the banner um 100 coins
04:43 - and same here but instead right in the
04:46 - pig you can switch between the pig
04:48 - and the ghost so we have let's say you
04:50 - buy the pig but
04:51 - you want to switch it back to the ghost
04:53 - skin then we'll allow it to switch
04:56 - as well so this is not so if you
04:59 - purchase the pig you'll not permanently
05:01 - be able to place a pig you can still
05:02 - switch back to the ghost okay so we got
05:05 - all our costumes
05:06 - it'll be in the google drive and link
05:07 - description so be sure to download that
05:10 - okay all right so now let's go to our
05:13 - first sprite the wing sprite
05:15 - the purchase wings purchase speed
05:18 - so in here first we want to do make a
05:21 - variable
05:22 - okay let's pick the smaller and we're
05:24 - gonna call the variable wing status
05:28 - okay wing
05:34 - wing status so this is to check if the
05:36 - wing
05:37 - is like locked or unlocked so that's
05:40 - what it does
05:40 - and for all sprites waiting status
05:44 - so first in this in this sprite the
05:46 - purchase wings
05:47 - make you more faster first when i
05:49 - receive start game we're going to hide
05:51 - this
05:52 - of course so when it's in play we're
05:54 - going to hide this sprite because you're
05:56 - not in the shop yet
05:58 - and when i receive
06:01 - a start screen then we're going to hide
06:06 - and we're going to set the wing status
06:08 - to locked
06:09 - because it has not been bought yet so we
06:10 - are going to set it to locked
06:12 - wing status to locked
06:17 - and once you can unlock it we'll say
06:19 - it's unlocked and then we're going to
06:20 - switch the costume to costume one which
06:22 - is the
06:23 - locked one like the one that you
06:27 - the purchase one this is the one you
06:29 - already purchased
06:30 - this means you already purchased this
06:32 - the wings this means you have not so
06:34 - we're going to switch it to the first
06:35 - one first
06:37 - and then when i receive shot we're going
06:38 - to show this
06:40 - shot we're going to go to the front
06:44 - layer with it so it's going to go to the
06:45 - front
06:46 - and after that we want to make it go to
06:49 - position
06:50 - so since i import this from my other
06:52 - thing from the sprites
06:54 - i already have the coordinates but this
06:55 - is the coordinate i use
06:57 - negative 175.85 so this is where it is
07:00 - somewhere in this corner area so that's
07:03 - where it is
07:05 - and then we're going to set the size to
07:06 - 100 so in the beginning i want to do
07:08 - that because
07:09 - we're also going to do the mouse hover
07:10 - thing so it will
07:12 - um so then it will get bigger and
07:15 - smaller so
07:16 - in the beginning we want to make it back
07:17 - to normal size
07:19 - and we're going to show okay
07:23 - so then we can go to our exit button
07:26 - i believe we can just drag and drop this
07:29 - forever thing
07:31 - this entire script into here and you see
07:34 - this
07:34 - attach it to the bottom but we'll have
07:36 - to make changes obviously
07:37 - so up here this is fine
07:40 - actually no you have to switch
07:44 - this like that so
07:47 - it has to be 100 um
07:51 - 100 minus size and the size has to be in
07:54 - here
07:55 - like that it's kind of confusing and
07:56 - we're going to divide by three instead
07:58 - so it's going to be a different um
08:00 - amount of
08:02 - big and small because this is a smaller
08:04 - this is a different sized
08:05 - sprite so we're going to do that and
08:08 - plug that in here
08:09 - same thing for this thing i'm going to
08:11 - take this out
08:12 - 150 minus the size we're going to put
08:15 - the size in the first
08:16 - in the division put that in here like
08:18 - that
08:20 - all right and drag that in here
08:23 - and we're going to take this out and
08:26 - if touching mouse pointer so if the
08:30 - uh this thing's touching the mouse
08:31 - pointer then we're going to
08:34 - oh wait we already have done that sorry
08:36 - we have to do this now
08:37 - so mouse down so when mouse down
08:41 - so if mouse down then we're going to set
08:44 - the brightness to the w10 if mouse down
08:47 - then we're going to take this out
08:48 - because
08:49 - this is different so if wait until mouse
08:52 - down
08:53 - we are going to broadcast another
08:55 - message so we're going to broadcast
08:57 - a message called check wins purchase so
09:00 - it's to check if the wings
09:01 - are purchased or not check wins
09:06 - um
09:08 - and then we're going to set the
09:10 - brightness here over here okay
09:13 - and this right here
09:17 - and one more thing you have to put this
09:19 - if else statement inside this if then
09:20 - statement
09:21 - if touching mouse pointer okay so i'm
09:23 - gonna start from the beginning
09:25 - this is setting it up forever change
09:28 - size by this if touching mouse pointer
09:30 - then we're gonna change size for this
09:32 - and we're gonna have an if else right
09:34 - here so if mouse down
09:36 - then set brightness negative 10 wait
09:38 - until mouse down and then we're going to
09:39 - broadcast the check
09:40 - wings purchase and then we're going to
09:42 - set the brightness to zero so this is
09:43 - the
09:44 - scripts for the wings so get that into
09:47 - your code okay
09:52 - um and this should be three as well not
09:54 - i don't know why i put five right there
09:57 - um so these these both should be three
10:01 - and then up here we're going to
10:04 - receive the check wings purchase so when
10:06 - i receive
10:07 - check wins purchase and
10:10 - we're going to get an if done statement
10:12 - so if else i mean if l statement so if
10:16 - wings status is equal to unlocked so if
10:19 - it's
10:19 - not locked so status is equal to
10:23 - unlock then we are going to stop the
10:27 - script
10:30 - stop this script and we're going to
10:33 - in the l statement we're going to put in
10:35 - if else another if else in here
10:37 - so if the money okay so this is to check
10:40 - if the player has enough money to
10:42 - purchase it
10:43 - so if we're gonna use an ore
10:47 - okay so if money is equal to 25
10:52 - so we're gonna get the money the money
10:54 - variable we had
10:56 - so if the money is equal to 25 or the
10:58 - money is greater than 25 so this is to
10:59 - check
11:00 - if the player has 25 coins or over
11:03 - so they can purchase it money
11:06 - is greater than 25
11:10 - then we're going to change the money by
11:12 - negative 25
11:14 - change money by negative 25 so you'll
11:18 - lose your money
11:19 - after you buy this and we're going to
11:22 - set the wing status to
11:23 - unlocked
11:27 - so what this appears if it's already
11:29 - purchased then we will not need the
11:30 - script that's why we're gonna stop it
11:33 - unlocked so the reason why we have this
11:37 - up here
11:38 - if the wing status is already unlocked
11:39 - then we would not need the script
11:42 - so set that and then all right so right
11:45 - here
11:46 - in the player our run is only
11:49 - eight right so we're going to make the
11:51 - player even quicker by setting the run
11:53 - to 20 okay one to twenty
11:58 - and put that under here and we're gonna
12:00 - switch the costume to costume two
12:03 - to know that tell the player that you've
12:06 - already bought this
12:07 - okay and then else if the player cannot
12:11 - afford it
12:12 - or let's not buy it then we're going to
12:14 - set the wing status to locked
12:17 - locked
12:22 - locked and we're going to switch the
12:23 - costume to costume one so it'll stay on
12:25 - the first costume
12:27 - right here and costume one okay
12:30 - okay so now after we finish the script
12:33 - we want to
12:34 - receive a message the check wings
12:36 - purchase so we're going to check wings
12:38 - purchase so we're going to get an
12:39 - if-then statement
12:41 - so if the wing status is unlocked we can
12:45 - just duplicate that
12:46 - we're going to get it forever forever
12:48 - we're going to switch the costume to
12:50 - costume
12:51 - so you can't purchase it ever again
12:55 - all right so why not let's try this out
13:04 - so first we need enough money actually
13:06 - we can check on it
13:08 - right now yes okay click here
13:11 - so as you can see i cannot purchase it
13:13 - when i click on it nothing happens
13:15 - because i do not have enough money first
13:17 - let's get enough money
13:21 - okay money right there
13:27 - so the money gives you pick random money
13:29 - so it depends
13:32 - close
13:37 - okay now we can buy so let's click s for
13:40 - the shop
13:41 - and as you can see we can purchase it
13:43 - and minuses are money and you can't
13:44 - purchase it again
13:46 - and as you can see the player is much
13:48 - quicker now and you can move
13:50 - much quicker but yeah
13:53 - so now the speed will work the speed
13:56 - will work now so
13:58 - that's the demonstration of the speed
14:00 - now we can work in a bigger
14:02 - basket i think we will not have enough
14:04 - time to work on the
14:05 - skin though but let's work on the bigger
14:07 - basket okay
14:09 - so let's go into our bigger basket um
14:12 - thing
14:12 - or whatever upgrade you have
14:16 - so since i have not released the like i
14:19 - don't think we'll have enough time to
14:20 - the skins
14:21 - you guys can try to do it it's pretty
14:22 - much the same concept as these
14:24 - um if you can do it that's great
14:28 - you will not need our last tutorial so
14:32 - um i guess you guys can try to do it but
14:34 - first right now we're going to work in a
14:35 - bigger basket
14:36 - you guys can make your own upgrades as
14:38 - well you don't have to just copy
14:40 - mine so in the bigger basket
14:43 - um in the beginning when i receive start
14:46 - game
14:48 - we are going to hide hide the basket
14:52 - when i receive a start screen
14:57 - start loops start screen you're going to
15:00 - hide and we're going to make a new
15:02 - variable
15:05 - okay so for each one we're going to make
15:07 - a status so we're going to name this
15:08 - basket
15:09 - status to see if it's locked or unlocked
15:12 - okay
15:13 - so for the basket status we're gonna set
15:14 - it to locked in the beginning
15:18 - oops not bomb speed basket status we're
15:21 - gonna set it to locked
15:23 - and then we're going to switch the
15:24 - costume to costume one which is then
15:27 - one that's not has not been purchased
15:29 - yet this one
15:31 - okay okay now let's
15:34 - work on the um
15:38 - the so you can be able to purchase it
15:39 - okay so when i receive
15:41 - shop
15:46 - we are going to go to front layer
15:51 - and then after that we are going to go
15:53 - to this position i had negative 685 i
15:55 - put them all in the same y position
15:57 - so i'm going to go to this position
15:59 - negative 60 85
16:01 - set the y and the size to 100
16:05 - and we're gonna show and then after this
16:08 - we're going to get
16:09 - the same script from here so we can just
16:12 - drag and drop this forever
16:13 - loop script we have to change some stuff
16:15 - still but
16:16 - almost the same thing so this up here
16:20 - is the same so don't this can be
16:22 - unchanged
16:24 - and the only thing that needs to be
16:25 - changed is right here and we're going to
16:27 - broadcast another mask a message
16:29 - called check basket purchase
16:33 - okay so this is the code for this pretty
16:36 - simple
16:37 - and then we are going to when i receive
16:40 - the check basket status when i receive
16:43 - check basket purchase then we're going
16:46 - to get an if else statement
16:48 - so pretty much the same thing as this
16:50 - one so
16:51 - drag and drop this into here except
16:53 - we're going to change some stuff up
16:56 - oops what if okay so
16:59 - instead of wing status we are going to
17:01 - do basket status obviously
17:04 - and instead of 25 we're doing 50 so big
17:07 - basket is 50.
17:09 - you guys can make it any cost you want
17:10 - but i'm making 50. so we're gonna and
17:12 - after this we're going to change it
17:14 - by negative 50 the money and then we're
17:16 - going gonna set the
17:18 - um basket status to unlocked
17:22 - and um instead of the run we are going
17:25 - to
17:26 - broadcast a message called bigger basket
17:29 - this can be still here so we're gonna
17:31 - broadcast a message in between here
17:34 - called bigger basket
17:38 - so we'll make a new costume to make the
17:40 - basket bigger
17:41 - i'll also show you how to do it and then
17:43 - right here instead of wing status we're
17:45 - gonna do
17:45 - basket status a lot okay
17:50 - and then right here um we have to add
17:52 - one more thing
17:54 - when i receive check basket
17:58 - purchase we're going to get an if then
18:00 - statement
18:01 - if the basket status is
18:04 - equal to unlock we can just duplicate
18:06 - this then we're going to forever
18:09 - switch the costume to two so you can't
18:11 - ever buy it again
18:13 - unbuy it i mean you can't ever unbox
18:15 - again so that's
18:17 - it this the bigger basket so obviously
18:20 - we
18:20 - the the basket's not gonna get bigger so
18:23 - we have to make a costume
18:24 - for the basket so let's go to the basket
18:30 - okay so inside the basket um i have a
18:34 - bigger
18:34 - basket costume so what i did so i got
18:37 - the normal basket
18:38 - and i basically just enlarged it on the
18:41 - sides
18:42 - i just made it longer and wider so
18:44 - that's what i did
18:45 - that's the bigger basket it's really
18:47 - simple to do
18:49 - um and after this i'm going to receive
18:52 - we're going to receive the message when
18:54 - i receive
18:54 - bigger basket we are going to switch the
18:56 - costume
18:57 - to basket 2 which is the bigger one
19:01 - all right let's see
19:10 - i need the coins
19:13 - um and i don't want to just give myself
19:16 - 50 coins because i want to
19:18 - also play with this
19:26 - well we're really close maybe one more
19:28 - point if we're lucky
19:30 - okay we need one more we only got six
19:32 - from that
19:34 - oh no now we have enough
