00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video
00:12 - called the faily bricks game we'll be
00:14 - making a family breaks human scratch
00:16 - the objective of this game is to survive
00:18 - as long as possible if the player drops
00:20 - to zero then the game is over
00:21 - player the player can collect hearts to
00:24 - refill hp stars
00:26 - to get more points and power so you can
00:28 - shoot out lasers
00:29 - so anyways um if you never heard about
00:32 - the game called faily brakes
00:33 - it's a pretty cool game i sometimes play
00:36 - it
00:37 - and as you know this video was sponsored
00:40 - by
00:40 - bailey brakes and um sponge games
00:44 - well i'm just kidding psych and it's not
00:47 - sadly we don't have a sponsor okay what
00:48 - happened let's get into this
00:51 - so um
00:54 - bailey breaks game we'll be learning
00:55 - these following concepts in scratch
00:57 - variables loops broadcast messages
00:59 - custom block
01:00 - custom sprite control sprite with keys
01:02 - and we'll be jumping right into the
01:04 - video
01:05 - so i'm gonna go demo the game full
01:08 - screen it
01:10 - so as you can see it says please select
01:12 - the card by using left and right arrow
01:14 - keys please
01:15 - click space when you're done i'm going
01:17 - to play some cool music um
01:19 - so you can just like select a skin so i
01:22 - am going to select
01:23 - blue because my favorite color and as
01:26 - you can see these hearts give you
01:27 - um 20 extra hp and these stars just give
01:31 - you points they don't really do anything
01:33 - and then you can also shoot these crates
01:34 - and then just start out
01:36 - ten lasers and then um you can also
01:39 - gather lasers
01:40 - by looking at these power ups right
01:44 - here i wonder
01:46 - [Music]
01:50 - yeah so then the rocks
01:56 - so in this game uh soccer ball
02:00 - it takes one hit to kill the soccer ball
02:02 - and
02:03 - um and one had to kill the crate
02:06 - also it takes three hits to kill the
02:08 - wall uh three hits to break the
02:10 - motorcycle
02:11 - and rocks i believe it is three two
02:15 - and yeah basically that's the game
02:20 - he has some decorations on the side too
02:23 - i'm going to show you
02:24 - how how you die so i'm going to pick a
02:26 - different skin to show that this all the
02:28 - skins work
02:29 - purple and i'm trying to die not
02:32 - gathering live so
02:34 - i'm bumping into rocks they lose you ten
02:36 - lives
02:37 - so bail at 10 mil hertz left hit the
02:40 - crate as you can see you flip over
02:42 - and you die so basically yeah and that's
02:45 - what
02:46 - the game is known about so
02:49 - um i started a new project and i
02:52 - am going to say some things before i
02:54 - start please like share subscribe
02:56 - and comment in the comment section below
02:58 - for what else um
02:59 - content you want so you can also
03:00 - basically share it with your friends
03:02 - so just to leave this scratch cat it's
03:05 - the first thing
03:07 - and i'm gonna get the convertible sprite
03:09 - i actually have it in my backpack i
03:11 - think
03:11 - um right here let's just drag the
03:14 - convertibles right first i'll show you
03:15 - some things
03:16 - in the convertible spray as you can see
03:18 - there's costumes and
03:20 - i um had some a few costumes like yellow
03:25 - purple blue red and green so yeah
03:28 - so you can make a new costume if you
03:30 - want just duplicate the older costume
03:32 - and just change it a little bit so you
03:34 - can also
03:35 - um change like the color you can make it
03:38 - all wacky
03:39 - i don't know what you can do but you can
03:41 - make it like
03:43 - um like orange
03:46 - or you can just do like a um
03:50 - let's just just have to do this and then
03:52 - you can also make a darker color this is
03:54 - optional but you can make a darker color
03:56 - and then put this in this a darker color
04:01 - and you can also use this you can also
04:03 - use like basically this you can also use
04:05 - to make some cool skins too
04:07 - so anyways i'm gonna start getting
04:09 - everything i have in my backpack
04:12 - so convertible is in the sprite library
04:14 - so you can find it
04:15 - and um we have i have a backdrop
04:19 - so i got this from the math racing game
04:21 - so
04:22 - yeah you can just take the backdrop you
04:24 - got from the math recent game
04:25 - and in the backdrop you just have to
04:28 - write a hp type of thing
04:30 - and um i put a star
04:33 - and a power up
04:35 - [Music]
04:37 - and put a star in the power so yeah
04:42 - star hp power
04:45 - so anyways let me try the rest of the
04:47 - things the rest of my sprites inside
04:49 - so i have a motorcycle i
04:52 - this is also in the sprite library i
04:55 - just need obstacles but there is some
04:57 - things inside the motorcycle
04:58 - so all these um things are all
05:01 - in the all um all
05:05 - all obstacles and they're all one sprite
05:07 - so it's crate soccer ball rock
05:09 - rocks 2 wall morsel
05:12 - [Music]
05:14 - so yeah so
05:18 - we will have these sprites in the links
05:19 - in description in our google drive
05:21 - so i'm also going to drag some other
05:23 - things like the
05:24 - um decorations i guess this is optional
05:28 - but you could use it and i have a heart
05:30 - i think there is a heart in scratch
05:32 - already so
05:33 - you could also use that i also have a
05:35 - laser
05:36 - i think the lasers also you just have to
05:38 - name it button
05:40 - button and then you just color i think
05:43 - it's already colored like that
05:44 - and yeah so it's basically almost
05:48 - all the things we'll have so
05:51 - for the costumes the costumes there's
05:53 - also the star
05:55 - and the power up which is this is just a
05:57 - lightning you just color it
05:58 - um pink so yeah
06:02 - actually we drew this a lightning but
06:04 - there is a lightning in the sprite
06:06 - library
06:07 - search it up for you guys lightning like
06:10 - that you can also do that and
06:11 - yeah change the color i don't know you
06:13 - can do anything but there's also some
06:15 - other code that we
06:16 - that we need like we're gonna work on
06:19 - the player
06:20 - first on part one and we're trying to
06:22 - cover some
06:23 - easy code in the beginning so yeah so
06:26 - when the green flag is clicked
06:30 - so set hp
06:47 - bro so i do have a testing uh
06:50 - [Music]
06:52 - so i do have a testing limit but i i
06:55 - would actually do 100
06:56 - but you can do like more if you want and
06:59 - you also need to make a new variable
07:07 - so set score to zero
07:11 - and then oh yes i'm gonna make laser
07:16 - and set lasers to 10 well you can put
07:20 - infinite if you want you can put a
07:22 - million if you want but i'm using 10
07:25 - and also you can also i have a written
07:28 - coordinate so it's go
07:30 - going to here that's fine
07:33 - anything's fine and i'll point in
07:35 - direction 90.
07:38 - and we'll switch costume to convertible
07:42 - one
07:45 - so convertible one is the um
07:49 - green one so you can change it around
07:52 - and with your skin so yeah now set
07:55 - say please
07:59 - say please
08:03 - select
08:05 - [Music]
08:06 - a car
08:09 - by using left
08:15 - and right arrow keys
08:21 - um please
08:25 - click please space
08:32 - press space when
08:36 - you are done
08:41 - i'm gonna make it five seconds
08:45 - and then i'll broadcast a new message
08:47 - because we don't even have any messages
08:49 - like i said wait um select a card
08:56 - [Music]
09:00 - yeah and then um i'll also be working on
09:03 - a little bit more code like when i
09:05 - receive select a car
09:10 - it will go forever
09:14 - you need an if then statement if then
09:19 - the key right left arrow
09:22 - um key
09:26 - left arrow is pressed
09:30 - it will uh
09:33 - it will switch costume
09:37 - to to
09:41 - minus a minus so switch costume
09:45 - to costume number
09:48 - minus one so i'll tell you what that
09:50 - does
09:52 - right now so costume number minus
09:55 - what so basically that's going left so
09:57 - the costume number will go left
09:59 - so i think um behind the green is the
10:02 - purple no i mean yellow
10:04 - so i'll switch to yellow basically and
10:06 - it'll wait until
10:11 - wait until
10:15 - the not key left arrow is pressed
10:19 - so it will not be as glitchy
10:21 - [Music]
10:28 - so yeah and um also you need to
10:30 - duplicate this and you can also make the
10:32 - right side
10:35 - which is slightly different so let's
10:37 - just
10:38 - write and
10:42 - um switch costume the costume number
10:45 - plus one
10:52 - plus one so plus one is red i know
10:57 - i think and
11:00 - you'll see right around to the left
11:03 - arrow so yeah
11:05 - um you know wait until
11:08 - and it will broadcast
11:11 - and you also have to go to the um
11:13 - spacebar sorry
11:14 - um so you gotta go to spacebar so it's
11:18 - really different from office by just
11:19 - duplicate it for quicker use
11:22 - and you do not need to i'll switch
11:23 - costume number
11:25 - so you can throw that away this costume
11:27 - number not
11:29 - uh key space press
11:31 - [Music]
11:35 - and it will broadcast
11:37 - [Music]
11:40 - start game
11:45 - and stop the script so you can you so
11:48 - because you're using right and left
11:49 - arrow keys to move your car
11:51 - you gotta start stop the script so then
11:54 - it will
11:55 - not change skins basically and also
11:58 - we have some other code to do
12:02 - so i'm going to show you the skin
12:05 - stuff so it says please select the car
12:08 - by using left or right arrow keys please
12:10 - press space when you're done
12:12 - and bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam bam
12:14 - bam bam bam bam so
12:16 - all those colors okay yeah and we're
12:18 - also gonna have some author code for
12:19 - moving
12:20 - so this should be simple enough when i
12:23 - receive start game
12:26 - it will uh go forever
12:32 - if then the left key arrows clicked
12:41 - then it will change x by minus 10 so go
12:44 - to the right
12:46 - left left left sorry ah
12:50 - um and also you said to
12:53 - duplicate this and this will be click
12:57 - right arrow and instead it's 10.
13:06 - and then you also need an if then
13:09 - if then statement if then
13:13 - so for the up and down arrow keys
13:16 - there's a little twist to it
13:18 - so you need and operator so
13:21 - it will key up press so it will not
13:24 - so i'll tell you after when i'm done
13:26 - coding keep
13:27 - up up arrow and um
13:32 - you need um if the
13:35 - 880 is greater than the y position
13:39 - less than the y position then it will
13:45 - then that that's basically so it will
13:47 - not go
13:48 - if it's up so it'll let you go up
13:52 - will not let you pass this green grass
13:55 - so
13:56 - that's uh basically like a border so
13:58 - that's a coordinate
13:59 - so yours could be different
14:02 - but yeah so mine is just
14:05 - like this so change y by 10
14:08 - and you just have to duplicate this
14:16 - duplicate this throw this away
14:19 - throw this away put this inside of here
14:23 - instead you gotta change that's a down
14:25 - arrow
14:26 - in the y position
14:31 - so i just got to take this out and it's
14:33 - just a little bit different so
14:36 - so we have to use this one
14:40 - so um if the y position is greater than
14:45 - negative 90 so it's a y position
14:53 - and it will change y by
14:56 - negative
15:01 - [Music]
15:04 - and we'll be also working on some other
15:06 - code we have here
15:08 - so sorry about this guys
15:12 - um it's actually right arrow i forgot
15:15 - about to do that
15:16 - so it's left right up down so let's see
15:21 - so as you can see it works correctly so
15:25 - just start the game working
15:29 - so yeah
15:33 - okay so i also got to show you um it
15:36 - will
15:37 - not be able to cross into here or here
15:41 - so
15:41 - let me show you see look so yeah
15:46 - let's have some other code to do like
15:49 - when i receive
15:52 - start game will go forever
15:57 - and if then it's touching the power up
16:02 - so we do have the power up here we're
16:05 - touching
16:06 - power up the broadcast got power up so
16:10 - yeah
16:11 - god just got power up
16:22 - and it will also mess up some code
16:26 - so when i showed you the demo i had some
16:29 - trees so we'll be coding this and this
16:30 - will be the end of the video
16:32 - so when the green flag is clicked we'll
16:34 - hide
16:35 - let me show and when i start the game
16:40 - when i receive start game
16:43 - then i'll go forever
16:48 - it'll go forever it'll go next costume
16:52 - so
16:52 - i do have some costume to the tree trees
16:54 - a trees b
16:56 - three c three costume one basically
16:58 - costume two
16:59 - lesson three costume four costume five
17:02 - costume six so you don't have to have as
17:05 - much as i do
17:06 - but you can do that if you want to
17:10 - we'll give it in the google drive in the
17:11 - links in the description like
17:13 - what i said like earlier so then it'll
17:16 - go to
17:16 - a position to make it go here
17:21 - i'll repeat 50 times and change x
17:26 - by minus seven
17:32 - so that's the trees and we'll be working
17:35 - on the other things on part two
17:38 - so this change access to make the trees
17:41 - go backwards to
17:42 - make like looking the cars going forward
17:44 - and it's not set at this chain checks
17:47 - so um we'll be doing the rest in part
17:50 - part one two we might have a part three
17:53 - i'm not sure
17:55 - but yeah so then we can finish this game
17:59 - so i'm gonna i'm gonna select the skin
18:01 - hopefully select red
18:03 - so as you can see trees moving
18:07 - and yeah that's basically what it is so
18:10 - you're not done coding you'll finish the
18:12 - rest later
18:13 - please like share subscribe and comment
