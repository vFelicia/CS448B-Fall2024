00:06 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:09 - playground and today we'll be doing
00:11 - another video this time we'll be doing a
00:14 - video on Apple cash routine we'll be
00:17 - making an apple catcher came today and
00:19 - the objective of the game is to get 50
00:21 - points by catching apples so an Apple
00:27 - catcher game we will be learning these
00:28 - following concepts and scratch
00:30 - broadcasting messages using pick random
00:33 - variables operators and condition checks
00:37 - so without further ado let's head on to
00:41 - the tutorial okay so now first we can
00:47 - you rename this to apple hunter so you
00:56 - need to leet the cat sprite because we
00:58 - don't need it first we need upload some
01:02 - sprites and a backdrop we need the
01:05 - apples right
01:06 - we'll need the bull sprite and we need
01:12 - to paint a sprite the win the winning to
01:15 - let the player know that they won so you
01:17 - might want to pick like a red color I
01:20 - guess I'm gonna pick the marker fun
01:24 - because it's big and easy to see so you
01:29 - win so you want to Center it like that
01:40 - we might want to get a backdrop to I
01:43 - would pick the blue sky that looks great
01:46 - with the occasion game okay so let's
01:50 - start with the code for the Apple so you
01:54 - want to always start with one flat plate
01:56 - we want it to go to room in position set
02:02 - Y to 180 so it would be somewhere up
02:06 - here
02:13 - next you want to drag in a forever loop
02:16 - everything inside will go on forever
02:19 - then you wanted to change Y by negative
02:22 - seven so that means I'll make the Apple
02:24 - drop by negative seven every time change
02:29 - Y by negative 7 and then we need dragged
02:37 - in if-then statement if then it the
02:43 - position the Y position track this is
02:50 - equal to negative 178 which is somewhere
02:54 - around the bottom of the screen you want
02:58 - to go to a random position and reset
03:03 - back to one a set Y back to 180 next you
03:13 - want to get dragged in another if then
03:14 - statement this part is a check if the
03:18 - bowl is touching the Apple so we need to
03:21 - go to sensing dragon if touching block
03:24 - we need a selectable then we might want
03:28 - to play the sound
03:29 - chomp to give it a little effect we can
03:36 - and then we need to make a variable so
03:39 - our variable would be score to track how
03:43 - many points you get so you want to keep
03:46 - this check to show up right here so we
03:49 - want it to change score change score by
03:55 - pick random one to ten so you've got a
03:57 - random score every time every time you
04:03 - catch an apple so you want to select
04:05 - back to go to a random position so I'll
04:08 - reset again and set Y back to 180
04:18 - one-eighty will be around somewhere
04:21 - right here and next you want to do a 100
04:25 - and clicked if if the score is equal to
04:29 - 50 or greater than 50 so dragon if cliff
04:32 - like like to forever loop and you need
04:35 - to if then statement so Union also need
04:39 - some operators so you need your after
04:41 - the or if the score is greater than 50
04:46 - or equal to 50 so that means if the
04:49 - score is greater than 50 or equals than
04:54 - 50 equal to 50 because we need this part
05:00 - because we have a random right here if
05:03 - it picks random then it's not a
05:06 - guarantee it will be under 50 or equal
05:09 - to 50 when you broadcast a message after
05:12 - call it win and we need to broadcast
05:19 - this Apple has to receive the message
05:22 - win and whatever sees it it'll hide so
05:25 - it won't show on the backdrop anymore
05:28 - and then stop other scripts in the
05:31 - sprite so you weren't drinking to stop
05:33 - all click this other scripts in this
05:35 - straight so as you can see now if you do
05:40 - this
05:40 - this will stop the code for this part
05:43 - and this part so as you can see if we're
05:46 - done with the Apple now let's move on to
05:48 - the bull code so for the bowl first with
05:53 - the dragon if like legs we want the bowl
05:58 - to be somewhere down here and also be in
06:01 - the center so we might want to go zero
06:06 - negative 136 so it'll be even like
06:09 - straight through the center or we want
06:11 - to set the score 2-0 so you you won't
06:14 - start out with the score bigger than
06:17 - zero so you get an advantage so next
06:20 - we'll drag into forever loop we need to
06:25 - if-then statements
06:28 - so if then left we need go to sensing if
06:30 - then left arrow is pressed down that
06:33 - means it'll go left
06:34 - if the left arrow is pressed down we
06:37 - need to make it go left so pointing
06:39 - direction of negative 90 which is the
06:43 - left side right here and then next you
06:50 - want to change X by negative 10 that
06:52 - means it'll move to the left by negative
06:54 - 10 so and then we want to get another
07:06 - key pressed we want the right arrow this
07:09 - time and instead of changing X by
07:12 - negative negative 10 we need positive 10
07:15 - and instead of pointing direction of
07:16 - negative 90 we want to point in the
07:18 - direction of 90 so we'll change X by 10
07:22 - and then when it receives the message
07:26 - wind stopped other scripts in the sprite
07:29 - which means I'll stop this chunk of code
07:32 - right here and don't forget this step
07:37 - you will always want to set the bowl to
07:40 - this or else your bowl will flip upside
07:44 - down when you're playing and it won't
07:46 - look good and finally we want to go to
07:49 - the wind code so for the wind code we'll
07:54 - need to get a 1 clicked you'll go to 0 0
07:58 - and no hide we wanted to hide in the
08:07 - beginning because you don't want it to
08:08 - say win in the beginning even though
08:10 - they haven't even got one Apple yet so
08:13 - we need a dragon up the when I received
08:16 - when we wanted to show when it receives
08:19 - the message win and stop all everything
08:23 - stop all okay so now we have the whole
08:28 - game ready oh yeah and we also might
08:31 - want to set the Apple a bit small it's
08:33 - like size 75 so now when we play it Bob
08:39 - mom you catch an apple it place the
08:42 - chunks up and get a random score
08:45 - Bob and the score goes up Bop as you can
08:49 - see the score goes up right here
08:51 - every time the humming Apple Bob and
08:55 - when I reach over 52 or equal to 52
08:58 - it'll say if you win so thank you for
