00:06 - welcome back guys as kids coding click
00:09 - on here and today we're gonna work on
00:10 - another video called tree simulator so
00:13 - this is another um game which is simply
00:17 - easy really easy so in this tree
00:21 - simulator game today - today in this
00:24 - tutorial we are learning these concepts
00:26 - and scratch cloning loops and one stage
00:28 - clicked so this is a setup you can use
00:33 - that right here and set up the trees
00:38 - backdrop okay so since it's a game I'm
00:44 - gonna show you the demo as you can see
00:45 - you can plant trees wherever and then
00:47 - it's a pic random reason also pick
00:49 - random size and it dies later and it
00:53 - falls down that's basically the game so
01:00 - let's make a new project so it's fairly
01:09 - easy let's get the tree sprite so we can
01:14 - tree what tree one and we also got
01:17 - please so the background we also need we
01:25 - can change the backdrop we can use for
01:28 - us cuz it's dinner and like a forest
01:34 - yeah because that's where all the trees
01:36 - are so the backdrop has to have code the
01:38 - backdrop is when the stage is clicked
01:40 - cuz that's where you just want the tree
01:41 - wherever you go and then you need it if
01:44 - then else statement because it's a pic
01:46 - random it will you need to eat balls
01:53 - right here pick random one to two so cuz
02:05 - there's only two trees so when I create
02:09 - the clone of
02:11 - if it's number one it creates a clone of
02:13 - tree one else so create the clone of
02:16 - trees or tree - so tree wanted tree to
02:23 - have the same code so lips when you
02:27 - always start out with a thing I'm gonna
02:31 - make a hide and then when I start as a
02:37 - clone - that's when they start on the
02:39 - spawning it will show it'll go to
02:48 - wherever your mouse is so it's actually
02:50 - go to X Mouse X because that's where
02:53 - your mouse is and mouse why because it's
02:56 - a right where your analysis of where you
02:58 - click so we can set the size to 10%
03:03 - because it's really big right now well P
03:13 - we need a repeat I'll repeat this thing
03:22 - will tell you it'll pick random the size
03:24 - so LLL be pick random size from 5 to 10
03:35 - so the 5 and 10 is to repeat number of
03:43 - times of how big it's gonna be so you
03:49 - need to change size by 10 10 and then
03:54 - you're gonna let's make it wait 5
03:56 - seconds and we can make it repeat 9
04:01 - times so this is what it dies so we can
04:03 - make it repeat 9 times and turn display
04:07 - if I 10 degrees you can do a 90 degrees
04:11 - but it looks less animated so we can use
04:13 - that so it's really simple so we can
04:18 - save now we can also change the name 3
04:26 - and we can find out let's try it out you
04:31 - also have to duplicate this to the other
04:34 - tree or just basically you're just I
04:37 - think it's actually too big so we can
04:41 - take this dollar tree and this to the
04:43 - other tree open doesn't have it okay we
04:47 - can put this right here
04:52 - there it goes so I'll pick random it's
04:54 - just the same code then CD just grows
04:57 - random trees
04:58 - I found a buck inside the code so
05:11 - actually I forgot to change this it's
05:13 - actually supposed to be one because all
05:15 - the times they'll be on a certain type
05:17 - of trees but now it'll be all different
05:19 - types of trees in all different sizes so
05:24 - as you can see they flip over when they
05:27 - die and that's how you make it thank you
05:33 - for watching this and please like share
05:36 - and subscribe goodbye
