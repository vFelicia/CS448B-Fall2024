00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:10 - playground here and today we're back for
00:12 - another
00:13 - video so this is a space invader game so
00:17 - i'll show you in a minute
00:18 - but first i have to ask you about easter
00:21 - so easter i know um
00:24 - people still do easter hunting i'm
00:26 - pretty sure i don't know i haven't done
00:28 - easter hunting in six years
00:29 - so i don't really know um so
00:33 - easter hunting yeah i'm pretty sure some
00:36 - people still do that so
00:37 - come in the comment section below if you
00:39 - did easter hunting
00:40 - so it's great if you did so anyways
00:43 - let's get
00:44 - started so this is going to be the demo
00:47 - look there's scrolling stars on the
00:49 - background
00:51 - it's just a really cool thing for
00:55 - some stars and then there's a start
00:58 - button and there's
00:59 - arrows for switching so first you can
01:02 - click on this
01:04 - just to change the skin to this this
01:07 - this plenty of skins you can even use
01:10 - previous
01:10 - so you might go back there's a bunch of
01:13 - skins to choose from you guys can be
01:15 - creative
01:16 - i tried to go creative and color them
01:18 - random
01:20 - so it's a lot of skins i made so yeah
01:23 - so you just toggle these arrows to
01:25 - change to have your skin
01:27 - and click the start button
01:30 - so use the arrow keys to move you go up
01:34 - and down so
01:37 - i'm going so you see my shield in the
01:40 - top right
01:40 - i'm losing shield whenever i touch
01:42 - something it says you lost and
01:45 - oh yeah so whenever they touch something
01:48 - if you haven't noticed they change the
01:49 - color effect
01:50 - to make some extra detail like if you
01:54 - ever play minecraft and
01:55 - you hit something they have they turn
01:58 - the mob red so
01:59 - that's basically what we're doing so
02:03 - so here look you can shoot the lasers in
02:05 - the space key
02:06 - and then we'll kill the
02:10 - monsters so as you can see my score is
02:12 - going up
02:13 - right now so
02:16 - this is great uh and you can just
02:19 - go in the comments of my video or
02:22 - in my scratch project and comment what
02:26 - your high score was so you can go up
02:29 - down side right left up down
02:32 - so there's a lot of functions
02:36 - so anyways let's get started
02:41 - so first things first is to start out
02:43 - strong so
02:45 - first bye-bye
02:48 - second open backpack so i'm known for
02:51 - opening my backpack because that's how
02:54 - i am because i can't draw all of these
02:57 - in one video
02:58 - or else you'll be watching a time lapse
03:00 - of me drawing random spaceships
03:02 - so there's a bunch of costumes on this
03:04 - one so
03:05 - i already have all that you don't have
03:07 - to copy our costumes completely
03:09 - like this and this i just made up
03:14 - so so um you can get this one from the
03:17 - sprite
03:18 - library this one's from scratch too so
03:20 - we've been doing scratch for quite a
03:21 - while
03:22 - these are from scratch too this one we
03:24 - just downloaded from online so
03:26 - i'm gonna show you how to do it so i'm
03:27 - gonna go rocket ship
03:32 - so you need to go to costumes i bet all
03:35 - of you guys know how to do this
03:37 - you guys are great coders so you just
03:39 - have to do this
03:41 - bam bam bam bam
03:45 - just color it like
03:48 - the amount you want like what's your
03:50 - favorite color you can just color your
03:52 - spaceship that so it can
03:56 - be red it can be blue it doesn't matter
03:59 - what it
04:00 - would be because it depends on what your
04:02 - favorite color is so
04:04 - you could make this tip
04:07 - no block anymore because there's a
04:08 - starry background like
04:11 - i'm not red people like
04:15 - pink pinkish so look we made a spaceship
04:20 - this is alien activity so yeah
04:24 - so guys let's work on getting the rest
04:27 - of the sprites in
04:28 - so we have the alien
04:33 - we have the space oh we already got that
04:36 - we have the background which is the
04:38 - scroll
04:40 - and we have to get the right and left
04:42 - arrow keys
04:43 - so you just need one one of these
04:47 - and a start button which is just this
04:49 - button and we just write star on it so
04:52 - do that white text
04:57 - start
05:02 - put in the middle and then there you go
05:04 - a star button
05:06 - and then now we have to work on the
05:08 - start button first because that's how
05:10 - it codes everything and that's how you
05:12 - start everything
05:13 - okay so um i'm gonna put one arrow over
05:16 - here
05:17 - one arrow over here so they're both
05:20 - turning to the right just
05:21 - change the direction
05:24 - like that 90 is great
05:28 - so yeah really simple just make
05:31 - one pointing right and one pointing left
05:35 - and then move the start button to the
05:36 - middle i just like it up there looks
05:38 - cool
05:39 - so i'm going to go in the backdrop make
05:41 - a black
05:42 - backdrop so just this
05:45 - and black so
05:48 - just drag this and then it will fit in
05:51 - so now we have a black backdrop
05:53 - this is when all the stuff starts but
05:55 - first we gotta make
05:56 - the start button so don't get too
05:58 - excited on what we're gonna do oh that's
06:00 - gonna upgrade the laser
06:02 - laser so a lot of you wasn't asking me
06:04 - in rock blaster
06:05 - how do you get the laser where is the
06:07 - laser
06:08 - so where is the laser oh my god where's
06:10 - the laser so
06:12 - and so people are asking for where is
06:14 - the laser so
06:15 - you actually have to listen really
06:17 - really closely you see this right here
06:21 - it's button two so button two
06:25 - you should do the button two b and this
06:27 - is how you make
06:29 - the laser and you rename it the laser
06:32 - okay so that's how you guys make the
06:35 - laser
06:36 - but first we're gonna start on arrow one
06:39 - which is
06:40 - the one pointing to the left
06:46 - um so arrow one
06:50 - pointing to the left i mean yeah yeah
06:53 - running to the left so
06:54 - this one's gonna be pointing to the left
06:59 - so i'm gonna code this up so the green
07:01 - clock is clicked
07:02 - it will show so
07:06 - uh it'll switch this sprite
07:11 - sprite collect no broadcast go to
07:13 - previous
07:14 - previous costume so this will make it
07:17 - go back a costume so this is really
07:20 - tricky i didn't get this on my first try
07:22 - either
07:23 - so i'm pretty sure some of you guys
07:27 - are great coders out there and you guys
07:28 - can probably get there
07:33 - because
07:37 - oh wow put two o's go to previous
07:40 - costume
07:41 - and then then you also yeah start button
07:43 - right to start on the start button
07:45 - so sorry about that guys as you do it
07:47 - then this
07:48 - it'll go to zero zero which is just the
07:51 - middle i don't know i dragged it over
07:53 - there
07:53 - you just do that and then you go show
07:56 - and then when this right click this is
07:59 - the most
08:00 - important script that all this code so
08:03 - do
08:03 - not skip this part so when this right
08:06 - clicked
08:09 - broadcast new message
08:12 - start okay so start is going to be our
08:16 - key
08:18 - block here broadcast here so you have to
08:21 - have this because this is where it
08:22 - starts everything
08:24 - so some people sometimes skip the video
08:27 - so then they can get the
08:28 - parts for the code but this is really
08:30 - important
08:32 - hide and start it'll hide
08:35 - that's all you have and then
08:38 - i'm gonna go back to arrow one so when i
08:40 - receive
08:44 - so when i receive start hide
08:52 - so hide so that's for arrow one
08:56 - and then arrow two is pointing to this
08:59 - side
08:59 - so i'm gonna make a row two
09:03 - like this so when i receive start
09:10 - then it will hide once you're done
09:13 - selecting your skin
09:15 - and then when this is clicked
09:19 - it'll go to next costume so we gotta
09:21 - make a new
09:22 - message called go
09:25 - to next costume
09:30 - and then we're gonna do when the green
09:33 - vlog is clicked
09:35 - it will show so we're done with the
09:37 - arrows and the start button
09:39 - so now we gotta work on the spaceship
09:42 - for the skins
09:43 - and then we gotta work on the backdrop
09:45 - about the um
09:46 - scrolling so so when the green flag is
09:50 - clicked for the spaceship
09:53 - then it'll switch costume to space
09:55 - invaders
09:56 - because i honestly like this costume the
09:58 - best because it's from the internet
09:59 - yeah remember watch our google drive
10:01 - video because some people don't know how
10:02 - to download their google drive
10:04 - and we yeah just go to our channel and
10:07 - then get it
10:08 - and remember don't use your school
10:10 - account so
10:11 - basically we'll have everything on the
10:13 - google drive
10:15 - if you don't know how just go to my
10:16 - shared project export all the images and
10:18 - that's great
10:20 - that's that's also uh also a pretty good
10:23 - strategy as well so i'm going to switch
10:25 - this to space invaders because
10:27 - honestly the my favorite you know clear
10:29 - graphic effects
10:30 - because whenever you get hit it will
10:32 - change the color so
10:34 - so i want to clear all graphic effects
10:39 - set size to 40 percent set rotation
10:43 - style
10:44 - left right
10:48 - so it will not turn around when it moves
10:50 - up down right left
10:51 - whatever no goes hill
10:55 - zero never oh no here's already have
10:57 - another position
10:59 - and i gotta make variables
11:02 - but first i gotta yeah make variables so
11:06 - score of course
11:12 - uh and shield
11:19 - so shield i'm gonna drag shield to this
11:23 - side
11:24 - because that's how i even out my
11:25 - variables all the time so
11:27 - when i receive start oh so
11:31 - it says shield to something i didn't
11:33 - even put it here yet
11:34 - so set score to zero
11:40 - shield to 100 you can make a thousand if
11:42 - you want to a billion
11:44 - it depends on you so next
11:47 - we're gonna make the skins so whenever
11:50 - when i receive
11:51 - go to next costume
11:54 - then it'll go to next costume that's
11:56 - obvious
11:58 - and then so this is the tricky part for
12:01 - the
12:02 - previous costumes so please do not skip
12:03 - this part as well
12:06 - they got a previous costume and then
12:08 - said
12:09 - switch costume
12:14 - to costume number
12:17 - minus one
12:24 - costume number minus one because
12:27 - you have to go to the previous costume
12:29 - because if i'm on space invaders you'll
12:31 - go to this blue rocket
12:33 - and if you click the previous button
12:34 - again it'll go to this rocket and then
12:36 - this rocket so
12:38 - so you got to do when i received go to
12:40 - previous costume
12:43 - so yeah so i'm going to do
12:46 - the when i start here so when i start
12:49 - oh my god still in that forever loop
12:55 - so when i start
13:03 - it will go forever why is it always
13:06 - highlighted for some reason
13:08 - it doesn't matter it's not doing
13:10 - anything to affect me
13:12 - so if an edge bounce
13:16 - and then you need it if then
13:21 - key right arrow clicked press
13:24 - same thing
13:27 - then it will change x by 10
13:31 - and you just duplicate that to make
13:36 - the left arrow which is -10
13:40 - and then and then
13:43 - after that you're going to put the up
13:45 - arrow
13:47 - the thing the thing that you gotta
13:50 - change the y instead of x so
13:54 - so up arrow it will change
13:58 - y
14:01 - and then down arrow will be negative y
14:06 - negative 10 y and then that's down arrow
14:10 - so
14:12 - and then now we have to work on the
14:13 - background so this is about the scroll
14:17 - on the stars so i'm going to show you
14:19 - how it works first so
14:20 - so as you can see you can select your
14:22 - skin so i'm going to select the skin
14:25 - you can previous buttons also working so
14:28 - i'm going to suck this skin and then you
14:29 - can click the start button nothing
14:31 - happens yet
14:32 - but you can move around and then we
14:34 - haven't fixed the galaxy things yet
14:36 - so yeah this is basically what we have
14:39 - right now
14:39 - and now we're going to work on the
14:41 - background
14:43 - the background so i'm going to change
14:45 - the name of this from untitled 13 to
14:49 - um space ship
14:53 - add spaceship
15:00 - i think this is it
15:04 - okay
15:07 - so this adventure game
15:11 - okay so same sorry
15:15 - game um so now let's do the backdrop
15:18 - so this is how you do the backdrop
15:22 - so you just do a black screen
15:27 - and you got to make star so are
15:29 - obviously not going to use this one
15:30 - because
15:31 - that's how it is you make a circle
15:37 - and use the reshape tool to shape this
15:40 - thing up
15:49 - see how this looks like a star right so
15:52 - great we just have to duplicate these
15:55 - and then make a lot of them around
15:59 - so ctrl c ctrl v but do not put them
16:02 - up too close or else you'll cut a star
16:05 - in half
16:06 - because if you put them up there a new a
16:09 - new clone is coming down already
16:11 - so if you put one up there one of the
16:12 - stars will probably be cut off
16:16 - so just scatter them around the place
16:20 - so try to put it around there don't put
16:22 - it up okay
16:24 - well you can if you want to but chances
16:26 - are they will get cut off
16:28 - so let's talk about the coding
16:31 - for background so let's just delete
16:34 - sprite one and then i'm gonna go to the
16:38 - background
16:39 - and it'll work on the code so when the
16:41 - green flag is clicked
16:43 - it will go to back layer
16:49 - uh where's that go to back layer yeah
16:52 - this one
16:52 - so go to back layer it'll go to x00
17:01 - i'll create clone of myself
17:06 - i'll go forever taking the laggy forever
17:08 - again
17:09 - and then you need if then else so
17:12 - if then uh the y position
17:18 - is greater
17:23 - than negative 340
17:28 - then it will change y by minus three so
17:32 - it will go down
17:33 - slowly so change y by
17:37 - and then it will go to x
17:42 - three fifty and then now
17:45 - we have to do what i start as a clone
17:48 - so when i start as a clone
17:51 - go to x350 just this
17:56 - and then go to back layer
18:01 - this right here
18:04 - back layer and i'll go forever to laggy
18:08 - forever
18:09 - but i can just take that from here again
18:11 - so it's basically the same code it is
18:14 - the same code never mind and then that's
18:16 - how it is so
18:17 - look a scrolling background is coming
18:21 - down
18:22 - this looks nice right and there's the
18:25 - start button you can switch your skins
18:27 - around
18:28 - previous button let's select this skin i
18:30 - don't know why
18:31 - let's start you can move around so we
18:33 - haven't coded much
18:34 - yet but i'll see you guys in the second
18:37 - part because we're obviously having a
18:38 - second part of this already 18 minutes
18:40 - and 32 seconds
18:41 - 33 now 34 now 35 now so same thing
18:44 - yeah seconds past really quickly so
18:46 - anyways
