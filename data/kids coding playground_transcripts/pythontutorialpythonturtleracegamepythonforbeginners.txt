00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground we're back with another
00:10 - python tutorial
00:11 - it's been a while so we're gonna make a
00:13 - turtle racing game today
00:14 - not really a game so like um the turtle
00:18 - can like
00:18 - move around and when it gets to the
00:20 - finish line you can guess
00:22 - which one wins and stuff like that so
00:24 - yeah so we're gonna start a new trinket
00:26 - python we're gonna rename this trinket
00:30 - first let's name it um turtle race
00:35 - so turtle race and then we'll go i'm
00:38 - gonna
00:39 - zoom into the code a little bit more so
00:41 - you guys can see it better
00:43 - so first we're going to import the
00:44 - turtle library so we're going to do it
00:46 - by
00:46 - import oops click in here
00:49 - import turtle
00:52 - so import turtle and then we're also
00:54 - going to import the time library which
00:56 - is like the wait
00:57 - pluck and scratch import time so we're
01:00 - going to do that as well
01:02 - and let's go down two lines and then
01:04 - we're going to import the actual
01:06 - object turtle so we're going to import
01:08 - the turtle object from the turtle iber
01:10 - library so we're going to do this
01:12 - from tur turtle
01:15 - um import turtle
01:19 - with a capital t okay from turtle
01:22 - library we're going to import the object
01:24 - so and then we're gonna also
01:26 - import random we're gonna from random
01:29 - we're gonna import the random int okay
01:31 - so
01:32 - from random
01:35 - uh library we're gonna import
01:44 - [Music]
01:49 - and after that we're going to get the
01:51 - screen so we're going to
01:52 - backdrop screen is equal to
01:56 - turtle turtle
02:00 - dot screen and click parentheses
02:05 - and then we're going to do turtle
02:09 - is equal so this um library turtle is
02:12 - equal
02:12 - to the object turtle
02:14 - [Music]
02:16 - like that okay so after this we're going
02:20 - to set up the grass for the background
02:21 - so we're gonna have some grass
02:22 - as the background so right here we have
02:25 - all the colors for the turtle
02:27 - so you can pause the video and use
02:29 - whatever color you want when we get
02:30 - there
02:31 - so we have um
02:34 - we're going to set the backdrop to force
02:37 - green like the
02:38 - color the grass so we're going to do
02:41 - screen
02:42 - dot bg color
02:46 - screen dot bg color and we're going to
02:47 - set it before a screen
02:52 - and some of these colors might not work
02:53 - but because this is for css
02:55 - colors but some of them do work so like
02:57 - you can pick some right here
02:59 - as you can see you can pause the video
03:01 - if you'd like
03:03 - okay after that we're going to set the
03:05 - turtle color
03:07 - to white so this turtle we're using to
03:08 - draw is the turtle library
03:11 - not the actual turtle we're going to be
03:12 - using to race so we'll show you the end
03:15 - product that
03:15 - we'll show you the product at the end
03:18 - the result of this game so then after
03:20 - this we're going to set the turtle color
03:22 - to white because we want to write turtle
03:23 - rays
03:24 - up here we're going to write turtle
03:29 - dot color and then we're going to do
03:33 - parentheses um uh
03:36 - quotation marks once so like that
03:41 - you can add a semicolon if you would
03:43 - like and then after that we're going to
03:45 - do
03:46 - turtle dot
03:49 - speed is equal to zero
03:52 - and zero like that and after that we're
03:56 - going to make the turtle pen up so then
03:57 - it won't draw
03:58 - so we're going to make it draw once we
04:00 - do pen down
04:02 - so we're going to do turtle dot
04:05 - pen up and up so like if you don't
04:09 - do pan up it'll already start drawing
04:12 - and then we're going to make the turtle
04:13 - go to this position negative 250
04:16 - 150 somewhere right here so then we're
04:18 - going to write turtle race somewhere
04:20 - right here
04:21 - okay so we're gonna write turtle
04:26 - goat oops dot go to
04:31 - dot go to and then we're gonna do
04:33 - negative 120
04:35 - and the other position is 150.
04:38 - so you guys can pick whatever coordinate
04:40 - you think is best for you
04:41 - then we're going to do turtle dot right
04:45 - and we're going to write turtle race
04:48 - quotation marks turtle let's make it all
04:52 - caps
04:54 - turtle race and then we're going to put
04:57 - a comma
04:59 - and we're going to set the font to ariel
05:00 - you guys can set whatever font i don't
05:02 - know what the fonts are but i just need
05:04 - arial
05:05 - font is equal to put another parenthesis
05:08 - quotation mark ariel ariel
05:12 - and we want it to be 20 size so that
05:15 - one's 20 size
05:16 - and we want it to be bold so you can do
05:19 - this
05:20 - you guys can do anything you want you
05:21 - don't have to make it bold i just made
05:22 - it bold so it looks better
05:25 - except for this we're going to make it
05:28 - pen up
05:28 - so after it's done writing it we're
05:30 - going to make it pin up turtle
05:32 - dot pen up
05:36 - oops i still put this pen
05:40 - up and then do this
05:43 - and add something right here
05:46 - okay and after this we're gonna set up
05:48 - the dirt
05:49 - so we're gonna have some dirt over here
05:52 - like we're gonna add like some brown
05:54 - dirt so we're gonna make the turtle go
05:57 - to negative 200 negative 150 first
05:59 - so somewhere about like right here so
06:01 - start drawing from here
06:02 - so what we want to do is make it draw
06:04 - from here all the way to here
06:07 - and then come down and then draw with
06:09 - this then all this area will be brown
06:12 - so we're going to do turtle dot go to
06:16 - negative 200 negative 200 and
06:20 - we're gonna do negative 150 for the y um
06:23 - and then after that we're going to do
06:26 - actually
06:27 - uh yeah so negative 200 negative 150 you
06:30 - guys can do whatever coordinate you
06:31 - would like
06:32 - and then we're going to set the color to
06:34 - chocolate remember we still have a
06:35 - python color
06:36 - so we're going to make like a brown
06:37 - color i'm going to pick chocolate you
06:39 - guys can pick whatever color you would
06:41 - like
06:41 - and she did chocolate and then we're
06:44 - going to do
06:45 - [Music]
06:46 - turtle dot color
06:49 - is chocolate so we're gonna do this
06:55 - chocolate and then after this
06:59 - we want to get let the turtle begin to
07:03 - fill this area with brown
07:04 - so we're going to do turtle
07:08 - dot begin underscore
07:11 - fill and then we can put this
07:14 - in semifinal okay
07:18 - and then after this we're going to get
07:21 - uh the pen down so we're going to make a
07:22 - pen down so it'll start drawing so
07:25 - turtle dot pen down
07:28 - and then we're going to put this so it's
07:30 - going to begin drawing the brown
07:33 - so we're going to make a move 400
07:34 - forward so from here we made it go to
07:36 - negative 200 negative 150
07:38 - so move 400 it'll move all the way to
07:40 - the other side so 400 is like about
07:42 - right here
07:43 - and then we're gonna make it uh so let's
07:46 - enter
07:48 - so let's write so we're gonna make it
07:51 - move
07:52 - forward by um 400 so we're going to
07:59 - dot forward
08:03 - forward and then we're gonna put the
08:05 - parentheses
08:09 - and after that we're going to make it
08:11 - turn right so as you can see when i run
08:12 - it right now
08:13 - it says turtle race and has the green so
08:15 - as you can see the turtle moved all the
08:16 - way right here
08:18 - so we wanted to make it turn right it's
08:20 - kind of hard to see but if you can see
08:21 - over here
08:22 - right here um so we want to make it turn
08:25 - right so then it will move down here
08:26 - and then go back all the way back so
08:29 - we're going to make it turn right
08:30 - 90 degrees 90 degrees because um the 90
08:34 - degrees turn right here
08:35 - so if you were in this position you
08:37 - would be turning right
08:39 - okay so after this we're going to
08:43 - enter so i kind of need to scroll down
08:46 - right here
08:48 - i don't think it's letting me scroll
08:49 - down so you guys have to look down here
08:51 - and then we're going to have to make it
08:53 - turn right by 90 degrees so
08:55 - turtle dot right by 90 degrees
09:00 - and after that we're going to get uh
09:02 - turtle forward by 60 so
09:04 - 60 is like about from here to here so
09:06 - we're going to make him move 60 degrees
09:08 - and then move back so
09:09 - we're going to turtle turtle
09:14 - dot forward by
09:17 - 60. so we can move 60 steps
09:22 - and then we're gonna make it turn right
09:24 - again so if you're down here
09:26 - you're facing down so turn right you
09:28 - move this way again so we're gonna do
09:29 - turtle
09:32 - dot right 90 degrees
09:36 - oops so we have the turtle turning 90
09:40 - degrees
09:41 - okay so after that we want to make it
09:44 - move back 400
09:46 - and then we're gonna end the fill so
09:48 - we're going to turn forward 400.4
09:54 - for word 400
09:58 - and we'll do that and then we're going
10:01 - to turtle.end
10:02 - the field so we're going to finish the
10:03 - fill
10:06 - end underscore fill
10:12 - okay so now let's play it as you can see
10:16 - it says turtle race the background is
10:18 - green and the dirt right here has been
10:20 - filled
10:21 - okay so now we're gonna work on the
10:24 - turtles we're gonna work on the turtle
10:27 - and the finish line next
10:28 - but uh before we continue i'm pretty
10:30 - sure in some previous python tutorials
10:33 - we mentioned that um you can comment out
10:35 - stuff
10:36 - so that's what i'm going to do right now
10:38 - so i will show you guys how to do it
10:39 - i'll
10:40 - i'll comment it so it's easier guys for
10:42 - you to understand so right here this is
10:44 - importing
10:46 - the turtle object
10:50 - i'm just trying to make it easier for
10:52 - you guys to understand from
10:53 - the turtle library
10:59 - the library and we're importing
11:02 - the rand int from
11:05 - the random library
11:10 - okay so now this is what we have right
11:12 - here importing the turtle so i just
11:14 - commented it out so you guys can
11:16 - see what it's about and then right here
11:18 - we are drawing the background we're
11:20 - setting up
11:21 - set up the
11:25 - grass green background and then right
11:27 - here
11:28 - in this area we're going to set up the
11:30 - dirt or
11:32 - set set up
11:35 - the dirt which is the brown stuff right
11:38 - here
11:39 - okay so that's what we have right now we
11:42 - will
11:44 - i will add more comments as we continue
11:47 - so i don't know why it's not letting me
11:50 - scroll down
11:50 - but i guess i can make a couple more
11:53 - answers and then you can see right here
11:55 - okay so next we are going to be working
11:58 - on the finish line so
12:00 - i'm gonna make a comment real quick set
12:04 - up finish line so we're gonna set up the
12:08 - finish line and then we want to make the
12:10 - square size 15 we don't want to make it
12:12 - any more or less because
12:13 - 15 is just the right size if it's 20 it
12:16 - might be
12:17 - spaced out a little bit more and might
12:19 - go off the screen
12:20 - so we do not want that to happen so
12:22 - we're going to set a variable
12:24 - square size underscore size
12:28 - and then we're going to make it uh 15
12:31 - equals
12:31 - to 15. okay so next we're gonna define
12:35 - another variable
12:36 - okay so actually the square is the
12:39 - square size
12:41 - um it's the default square size for the
12:43 - turtle so
12:44 - it's 15 by 15 but you can change it but
12:46 - if you do 20s it'll get spaced out so
12:49 - it'll not fit on the screen so it
12:50 - doesn't look great so we're going to do
12:51 - 15
12:52 - as the one we want so next we want to
12:56 - get
12:56 - a finish line so we're going to make the
12:59 - finish line
13:00 - underscore line another variable finish
13:03 - line at
13:04 - 170 so that's going to be like somewhere
13:06 - right here
13:08 - on the x position and then
13:11 - we're going to make the color of the
13:13 - squares black so we're going to do
13:17 - turtle dot color
13:20 - turtle.color and then we're gonna do
13:22 - black
13:24 - so you guys can do whatever color you
13:26 - want i just picked the black color
13:28 - um and then next we can get
13:31 - a turtle.shape we want it to be a square
13:34 - the finish line
13:35 - you can make it any shape you want
13:37 - pretty much
13:38 - shape and then square so square
13:43 - and add a second column here and then
13:46 - down here we're going to add a couple
13:48 - more enters so you guys can see
13:50 - and after this we are going to work on
13:53 - the repeat loops but before i show that
13:55 - oh yeah and we need the pen up i forgot
13:57 - about that we have to do turtle dot
13:59 - pen up and then we're going to work on
14:01 - some repeat loops to make
14:03 - this process of stamping black squares
14:05 - much quicker than it is
14:07 - so i'm not going to use it right now i'm
14:10 - going to show you guys
14:11 - how how much code you need to do it
14:14 - without the stamping
14:15 - it takes a lot so i'm going to show a
14:17 - section
14:18 - okay so start here so we're going to do
14:21 - turtle
14:22 - dot go to you will see that it's not
14:26 - very efficient
14:27 - go to and then we're going to do 170
14:30 - 140 140
14:35 - oops and then next we're going to do
14:39 - and then we're going okay so next you
14:42 - wanna
14:43 - let's go to another position so we're
14:45 - gonna keep on stamping down we're gonna
14:47 - add a little section
14:48 - in the middle that's not shaded so first
14:51 - we're gonna stamp this one
14:55 - turtle.stamp and then we're going to do
14:58 - turtle
15:00 - dot go to and then we're going to do 170
15:03 - 110 so we're going to make a little gap
15:05 - for like a like some space
15:09 - and then we're going to stamp again
15:16 - okay so when you run it as you can see
15:19 - there's a little space we want to make
15:20 - two layers of them
15:22 - as you can see it's not very efficient
15:23 - you have to do it for the whole line and
15:25 - we're gonna have to do another line of
15:26 - those
15:27 - so i'll show you an another part of it
15:29 - another little section
15:30 - of it so this is like the second line of
15:33 - this
15:34 - so we're gonna do turtle dot
15:37 - go to oh yeah and i can comment this out
15:40 - before i show
15:41 - and then um i'm gonna comment this out
15:43 - real quick so you can do control slash
15:45 - to come and add the whole line
15:46 - let's highlight it in control slash so
15:49 - i'm going to be
15:50 - um showing you the other line so turtle
15:53 - dot
15:54 - go to and then we're going to go to 185
15:58 - 125 and these are just some coordinates
16:02 - you can
16:02 - get whatever you want you know you
16:04 - actually should not you don't have to
16:05 - code this part
16:06 - we'll be working on a loop to make it
16:08 - more efficient
16:10 - and then after that we're going to do
16:11 - program dot stamp
16:14 - and then we're going to do this
16:17 - and after that we're going to get turtle
16:21 - dot go to as you can see it's not very
16:23 - efficient you have to keep on typing or
16:25 - copy pasting it
16:26 - and there's a much quicker way to do it
16:28 - and we will show you
16:29 - later and then we have
16:33 - turtle dot stamp
16:36 - again that so as you can see
16:39 - i commented this out so now you see
16:41 - there's two lanes
16:43 - so let's uncomment this real quick so
16:46 - you can do control slash again
16:48 - so as you can see we want like a lane
16:50 - right here and a lane right here it's
16:51 - going to take a long time to do
16:54 - so this code is not very necessary so we
16:56 - can take this out
16:57 - and i'll show you guys how to do a loop
16:58 - on how to make it way more efficient
17:01 - so let's start on the loop
17:05 - so on the loop we're going to make two
17:07 - repeat loops
17:08 - so for i in range you can basically pick
17:12 - any letter you'd like i'm just going to
17:13 - do i
17:15 - so for index in range
17:19 - for i in range and then we're going to
17:22 - do 10 that means repeat it 10 times
17:26 - um has to be colon not a semicolon this
17:28 - one has to be a colon because it's a
17:29 - loop
17:30 - and then you tap enter and then we're
17:32 - going to do turtle
17:33 - dot go to so this part requires a little
17:36 - bit math
17:37 - and then we have to finish line
17:40 - so right now we defend define finish
17:42 - line as 170 so that's the value of
17:44 - finish line you can think of this as a
17:46 - variable like x or y
17:48 - so infinite x is equal to 170 let's say
17:51 - that
17:51 - and then we're going to put a comma
17:54 - and then we're going to make another one
17:57 - of these
17:58 - another uh parentheses and then we're
18:00 - gonna add space actually
18:02 - i'm gonna do 140 minus
18:06 - and then we can put another one in here
18:09 - so um
18:12 - put one in here sorry so you put one in
18:15 - here and then
18:16 - i we're going to do i multiply
18:21 - multiply by square size so square size
18:24 - we have defined it as 15 up here
18:28 - as you can see square size and then
18:29 - we're going to multiply
18:31 - it by two okay
18:35 - okay so right here we have the
18:36 - turtle.go2 finish line is 170. so this
18:39 - is finding the coordinates
18:40 - 170. so let's say all right i always
18:43 - starts out as zero in python
18:44 - so we can substitute the i as zero so
18:48 - zero multiplied by fifteen is zero
18:50 - fifteen multiple zero multiplied by two
18:52 - is zero so one forty minus zero is zero
18:55 - so i mean for 140 sorry 140 minus zero
18:57 - is 140.
18:58 - so this becomes 170 and 140 that's the
19:01 - coordinate so let's say i was
19:03 - one so the next index would be one it
19:06 - would just keep on going up
19:07 - so then it'll be 170 finish line is 170
19:10 - so 140
19:11 - minus 1 times 15 is 15 15 times 2 is
19:15 - 30 so 140 minus 30 is 110 so the next
19:18 - coordinate would be 170
19:20 - and 110 and then so on so you see the
19:22 - pattern it goes down by
19:24 - 30 every time so let's what if this is 2
19:27 - so if i is 2 2 multiplied by the square
19:30 - size is 15
19:31 - so 30 30 multiplied by 2 is 60 and then
19:34 - 170
19:35 - is the finish line so 140 minus 60 is
19:38 - 80. so
19:39 - the coordinate will be 170 and 80. so
19:42 - i hope you guys understand what that is
19:45 - so
19:46 - and this is the subtract so 140 is
19:49 - subtracting of whatever this value
19:51 - is i'm actually going to put a space
19:54 - between here so it's more easier to see
19:56 - like that okay so next we're going to
20:00 - write
20:00 - turtle.stamp so it can actually stamp
20:06 - and then we're going to make another
20:08 - loop for
20:09 - the second row as you can see it already
20:11 - created one row we're going to make a
20:12 - second row
20:13 - we're repeating 10 times for the first
20:16 - line but for the second line we can
20:17 - repeat nine times
20:18 - and then for the second one you can call
20:20 - it anything you want again
20:22 - you can even do i could do j you can do
20:24 - z so i'm just going to do j
20:26 - for the sake so you guys can understand
20:28 - it better for
20:29 - j in range what you're going to do nine
20:32 - times
20:34 - instead so in the back we're only gonna
20:35 - do nine
20:37 - oh yeah and not a semicolon sorry keep
20:38 - on putting a semicolon or hit the shift
20:40 - key
20:41 - so you have to hold down the shift to
20:42 - get the colon so this because this is a
20:44 - repeat loop and then this is going to be
20:46 - different than the first one so we're
20:48 - going to turtle
20:48 - dot go to and then of course there's a
20:52 - finish line
20:53 - defined as 170 and then we want to add
20:56 - the square size which is 15
20:58 - to the finish line and then we're going
21:02 - to i'm sorry not 15 square size not
21:06 - because we already have the variable
21:07 - defined you guys can just use the
21:09 - variable
21:10 - i'm going to put another parentheses so
21:14 - uh 140 we're gonna put two actually 140
21:18 - minus
21:20 - minus the square size
21:23 - and then we're going to add a
21:25 - subtraction sign
21:26 - in the middle actually take out one of
21:28 - these so we have
21:30 - this we have the 140 minus square size
21:34 - we'll add the other parentheses later
21:36 - sorry about that
21:37 - so we have the 140 square size and then
21:39 - we're going to subtract
21:40 - it by j
21:44 - which is the right here j in range
21:48 - j multiply whatever the j value is
21:51 - like zero because it starts at zero
21:53 - square size
21:56 - times two okay
21:59 - so right here i think we need to add
22:01 - some more parentheses
22:03 - let me add a couple more parentheses i
22:05 - think you have to add i accidentally
22:06 - deleted them sorry about that
22:08 - i wanted to let you guys see it better
22:10 - so we have to add the parentheses back
22:12 - now
22:13 - that and one more okay so
22:16 - we have three on this side and two on
22:18 - this side okay
22:20 - so what this is is basically kind of
22:23 - similar
22:23 - so finish line is 170 square size is 15
22:26 - like i said
22:27 - so 170 plus 15 is 185 and then we have
22:31 - the 140 minus the square size so this is
22:33 - going to be a little bit different this
22:34 - is the back lane
22:36 - so 140 minus square size is going to be
22:38 - 125
22:40 - so and then j is 0 first so 0 times
22:43 - 15 0 15 times i mean 0 times 2
22:46 - is also 0. so 1 125 minus a 0 is 125
22:52 - so that's the first coordinate is going
22:54 - to be 185
22:55 - 125. okay let's say j was one
22:58 - we're going to substitute j with one
23:01 - then
23:01 - the x position would be 185 because you
23:04 - have
23:04 - the finish line and plus the square size
23:07 - and then right here we have
23:09 - 95 because 140 minus the square size
23:12 - and then you minus whatever this value
23:14 - is and then finally
23:16 - it just goes on for nine different times
23:19 - and let's just say j was two
23:21 - finish line 170 plus square size would
23:24 - be the same would be 185
23:26 - 140 minus 15 would be 125 and then 125
23:30 - minus 2 times square size is 30 30 times
23:34 - 2 is 60
23:35 - and you minus then it'll be 65 125 minus
23:38 - that
23:39 - is going to be 65 as you can see
23:43 - so that there's a bit math there's some
23:45 - math into this coding
23:47 - and then we're going to do turtle dot
23:49 - stamp
23:51 - and then we're gonna do this so let's
23:53 - run
23:54 - as you can see there's two lanes and
23:56 - turtle race and that so this is all the
23:58 - code we have so far
23:59 - so i'm going to i guess i can make a
24:03 - comment right here
24:06 - so let's make a comment let's say set up
24:08 - the finish line
24:09 - let's start up here actually i already
24:11 - have the setup finish line this is just
24:13 - stamping the finish line let's name it
24:15 - stamp
24:16 - the line like that
24:20 - okay so for you guys to understand it
24:22 - more easier
24:23 - and you should save your project as
24:25 - always
24:26 - when you have a lot of stuff you should
24:28 - always save your project
24:30 - okay let's make it back bigger okay
24:33 - okay next we want to do turtle.hi turtle
24:37 - so after it's done stamping all this we
24:39 - want to hide the turtle library so we're
24:41 - going to turtle
24:42 - dot hide turtle i'm gonna do that
24:49 - okay and let me add a semicolon right
24:53 - here it's optional
24:54 - remember that and then um right here
24:57 - we're gonna set up the turtles
24:59 - to the color so we're going to do
25:02 - setup i'm going to give you like a
25:06 - little
25:07 - comment set up
25:10 - somewhere here and then we're going to
25:12 - my turtle one
25:15 - one equals turtle
25:19 - turtle which is the turtle object
25:23 - okay and next
25:27 - this is defining the variable and then
25:29 - we're going to do my
25:32 - turtle dot speed
25:38 - uh one sorry my turtle one so we're
25:40 - dividing these as one two three and four
25:42 - we're gonna put
25:42 - four turtles and then um
25:46 - dot speed to figure out the speed equals
25:49 - two zero speed
25:53 - and then we're gonna do zero with that
25:57 - and then we're going to add
26:01 - my turtle color red so we're going to
26:02 - make the first turtle right so by
26:04 - turtle one and then
26:07 - dot color it's going to be
26:10 - red
26:14 - and then i'm going to add more spaces so
26:16 - you guys can see
26:17 - and then my turtle
26:21 - dot one oops one dot
26:24 - next we can do the shape so we want the
26:27 - shape to be
26:28 - the shape of a turtle obviously like
26:31 - that
26:34 - and then we're gonna do um pen up my
26:38 - turtle
26:40 - dot pen one dot pen up
26:45 - okay so that is going to draw the turtle
26:48 - and then we're going to make it go to
26:49 - this position one
26:52 - dot go to i'll make it go to negative
26:56 - 170
26:58 - 100 and space
27:01 - and then you can pen down after this i
27:04 - can do my total one dot pen down
27:10 - okay so now i can just uh copy paste
27:13 - all of this um to make
27:16 - the different uh ones so as you can see
27:19 - it draws the first turtle the red one
27:22 - so i can just copy paste this to make
27:24 - all the different turtles i'm gonna put
27:25 - four turtles
27:26 - if you guys can put as much as you would
27:28 - like i'm just gonna do four for the sake
27:30 - of time
27:31 - and then we're gonna copy paste this and
27:34 - we're gonna have to change
27:35 - the number of the total so we're gonna a
27:37 - couple lines
27:38 - and then right here we're gonna do my
27:40 - turtle two is equal to turtle object
27:43 - two and this should be two as well
27:47 - to to just change all this to two and
27:50 - then we're going to change the
27:51 - coordinates and the color
27:55 - to and remember you guys can change it
27:57 - to whatever color you
27:58 - want i'm just going to change it to what
28:00 - colors i had
28:02 - and then right here we're gonna i'm
28:03 - gonna put the second one as a yellow
28:05 - turtle
28:07 - and then we're also going to change the
28:10 - x and y position so right here i'm doing
28:11 - 50 as the i'm going down by 50 for each
28:16 - turtle
28:16 - as you can see so this is my second
28:18 - turtle let's copy paste this
28:20 - we're gonna make the third turtle okay
28:23 - we're almost done and then
28:26 - my turtle three so we can change all
28:29 - this to three
28:33 - three three three
28:36 - oh yeah let's do that three
28:42 - three there's
28:45 - three and three so we got all the
28:48 - turtles
28:49 - and then we're gonna change the x uh y
28:52 - position so we're gonna make it zero
28:53 - we're going down by fifty and we're
28:54 - gonna change the color
28:56 - to cyan any color you'd like i didn't
28:58 - want to pick green color because the
29:00 - background is already green
29:02 - so just pick a cyan color and then my
29:05 - turtle for
29:08 - ctrl c
29:12 - ctrl v okay so we have the my turtle 4.
29:14 - now we can just
29:15 - use the down key if you want to go
29:17 - faster
29:24 - okay so it changes all to four and then
29:27 - we're gonna
29:28 - um change the color to purple so this is
29:31 - the fourth
29:32 - this is gonna be the fourth turtle and
29:35 - then we're going to make it negative 50.
29:39 - okay and then it's okay so we have all
29:41 - the turtles let's play
29:42 - as you can see they're not racing yet
29:44 - because we did not
29:46 - make the move yet so we will now so
29:49 - right now we're gonna do time
29:50 - we're gonna add this at least waiting
29:52 - one second before the game starts
29:54 - so time dot sleep and then
29:57 - we're gonna put parentheses one second
29:59 - so it's gonna wait one second before
30:01 - starting up the race
30:04 - and then i'm gonna put another comment
30:05 - right here let's go move turtles
30:10 - let's move to turtles for i in range so
30:13 - we're going to make another loop
30:14 - for i in range so we're going to make
30:17 - this repeat 110 times do this
30:22 - 110 times and colon because it's a loop
30:26 - so my turtle one
30:29 - my turtle one dot forward
30:32 - and then we're gonna make it a random
30:34 - one to five steps pick random so rand
30:37 - ins one to five put this one
30:41 - to five and you just copy paste this a
30:45 - couple times
30:49 - let's tap to tab
30:52 - and tap okay so now we have them we're
30:55 - going to have to change
30:56 - the numbers two three
30:59 - and four so now we have all the
31:03 - different ones
31:04 - so my turtle one two three and four
31:08 - okay it looks like we're finished now
31:10 - let's play
31:12 - as you can see the turtles are moving so
31:14 - you can bet with your friends which
31:16 - turtle you want to win and stuff like
31:17 - that
31:18 - so as you can see the yellow turtle won
31:19 - right now
