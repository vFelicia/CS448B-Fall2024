00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello and welcome back to kids coming
00:09 - playground today we'll be doing another
00:10 - project in scratch so this is going to
00:12 - be our brick breaker version 2 on
00:14 - scratch so about two years ago we made a
00:17 - brick breaker version one so this is our
00:19 - version two it's much more advanced the
00:21 - game looks much better there's a lot
00:23 - more effects going on so without further
00:26 - ado let's run the project brick breaker
00:28 - version two
00:30 - so start it
00:31 - so as you can see when you hit the ball
00:33 - there's like a trail behind the ball
00:35 - and when you lose there's also a cool
00:37 - losing effect that says game over
00:40 - and then next you have uh when you play
00:42 - it i'm trying to win this time so you
00:44 - can see when you when you start the game
00:45 - all the bricks it looks really cool when
00:47 - they come in
00:49 - and as you can see every time you hit
00:50 - the ball the paddle also changes color
00:52 - effect and when you take out the bricks
00:54 - it also looks better
00:56 - so i'll show you guys what happens when
00:57 - you win
00:58 - [Music]
01:03 - so here we're about to repeat the level
01:06 - so let's finish this up
01:08 - [Music]
01:09 - okay we got three right there let's get
01:11 - this last one
01:12 - as you can see when it says you win has
01:14 - a cool winning effect so this is our
01:16 - brick breaker version two without
01:17 - further ado let's get started onto the
01:19 - coding
01:20 - all right so let's start a new project
01:24 - so here we have our new project let's
01:25 - rename the project we're gonna name it
01:28 - brick
01:28 - breaker
01:30 - v2 so for version two this is gonna be
01:33 - our second version of our brick breaker
01:35 - so right here we have the scratch cap
01:37 - we're gonna delete we don't need the
01:38 - scratch cam
01:39 - and then we're going to get our
01:41 - paddle so this is going to be our paddle
01:43 - for the game
01:45 - so here we have our paddle this is the
01:47 - one where you used to hit the ball and
01:49 - then next we have the tennis ball there
01:51 - is the tennis ball inside the scratch
01:52 - library
01:53 - i think everything is from the scratch
01:55 - library here
01:56 - and then here with the tennis ball
01:59 - and then next we have the game over you
02:01 - win
02:02 - brick and then we have the trail which
02:03 - is another tennis ball so we just got to
02:05 - get another tennis ball or he just it
02:08 - let's duplicate the tennis ball rename
02:10 - it to trail
02:12 - trail
02:13 - so here we have tennis ball two bringing
02:16 - the trail and then we're gonna get the
02:17 - button
02:18 - so this is the button this is basically
02:20 - the bricks
02:21 - and then finally we have the u n and you
02:23 - lose
02:24 - so i already have the you win right here
02:27 - but basically here we have our blocked
02:29 - letters it makes the game look much
02:30 - better
02:32 - so here we're going to center our you in
02:34 - so we're just going to duplicate this
02:36 - and then we're going to
02:38 - delete
02:40 - you
02:41 - game over we're going to say game over
02:44 - and then we're going to
02:46 - move this
02:48 - we're going to have to rename that
02:50 - this one
03:00 - and then next we're gonna make our game
03:02 - over one so since this is already in
03:04 - bitmap we have to get our other text one
03:06 - so we're gonna have to rename this one
03:08 - so we're gonna say
03:09 - game over
03:12 - game over
03:14 - and then we're gonna move this over zoom
03:16 - out i'm gonna rename this to game
03:20 - over
03:22 - and then we're gonna move this towards
03:23 - the center
03:25 - so about like right here
03:27 - i'm gonna move this to the center as
03:28 - well all right so here we have our game
03:30 - over we're going to group it
03:32 - so here we have our game over
03:34 - and then our you win
03:36 - we can show that as well so maybe we can
03:38 - increase the size of our game over by
03:40 - just a little bit
03:42 - yeah this should be a good size
03:44 - okay so here we have our you in game
03:47 - over we have all our sprites right here
03:49 - so now start coding in the paddle
03:52 - so we can hide this and this for now
03:55 - let's go into paddle so let's start
03:56 - coding
03:58 - so first in the paddle we're going to
03:59 - get our wind green fly clicked
04:03 - when we flag's clicked we're going to
04:05 - set the rotation style
04:07 - to don't rotate so we won't let the
04:11 - paddle rotate so like i said it don't
04:13 - rotate and then we're going to set it to
04:15 - x negative 130 and then y i mean x 130
04:19 - sorry
04:20 - x 130 and then y negative 140.
04:24 - so we set it here should be somewhere
04:26 - down there because the ball is gonna
04:28 - we're gonna make the ball bounce towards
04:30 - this way
04:31 - um then next we're gonna get forever
04:35 - forever set the x to the mouse x so
04:38 - we're gonna make it follow the mouse
04:40 - set x to mouse x
04:43 - and then next
04:44 - there we have our paddle code so as you
04:46 - can see you can move the mouse
04:48 - uh it will move with your mouse on the x
04:52 - so here we have the paddle
04:54 - now let's go into our tennis ball
04:56 - so inside our tennis ball we're going to
04:58 - get a wink fly clicked
05:02 - when group likes clicked we're going to
05:03 - go to zero zero
05:05 - it's gonna make it go to the center
05:08 - and then we're gonna point direction of
05:09 - 135 so we're gonna point in direction
05:14 - of 135 so we're going to make it point
05:16 - towards the bottom right so that's why
05:18 - we move the paddle right here so it's
05:19 - going to bounce here first
05:21 - and then we're going to wait one second
05:22 - before we start to give the player
05:25 - a little the time to get ready
05:27 - and then we're gonna get a forever loop
05:29 - after this so forever
05:30 - uh we're gonna move ten steps this is
05:32 - the bouncing for the ball so we're gonna
05:34 - move ten steps
05:35 - and then we're gonna if on edge we're
05:37 - going to bounce and then we're going to
05:38 - get if that's even so if
05:41 - if it's touching the paddle so if the
05:43 - ball is touching the paddle
05:46 - if touching the paddle then we're going
05:48 - to start the sound pop
05:51 - and we're gonna broadcast a message
05:53 - we're gonna name the message bounce so
05:55 - we're gonna start a new message
05:57 - bounce
05:59 - all right so now we have bounce
06:01 - we're gonna receive the message bouncer
06:02 - here
06:04 - so
06:05 - when i receive bounce inside the tennis
06:06 - ball we're going to point in direction
06:08 - so basically it's going to make it
06:10 - bounce in the opposite direction after
06:11 - touching the paddle
06:12 - so we're going to point directions so it
06:15 - basically randomizes the bounce so it
06:17 - makes the game a little bit more
06:18 - interesting we're going to point
06:20 - direction
06:22 - point in direction
06:24 - and then we're going to do 180
06:27 - minus
06:28 - so we're going to take the minus 180
06:30 - minus the direction of the ball so
06:33 - put that in here and then we're going to
06:34 - repeat until
06:37 - we've got to repeat until we're going to
06:39 - repeat until not touching paddle so
06:41 - basically if it's not touching paddle
06:42 - we'll make it move 10 steps
06:45 - so
06:46 - repeat until not touching paddle
06:48 - move 10 steps motion
06:52 - all right
06:53 - and then next we're going to get a one
06:54 - three fly clicks for the ball
06:57 - here if i clicked go to front layer
07:00 - so to keep it at the front
07:02 - and then forever
07:05 - we're going to wait 0.1 seconds and then
07:08 - we're going to create clone of the trip
07:09 - so basically we're going to make the
07:10 - trail
07:11 - for the ball so we're going to need this
07:13 - later so we're going to create a clone
07:15 - of trail
07:17 - and then next this is going to be the
07:19 - game over
07:20 - so basically when the game is about to
07:22 - be over you'll do this
07:25 - the game is over whenever if i clicked
07:27 - we're going to do forever
07:29 - um if
07:32 - if the y position is less than negative
07:34 - 160 so i'm assuming negative 160 is
07:36 - somewhere around here basically the ball
07:38 - goes below the paddle
07:41 - so
07:41 - y position
07:44 - it's less than negative 160
07:47 - then we're going to broadcast
07:48 - game over so we're going to need this
07:50 - later as well so
07:52 - broadcast
07:53 - [Music]
07:55 - so it came
07:56 - over now let's go back to our paddle so
07:59 - i'm going to zoom out to show you guys
08:00 - all the code
08:01 - all right now let's go into the paddle
08:04 - now in the paddle we're going to work on
08:06 - how to make the paddle change color when
08:08 - it's touching the ball so we're going to
08:10 - do is when i receive bounce
08:13 - we're going to get an if-then statement
08:15 - if
08:16 - so we're going to find the we're going
08:18 - to use the distance block so if it's
08:20 - less than 60 so basically we're going to
08:22 - find the distance between the ball and
08:24 - the paddle
08:24 - so here we're going to get the distance
08:26 - to
08:27 - tennis ball
08:29 - so basically the distance
08:31 - is
08:32 - square root of x2 minus x1 plus this
08:36 - uh
08:37 - square root of y2 minus y1 so basically
08:40 - this is just the distance between the
08:42 - ball and the
08:44 - pedal so this is the formula on how to
08:45 - do it
08:46 - you can also replace it with another big
08:49 - chunk of code but we're just going to do
08:50 - this because it's much more simpler
08:52 - so next we're going to do a repeat 10
08:55 - times
08:56 - and we're going to change color effect
08:58 - by 25
09:01 - so now let's play it
09:04 - so as you can see the panel changes
09:06 - color now
09:08 - but every time the ball touches it
09:14 - all right so that's exactly what we want
09:17 - now let's go into our bricks
09:20 - so inside our bricks we're just going to
09:21 - rename the button to brick
09:24 - bricks so what we're going to do is
09:26 - inside the bricks we're going to when we
09:27 - fly clicked
09:29 - zoom in we're going to click we're going
09:31 - to make it variable we're going to name
09:32 - it score for all sprites
09:34 - and then we're going to set score to
09:36 - zero in the beginning
09:38 - and then we're going to set the size to
09:39 - 50 so it's half the size
09:42 - 50
09:43 - and then we're going to go to negative
09:44 - 200
09:46 - uh and then for y
09:49 - maybe 200 and for why we're doing 140
09:52 - and then next so we basically make 28
09:55 - clones of this we're gonna make 28
09:57 - bricks
09:58 - repeat four times
10:02 - repeat four times and then repeat seven
10:04 - times
10:06 - so there's gonna be 28 colons repeat and
10:09 - then we're going to create a clone of
10:10 - myself
10:12 - create a clone of myself and then we're
10:14 - going to change the x by 65. so
10:16 - basically we're going to evenly space
10:18 - the bricks
10:19 - uh a little bit so we're going to move
10:21 - them by 65 each
10:23 - change x by 65.
10:25 - so we're gonna have
10:26 - four
10:27 - by seven of these bricks
10:30 - and then next right here we're going to
10:31 - do the repeat four times just give me
10:33 - the four rows so we're going to do
10:34 - go to
10:36 - set the x to negative 200
10:40 - and then we're going to change the y by
10:41 - negative 30 so it's evenly spaced out as
10:44 - well
10:48 - and then next we're going to hide
10:51 - so we're going to hide the brick because
10:53 - we have all the clones out so we're
10:54 - going to hide the brick
10:56 - and then when i start as a clone
10:58 - we're going to get a when i start as a
10:59 - clone
11:01 - we're going to
11:03 - change y by negative 10. so basically in
11:05 - the beginning as you can see in the
11:06 - beginning when i showed you guys a
11:08 - project had a little like drift effect
11:10 - in the beginning this is what we're
11:12 - going to do we're going to change the y
11:14 - by negative 10
11:16 - in the beginning
11:18 - and your 10
11:20 - and then we're going to set the ghost
11:21 - effect
11:22 - to 100 set ghost effect
11:26 - to 100
11:28 - and then we're going to show
11:30 - and then next we're going to repeat 10
11:32 - times
11:34 - repeat 10 times we're going to change
11:36 - the y by 1 so it's going to go up a
11:38 - little bit so it's like a little drift
11:39 - effect and change the y back by one so
11:42 - it's going to move back to its original
11:43 - spot and then we're going to change the
11:45 - ghost effect by negative 10 so it'll
11:46 - slowly fade in
11:49 - change ghost effect by negative 10
11:55 - and then next we're going to wait 0.01
11:57 - seconds
11:58 - and just keep a little bit weight
12:03 - so next and we're going to get it
12:04 - forever
12:07 - forever if touching
12:09 - if
12:11 - touching the tennis ball
12:13 - so if the bricks are touching the tennis
12:14 - ball
12:16 - then we're going to get a start sound
12:19 - blazer too i have a sound right here
12:21 - it's in the sprite library so laser
12:23 - laser 2 sounds like that so we're going
12:25 - to use laser 2.
12:27 - so with laser 2 we're going to
12:30 - start sound laser 2.
12:33 - so after we start the sun laser 2 we're
12:35 - going to broadcast bounce
12:37 - and then next we're going to change the
12:38 - score by one so every time you destroy a
12:41 - brick you get one score
12:43 - and then we're going to repeat 10 times
12:46 - repeat 10 times inside here we're going
12:48 - to get a change color effect by 25 so
12:51 - basically once you hit the brick this is
12:53 - what's going to happen so we're going to
12:54 - change the color effect by 25 we're
12:56 - going to change the ghost effect by five
13:00 - boost by five
13:03 - and then next we're going to change the
13:04 - size by negative four so basically just
13:06 - makes it look cooler when you hit the
13:07 - brick
13:08 - change the size by negative four
13:14 - negative four and then we're gonna
13:15 - change the y by four and then we're
13:17 - gonna make it spin
13:18 - change the y by 4
13:21 - and then we'll make it spin by turning
13:23 - 15 degrees
13:24 - and then we're going to delete the clone
13:26 - after you've destroyed the brick
13:29 - so here we have all the code
13:31 - i'm going to zoom out
13:33 - so here we have the top part
13:36 - and the bottom part
13:38 - so this should be all the code for the
13:40 - bricks so let's play
13:43 - so as you can see it generates the
13:45 - bricks
13:47 - it makes it look much better
13:49 - when you generate the bricks like that
13:52 - let's show you one more time
13:54 - as you can see when you hit the bricks
13:56 - with the ball
13:57 - it makes that cool effect
13:59 - so yeah this is exactly how we want it
14:01 - so far now let's go into our trail so
14:05 - remember when in the beginning we
14:06 - brought like tried to make close in the
14:08 - trim right here so right now we're going
14:10 - to work on the trail so
14:12 - whenever we fly clicked we are going to
14:13 - hide with the trail
14:16 - and groove so i clicked hide and then
14:18 - we're gonna when i start as a clone
14:21 - when i start as a clone we're going to
14:23 - show
14:26 - and then we're going to go to tennis
14:27 - ball
14:30 - to tennis ball and then repeat 15 times
14:33 - so this is how you make the trail repeat
14:35 - 15 times
14:36 - change the size by negative four so
14:38 - we're going to make it a little bit
14:39 - smaller
14:40 - than what the tennis ball actually is
14:44 - change the size by negative four
14:47 - and then we're gonna set change the
14:49 - ghost effect by five so it's a little
14:51 - bit transparent
14:53 - so repeat 15 times change the ghost
14:55 - effect by
14:57 - and then delete this clone
15:00 - so that's it for the trail
15:03 - show you guys how it looks like as you
15:04 - can see
15:05 - it looks pretty cool makes your game
15:07 - look much better
15:08 - and fades away
15:11 - okay so this is exactly how we want it
15:14 - now we can work on the you win and you
15:17 - lose
15:18 - so
15:20 - back let's go into our you win
15:23 - so inside are you in we're going to make
15:24 - like a cool effect when you win so when
15:27 - you're if i clicked
15:29 - we're going to zoom in move your flag is
15:31 - clicked we're going to go to zero zero
15:34 - gonna make the wind go to zero zero
15:37 - and then next we're gonna hide
15:41 - and then next we're going to set the
15:42 - ghost effect to 100
15:48 - set ghost effect 200
15:51 - and then set size to 100
15:55 - and then we're going to set the score
15:58 - to zero in the beginning
16:02 - and then we're going to wait
16:04 - until
16:05 - we used to wait until
16:07 - it's right away until the score is equal
16:08 - to 28 because there's 28 blocks
16:11 - wait until score is equal to 28
16:15 - and then once the score is equal to 28
16:18 - we're gonna get a sound
16:20 - of those sounds in here but let's see
16:23 - uh percussion see
16:25 - i think i had gong before so
16:27 - this one
16:29 - i guess we'll use this one sounds pretty
16:30 - good
16:31 - so we're gonna use starts on gong
16:34 - and then we're going to broadcast
16:36 - uh stop game
16:38 - new message
16:40 - stop
16:41 - game actually we'll name it you win win
16:43 - that sounds better so you win and then
16:46 - we're gonna show
16:49 - and then we're going to repeat 10 times
16:50 - so this is the effect to make the uin
16:52 - look a lot better
16:54 - repeat 10 times we're going to change
16:55 - the ghost effect by negative 10.
16:58 - so it's going to fade in slowly
17:02 - change ghost effect by
17:05 - ghost effect by negative 10
17:07 - and then we're gonna change the size by
17:09 - three so it's going to get bigger
17:15 - and then we're gonna get change y by
17:17 - four so it's going to go up
17:20 - to the top
17:22 - and then we're gonna wait 0.01 seconds
17:24 - so basically 0.1 seconds because it
17:26 - repeats 10 times
17:28 - and then next we're going to wait a 0.2
17:30 - seconds before continuing to the next
17:32 - part of it so wait 0.2 seconds
17:34 - and then this one it makes it flash a
17:36 - little bit so we're going to repeat two
17:38 - times
17:39 - repeat twice
17:40 - now we're going to get a set brightness
17:42 - effect to 50
17:45 - set brightness
17:47 - 250
17:49 - and then wait 0.1 seconds
17:54 - and then we can duplicate this
17:56 - put that in here
17:58 - uh we'll repeat like twice so four times
18:01 - right here and we're gonna wait four
18:03 - seconds before stopping the game
18:06 - stop all
18:07 - so this should be it
18:09 - for our you win so i'm gonna zoom out
18:11 - show you guys the top
18:13 - and then to the bottom
18:15 - so this is our you in
18:17 - okay so let's go back to the paddle so
18:20 - right here when i receive
18:22 - you win
18:24 - when i receive you in
18:26 - we're going to stop other scripts in the
18:27 - sprite
18:30 - there you go
18:33 - okay and then one last thing let's go to
18:35 - you lose or game over my reading in this
18:37 - right to game over
18:39 - game over
18:41 - we're going to
18:43 - when i receive
18:45 - game over
18:46 - actually no let's do this part first we
18:48 - need to do the setup first if i clicked
18:50 - we're going to go to zero zero
18:54 - go to zero zero hide
18:56 - and then we're gonna set the ghost
18:57 - effect to 100
19:01 - ghost
19:03 - to 100
19:06 - ghost effect 100 and then we're going to
19:07 - set the size to 100 percent and then
19:10 - we're going to point direction of
19:11 - negative 60.
19:13 - so we're basically going to make it spin
19:14 - so that's why we're going to make it to
19:15 - negative 60 in the beginning
19:17 - so pointing to the top left
19:20 - uh and then next we're going to do when
19:22 - i receive
19:25 - game over
19:27 - then we're going to start the sound gong
19:30 - again i guess let's get the gong
19:34 - gong start sound gong
19:37 - and then next i'm going to broadcast
19:38 - stop game
19:42 - for broadcast
19:43 - game over
19:46 - you lose
19:50 - so you lose
19:52 - and then next we're going to show
19:56 - show and then we're going to do the
19:58 - little spin effect so we're going to
20:00 - repeat 10 times
20:02 - then turn 15 degrees
20:05 - and then we're going to change the ghost
20:06 - effect by negative 10
20:09 - change ghost effect
20:13 - ghost by negative 10
20:15 - so slowly fade in as well
20:18 - and then we're going to change the size
20:19 - by 12. so we're going to get bigger
20:23 - change size not the size sorry
20:26 - i'm going to change the size by 12
20:29 - and then next we're going to do a weight
20:30 - 0.01 seconds
20:34 - and then finally we're gonna wait four
20:36 - seconds at the end and then stop all
20:40 - right then finally let's go to your
20:42 - paddle when i receive you lose
20:45 - stop other scripts in the sprite we can
20:46 - also drag and drop this into our blocks
20:51 - one last thing let's add a backdrop so i
20:53 - had the galaxy backdrop last time so
20:54 - we're gonna do that
20:58 - galaxy
21:00 - delete this one all right so let's also
21:03 - drag and drop these into the tennis ball
21:05 - so we're going to drag drop tennis ball
21:09 - and then
21:10 - i think that should be it
21:12 - we have the backdrop we have everything
21:14 - let's run our project
21:20 - show you guys what happens when you win
21:34 - so as you can see that is our ending you
21:36 - win
21:38 - all right that's that's how it looks
21:39 - like when you win
21:41 - and for you lose i think we should
21:43 - decrease the size of this
21:45 - a little bit just a little bit maybe
21:47 - like that much was it in largest i just
21:49 - i remembered that it makes it bigger and
21:52 - you win so we'll see how it looks like
21:54 - when you lose
21:58 - as you can see game over it's still a
22:00 - little too big
22:01 - so we can change the code a little bit
22:04 - maybe instead of changing five
22:06 - we'll see
22:10 - yeah that's better so here we have our
22:13 - game over and our winning so
22:16 - that's it for today's project so here is
22:18 - our
