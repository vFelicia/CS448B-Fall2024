00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back to kids coding cool around
00:08 - today we'll be doing a whack-a-mole game
00:11 - in scratch so i'm pretty sure you guys
00:13 - know a whack-a-mole famous like
00:15 - at the arcade they have these games
00:17 - where like you use a hammer and you're
00:18 - trying to like hit the moles or whatever
00:20 - so yeah we'll be making this in scratch
00:22 - today so let me demonstrate the game
00:24 - real quick
00:25 - so basically use a hammer you hit it you
00:27 - get hits
00:28 - or if you miss your hit your misses go
00:30 - up
00:32 - so it's basically just an infinite game
00:34 - you can add any screen
00:36 - screen if you want or lose
00:39 - [Music]
00:44 - yeah so it's pretty much the game it's
00:45 - pretty simple to do
00:47 - um i'll be showing you guys also how to
00:49 - draw all of these sprites we have here
00:51 - but we'll still link them in the
00:52 - description below but we encourage you
00:54 - guys to like try to draw them and stuff
00:56 - so yeah okay let's create a new project
01:00 - first we will need the backdrop so
01:04 - i'm going to import the backdrop
01:06 - from here
01:09 - so we're going to delete this so i'm
01:11 - going to show you what i did in the
01:12 - background so basically
01:14 - we just uh for the back for like the
01:16 - blue thing we just took white like a
01:18 - light blue color and a dark blue color
01:21 - and we use this circle tool right here
01:23 - to make like that
01:24 - thing and the color is 54 saturations 13
01:28 - brightness is 99
01:30 - so it's basically just like
01:32 - uh it has like a little color in the
01:33 - middle
01:35 - you can uh
01:36 - and the other color is color 54
01:39 - saturated 95 and brightness 95. um you
01:42 - can use whatever color you want but this
01:43 - is what we have
01:44 - and for these circles it is just
01:47 - basically an outline of five with white
01:49 - on the outer rim and then just filled in
01:52 - with black which just basically just
01:53 - duplicated them to make rows of them
01:56 - so we just have like a few of them and
01:59 - then right here we have the hits and
02:01 - misses
02:02 - and
02:03 - um it's just a shaded red circle
02:06 - uh white circle and this is another
02:08 - shaded white circle
02:10 - so and then we'll be putting like the
02:12 - score like the hits and misses into here
02:15 - and the whack-a-mole thing is just like
02:17 - just with the text
02:19 - that's pretty much it with handwriting
02:21 - uh font so yeah
02:23 - and then uh we will be importing the
02:25 - hammer sprite so hammer sprite
02:27 - um
02:28 - this one's a bit like a little bit more
02:30 - difficult to draw we have multiple
02:32 - costumes for it so uh when you click
02:35 - it'll hammer down
02:36 - and so basically right here we have like
02:39 - some
02:40 - like like something like like shade i
02:42 - guess
02:43 - i don't know what to call this like
02:44 - shine i i guess
02:47 - um so yeah this is on the hammer this
02:50 - it's just like
02:51 - so this is that color 17 4 and 30.
02:55 - and then right here we have another one
02:57 - it's the same color
02:58 - the
03:00 - edge like the big part of the hammer
03:03 - is like this
03:05 - and then right here we have
03:06 - basically we have like a darker yellow
03:08 - and then we put a lighter yellow on top
03:10 - of it with this part
03:12 - um and then we have this
03:14 - dark gray and then a light gray on top
03:17 - okay so now i'm gonna be drawing it so
03:20 - we're gonna paint a new sprite
03:23 - all right
03:24 - so first
03:27 - we're going to get that color that is
03:29 - the
03:31 - click the back color
03:35 - we're gonna change it
03:38 - okay so we're gonna be using the
03:39 - rectangle tool
03:43 - we're gonna use some outline as well if
03:45 - you saw we use a 10 outline
03:49 - we're just going to draw a rectangle and
03:50 - then reshape it using the reshape tool
03:56 - so we did 17 18 and
03:59 - for the
04:02 - 17 18 and 15
04:04 - 8 and 15 sorry um
04:09 - so yeah it's kind of like a dark gray
04:11 - almost black color
04:13 - and then we're going to use the reshape
04:14 - tool to kind of reshape it make it a
04:16 - little bit bigger
04:18 - reshape
04:19 - so we're going to make it look like a
04:20 - hammer now
04:29 - i'm gonna reshape it all right so we got
04:31 - kind of shaped up a little
04:34 - it's not
04:35 - it's okay looks okay
04:39 - and then next we will be putting the
04:42 - like the shine or whatever on it
04:45 - so next we will be using this color 17 4
04:47 - and 30.
04:49 - uh we'll be using no outline
04:51 - for this one
04:52 - so select no outline and then just draw
04:54 - a rectangle and we will reshape it
04:57 - it's a reshape tool
05:03 - like that and then we can just
05:06 - draw another one
05:08 - or you can just duplicate it yeah
05:10 - we'll duplicate it
05:13 - and then we'll
05:15 - and then we will reshape this one a
05:17 - little bit more
05:20 - make it smaller
05:22 - yeah okay so that looks fine
05:25 - then next we will get the handle of the
05:27 - handle
05:28 - so then we'll be using a dark yellow no
05:30 - outline um color 1390 86 for the handle
05:34 - of the thing the hammer
05:37 - oops
05:42 - so now let's draw the hammer handle just
05:45 - draw a rectangle
05:47 - connect it onto there
05:49 - and then we'll get a lighter yellow
05:50 - color
05:53 - like that color i guess
05:55 - and then draw a
05:56 - smaller rectangle
05:59 - and put that right there
06:04 - okay
06:07 - so now we have a darker yellow uh color
06:09 - 12 99 56 so we'll be no outline we'll be
06:13 - drawing using the ellipse tools draw
06:15 - like a small oval
06:18 - and put that right there
06:21 - and then finally we'll just use the same
06:24 - colors as this and the
06:26 - the two gray colors for the end end of
06:29 - the hammer
06:30 - so
06:32 - let's get let's let's actually like
06:34 - increase the size
06:35 - decrease the size a little bit
06:40 - to cover that little part
06:43 - okay
06:44 - make it a little bit more to the left
06:49 - and then we'll group it
06:50 - so then we can
06:52 - make it all together and then move it to
06:54 - the back layer so then it will be
06:55 - covering the top
06:59 - we'll be using the same colors right
07:00 - here so we'll just draw 17 8 15 same as
07:04 - before
07:05 - with outline of 10.
07:07 - so this is the edge of the hammer
07:15 - decrease the size a little bit
07:22 - use this color and we're going to draw
07:24 - the little rectangle
07:26 - so our hammer is complete
07:31 - okay so now we have our hammer
07:36 - okay let's move it to the right a little
07:38 - bit
07:40 - and shrink it
07:44 - okay
07:45 - so now we have our hammer basically to
07:47 - make the different costumes we just
07:49 - duplicate it select it and then move it
07:51 - to the side a little bit
07:52 - use the rotate tool and then and then
07:55 - move it to the side a little bit
07:57 - see that
08:00 - move it
08:02 - again
08:04 - and
08:06 - so i'm pretty sure you all get the idea
08:07 - just keep on duplicating it like five
08:09 - costumes
08:10 - and you will make the hammer costumes
08:14 - to make it smash down so yeah that's
08:16 - pretty much it
08:17 - um for drawing the hammer
08:20 - so i'm going to delete it and we'll get
08:22 - started on the coating so for the cat we
08:25 - were only going to need the head
08:26 - obviously so we're going to select this
08:30 - and just have the head
08:32 - okay
08:36 - we're also going to center the cat head
08:38 - right now so
08:39 - we have the cat head center all right
08:42 - let's get the hammer
08:43 - okay so now let's start coding
08:46 - let's go to the um cat head
08:49 - all right so we're going to start coding
08:50 - in the cat so we're going to need to
08:52 - make two new variables
08:54 - uh we're going to make available hits
08:56 - and another variable
08:58 - we're going to name it misses
09:01 - this is
09:02 - both for all sprites and then we're
09:04 - going to make some lists we're going to
09:05 - make a
09:06 - list called x position
09:09 - and another list called y position
09:13 - y position
09:15 - and we're going to define the lists
09:17 - we're going to like add a bunch of stuff
09:19 - to the list but first let's set some
09:21 - stuff up
09:22 - so let me zoom in
09:24 - when green flag is clicked we are going
09:26 - to set the hits
09:27 - and we're also going to set the misses
09:29 - to zero
09:31 - and then we're going to go
09:32 - uh
09:33 - add a bunch of stuff to the list
09:36 - okay and then
09:38 - so now
09:39 - we have to find the x and y position of
09:41 - the head
09:42 - for each of these little black slots
09:45 - so basically what you do is just move
09:47 - the head
09:48 - and you find the x and y position but
09:50 - since i already have all the x and y
09:51 - position you can just copy what i'm
09:53 - doing
09:54 - so
09:55 - i'm just going to delete all of the
09:57 - lists in the beginning so we're going to
09:58 - delete all
10:00 - of the exposition
10:01 - so we're going to add a bunch of
10:03 - coordinates to the exposition so the x
10:05 - positions from this side to this side so
10:08 - you look down here you can see the x
10:09 - position
10:11 - as you can see if i drag it here you can
10:12 - see it's negative 166.
10:15 - so we will set our
10:17 - add our first thing negative 166
10:21 - and then after that we'll add another
10:23 - one so you get the idea we just keep on
10:25 - dragging the head
10:27 - to each slot
10:29 - and then you just find the x positions
10:31 - and then next one i got was negative 79
10:34 - and then as you can see i move it it's
10:36 - about it's negative 79.
10:39 - the next one i move it is three
10:41 - so we're going to duplicate this again
10:43 - and three
10:45 - and next one
10:49 - about right here
10:50 - we got 87
10:52 - so we're gonna do 87
10:54 - and we have one more
10:56 - movement about right here
10:58 - 172 so
11:02 - 172.
11:05 - and then we can just delete all of y
11:07 - position in the beginning we have to
11:08 - delete all of the other lists
11:11 - and then we're just going to duplicate
11:12 - all this and put this under be sure to
11:15 - change all of this to y position
11:17 - so let's change it all to y y
11:20 - y
11:22 - y
11:23 - and then we're gonna have to also change
11:24 - all of these
11:25 - and then so now we're just going to find
11:27 - the y position so
11:29 - start from here
11:31 - and since there's only four we're gonna
11:32 - have to delete one
11:34 - so
11:35 - we find the first y position on the
11:37 - bottom
11:38 - to be
11:39 - actually start from the top it's
11:42 - more better so first one's 86
11:45 - a6
11:47 - next one we get is going to be
11:50 - 31
11:52 - right
11:53 - 31.
11:57 - next one
11:58 - is going to be
12:01 - negative 25
12:04 - and next one is going to be
12:08 - negative 72.
12:11 - so yeah now we have all the x and y
12:14 - positions and after this we're going to
12:15 - broadcast a message we're going to name
12:17 - it start game
12:22 - okay
12:23 - okay so now we're after broadcasting
12:25 - start game
12:26 - we're going to receive start game
12:29 - we're going to forever
12:32 - and then we're going to set the x
12:34 - position
12:35 - set x position
12:37 - and then we're just going to get the
12:38 - item
12:40 - item
12:42 - and then we're going to pick random
12:44 - so how many are here we have five so
12:46 - we're gonna pick random one to five
12:49 - of x position duplicate this
12:52 - and then actually no no sorry uh we have
12:54 - to duplicate that not this set y to item
12:57 - pick random one
12:59 - to four of y position
13:02 - and then we're going to wait 0.8 seconds
13:04 - so it's only going to stay at one spot
13:06 - for 0.8 seconds
13:08 - okay
13:09 - next let's go to the
13:11 - uh
13:12 - i'll show it
13:13 - so as you can see the cat moves around
13:17 - yeah so the cat moves around
13:19 - so it looks pretty cool
13:21 - now let's get coding in the hammer
13:24 - okay so inside the hammer first we are
13:26 - going to get a one green fly clicked we
13:28 - are going to
13:29 - zoom in
13:30 - and if i clicked we are going to switch
13:32 - the costume to costume 1 which is the
13:34 - first costume
13:35 - and then we're going to forever go to
13:37 - mouse pointer so it's going to follow
13:39 - the mouse
13:41 - go to mouse pointer
13:44 - and then next when the sprite is clicked
13:46 - so when you click on the sprite
13:48 - it will switch costume to costume one
13:52 - switch costume costume one and then
13:55 - broadcast hammer cat
13:57 - so it will hammer down on the cat so
13:59 - hammer
14:01 - cat
14:02 - hammer cat and then we're gonna repeat
14:04 - five times
14:07 - repeat five times next costume because
14:09 - there's five costumes from here there's
14:12 - six but we're only gonna do five because
14:13 - there's five moving ones
14:15 - okay so we repeat five times
14:18 - next costume and we will do
14:21 - switch costume to costume one once it's
14:24 - done with action
14:26 - and then next when i receive hammer cat
14:28 - inside the same sprite
14:30 - we're going to wait 0.1 seconds
14:34 - and then we're going to if else
14:38 - so basically in the top we're going to
14:40 - check
14:41 - if it's touching the cat and if the
14:42 - costume number is greater than three
14:45 - so
14:45 - it will count as hammering down because
14:47 - the last three one or it's like
14:48 - hammering down
14:50 - so
14:51 - we're going to get an and
14:53 - so and so we're gonna get if
14:55 - touching
14:56 - cat touching cats
15:00 - sprite one all right so we're gonna
15:02 - rename this cap i guess
15:04 - it'll be
15:05 - easier to understand
15:07 - and
15:07 - the costume number is greater than three
15:12 - position numbers greater than three
15:15 - then we will change the number of hits
15:18 - by one else it will change the number of
15:20 - misses
15:22 - by one so we can get these variables
15:24 - double click on them drag them here
15:27 - and double click on this one again this
15:29 - one's misses make sure yeah so is it
15:32 - misses
15:34 - let's put that in there
15:36 - okay
15:38 - and then after we get that uh we can add
15:41 - music last last step
15:44 - like clicks
15:45 - with the sounds let's just get a random
15:47 - loop
15:49 - loop
15:52 - i guess whatever
15:54 - uh forever
15:56 - play this out and we don't want it to be
15:58 - too loud oh sorry this one
16:00 - so then we're gonna
16:03 - set the volume to 25
16:06 - okay
16:07 - i think that's it let's play it
16:10 - as you can see
16:12 - [Music]
16:15 - we can also make the hammer go to the
16:16 - front layer so that we can
16:19 - go on top of the cat as you can see it's
16:21 - not on the front layer so it's easier to
16:22 - see if you hit the cat or not
16:24 - so we're going to go with the hammer we
16:26 - can do
16:27 - one grip on clicks
16:29 - toward front layer
16:34 - okay there
16:36 - [Music]
16:49 - but it's somewhat working
16:52 - all right
16:53 - so that's pretty much it for this
16:54 - tutorial thank you guys for watching
16:56 - um you guys can add like a end screen if
16:58 - you want but yeah
17:01 - like you can have a certain amount of
17:02 - hits once you get a certain amount of
17:03 - hits you win the game
17:05 - so yeah thank you guys for watching
17:06 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
17:09 - and bring the notification bell
17:12 - [Music]
17:21 - you
