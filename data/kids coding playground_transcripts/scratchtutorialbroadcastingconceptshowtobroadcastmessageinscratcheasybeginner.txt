00:08 - welcome back to the channel
00:10 - kids coding playground today we'll be
00:12 - doing a video on broadcasting concepts
00:15 - this is not really a game but it can
00:18 - probably help you understand
00:19 - broadcasting more easier so the bat
00:22 - pictured right here is no longer
00:24 - available in 3.0 you can get a
00:26 - substitute for it I picked the other bat
00:29 - because they still have another bat
00:30 - available so if we will be learning
00:35 - these falling concepts in scratch today
00:38 - understanding broadcast messages using
00:41 - variables using random operator
00:43 - animating sprites for messages receive
00:46 - the point of the short animation is that
00:49 - the microphone will be broadcasting a
00:52 - message and the sports will act
00:54 - accordingly
00:55 - when they receive the message so let's
00:58 - head on to the project so indeed I'm we
01:03 - need to rename this to rock has 10
01:08 - concepts so we can we will need the cat
01:17 - the cat should set the size to 80
01:22 - because he's pretty big moving like
01:25 - right here let's get a background I like
01:30 - the bench one this one is a good
01:32 - background and then we can import our
01:35 - sprites from the sprite library we need
01:38 - the bat put that up here and you get
01:43 - like a size 70 front it's a bit too big
01:46 - and then we'll need the Frog and finally
01:52 - we'll need the mic from
01:55 - [Music]
01:58 - take this frog and we'll need the
02:01 - microphone so in my career here every
02:12 - scale the size okay so we might also
02:17 - want to turn this don't rotate negative
02:21 - 90 degrees so it look this way so it
02:27 - will look better next we'll work on the
02:31 - code for the mic okay so when the key
02:35 - will start out when when the key space
02:37 - is pressed actually no we'll make a
02:40 - variable first random action make a
02:46 - variable called random action when
02:50 - spacebar is pressed then we'll change
02:54 - set the random action to pick random one
03:00 - two three cuz there's three sprites to
03:04 - pick from so next we need three if then
03:09 - condition statements duplicate this then
03:20 - we will need some operators we'll need
03:22 - the equal operator if it's equal to one
03:26 - if right of action the variable then we
03:30 - can probably broadcast fly and wait why
03:38 - is probably for the bat okay then we did
03:43 - another equal sign if it's equal to two
03:47 - if the variable random action is equal
03:50 - to two then we will broadcast walk and
03:54 - wait walk and finally um third equal
04:04 - sign if random action is equal to three
04:11 - then real broadcast and wait we'll
04:16 - broadcast jump okay so now we are done
04:24 - with the mic let's head on to the cat
04:27 - code so we'll always want to set the
04:31 - position of the cat in the beginning and
04:37 - then we'll need a if it's brought if it
04:41 - broadcasts if it receives the walk-walk
04:44 - message then it will repeat 10 times
04:48 - move 10 steps they can move forward and
04:53 - then we'll make it move back again or
04:56 - next costume and wait 0.1 seconds so Oh
05:04 - make it look more like it's walking we
05:07 - can duplicate this instead of 10 steps
05:11 - will move into 10 steps so I put
05:13 - backwards and I look like it's walking
05:16 - backwards so we are done with the cat
05:19 - now let's head on to the Frog code so we
05:23 - always need to set the position make it
05:26 - bigger next we'll need to if it receives
05:32 - the junk jump message then it will
05:38 - change the Y by 50 making it look like
05:40 - it's jumping up so change Y by 50 then
05:46 - we'll wait zero point 5 seconds so it
05:49 - look like it's in midair then it'll fall
05:51 - back down so by making it fall down
05:55 - we'll do change Y by negative 50 so
06:05 - that's the Frog code now it's worth at
06:08 - the bat finally we have the bat left
06:12 - so when clicked we want to set the
06:14 - position on all the time that it's in
06:18 - this position
06:20 - and then receives fly then will repeat
06:25 - 10 times make it look like they'll fly
06:29 - switch costume to costume a and then
06:35 - weight 0.1 seconds and make like a
06:37 - flapping effect then switch costume to
06:44 - bat-beam I mean duplicate this actually
06:48 - that'd be complete 0.1 seconds so now we
06:56 - are finished we can try this out so when
06:59 - I play spacebar that that starts
07:02 - flapping its wings because the random
07:04 - action is 1 and inside the mic one is
07:08 - fly so the fly is gonna be broadcasted
07:10 - to the back room for space again random
07:13 - action is 3 3 is jump so our broadcast
07:16 - is a frog and make it jump striking see
07:20 - if we can get walk see it one so I
07:31 - wanted to get to 2
07:32 - yeah so it walks forward and walks back
07:35 - see ya so thank you guys for watching
