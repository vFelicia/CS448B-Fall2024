00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so hey guys it's kids coding playground
00:09 - and today we will be doing another video
00:11 - on like a type of space invaders game
00:14 - it's called wizard defense so in wizard
00:17 - defense the point of the game is to
00:19 - survive and you save the coast we'll be
00:22 - learning these following concepts and
00:23 - scratch a custom sprite repeat until
00:26 - clone touching sprite and broadcast
00:29 - message so I'll be showing you my demo
00:35 - on what this game is actually on so the
00:41 - music is actually pretty loud so if you
00:44 - can see and so there the music is just a
00:48 - shoot control so they shoot out daggers
00:51 - and they try to hit you to win and it
00:54 - says you win or you can lose and lose
00:57 - all your lives
00:59 - let's try to lose here
01:14 - so it says you lose so that's how the
01:20 - game works so let's get a new game a new
01:24 - project and then before we start please
01:30 - like share subscribe and comment in the
01:33 - comment section to see what you what
01:35 - content you want to see or to rate what
01:38 - we write rate how good we are or you can
01:42 - post things and tell us what you want to
01:45 - see next so let's see
01:47 - so the first sprites we need we need a
01:50 - bunch of sprites we need first we can
01:53 - choose a backdrop so I'll Universal
01:55 - Defense game so let's choose like a
01:58 - castle a sort of castle now there is a
02:02 - castle yep so I chose this one because
02:05 - it's like you're opening up a castle so
02:08 - we need also some sprites so the pros
02:12 - right there is actually no pro sprite so
02:14 - I took the parents bright and actually
02:16 - um the parent and just changed the color
02:20 - so let's just change it right now right
02:32 - so you can change the color if you want
02:35 - umm yeah so that's the pros we can make
02:41 - the eye red or something yeah we can
02:45 - make it red make it look like it's evil
02:48 - so we also need other sprays we need the
02:53 - wizards right
02:57 - the wizards right let's change the size
03:02 - to 30
03:03 - yep that's small enough let's change the
03:09 - sizes later first let's um get our
03:12 - sprites oh we have to paint our sprites
03:14 - so we have to paint our sprites this
03:16 - paint a fireball sprite so it's coming
03:20 - out of the Wizards hands oh that's
03:25 - really big we can make it smaller
03:39 - so we got the fireball sprite
03:46 - yeah so we can give it an outline say
03:53 - black then we got to restart this thing
03:57 - so so I added an outline so we can
04:02 - change the thickness to for one was too
04:05 - skinny oh we can as you can see it's
04:10 - right oh yeah you have to Center it we
04:19 - can move this to the center you can have
04:23 - the extra details if you want but let's
04:26 - skip over that from now huh let's draw
04:33 - the details let's make it more closer to
04:42 - the thing and then let's draw a knife we
04:46 - need a draw a knife for the parent I
04:48 - mean the crow we can change this let's
04:57 - draw the knife so first we need the
05:00 - square first we need this square the
05:07 - rectangle well we can change this color
05:10 - a more darker color around there umm
05:17 - let's change that outline so let's
05:21 - change it to black so we can do that and
05:31 - that we can make it smaller later so so
05:39 - there's a reshape tool right here so
05:41 - didn't draw a she just took gray first
05:47 - we can do this but then there's a
05:51 - reshape tool you can reshape this to
05:55 - look like it's pointy like a knife so I
06:02 - just noticed this thing goes a little
06:04 - bit too skinny you need the pointer tool
06:06 - let's click that and let's change it to
06:09 - ten make it more thicker I think yeah
06:12 - that's thick enough and we always we can
06:14 - select this and change it to ten and
06:19 - then we can move this a little bit out
06:24 - around
06:25 - yeah like later we can make it so we've
06:35 - got adjusted a little bit oh I think
06:38 - that yeah that that's good that looks so
06:46 - as you can see I adjusted it from there
06:50 - and you know I think it looks a little
06:53 - bit better than before so let's work on
07:00 - the let's work on that you win sprite so
07:04 - we got paint another sprite so you can
07:07 - use any font you won but then let's use
07:11 - you can use sans serif yeah stick with
07:15 - sensory you can use marker marker looks
07:18 - pretty good let's type you wait let me
07:26 - change this color to let you win
07:34 - we can make it bigger it's about the
07:40 - size
07:46 - and that's about the size you wait so we
07:50 - gotta we can make it another costume you
07:59 - change the color we have to Center that
08:15 - and then there are you lose so you
08:18 - probably can't see it that well because
08:19 - the fireball is right as well but let's
08:24 - get to the code so the wizard first so
08:30 - we have to start always with the overall
08:33 - yeah we always have to start with if I
08:37 - clicked yeah zoom in um let's go to you
08:46 - can go to right here yeah let's make it
08:48 - go to right here
08:50 - we can set that set the size to 30 yeah
08:55 - it's already 30 but just in case if you
08:58 - did said it you can set it to 30 set
09:01 - score to zero so let's make a new
09:04 - variable first score you need the
09:07 - variable score for this part and lives
09:14 - so you always have to set the score to 0
09:18 - and set the lives to 5 because you can
09:22 - do anything you want you can do 100 but
09:24 - I'm gonna use 5 you're gonna go forever
09:29 - let's use a forever blue so then so it
09:32 - can keep on moving left and right and
09:34 - left and right so we're not doing up
09:36 - arrow keys we're only doing on set right
09:40 - left so let's do sensing touching cuz we
09:47 - always have to know keep pressed not
09:50 - touching key pressed because key pressed
09:53 - is um the right arrow key the left arrow
09:57 - key
09:58 - those things issues left first uh we can
10:02 - use change X by 10 you can duplicate it
10:07 - change X by negative 10 because the
10:12 - right arrow is 10 but left overs
10:15 - negative 10 because the left is the
10:16 - opposite over right so a key press we
10:19 - need another key pressed you can
10:21 - duplicate it if you want this is the
10:23 - whole process change X by 2 let's change
10:33 - this to the right arrow key so next
10:36 - we'll be working on looks like how the
10:41 - wizard is moving well I didn't click
10:43 - start yet as you can see he's moving
10:46 - around he can move yeah so right now you
10:49 - can move so let's work on the fireball
10:52 - just pause this is sprite 1 let's rename
10:55 - it to fire when start always let's say
11:07 - let's go one more I think that's good
11:09 - set set size 2 that's a hundred it's
11:15 - really really big let's say 15 see how
11:18 - big this is
11:18 - oh wow yeah yeah that's the right side
11:22 - it's this big yeah that's the right size
11:24 - on point in Direction 90 dream direction
11:30 - 0 in it because it's facing up because
11:33 - it's facing up because if you use 90
11:36 - it's so it's facing up because I mean
11:38 - the ball has to face up and its hind
11:41 - let's hide it and then you need a
11:46 - if-then space-click because you have to
11:49 - click a spacebar to shoot bullet you use
11:53 - a or whatever you want but create clone
11:56 - of myself of myself so it'll keep on
12:01 - creating it's a clone of itself and then
12:04 - let's start sounding the pot when it
12:05 - comes out wait zero point five seconds
12:17 - and then when I started as a clone
12:21 - that's when he's when he awakens and
12:23 - when you can see him oh go to the wizard
12:26 - so then it follows the Wizards lead I'll
12:29 - go to the wizard it will smooth this
12:36 - I'll go to the wizard um it'll show
12:41 - let's make it show so see it you can see
12:45 - it I'll repeat until it's touching the
12:50 - edge or the crow edge or so change Y by
13:07 - 10 so keep on going up until it touches
13:10 - the edge or touching the crow and then
13:15 - I'll delete this clone when it touches
13:17 - the edge in the end I don't like this
13:19 - code so the last thing we're gonna work
13:21 - on on part one is the music so you can
13:26 - take a if flag clicked pick green flag
13:33 - clicked this says it really this doesn't
13:37 - really have that much code so we can
13:40 - zoom in this and then we always have to
13:43 - have a forever loop we gotta get it
13:46 - sound you can use any sound you want but
13:48 - I'm gonna use a medieval too cause it's
13:51 - more of a medieval Lord medieval ish for
13:57 - this type of situation cuz it's like a
13:59 - medieval and that's the code for
14:02 - medieval - I'm gonna show you how this
14:06 - works
14:07 - so let's hide the crow it's all so hot
14:10 - that you lose sprite and the knife as
14:15 - you can see you can move with the wizard
14:18 - wizard
14:19 - we're WASD the music is working Nixon
14:27 - next pops out and that is the end for
14:30 - part 1 thank you for listening and have
14:32 - a good day
14:33 - [Music]
