01:15 - throw space and throw his shield and
01:17 - dash and kill all
01:19 - um there's no score so you can counter
01:22 - because it's a simple adventures game
01:24 - and um you don't die
01:26 - so that's pretty cool and you can also
01:29 - dash with the um
01:31 - right arrow key uh throw shields of
01:34 - space
01:34 - and whatever they touch you would die as
01:36 - well

02:47 - comments i don't have much time so
02:50 - uh anyways let's get right into the
02:53 - video
02:54 - so um let's make a new project
03:00 - all the sprites are the links in
03:01 - description if you're doing something
03:03 - wrong you can
03:04 - watch our google drive video so we have
03:06 - cap
03:08 - captain america sentinel
03:12 - and the shield that captain america
03:13 - throws so we have all of these things
03:15 - you can download links in description
03:17 - google drive yeah you can get that
03:18 - so um yeah and
03:21 - on if you're doing something wrong watch
03:23 - our video
03:24 - it's on it's on our channel how to
03:26 - access google drive and do not use your
03:28 - school account use your main account
03:31 - since sentinel was already in my
03:33 - backpack it was already done all this
03:35 - stuff
03:35 - so remember guys put on rotation left
03:38 - right so i'm gonna show this
03:39 - it was pointing to the right side
03:41 - instead of the left side so
03:44 - turn on that and make it negative 90
03:46 - degrees so
03:47 - yeah um let's get let's get to it
03:50 - so uh let's start on sentinel
03:54 - so i actually can get the backdrop first
03:56 - that's the most easiest
03:58 - that's a task that needs to be done um
04:03 - i think this is called stars not sure
04:06 - yeah yeah it's called stars
04:08 - so i'm also going to name this project
04:12 - i named it captain america game so
04:16 - yeah a captain america game
04:24 - captain america okay
04:30 - so yeah i'm gonna do captain america
04:34 - not sentinel so when the green flag is
04:36 - clicked
04:38 - uh hide
04:42 - forever
04:46 - it'll create clone of myself
04:49 - which is sentinel well not me and it'll
04:52 - wait
04:53 - i'll pick random seconds before spawns
04:55 - another one so
04:58 - i'm going to pick random of 0.5 to one
05:02 - side
05:02 - sentinel so yeah and then we have
05:06 - cap we have sentinel uh
05:09 - so we have to make the code for sentinel
05:12 - so when i start as a clone because we
05:15 - always need that
05:16 - and it will switch costume to costume
05:19 - sentinel one
05:20 - because that's the first costume when it
05:23 - not dies
05:24 - there's one two three
05:27 - that's when he's dying and
05:31 - it'll go to a random position
05:36 - set x to 175
05:39 - so let's drag that block in for school
05:41 - so
05:42 - 176 right now so 175 same thing but
05:45 - whatever
05:46 - um show
05:51 - um repeat until touching edge
06:01 - uh move one step
06:07 - and you need to if then so
06:10 - if then the it's touching
06:14 - the shield or cap because of the dash so
06:17 - shield or cap
06:32 - shield or cat so yeah capper shield i
06:36 - did capper ship
06:37 - so let's put that in there and switch
06:39 - costume to sentinel 2
06:42 - so when he gets attacked by
06:46 - the shield or cap and i'll wait 0.2
06:49 - seconds
06:56 - and then there's also delete this clone
07:02 - and delete this clone
07:06 - and then next we're going to work on cap
07:08 - so cat
07:09 - we have
07:12 - so um demo the game for you right now
07:19 - oh we got sentinels
07:23 - they're coming in hot
07:26 - so yeah that's basically what we have
07:28 - right now no we have cap
07:30 - so we have to code someone cap and then
07:32 - we have to code some of the shield so
07:34 - it'll be like a part of cat part of
07:37 - shield part of cap so that's basically
07:39 - what we're gonna do
07:39 - and it'll go to the position i already
07:41 - have it at because that's what it always
07:43 - does no no no
07:44 - actually the y is different but whatever
07:46 - it doesn't matter
07:48 - i'm gonna switch costume to cat
07:52 - one
07:56 - and then so one two
07:59 - three yeah you basically cap dash one
08:01 - you basically get the point and
08:03 - there's like throw shield so yeah that's
08:05 - basically what we have
08:06 - let's switch costume to one cat cat one
08:09 - and then go
08:10 - forever that you know
08:13 - if you need it if then
08:18 - you need an up arrow key
08:20 - [Music]
08:24 - press then it will change y by five
08:33 - duplicate that let's do the down arrow
08:36 - key
08:37 - which is negative five so
08:41 - minus five and then
08:44 - duplicate again but we gotta change the
08:46 - y to x instead
08:48 - but oh actually we have the right arrow
08:50 - we don't we have the right arrow for um
08:53 - the dash so we actually don't need that
08:55 - we just need to broadcast dash
08:59 - and wait
09:06 - dash
09:08 - and we also have to do uh when the
09:12 - space arrow key is pressed
09:16 - no wait until
09:19 - space t not space arrow key
09:22 - and then we gotta wait until not key
09:24 - press so
09:27 - not not a key space press so
09:32 - that will wait until it won't click
09:41 - oh yeah we knew we didn't wait until
09:43 - sorry guys sorry guys
09:44 - not a wait just to wait until um
09:48 - yeah wait until not key space press
09:52 - so let's put that in not key space
09:55 - pressed over here and then instead of
09:57 - broadcast dash you'll be broadcast
09:59 - throw so
10:03 - let's work on the shield now so the
10:06 - shield
10:07 - so when the green slack is clicked it
10:09 - always has to hide because you didn't do
10:11 - anything with the shield yet so
10:13 - you always have to make it hide so yeah
10:16 - and when i receive throw
10:23 - then i'll go to cap
10:29 - go to cap and then it'll
10:32 - show
10:35 - and it'll repeat until
10:39 - touching sentinel so repeat until
10:42 - you know or
10:46 - sentinel
10:52 - signal or touching edge
10:57 - so repeat until it'll move 10 steps
11:02 - hi didn't go to cap so go back to the
11:05 - captain
11:06 - america after when you're done throwing
11:08 - the shield
11:12 - so yeah um put a cap
11:15 - right there cap and there we go so we're
11:18 - gonna work on the captain america
11:20 - again so i'm gonna work on the throw up
11:22 - her cap
11:23 - so um zoom one out i think that's gonna
11:26 - be better uh
11:28 - so when i received throw
11:32 - a switch costing me cap five
11:36 - well it's always 14 cap not cap dash
11:40 - it's just cat
11:41 - five let's get five i thinks
11:46 - and then repeat ten
11:51 - next costume
11:58 - weight 0.05
12:06 - the reason why we have to repeat 10 but
12:08 - i'm gonna finish this real quick switch
12:10 - costume back to cap
12:11 - one so finish this block
12:15 - so the reason why we have to do repeat
12:16 - 10
12:18 - and be between 5 cap 5 to cap
12:22 - 20 cap 14 there's 10 costumes
12:26 - so one two three four five six
12:29 - seven eight nine ten eleven
12:32 - ten yeah ten just ten so that's why um
12:35 - and yeah so
12:36 - we have to do when i receive dash
12:41 - and demo this real quick to show you so
12:44 - the throw is with the bam
12:46 - bam with the the space key so
12:50 - um yeah i'm moving around and like
12:54 - okay yeah so let's work on the dash next
12:56 - um yeah
12:58 - i i noticed that the captain america
13:00 - shields only single target so
13:01 - the dash is all targets so then when i
13:05 - receive
13:05 - dash repeat until touching edge
13:13 - touching edge so keep on going until on
13:16 - the captain america touches the edge
13:18 - and then i'll move ten steps
13:22 - and go back to the position i already
13:23 - have a mat
13:26 - and then when i receive dash
13:31 - i receive dash let's switch costume to
13:34 - cap dash one
13:38 - cap dash not cat one cat dash so
13:41 - um a repeat ten
13:47 - so you can make it nine for y for if you
13:50 - want to do it on the center but i
13:52 - i already have them at this spot so why
13:53 - not um
13:56 - but we also have to change the
14:00 - this is negative six so you gotta match
14:02 - it together so that also has to be
14:04 - negative 16.
14:05 - uh or this can be negative 36 so
14:09 - let's make this negative 16 i mean 36.
14:14 - so get that now let's do when i receive
14:18 - switch cost me the cap dash repeat 10
14:21 - times
14:22 - i already have that uh next costume
14:27 - and weight zero 0.05 seconds
14:34 - i um and switch costume
14:37 - to cap dash just cap one not cap dash
14:40 - switch costume to cat one and we also
14:44 - have to add the music and then we'll
14:45 - that'll be the done we'll be done with
14:47 - this so when the green flag is clicked
14:52 - so the reason why i decided to always
14:55 - use this set
14:58 - a volume to 25 is because i don't want
15:01 - it to
15:01 - that loud then you can hear me so um we
15:04 - also have to have a forever loop
15:06 - and ever and ever and i'll play sound
15:09 - this sound i have
15:11 - movie two i already memorized it i think
15:14 - at least
15:14 - i think it's movie one
15:18 - uh yeah so this is the cool music so
15:20 - please sound
15:21 - movie too until done
