00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kid tune
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video in scratch and today we're
00:12 - making a fun area calculator thing if
00:16 - you're doing homework and um
00:18 - you have homework to do and you're not
00:20 - quite sure and you want to check your
00:22 - answer you can just go to your
00:24 - local scratch project and code this for
00:27 - yourself you can see there's some
00:29 - backdrop that you can make
00:31 - reflect
00:32 - place a music emotional piano
00:35 - and then you can enter your choice one
00:37 - two or three one is a rectangle two is a
00:39 - triangle and three is a circle
00:41 - so
00:45 - so um you can go one
00:48 - you know
00:49 - and ask you to enter the length of the
00:51 - rectangle four
00:53 - and enter the width seven six
00:56 - and then the area is 24. you could
00:58 - probably solve that in your head but it
01:00 - also works with decimals too
01:06 - 5.65
01:07 - [Music]
01:16 - two triangle enter the base four enter
01:19 - to the height three and you'll divide it
01:20 - by two that's how you find the area of a
01:22 - triangle and um
01:24 - you go three
01:26 - will be the circle into the diamond
01:28 - diameter to 45
01:31 - and then you'll times that by three
01:32 - volts because that's how you find the
01:35 - area
01:36 - and now um
01:38 - let's make a new project
01:40 - so we actually need the scratch cat
01:42 - today and
01:44 - we actually have to make a backdrop
01:47 - so i have my backdrop in the backpack
01:51 - there we have it and we have our
01:54 - backdrop and we want to move like the
01:56 - scratch cat around here so
01:58 - it's really blocking anything
02:01 - and we have our backdrop
02:04 - and
02:06 - so all you need to do is make this
02:08 - rectangle and uh
02:10 - uh just pick random colors and you can
02:13 - make a pretty decent thing and then you
02:15 - can use the text
02:17 - and outline and then you have the
02:19 - rectangle yeah
02:21 - the text rectangle and then you draw a
02:23 - triangle
02:25 - uh you draw a rectangle you draw a
02:27 - triangle you draw a circle it's pretty
02:29 - easy you write the text down and i
02:31 - actually think this is a little bit
02:33 - lower than the one that we had before so
02:35 - let's just move this up a little bit
02:37 - that means we also have to change the
02:38 - positioning of this oh i think it's fine
02:41 - positioning is fine but now we have to
02:44 - um delete this backdrop
02:47 - and
02:49 - we have the scratch cat so
02:52 - let's work on the scratch cat so
02:54 - we have this
02:57 - so in this thing it has a bunch of
02:59 - my blocks and we're going to be working
03:02 - on a bunch of those today so you just
03:03 - drag
03:04 - when the green flag is clicked
03:07 - and you make a new my blog called setup
03:09 - game
03:10 - so whenever you finish the whenever the
03:12 - scratch cat finishes the problem it will
03:15 - set up the game again so then you can do
03:17 - it again and
03:18 - we have set up game and then we'll just
03:20 - define setup game
03:24 - and now we have defined setup game it'll
03:27 - ask us
03:29 - what
03:30 - you want like circle what do you want uh
03:33 - square
03:34 - so we have this ask
03:37 - said enter
03:39 - your
03:40 - choice
03:44 - one
03:47 - two
03:49 - [Music]
03:51 - oh yeah we need space uh or
03:54 - three or
03:56 - three
03:57 - and now we're done with that it will you
04:00 - need an if then else statement
04:06 - if then the answer equals one will it'll
04:08 - be the triang rectangle i mean so uh
04:11 - since this is the rectangle you'll find
04:13 - the area of the rectangle you want it to
04:15 - find so area you need operator
04:18 - equal
04:20 - if the answer equals one so answer
04:24 - then you will
04:26 - make a block called rectangle so as i
04:29 - said we're going to be working with a
04:32 - bunch of
04:33 - these my blocks today so
04:36 - we have rectangle
04:37 - we're going to put this to the side
04:39 - and then we're going to put rectangle
04:41 - over here
04:43 - else
04:47 - so we're actually going to code the
04:48 - rectangle first because i feel like we
04:50 - it's more organized so we have the
04:52 - rectangle
04:54 - it's going to ask you to enter the
04:55 - length so what's your one
04:58 - enter
04:59 - the
05:00 - length
05:04 - and wait
05:06 - oh i saw the wrong length and set length
05:11 - [Music]
05:15 - length
05:19 - to answer
05:25 - and now
05:26 - we have that because uh whatever length
05:29 - you need like four we'll set it to the
05:31 - answer and then it'll ask
05:34 - what is your width
05:37 - enter
05:39 - the
05:40 - width
05:43 - and now it's going to tell you and then
05:45 - now it's going to set a width
05:51 - and i was going to set the width
05:55 - to
05:57 - enter
05:58 - to whatever you entered and now you'll
06:01 - set area
06:05 - new variable
06:11 - and now you'll set the area
06:13 - to the length on your list because let's
06:15 - say you find the area of a
06:20 - a rectangle or square so we set that to
06:24 - length times width
06:30 - and now we say
06:34 - because we join the air the uh
06:37 - area
06:39 - so
06:40 - it will say join
06:45 - area
06:47 - equals
06:50 - and we
06:51 - area equals and we have a space and
06:53 - another space
06:55 - and then here
06:57 - we write
06:58 - area
06:59 - for
07:00 - any sections you want but i'm gonna say
07:02 - three because it's reasonable to write
07:03 - that down
07:04 - and
07:05 - set up game so it'll start over here
07:07 - again and so then you can ask whatever
07:09 - you want
07:10 - [Music]
07:11 - so now let's move back
07:14 - so i'm gonna yeah let's move on to the
07:16 - triangle first let's hide these
07:18 - variables and now um
07:22 - so let's
07:23 - see
07:24 - one into the left length uh eight
07:28 - with 3 24. so easy math and now we're
07:33 - going to
07:34 - look at
07:35 - the triangle
07:37 - so you need another if-then-else
07:40 - statement
07:42 - if then the answer
07:44 - equals two
07:46 - [Music]
07:49 - answer equals two
07:51 - then it will
07:53 - triangle
07:55 - because it'll become a triangle
07:58 - triangle
08:01 - it will be a triangle
08:05 - and now we have the triangle let's work
08:07 - on the triangle
08:11 - and yeah let's do this so triangle ask
08:14 - enter base because base times height
08:18 - is the triangle
08:20 - method divided by two and so we have um
08:25 - ask
08:27 - enter
08:28 - the base
08:31 - and then it'll say set base
08:35 - to enter
08:36 - so we need another variable base
08:40 - set base
08:42 - to answer
08:44 - so whatever you want the base to be
08:46 - and now
08:48 - if you hear any piano in the background
08:50 - which is my brother playing piano uh i
08:53 - don't know what he's playing right now
08:54 - but okay whatever and i'll set base to
08:56 - answer um
08:58 - it'll ask
09:00 - enter
09:02 - the
09:03 - height the highest ball height yes
09:05 - and it'll set height to answer
09:08 - make a new variable
09:10 - always use new variable
09:12 - and then uh
09:14 - and then i'll set
09:17 - height
09:20 - to answer and
09:23 - i'll set area
09:26 - to
09:28 - base
09:30 - all right so let's break this down so we
09:32 - have two time signs we put one of them
09:34 - inside there we put them in here jamming
09:37 - them there and then we have a 0.5
09:40 - because that's basically one half of
09:42 - something
09:43 - so we have 0.5
09:46 - times base
09:49 - times height
09:50 - so basically base times height divided
09:52 - by two or base times height
09:54 - divided uh just
09:56 - one half of that
09:57 - and
09:58 - now it would we just have to duplicate
10:00 - this and instead of saying yeah and yeah
10:03 - that's just it and that's for the
10:04 - triangle
10:05 - so let's test that
10:08 - two
10:09 - three three four point five i'm pretty
10:11 - sure that's right three times three nine
10:13 - divided by two yeah four four five so
10:15 - and now we have to work on the um
10:20 - circle
10:21 - and if you didn't know circle is
10:24 - uh your
10:26 - um
10:27 - what was that
10:28 - circle is the
10:30 - radius
10:31 - and times 3.14 so we have triangle here
10:35 - so we put that under the else here
10:38 - and
10:40 - if answer equals three
10:44 - then it will circle
10:46 - as i said we're having a lot of blocks
10:48 - in this video
10:50 - so
10:52 - yeah we have circle
10:55 - it will circle and this
10:57 - drag it over there for now and other
11:00 - than that it'll say
11:02 - invalid choice because what if he said
11:04 - 84 and that's not a part of that so we
11:07 - have to say invalid choice
11:13 - choice
11:16 - for two seconds and then it'll set up
11:17 - the game again because once you have an
11:19 - invalid choice you have to click the
11:21 - green flag to do all that all over again
11:24 - so you have to have the setup game
11:27 - yeah if you didn't have this under the
11:29 - invalid choice if you typed in 84
11:32 - because that's not one two or three that
11:34 - means it won't start over again so we
11:35 - need that over there and now let's work
11:37 - on the circle
11:39 - so
11:40 - you'll ask you to enter the diameter
11:49 - so he spell it yeah and um
11:52 - set radius so new variable a lot of
11:55 - variables in this uh uh video
12:01 - i'm just checking my spelling
12:04 - set radius
12:07 - to
12:08 - answer divided by 2.
12:11 - so area for circle is pi r squared and r
12:14 - squared is radius square so um
12:17 - pi
12:18 - r squared 3.14
12:20 - and by that by 2. so the radius is the
12:24 - answer
12:25 - divided by 2 because you say like 4 will
12:28 - be 2
12:28 - and it'll do that again because it's pi
12:31 - r squared so you have this
12:34 - division
12:36 - answer
12:39 - by two
12:41 - and um
12:44 - you'll you'll have to do this oh never
12:47 - mind and then you'll have to just delete
12:49 - this
12:52 - and
12:56 - so
13:01 - we're going to
13:03 - move that a little bit so
13:05 - he'll set the area to
13:07 - 3.14 times radius times radius because
13:10 - pi r squared 3.14 times radius and
13:13 - radius
13:14 - and we'll set the
13:16 - the area to
13:18 - we need times and another times
13:23 - and
13:24 - that would be 3.14
13:29 - times radius times radius radius squared
13:36 - and
13:37 - it will say
13:38 - okay we'll just get this
13:41 - area equals area for three seconds and
13:44 - we'll set up the game again so we just
13:47 - have to work on the backdrop and
13:50 - get this done
13:54 - and then so we'll set
13:56 - the sound where's the sound
13:59 - set volume
14:00 - to 25 you know this is optional
14:04 - and then it'll go forever
14:07 - and we got some
14:08 - relaxing music
14:13 - this one
14:14 - and we just put that in so now we're
14:16 - done with our project
14:18 - so now we're going to show you the
14:19 - circle
14:20 - and the circle 3.14
14:23 - so we're going to enter the diameter
14:26 - so diameter
14:29 - enter the diameter
14:32 - um
14:32 - let's go
14:34 - uh 10 because the radius is 5
14:38 - so
14:39 - we're going to go
14:43 - so now um yeah i'm going to show you the
14:45 - code one let's just test this
14:48 - yeah i think i think it should work
14:51 - individual parts but let's show you um
14:54 - the cat sprite
14:56 - uh let's jam this all together let's see
14:59 - if we can do it
15:04 - yeah
15:06 - yeah if you can see this this is good
15:08 - but uh feel free to pause and um
15:13 - and copy down all this code if you don't
15:15 - have it yet feel free to pause and
15:19 - please like share subscribe and comment
15:22 - the comment section below what else
15:23 - projects you want us to make and uh see
15:26 - you guys next time
15:28 - [Music]
