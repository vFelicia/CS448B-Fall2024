00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys to kid screenplay
00:08 - right here today we'll be doing another
00:10 - tutorial on blocks so in our last video
00:12 - for motion blocks someone told us to
00:14 - make a looks block video so here we are
00:16 - making a looks block video so i'm going
00:19 - to explain a little bit about each block
00:22 - and tell you guys how to use them
00:24 - so without further ado let's continue on
00:26 - to the project so
00:27 - first we have the say hello or anything
00:30 - you can put here for two seconds so this
00:32 - one's really self-explanatory it's just
00:33 - basically when you put it you click it
00:36 - right it just says hello for two seconds
00:38 - you can change the values for the hello
00:40 - the saying what to say and for how long
00:43 - and this is just saying hello this is
00:45 - no time limit it's just going to say
00:47 - hello yeah it's not going to disappear
00:49 - same with this one
00:51 - think this is the same thing as hello
00:53 - except is thinking for two seconds and
00:55 - this is the thinking without time so
00:59 - it's just going to say think
01:00 - but you can change the values as well
01:02 - for those two
01:03 - here we have the costume
01:05 - so you can switch the costume to two so
01:06 - here inside the scratch cat as you can
01:08 - see there are two costumes looks like
01:09 - it's running
01:11 - so we can click this as you can see it
01:14 - changes the costume
01:16 - so
01:17 - you can also change it back to the first
01:19 - one and change costume back to the first
01:21 - one so basically if you want to make
01:23 - your games better um by making costumes
01:26 - you can use this block
01:27 - to make your game look like uh more
01:30 - alive so like you know you can make a
01:32 - character switch costume to make it look
01:34 - like it's walking like the scratch cat
01:36 - okay and then next we have the next
01:38 - costume block so this is like if um
01:41 - let's say you don't have to switch a
01:42 - specific costume like a running
01:45 - animation or something you don't have to
01:46 - like keep switch to the second one
01:48 - because there's only two costumes you
01:49 - can just use next costume
01:51 - so
01:52 - so for the scratch cat
01:55 - um if since it wouldn't be as
01:57 - complicated if you use this block as to
02:00 - the other switch costume block because
02:02 - all you have to do is just one cream fly
02:04 - clicked you can just put it forever
02:05 - right
02:06 - so now when you click as you can see it
02:08 - just switches it but like for this one
02:11 - since there is only two costumes
02:14 - and it's only for running you do not
02:16 - need to do that so next costume is just
02:18 - for like
02:19 - uh
02:20 - running animation stuff like that it's
02:21 - perfect for that stuff
02:23 - and then switch backdrop so
02:25 - let's import a backdrop so
02:27 - let's
02:28 - import this one it doesn't really matter
02:31 - so you switch to backdrop one right so
02:34 - right here if you switch the backdrop
02:38 - so here we have arctic right so you'll
02:40 - switch to the arctic backdrop this one's
02:42 - also self-explanatory
02:43 - so i like to when you move off the
02:46 - screen in some game maybe you want to
02:47 - switch the backdrop
02:49 - or if you're doing an animation you want
02:51 - to switch the backdrop because the
02:52 - characters are moving to a different
02:53 - place this is the block for that
02:56 - and then next we have next backdrop this
02:58 - is the same thing as next costume if you
02:59 - don't want to like switch this specific
03:01 - backdrop you can use the next backdrop
03:03 - button so you can click as you can see
03:06 - it just switches to the next backdrop
03:08 - you don't need to use the switch one
03:10 - and then next we have the change size so
03:12 - this one is like self-explanatory two so
03:15 - all you do is just click it it'll change
03:17 - the size of the cat as you can see
03:18 - and you can put negative 10 if you want
03:20 - to make it smaller so you can change the
03:22 - size
03:23 - so
03:24 - here's just to change the size so let's
03:27 - say you want to make something pop up
03:28 - make it look like it's going towards you
03:30 - then you can use the change size
03:33 - or maybe you want to shrink something
03:35 - you can use the change size effect as
03:37 - well
03:38 - and let's say um you want to go back
03:40 - costume so you know how the next costume
03:42 - just switches costumes but what if you
03:44 - want to go back one costume instead of
03:46 - uh instead of like making a specific
03:48 - costume you just want to go back one
03:50 - because you know that's the costume you
03:52 - want to be on so let's say you're on
03:54 - this costume right so to make it go back
03:57 - a costume you just go switch costume use
03:59 - a subtraction so you can do that and
04:01 - then you get the costume number
04:04 - uh subtract by one so it'll go like this
04:07 - as you can see it's going back to its
04:09 - original form
04:10 - and basically this is just the next
04:12 - costume one except you want to go
04:14 - backwards you use this one
04:16 - and then next we have the color effect
04:18 - um and the chain set size i forgot about
04:21 - this one this is just to set the size of
04:23 - the cat to a certain thing in the
04:24 - beginning so maybe it's at 500 size
04:27 - then it'll be that big
04:29 - and or if you set it 50
04:31 - then it'll be smaller so this is just to
04:33 - set the size of the cat however you want
04:36 - or your sprite
04:38 - and here we have the change effect so we
04:40 - have the color right and change the
04:41 - color of the cat
04:43 - and then right here we have the fish eye
04:45 - this is just like turn it like
04:48 - like big in the middle like a fish eye
04:50 - and then right here we have the world
04:52 - this is just like whirl yeah as you can
04:54 - see so this just may add some effect
04:56 - into your games and projects pixelate
04:58 - here just pixelates it yeah like that
05:01 - mosaic this is just to make duplicates
05:03 - of it like a lot of them
05:05 - and then brightness this is just to
05:06 - change the brightness of it so it
05:07 - becomes more bright when you click it
05:09 - and then we have a ghost it just makes
05:11 - it ghost away and hide
05:13 - so
05:14 - uh you can just select the different
05:15 - ones and you can also change the effect
05:17 - by different values so if you want to
05:19 - change by negative it'll come back
05:21 - to normal if you're in the ghost and
05:23 - then maybe you want to ghost it to 100
05:26 - to make it hide completely you can
05:27 - change the value as well you can do the
05:29 - same thing with everything else
05:32 - uh we usually don't use any of these
05:35 - that much
05:36 - the ones i use the most is the color and
05:38 - ghost effect
05:40 - um and then here we have clear graphic
05:42 - effects and set the color so
05:44 - set color
05:45 - what this does is you can set the
05:48 - thing
05:49 - to affect any of these effects to a
05:51 - certain thing so you're going to set the
05:53 - color effect to 100 then click it
05:56 - well first we have to clear the graphic
05:58 - effects set thing to 100 as you can see
06:01 - it can just set a color effect or any of
06:04 - these effects
06:05 - to a certain value so you don't have to
06:07 - like keep on changing it so you can set
06:08 - it to wherever you want
06:10 - here we have the clear graphic effects
06:12 - so you see it's blue right so you just
06:13 - click the clear graphic effects to make
06:15 - it back to normal
06:16 - and then we have to show and hide these
06:18 - are arguably the most used looks blocks
06:22 - so for show so hide is just to hide the
06:24 - character and show is to show it
06:27 - so in many games
06:29 - in almost every project i do i think i
06:31 - need to use the hide and show button
06:33 - like blocks because
06:35 - let's say you start the game right uh
06:37 - you want to hide a certain like maybe
06:39 - the start button you want to hide that
06:41 - right so you'll hide it but in the
06:43 - beginning you want to show it so
06:44 - you'll need to use the hide and show to
06:46 - make your game look much better
06:48 - so you don't want the play button
06:50 - showing up while you're in playing the
06:52 - game
06:53 - next you have to go to the front layer
06:55 - you can make it go to the back as well
06:56 - so go to front layer is going to be the
06:59 - front layer so it just goes to the front
07:01 - and overlaps anything else behind it and
07:04 - then go to back layer it's just going to
07:05 - the back so we'll need some layers to
07:07 - show how that works so let's just
07:09 - duplicate our scratch cap
07:11 - so inside our sprite one we'll just put
07:13 - it on top here
07:14 - so go to back layer as you can see it
07:16 - will go behind the other scratch cat and
07:18 - then go to front layer it will go in
07:20 - front of the other scratch cap
07:23 - and then next we have the
07:25 - go
07:25 - forward or backwards a certain amount of
07:27 - layers i shouldn't have deleted that uh
07:29 - i think i can restore it yeah so you can
07:32 - just restore the sprite
07:33 - so
07:35 - here is the same thing pretty much
07:37 - unless you want to set it to a certain
07:38 - amount of layers
07:40 - so go forward one layer
07:42 - it's basically just go forward one layer
07:45 - and then for go backwards one layer
07:47 - let's go backwards one layer and you can
07:49 - if you have even more layers you can
07:50 - change the value of the amount of layers
07:53 - so then it'll go to the certain place
07:55 - you want it to be the certain layer
07:57 - and then here we have the costume number
07:59 - so this is just the number for the
08:00 - costume as you can see costume number
08:03 - one is costume one costume number two is
08:05 - costume two so earlier when i show you
08:07 - guys how to go back a costume we use the
08:09 - costume number to check
08:11 - uh so you use the cost number minus one
08:13 - so two minus one would be one so you'll
08:15 - go back one costume
08:17 - and then here we have the backdrop
08:18 - number this is the same thing except for
08:20 - the backdrop you see we have one and two
08:22 - so backdrop one is right here backdrop
08:24 - two is here so it'd be the same thing if
08:26 - you want to go back a backdrop you'd
08:28 - switch the backdrop
08:29 - by the subtraction
08:32 - switch the backdrop to subtract
08:34 - backdrop number -1
08:37 - so you would go back one backdrop so
08:39 - there you go
08:42 - and finally we have one last block and
08:44 - that's the size so
08:46 - the size this is the size of the cat so
08:48 - like basically
08:50 - um in some
08:51 - like
08:52 - like in like if you're gonna make a bun
08:54 - pop up or something you're gonna need to
08:55 - use the size
08:57 - um to make it like pop up so the size is
09:00 - just like the size of the cat so maybe
09:02 - you can do
09:04 - uh
09:05 - you can do the size
09:06 - plus maybe 100 so that'd be 200 size so
09:10 - it will increase
09:12 - so you see those uh
09:15 - size
09:17 - plus 200 i'll set the size to 200 right
09:19 - there
09:21 - so what you can do is just do set size
09:24 - put that in here click that as you can
09:25 - see the cat is now 200 size
09:29 - all right so that's all the
09:31 - uh looks block so that's it for the
09:33 - video thank you guys for watching don't
