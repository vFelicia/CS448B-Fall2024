00:00 - thank you
00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's consumer playing
00:08 - around here and today we're back with
00:10 - another video in scratch and today we'll
00:12 - be making a reaction time test on
00:15 - scratch so if you've ever wondered what
00:17 - your reaction time is and I've also
00:19 - always wondered so uh we made a scratch
00:21 - project just for that and it's in
00:24 - milliseconds so it'll show your reaction
00:26 - time
00:29 - so uh I'm gonna show you the original
00:32 - project that we got the idea from it's
00:34 - in our credit so I already shared the
00:36 - project but it only has like five views
00:38 - right now so um
00:41 - this is the link of the original that we
00:45 - got the idea from so I'm going to show
00:46 - you the project
00:48 - so this is the um
00:51 - the project so it's like wait for green
00:53 - click and then you get your reaction
00:56 - time
00:57 - and
00:58 - uh so we're gonna click and after five
01:01 - values after when you do it five times
01:04 - it'll get your average of your um
01:07 - reaction times and see what your average
01:10 - of your reaction times are so
01:13 - it's a pick random I think a second so
01:17 - I'm gonna
01:19 - go
01:20 - and our average reaction time is 396
01:23 - milliseconds
01:25 - so I'm going to show you our reaction
01:27 - time test so we start off over here and
01:30 - then uh it says click anywhere you start
01:31 - and then you wait for green
01:34 - and you click and it'll show your
01:36 - reaction time
01:39 - so and after five times it'll give you
01:42 - an average
01:43 - of your reaction times like the other
01:46 - game
01:47 - so
01:50 - I'm gonna try to get a better reaction
01:52 - time
01:53 - but 265 milliseconds
01:58 - and then click ok so
02:00 - five tries and my average reaction time
02:03 - is
02:04 - 257.4 seconds
02:07 - milliseconds my bad anyway
02:10 - um let's go to our project so I already
02:12 - have all the backdrops
02:15 - inside the project already so uh you can
02:18 - come to my profile Gumball zero nine
02:20 - eight and you can come to the backdrop
02:23 - and Export all these
02:26 - uh and or drag them to the backpack so
02:29 - you can just drag them to the backpack
02:30 - like that
02:32 - so just take my Sprites or you can draw
02:35 - your own because it's very simple to do
02:37 - it okay so I'm gonna go do a review of
02:40 - all the backdrops that we have created
02:41 - so we're gonna start with the start so
02:43 - reaction time test so when the red box
02:46 - turns green it will just show you the
02:47 - instructions click as quickly as you can
02:49 - click anywhere to start so that's the
02:50 - first backdrop red it'll just say wait
02:53 - for green then green click and then I'll
02:57 - show your result after the whatever
03:00 - round that you're on and after that if
03:03 - you click during the red like wait for
03:06 - the green and you click too early it'll
03:09 - say too soon and you have to restart so
03:11 - uh do not click during the red and not
03:14 - don't try to cheat the system because it
03:16 - will not work and you have to restart
03:17 - all over again and then final score uh
03:21 - it'll show you your score of your
03:23 - reaction time so
03:25 - that's just a quick review of all the
03:27 - backdrops so let's get started we do not
03:29 - need any Sprites for this project
03:32 - so
03:34 - so uh
03:36 - so we're gonna start with the green flag
03:39 - so we have our green flag like always
03:40 - and then we have to go to our videos
03:42 - create a new variable called index
03:48 - um
03:49 - reaction time
03:53 - uh
03:55 - total reaction time
04:02 - and yeah we have all our videos so we
04:05 - set the index to one because we're using
04:07 - lists in this project and lists I
04:12 - normally start at zero or well the index
04:15 - but in scratch it starts at one so you
04:18 - have to change the index to one and oh
04:21 - set reaction time
04:24 - to zero because you haven't even started
04:26 - yet and it'll set the total reaction
04:28 - time to zero as well
04:31 - then it will hide the variable reaction
04:33 - time and it will also hide the variable
04:35 - total reaction time because you do not
04:37 - need those values yet so and now we're
04:40 - going to make a block called start
04:44 - test
04:48 - and now we have our start test book so
04:50 - now we can drag in start test from here
04:53 - so we're on to our start test place and
04:57 - there's something under variables if
04:59 - you've never noticed there's something
05:00 - called lists so just click on variables
05:02 - and you'll see lists as many uh things
05:05 - that you can play around over here but
05:07 - today we'll be using delete all of
05:09 - timetable list because we have to delete
05:11 - all the time table list because you
05:13 - started you might have done the thing
05:16 - before so you have to reset it by
05:18 - deleting all
05:19 - of the values inside the list
05:22 - so we forgot to delete this you will not
05:25 - I don't think you'll see this uh uh list
05:28 - variable thing over here so you have to
05:30 - click on make a list okay so make a list
05:32 - and then you have to write time table
05:37 - list but we're not going to make a new
05:39 - one because we already have one and we
05:40 - forgot to delete it before we started
05:42 - this video so just saying and
05:45 - so we'll delete all of your list and
05:48 - after that we'll switch backdrop to
05:51 - start which is the beginning of the
05:53 - project
05:54 - the instructions manual
05:57 - and it'll wait until Mouse down because
06:00 - it says click anywhere to continue so we
06:03 - have to wait until the mouse is down to
06:05 - continue
06:07 - after that it will repeat five times
06:09 - because you have five Reaction Time
06:12 - tests right so you have to repeat it
06:14 - five times and it'll broadcast a new
06:17 - message and wait so it'll broadcast a
06:21 - message called start sense
06:25 - uh
06:29 - so yeah we have start sensing and
06:32 - so now we're gonna work on another place
06:35 - so we're so when I receive
06:37 - start sensing which is our message it
06:41 - will wait
06:43 - I'll pick random
06:47 - uh 2.555 to 4.55 we have these little
06:52 - decimals because we want more range
06:54 - inside our data uh I mean our time so
06:57 - uh it could take
07:00 - 2.557 seconds or whatever and then after
07:03 - that
07:05 - we have to
07:07 - this uh script over here is to check the
07:10 - green part so the click part in our
07:12 - backdrop and so we'll reset the timer
07:15 - because we're using a timer to check
07:17 - your times and then we have to switch
07:20 - the backdrop to Green
07:23 - which is our backdrop and then we'll
07:26 - wait until
07:28 - Mouse down because that's when you click
07:32 - so wait until Mouse down when you click
07:35 - on the green and then
07:38 - after that it'll set
07:41 - reaction time
07:44 - to
07:46 - timer see if you got times first
07:51 - set reaction time to timer
07:56 - times
07:58 - one thousand so the timer is how long it
08:02 - takes you
08:03 - to click on the thing but it will say in
08:06 - seconds and we want our reaction time in
08:08 - milliseconds because a normal reaction
08:11 - time I guess is in milliseconds like 0.4
08:15 - milliseconds I'm at 0.4 seconds so that
08:18 - would be 400 milliseconds so you have to
08:20 - multiply that by a thousand to get your
08:23 - milliseconds so after that we have to
08:26 - add
08:29 - your reaction time because we have to
08:31 - keep this in store
08:33 - in mind so we have to add our reaction
08:36 - time to the timetable list our first
08:38 - reaction time
08:40 - in their timetable is so we can uh value
08:42 - them in the end and find the average of
08:45 - all of them and then we have to switch
08:48 - backdrop to result
08:51 - and oh
08:52 - show the variable reaction time
08:55 - so if you don't know result is this one
08:58 - it does not have a certain time because
08:59 - we don't know your reaction time so it
09:01 - will show the variable
09:04 - reaction time
09:05 - on this part so then it will show your
09:09 - reaction time wait two seconds
09:13 - and it will hide
09:17 - your variable
09:19 - reaction time
09:21 - so we have that now so this is to check
09:25 - the green the clicking the place where
09:28 - you're supposed to click so now we're
09:29 - going to work on the place that you're
09:32 - not supposed to click so then we can put
09:34 - the script the backdrop too soon
09:37 - when you click at the red part so when I
09:40 - receive start sensing
09:42 - I'll switch backdrop to red and if you
09:45 - don't know what red is it is the white
09:46 - for green
09:49 - so switch your backdrop to red
09:51 - and it'll wait 0.1 seconds this way is
09:54 - very important
09:56 - if you do not have the weight it will
09:59 - actually start and when you start it'll
10:03 - literally just say too soon once you're
10:06 - done coding this so you need a little
10:08 - weight or else they'll think the first
10:10 - click that you have on
10:12 - the this start backdrop if you click on
10:16 - this and you do not have a weight it'll
10:18 - go straight to too soon but that's after
10:21 - when you code all this so let's code all
10:22 - of it first so it'll wait until
10:26 - Mouse is down
10:28 - so that's if you click on the red part
10:30 - remember that so if you click on the red
10:32 - part if then
10:36 - if then
10:37 - uh you need equal sign
10:40 - if then the backdrop name is red which
10:43 - means so you need that drop name is red
10:49 - that means it will stop all the scripts
10:52 - of the Sprite because you just clicked
10:55 - on the red which is not supposed to
10:57 - happen so we're going to stop other
10:59 - scripts in the Sprite and it'll switch
11:01 - backdrop
11:04 - to
11:05 - oopsies
11:08 - switch backdrop to too soon because you
11:12 - clicked on the red too soon and you
11:15 - should yeah so after that it'll stop all
11:17 - and you have to restart the game to
11:20 - continue playing so now we have all this
11:23 - code
11:24 - so uh feel free to pause over here so
11:28 - you can see all the code and we will
11:30 - continue now on our main Define start
11:33 - test
11:34 - so now under that we have to have a
11:37 - repeat until I may not repeat until
11:40 - repeat
11:42 - length of timetable list
11:46 - there's five values in the uh
11:49 - length of the timetable is because
11:51 - you're doing five reaction time uh tests
11:55 - so it'll have five values so it'll
11:57 - repeat the length of the timetable list
11:59 - and it will set this is a really long
12:02 - block so say bear with me
12:05 - put this over set total reaction time
12:10 - so that's your value I mean your average
12:13 - or your mean when you add up everything
12:15 - and you divide by uh the values you have
12:18 - inside your list which is five for this
12:20 - project so it'll set total reaction time
12:22 - to
12:24 - add block
12:27 - total reaction time which is your
12:30 - reaction time
12:32 - Plus
12:34 - the item
12:37 - uh index
12:39 - go get index
12:41 - of
12:43 - the timetable list
12:45 - after that it will change the index by
12:47 - one and index is to switch from one the
12:52 - Val the first value to the second then
12:55 - to the third then the fourth and the
12:57 - Fifth Fifth so
12:58 - um we need this change index so it will
13:01 - change the first one to the second one
13:04 - and it will take your reaction times
13:07 - and after that it will set
13:10 - oopsies set total reaction time
13:15 - to
13:17 - um
13:18 - Divine so set total reaction time
13:22 - to Total Reaction Time divided by five
13:26 - and if you do not know if you have to
13:28 - calculate the mean or the average of a
13:31 - set of data you have to add up
13:35 - everything so the computers can do this
13:38 - for us and then you have to divide by
13:40 - five to find your average of all of your
13:44 - data so and after that just switch
13:47 - backdrop
13:50 - to final score because that's your final
13:52 - score overall and it's this one and
13:56 - it'll not show over here because you
13:57 - have to put the variable right there and
13:59 - it will show the variable
14:05 - uh total reaction time
14:07 - in that final reaction time place
14:10 - and stop it all
14:15 - I just tested the game and the
14:18 - millisecond thing isn't showing up at
14:21 - the exact spot so we actually have to
14:24 - move it because if you do not know the
14:27 - variables start over here so we're gonna
14:30 - open our reaction time
14:32 - and we're gonna move it and we just have
14:35 - to double click on it let's show the
14:36 - reaction time we don't have zero
14:37 - reaction time right now you go wait for
14:39 - green
14:40 - you click but it does not say it over
14:42 - here so my reaction time is 330 because
14:48 - I did not move it move it so we have to
14:51 - go like that wait for green
14:53 - and we have to click on the click so it
14:56 - will show our millisecond uh please so
14:58 - we move our um oopsies they're both over
15:02 - here
15:04 - so it will show your milliseconds
15:07 - and to go to our final score
15:11 - I have to move it it looks
15:13 - disproportionate so
15:15 - I might have to
15:17 - move it up maybe yeah
15:21 - so it should show up over there if I'm
15:24 - not mistaken
15:28 - maybe that will work out
15:30 - my favor oopsies yeah so the two student
15:33 - works at least we know that and
15:36 - let's go to our
15:38 - millisecond over here
15:40 - and show our reaction time so perfect
15:44 - like look a little disproportionate if
15:46 - you can proportion it if you can like
15:48 - place it better that's great
15:51 - up total reaction time
15:54 - we have to move the total reaction time
15:56 - also so we just double click on this
15:59 - go over here
16:01 - and like place it right there
16:04 - so it should show up so it should work
16:06 - I'm gonna go test it off camera for a
16:08 - moment and I'll show you if it works so
16:10 - now um I just tested it and it works
16:13 - perfectly so I'm going to show you it
16:16 - I'm going to show you all the the stuff
16:17 - that we did today
16:20 - feel free to pause over here if you do
16:22 - not have all the code but now we're
16:23 - gonna start testing our project
16:27 - I'm gonna start reaction time test when
16:29 - the red box turns green click as quickly
16:31 - as you can click anywhere to start
16:32 - wait for green
16:34 - [Music]
16:37 - click
16:38 - and 661 milliseconds is bad uh anyway uh
16:42 - so we're gonna start
16:44 - and oh I double clicked so if you click
16:47 - over here it'll say too soon
16:49 - click green flag to start again too soon
16:51 - so too soon Works wait for green
16:55 - click and it'll show you your
16:57 - milliseconds
16:58 - wait for green
17:02 - it's like and it'll it shows that screen
17:05 - and I'll wait for green I'm gonna see
17:07 - what my average is kind of messed up
17:10 - there
17:11 - gonna get 200 in the 200s
17:15 - yeah so paper green
17:20 - yeah so um
17:22 - 323 so we have our project here and I
17:27 - already shared the project on Gumball
17:28 - 098 so
17:30 - please comment what your reaction time
17:33 - is because I'm very curious for uh to
17:36 - hear all your reaction times because
17:37 - it's fun and uh like share subscribe and
17:42 - comment in the comment section below if
17:45 - you can't come to the project what is
17:47 - what was your reaction time when you did
17:48 - the project so yeah
17:50 - have a great day see you next time
17:53 - [Music]
