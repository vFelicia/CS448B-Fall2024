00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello and welcome back to kids going
00:09 - play today we'll be making a shape
00:11 - matching game in scratch so before we
00:14 - begin don't forget to like share and
00:15 - subscribe if you want to see more videos
00:17 - like this so let's show you guys the
00:20 - project so you just use the left and
00:22 - right arrow keys to move around and up
00:24 - and down arrow keys is to change the
00:26 - shape and you basically try to match the
00:27 - shape to gain points and if you don't
00:30 - match then you don't get points so say I
00:33 - don't match then it just doesn't gain
00:35 - any points and so yeah you just try to
00:38 - match it and try to get as much score as
00:40 - you can and um so yeah it's pretty much
00:43 - the game it's pretty simple game for
00:44 - beginners and let's start a new project
00:47 - guys
00:49 - so new project all right so what we want
00:53 - to do is first reame project of course
00:55 - so shape matching
00:57 - game matching game all right we're going
01:01 - to delete the scratch cat and okay so
01:04 - for I have the I have the Sprite already
01:07 - for um the shapes and stuff but I'll
01:09 - show you guys how to draw it on your own
01:11 - okay so what you want to do is get a
01:14 - paint okay and I made a different
01:17 - costume I made five different costumes
01:18 - so we have a square um a triangle a
01:22 - rhombus a circle and a rectangle so
01:25 - these are my five shapes and to make
01:27 - these um it's pretty simple so for the
01:30 - square what I did was I just took the
01:32 - square tool um I made it a certain color
01:36 - you hold down shift and then you can
01:37 - make a perfect square and what I want to
01:40 - do what you want to do is to make the um
01:43 - Square align with the Crosshair here you
01:46 - see the Crosshair down here so you want
01:48 - to make um this line up like that so you
01:51 - want to make all the Sprites like this
01:53 - you don't want to Center your Sprites
01:55 - because some Sprites are different sizes
01:57 - and shapes than others so we want to
01:59 - make it all uniform so they're all in
02:01 - the same position so you want to
02:02 - position all your Sprites like this so
02:04 - if I can go to the other Sprite you can
02:07 - see that all the Sprites are positioned
02:09 - in the same position like right above
02:11 - the Crosshair in the middle so you don't
02:13 - want to censor your Sprites so something
02:14 - like this like in the um in the ballpark
02:17 - area just do something like that so
02:19 - that's how you do a square to draw a
02:21 - triangle all you have to do is get the
02:23 - reshaped tool so select it and you can
02:25 - just uh delete one of the corners so you
02:27 - backspace and you got a triangle and
02:29 - then what you can do just rotate it um
02:31 - like that so you can hold on shift and
02:34 - then there you go you got your triangle
02:36 - all right and for um Circle uh you can
02:40 - just use the circle tool um and you want
02:43 - to make all your Sprites different
02:45 - colors um so Circle and oh rectangle uh
02:49 - Square you just draw you just duplicate
02:51 - your Square Sprite and just rotate it on
02:53 - the side and the rectangle you can just
02:55 - draw with the tool circle of course you
02:58 - just hold on shift draw draw a circle
03:00 - pick a different color and of course you
03:02 - have to make it a little bit above the
03:04 - center of the uh Crosshair like that and
03:07 - of course make different colors all
03:09 - right so that's how you draw the Sprites
03:12 - I already have it in my backpack so here
03:13 - are my five Sprites for the
03:16 - player so first let's make some
03:18 - variables let's make the variable
03:19 - score for all Sprites and then in the
03:23 - square in the player first we're going
03:24 - to go uh when green flag is clicked we
03:27 - are going to set the score to zero
03:31 - and then next I'm going to set this uh
03:33 - the Sprite to be somewhere uh near the
03:35 - center of the bottom so we're going to
03:37 - say go
03:39 - to x0 and Y 175 so that'll be somewhere
03:45 - like down here all right and then I'm
03:48 - going a forever Loop so this going to be
03:49 - the movement for the Sprite so I'm going
03:51 - to say move forever
03:54 - if uh right arrows press key right
03:59 - arrows press
04:01 - then we're going to say change the X by
04:03 - 10 so it's going to move 10 to the right
04:05 - and then we could just duplicate this
04:07 - right click duplicate if left arrow is
04:08 - pressed then we go X by
04:12 - -10 all right and then um next what
04:15 - we're going to do is uh make it so you
04:17 - can change the costume all right so
04:19 - we're going to say when the up arrows
04:22 - press so when up arrows pressed we're
04:26 - going to go next
04:27 - costume and we also want to make it so
04:30 - you can go back a costume so we're going
04:32 - to say going duplicate that so when down
04:34 - errors press we're going to say switch
04:36 - the
04:37 - costume to costume number minus one so
04:41 - it's going to go back one one costume
04:43 - number all right so we're going to say
04:45 - switch costume to costume number minus
04:48 - one costume
04:53 - number minus
04:55 - one all
04:57 - right okay so this is our player Sprite
05:00 - let's try it out so you can move left
05:01 - and right you go up it'll go next
05:03 - costume you go down it'll go back a
05:06 - costume all right so yeah so this is our
05:10 - player Sprite and then for the um shape
05:13 - that drops down all we have to do is
05:15 - just duplicate the player Sprite but we
05:17 - just delete the code so for um this one
05:20 - we're going to name it uh shape drop
05:23 - shape drop and we can just go ahead and
05:26 - delete all these blocks in the shape
05:28 - drop area and what we want to do is get
05:31 - when green flag clicked when green flag
05:33 - is clicked we can um clear graphic
05:36 - effects and the shape drop and we're
05:39 - going to make it so um the shapes will
05:41 - spawn from somewhere here to here up
05:43 - here so they'll fall from that area so
05:46 - we're going to say go to x and then
05:49 - we're going to say pick random for x -
05:51 - 180 to 180 and then we're going to say y
05:54 - 150 so it's somewhere up in the sky up
05:57 - at the top
05:59 - all right and then we're going to say
06:00 - switch costume to pick random 1 to five
06:03 - since there's five costumes so different
06:05 - shapes will fall so we're going to say
06:07 - pick random 1 to
06:09 - five and then we're going to
06:11 - say set we're going to make a new
06:13 - variable all right so we're going to
06:15 - make a new variable we're going to name
06:16 - it
06:17 - color so for color this is going to
06:20 - change the color of the Sprite so this
06:22 - doesn't really do much it's just going
06:24 - to make uh your Sprite change color so
06:27 - it's just for fun more um decoration or
06:30 - more add a little uh a little bit extra
06:33 - to your game so we're going to say set
06:34 - color to pick random 1 to 200 so be
06:38 - different colors falling down and we
06:40 - need to use a variable because uh we'll
06:42 - need to use it to control uh later
06:44 - functions all right and then so next
06:47 - we're going to say set color effect to
06:51 - the variable
06:53 - color and then we're going to
06:55 - show all right and then this is the code
06:58 - to make it draw so we're going to say
07:00 - forever we're going to say change y by
07:06 - -3 and I'm going to say we're going to
07:09 - make it so once it reaches uh the bottom
07:12 - it's going to disappear and go back to
07:13 - the top so we're going to say
07:17 - if the Y position is less than -
07:21 - 180 so we're using this instead of
07:23 - touching Edge because sometimes the
07:24 - shapes can be on the side and touch the
07:27 - side of the edge and that's not good we
07:28 - don't want it to reset because of that
07:30 - negative 180 sorry so um when the Y
07:34 - position is less than negative
07:36 - 180 we're going to
07:39 - hide and then we can just duplicate this
07:41 - code right here and uh so it will
07:44 - restart at the top and do
07:47 - that all right and then next what we
07:51 - going to do is get out one green flag
07:53 - clicked when green fly clicked we can
07:55 - get it
07:57 - forever and if
08:01 - so we're going to say if it's touching
08:02 - the player and the costume number is
08:04 - equal to the costume number of the
08:06 - player so if it's the same exact shape
08:09 - and it's touching the player then we
08:11 - have to broadcast a message and hide
08:12 - this shape drops Sprite so we're going
08:14 - to say if so we're going to get and and
08:18 - equal so let's put that like that so
08:20 - we're going to say
08:22 - if touching
08:25 - player touching
08:28 - player and
08:30 - costume number is equal to the costume
08:31 - number of the player so has to be the
08:33 - same exact costume for it to change
08:35 - color and disappear so say costume
08:37 - number is equal to the costume number of
08:39 - the player so we're going to take that
08:42 - and we have to change the second one
08:43 - before we change the first one so I say
08:44 - player and costume number then we're
08:47 - going to hide hide the
08:49 - Sprite the shape drop and then we're
08:52 - going to broadcast a message and we're
08:53 - going to name it matched so it knows
08:55 - that it
08:56 - matched matched all right
09:00 - and with the match we're going to go
09:01 - back to the player so when I receive the
09:03 - variable I mean the broadcast message
09:05 - match and we can change the score by
09:08 - five change score by five and then we're
09:11 - going to set the color effect to the
09:13 - variable color so it will switch to the
09:15 - color of the shape that
09:18 - dropped set color
09:22 - effect to the variable's color all right
09:27 - so that's all the code for the player
09:28 - and all the code for the shape drop so
09:31 - one last thing is get a backdrop so I
09:33 - think I use the um the stage I'm try to
09:37 - find it Spotlight okay yeah I use this
09:39 - one so we're going to hide the variable
09:41 - color let's keep the score all right so
09:42 - let's save let's play it so you move
09:46 - around it's not a match it won't work
09:47 - let's try to switch
09:49 - it as you can see when you touch it it
09:51 - changes the score and it changes the
09:54 - color as it
09:57 - matches there you go
10:00 - so another idea for you guys is you can
10:03 - make it so you can show when it wins and
10:05 - when you lose maybe something if you
10:07 - don't match something then you lose
10:09 - points or when you get to a certain
10:11 - score you're going to win so you can add
10:13 - that on your own and one last thing um
10:16 - one way you can clean up the code here
10:18 - as you can see there's like repeated
10:20 - code right so what we can do is make
10:22 - something called a custom
10:24 - block so with a custom block you don't
10:26 - have to repeat code it'll be easier uh
10:29 - to reuse the code later so we can name
10:30 - it like uh color
10:33 - change so that's our custom block color
10:36 - change so what we can do is take this
10:39 - code out put it right here and all we
10:42 - have to do is uh call it right here and
10:45 - we can remove that because it's the same
10:47 - exact thing and we can just call the
10:49 - function right here and it will do the
10:51 - same exact thing uh just looks more
10:53 - cleaner so let's play
10:56 - it all right
11:01 - as you can see it's uh working so yeah
11:04 - that's our simple game for today uh
11:07 - simple shape matching game for beginners
