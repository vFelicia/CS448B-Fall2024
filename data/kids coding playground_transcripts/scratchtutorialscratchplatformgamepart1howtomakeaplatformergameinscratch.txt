00:01 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys welcome back to kids calling
00:10 - playground once again we will be walking
00:13 - on an easier platform game today I think
00:16 - the ninja one that I started earlier
00:18 - it's a little bit too tough I think
00:21 - maybe if kids doesn't have a good
00:23 - understanding of scratch maybe too
00:25 - difficult so this is a little easier and
00:28 - also I have fixed it the some of the
00:30 - issue with the ninja game I encounter
00:33 - before the ninja getting away kind of
00:35 - stuck in the in the middle of the tiles
00:39 - here on the floor
00:41 - those are above platform so I fixed that
00:45 - a little bit so if you watch this video
00:47 - later you work on the ninja game you can
00:49 - make that changes there okay so today
00:52 - we'll make this a simple scratch
00:54 - platform again so as you can see we have
00:56 - a one treasure hunter guy here we have
01:00 - about three small platform on the top
01:02 - and the bottom platform on the bottom so
01:05 - the point of this game is the discharge
01:07 - of hunter how it jumps around and
01:09 - collect the gym so I don't have any
01:13 - level is only one level so this is just
01:16 - demonstrating of the simple scratch
01:18 - platform again okay alright let's go on
01:22 - to the second page okay so this video
01:26 - this tutorial you can learn about the
01:28 - custom block how to edit the sprite
01:31 - custom sprite a platform editing editing
01:33 - that platform and also you can control
01:37 - the sprite within the central platform
01:39 - learning how to do the control I will
01:41 - need there's a gravity pouring porta the
01:44 - sprite down right and then you cannot
01:46 - kind of hold a sprite back up you know
01:50 - if it touch certain color or the
01:52 - platform also you want to know where to
01:55 - download these sprites and tileset you
01:58 - can go to this URL below I will also
02:01 - have that in my
02:03 - description as well on the on the video
02:06 - alright okay let's get started
02:08 - okay alright let me demo the game once
02:12 - to you guys and then we'll get started
02:14 - okay so let me go to Mac screen okay so
02:21 - you see the this is the treasure hunter
02:25 - guy he can run and laugh and right jump
02:30 - this if you want to slice haha so you
02:47 - can run and slide how about than that
02:53 - it's really simple you just gonna jump
02:56 - around so I just can see if he's tried
03:00 - jungle pushing back down will show you
03:05 - so this is a little bit more smoother
03:08 - than the ninja ones so don't get stuck
03:11 - over there and also as you can see the
03:13 - smallest changes yeah alright so let's
03:20 - get on to the coding scheme gonna start
03:23 - this alright okay so before I begin
03:27 - please like share and subscribe to our
03:30 - channel and if you know anybody who's
03:32 - interested learning scratch you can pass
03:35 - our channel to them greatly appreciate
03:37 - it and if you have any comment or
03:39 - question just know down on the video
03:42 - below the comment below the video
03:44 - okay let's get started so we'll go file
03:47 - new okay so what do we need to do first
03:53 - so first will actually lower sprite into
03:56 - the game we can delete this cat we don't
03:58 - need we can say paint so this is
04:01 - painting the sprite so after you click
04:03 - on this paint sprite you go into here
04:05 - you can upload all your costume so I
04:09 - this is my tile set let me download my
04:12 - character first so this is the cake I'm
04:15 - using so the objector how many about we
04:19 - don't really need all the different
04:20 - sprite for the idol because I find that
04:24 - if we make idle switching costume it
04:26 - it's not that good actually the game
04:28 - doesn't run away well so we'll take the
04:30 - first or take all the jump okay let's do
04:34 - jump here from jump zero to jump nine
04:37 - and then run zero to run nine and sly
04:40 - okay so we take all this was hold the
04:44 - shift key and select and then hold ctrl
04:46 - P just selected the first Idol okay so
04:51 - we click open so as you can see all
04:55 - these are getting loaded so you have
04:57 - Idol you have jump and then you have run
05:02 - and you have slide right so where all
05:05 - the costume okay so the first custom
05:07 - would we did we can delete that okay so
05:10 - we have our guy over here okay so next
05:15 - we can get the platform so uh to make
05:18 - the video shorter I already have my
05:19 - platform but I'll show you guys how you
05:21 - would actually do it
05:22 - so let me go to demo I already created
05:24 - my platform okay Salo okay so how do you
05:31 - do the platform so in the platform the
05:33 - same way so what you do is you can just
05:36 - kind of upload all your platform in here
05:39 - and then you just kind of click on the
05:42 - platform say convert to vector so this
05:44 - is my let's say this B this is a bit nap
05:47 - Rice's connective a convert to vector
05:49 - and then you can use this arrow key
05:51 - selected say ctrl C copy and then you
05:55 - can go to your platform and then you can
05:57 - paste it there and you can just like
05:58 - kind of lined up like this you know
06:00 - however you want to line up your
06:01 - platform right so that's how we did the
06:04 - platform so same thing you will just
06:06 - upload right so you upload the custom
06:09 - and you have to go to the desert tile
06:12 - set go to the PNG go to the tile and
06:15 - just upload all your tile just say click
06:18 - on the first one hold the shift 3 click
06:21 - the last one say upload open so it will
06:23 - upload everything to here and
06:25 - after that you can just say convert to
06:27 - vector and then you can build a platform
06:28 - or you can just make like simple
06:31 - platform like this as well view like
06:33 - right so it doesn't matter so let me
06:35 - just delete that so I'm just so so what
06:39 - do you do is you can just make your
06:40 - platform and then you can resize them
06:42 - right you can say resize bigger and
06:44 - solar so when I say let me do an example
06:47 - for this one let's say for this will
06:49 - let's say we'll take one here right
06:52 - let's say we do one yeah I'm just doing
06:53 - over here let's say I put it here right
06:55 - this isn't one and then let's say I put
06:59 - this guy I copy this I go here control C
07:03 - control V and then this is the second
07:06 - block and this is the third block click
07:09 - here go back here and I can put it here
07:13 - so as you can see I kind of form one
07:16 - platform right you can come look into it
07:19 - a little bit make sure they're all
07:20 - aligned and you can like select them and
07:23 - move this guy out of the way and you can
07:25 - move this down and then what you can do
07:28 - is make sure you have this arrow here
07:29 - select them and you can kind of resize
07:32 - them right so how big you want how small
07:34 - you want so this is how you go the
07:37 - platform okay so you guys kind of get
07:42 - the idea how you would do the platform
07:44 - right okay so let me just trash this
07:48 - just delete this okay so we have the
07:52 - little man here with the platform I'll
07:54 - go back to my first platform this is the
07:56 - one I'm using so you can I move it
07:58 - around make sure you cover all the
08:00 - bigger than outside so that he actually
08:02 - doesn't fall off here so make sure that
08:04 - the platform's a little bit out bigger
08:07 - than the box around here okay
08:10 - all right so we've got the platform out
08:12 - of the way what we can do is we can you
08:15 - can decorate this a little bit later
08:17 - also and also we need to a background
08:20 - ISO habl√≥ to go back to the desert tile
08:22 - and there's something called background
08:24 - here background select that say open so
08:28 - this will fill the background in the
08:30 - back so you have the kind of the desert
08:32 - look and feel for the girl thought I
08:34 - came and then so now we have the
08:36 - background and you can add music later
08:39 - on and all that we can do that later but
08:41 - for now let's get the get create some
08:44 - variable and get going okay so what we
08:47 - need to do is we can change this one to
08:49 - rename it to score okay and we'll have
08:55 - to mix them all variable we have our
08:57 - fall speed this is basically detecting
09:01 - how fast the sprite going to fall down
09:05 - and then we are using run costume index
09:11 - this is kind of how I show how the
09:14 - running animation for the photo sprites
09:16 - since they have multiple costume we are
09:18 - going to use the index so if you can see
09:21 - here go back to this sprite you can see
09:26 - here you see jump zero zero three zero
09:28 - zero four so we've kind of run through
09:30 - that either run or jump or whatever
09:32 - right so that's why that's four and then
09:35 - we'll make another variable called Chun
09:39 - costume index this is like the the loop
09:43 - for the index for loop then we can use
09:46 - something like and we can specify it
09:48 - like a speed the jump speed for it as a
09:52 - variable so we can change it later of
09:53 - you when you're moving the game you
09:56 - don't have to like change the code at
09:58 - all for that and you can say run the
10:01 - speed so we're gonna make something so
10:05 - very very simple here so we have a
10:07 - couple of variable the fall speed
10:09 - basically keep track of the sprite
10:11 - falling down with gravity you have the
10:13 - running costume with the jumping costume
10:17 - right okay all right so that's all we
10:22 - have for right now and then we can
10:25 - decorate this costume thing later so
10:28 - let's kind of take out this I mean I can
10:31 - put it here for now maybe you guys yeah
10:33 - we can see this custom house change
10:35 - right okay so we we have and we can add
10:39 - the gym and other stuff so you know
10:43 - want to add the sign you can call the
10:45 - object you can get the sign out right
10:47 - and you can put the sign somewhere here
10:50 - and if you like all right wherever you
10:51 - want to put it and you can change the
10:54 - size maybe 75 right here this is the
10:58 - sign okay all right we have the sign and
11:01 - let's upload the magic Kim
11:03 - so I uploaded form I have a lot of game
11:06 - before and then we can upload some
11:08 - cactus let's take this one
11:10 - okay and let's get another one let's
11:15 - take a tree and we'll take one more at
11:20 - the bush we want the one too much stuff
11:23 - on here but just a couple and then we
11:27 - take one the magic gym that we had I
11:30 - created already from the other game okay
11:33 - so we have kind of order called things
11:36 - that we need it and you can adjust it
11:39 - any way you want
11:40 - make the tree I say smaller all right
11:42 - you can put in 75% you can make the tree
11:45 - smaller the cactus you can put it
11:49 - anywhere you want let's say you want to
11:50 - put the cactus up here or here or
11:53 - whatever you can do that let's put the
11:56 - cactus down here maybe maybe you're like
11:59 - great I don't know right here that looks
12:02 - like he's not blocking right let's put
12:04 - him up here okay so you can make this
12:07 - cactus 75 or 50 or whatever you like and
12:14 - and then this little tree you can put
12:17 - them on top if you like okay so the tree
12:22 - will quote me 50 oh okay maybe 75 will
12:27 - put the tree 75 in 50 a little small
12:30 - okay okay
12:35 - all right try to get it aligned
12:38 - perfectly but I think it's a little bit
12:41 - tough but I think it's good enough okay
12:43 - so we have that we have the gym so what
12:46 - we're going to do is we're gonna make
12:47 - this a little smaller maybe 25% so he is
12:53 - about 25%
12:54 - we're gonna start him somewhere let's
12:56 - say like right here doesn't matter and
12:57 - then we can code it so that's why when
13:00 - he dropped down we kind of stopped him
13:02 - over here
13:02 - okay wait without though it's a South
13:05 - Bush there's our cactus this is our tree
13:08 - and this our scientist our magic Jim and
13:11 - this is our sprite so we have everything
13:13 - okay all right we have all the variable
13:16 - we have the platform now let's work on
13:18 - the treasure hunter so we'll call this
13:20 - guy treasure hunter okay so we have the
13:27 - nice filtration wrong okay so with a
13:33 - treasure hunter so what we want to do is
13:35 - we can define some custom block here so
13:38 - that every time is start in a way we we
13:42 - can call this block I just call it start
13:45 - again but like if you're making a more
13:47 - than one level right you can call this
13:49 - function start again and then we set
13:51 - everything so what we want to do the
13:53 - first thing we want to do it in case the
13:56 - characters hop we want to show so zoom
14:00 - in a little bit
14:02 - say show and then we will switch to the
14:06 - first costume which is the idle right I
14:09 - don't custom by standing and we can say
14:12 - okay go to this position here so ever
14:15 - position we just move this guy here so
14:17 - go with this position here and make sure
14:21 - that we also have to make sure that you
14:23 - have selected list so that he doesn't
14:24 - rotate upside down and you can say at
14:28 - the beginning we want to make him point
14:30 - to ninety basically pointing to the
14:33 - right and also we want to make this guy
14:36 - go to the front layer so that he will
14:40 - not get blocked by either the tree or
14:42 - the cactus or something like that right
14:44 - okay and we will try to initialize some
14:48 - variable in the beginning so let's
14:50 - initialize some variable I will say the
14:53 - run speed so run speed will be 10 T for
14:58 - 10 and then will can't replicate this we
15:02 - can say jum speed let's say 15 like you
15:07 - can put any speed you want and we can we
15:10 - are going to put the for speed this is
15:13 - like when he's dropping down or football
15:15 - speed zero in the beginning okay and
15:19 - then we can set the custom index to zero
15:22 - also in the beginning so that we set it
15:25 - so that run custom index is zero
15:29 - duplicate that we can put in the jump
15:32 - custom index also zero okay all right
15:36 - that's how much we have for now okay so
15:42 - this is our custom block for these start
15:44 - and now let's walk on this next one is
15:47 - these simulating gravity so this is kind
15:50 - of making the the sprite fall keep
15:53 - falling down and making it either when
15:59 - it's falling down I kind of keep him up
16:01 - in the in the in the platform so we will
16:04 - meet that and what we can do is we are
16:07 - going to change first thing we do is
16:10 - that we're gonna change Y basically
16:12 - changing this position of this uh this
16:15 - uh yeah check your hunter by the fall
16:18 - speed so we will actually go into a yeah
16:22 - change the fall speed later but the
16:24 - another loop but uh basically every time
16:27 - this run or change the force bit making
16:29 - it go down okay and then we will say I
16:32 - will put an if condition here so we'll
16:35 - say if okay if the touching the platform
16:41 - so we need an end condition so we want
16:44 - to use a in the way that it can check
16:46 - both the its touching a platform and
16:49 - color because we don't want the other
16:51 - color array or any other thing else that
16:53 - could be on the platform
16:54 - so we'll say if touching oops
17:01 - I think I should do that over here let's
17:03 - jump
17:04 - first if touching the platform and or
17:09 - say touching color so what I'm going to
17:13 - do is I can click on this little dropper
17:15 - here kind of go in here so we're gonna
17:18 - drop this this one this color here okay
17:22 - so it was touching the platform and it's
17:25 - this color okay we are going to do okay
17:34 - so we'll check the fall speed so we'll
17:38 - say we'll use what the uses if an else
17:41 - statement here so this is a little bit
17:43 - different than the ninja platformer I
17:45 - initially did I think this works a
17:47 - little bit better so if you're working
17:50 - on the ninja platform later on after you
17:52 - watch this video you can try to change
17:54 - that to match this okay so we can say
17:59 - put this check here we'll say fall speed
18:03 - you have the fall speed it's greater
18:06 - than zero
18:08 - okay and what we did is we need another
18:13 - loop put a repeat until in here I'll
18:18 - explain what it all means something let
18:20 - me just call this first okay this and
18:26 - say here change Y by minus one so what
18:34 - is this doing is if the fall speed so
18:37 - basically the jump up right we're gonna
18:39 - set the fall speed to there to the jump
18:43 - it to the fall speed so it was a
18:44 - positive number of the fall speed and
18:47 - he's not touching this color we want to
18:51 - make sure that he's going down so and
18:53 - we'll jump up we wanna make sure bring
18:55 - him back down okay that's what this
18:56 - shows mean and we need another one here
19:01 - and this one we are going to put a
19:04 - positive so what happened is if the fall
19:06 - speed is negative basically he's falling
19:08 - down right now he's falling down point
19:12 - up on down become
19:13 - it was not touching this will put a plus
19:16 - one so make sure that he stand back up
19:18 - on here so make sure that when he's uh
19:20 - when he's jumping he either on the top
19:22 - of the platform or below the platform
19:24 - okay that's what this what is called us
19:26 - okay and then at the end we want to set
19:29 - the ball speed back to zero no sigh here
19:33 - okay okay so every time let me add some
19:38 - code and we can actually test this out
19:40 - so okay so we have already defined this
19:46 - to custom block what we're going to do
19:49 - is we're gonna use this custom block
19:51 - when the stop green flag is clicked so
19:53 - what we can do is go back over here in
19:55 - this event we say when the green flag is
20:00 - clicked we are going to call this start
20:03 - again basically that resets everything
20:05 - and we need to have a forever loop here
20:08 - to make this sprite going down and we
20:11 - have to go back to the variable we say
20:14 - change fall speed by minus one basically
20:17 - making this sprite keep on going down
20:19 - okay and then we need another control us
20:25 - the spring trackers click here and we
20:29 - need to have another forever loop here
20:31 - so this will keep on checking the
20:34 - gravity make sure the user the player
20:37 - stay on top or the bottom of the year of
20:40 - that platform okay so if I run this you
20:43 - can see how they player react so you can
20:46 - see the player can't drop down all right
20:48 - let me move him a little bit higher
20:50 - let's say let's say I move this player
20:52 - let me stop this let me move him like
20:54 - maybe here let's see like this right you
20:58 - can kind of see let me just throw this
21:00 - in here throw it here just for testing
21:03 - purposes we have not made the ninja run
21:06 - and jump yet so as you can see you kind
21:09 - of fall down and it stops it stops right
21:13 - so it stops right there because of this
21:15 - KO here this one is touching the
21:17 - platform either going up or down we want
21:22 - to make sure that he is
21:23 - staying on top of the platform so that's
21:25 - what how and then after that after it
21:27 - written through this and when we're
21:31 - touching the platform and then we'll set
21:33 - the false bit to zero then they will not
21:35 - fall anymore right so that's how it is
21:37 - so you can see this fall speed here so
21:39 - let me run this again just pay attention
21:41 - to this number here on top you see it
21:44 - says you know apart from the power from
21:46 - that fall speed right keep on going
21:48 - negative in here and it gets here it's
21:50 - changing back to zero so you know they
21:52 - didn't just not only fall down anymore
21:54 - further so let's stop here for now we'll
21:57 - continue the blacks next lesson to make
21:59 - the ninja kind of running and jumping
22:01 - and sliding and then maybe one more
22:04 - lesson with the collecting the gym and
22:06 - all that ok we'll stop here for now
22:08 - thanks for watching please subscribe
22:10 - like share our video thank you very much
22:13 - bye bye
