00:19 - hello welcome back guys to kids cooling
00:21 - playground so today we'll be working on
00:24 - the
00:24 - new ninja platformer i think i did that
00:27 - a while back maybe two years back so it
00:30 - wasn't really good
00:32 - they were having some bugs and stuff
00:34 - like that uh with the uh platform
00:36 - detection so
00:38 - we made a new one that is a lot better
00:41 - so
00:42 - so that's why i'm re recording the video
00:44 - to show you guys how to do that uh so if
00:46 - you want to uh start the project you can
00:49 - take look at this one called ninja
00:51 - platformer for class no code so this one
00:54 - has all the uh basic
00:58 - platform and stuff like that already
01:00 - there so you can go inside
01:03 - uh if you go inside you'll see like the
01:05 - uh the main character which is a black
01:08 - icon
01:09 - uh the
01:10 - ninja this is the main the boy ninja and
01:13 - then this is the girl ninja and then the
01:15 - ground so what let me explain a little
01:17 - bit so the black uh background i have uh
01:21 - both there's a taller one and there's a
01:23 - shorter one so the shorter one this is
01:25 - like a hitbox so we use that for the uh
01:28 - slide
01:29 - so um if you look at this right so let's
01:32 - say if i take this guy
01:33 - i take this i copy and i go to here
01:37 - and let me zoom out a little bit so if i
01:39 - paste it here you can see the hitbox and
01:41 - the ninja is about the same size right
01:43 - okay
01:44 - so similarly the uh the shorter one so
01:47 - i'm gonna take the short ninja uh the
01:49 - slide one so i'll go to the small one so
01:51 - you can see he's about the same size for
01:54 - the hitbox okay so that's why we can use
01:57 - like a ninja to slide under the spikes
02:00 - and stuff like that
02:01 - okay so hope you guys understand that
02:03 - part and then the next thing let's talk
02:05 - about the ground so basically the ground
02:08 - is like a design whatever you want to do
02:11 - so the design is the you can use it uh
02:14 - however you want and then the virtual
02:16 - ground is where we're gonna make the
02:18 - detection
02:19 - so so that way you know the ninja can
02:21 - jump on certain thing and not jump on
02:24 - other things so whatever you want to
02:25 - jump on to be able to jump on you have
02:27 - to put it in the virtual ground
02:29 - whatever decoration and stuff like that
02:31 - you don't want them to jump on then it
02:33 - can be in the
02:34 - ground sprite so for example let me take
02:37 - this
02:38 - so i take everything here
02:40 - so what you do is you let's say if you
02:41 - want to
02:43 - if you want to make a new one right so
02:44 - you can see if i post it here right you
02:46 - can see that
02:48 - my if i make everything go back layer
02:50 - you can see that the virtual ground is
02:52 - just the ground on top that way we can
02:55 - have the uh detection for the platform
02:57 - other than that everything
02:59 - you know you can jump on these so the
03:02 - spy cactus the break it you know
03:05 - the
03:06 - the
03:07 - the signs and all those are not a uh not
03:10 - something that the ninja can step on
03:12 - only the purple one this purple thing is
03:14 - where you can step up so let me go back
03:16 - you see that so so basically what you do
03:19 - is you can design your ground first
03:21 - after you design your ground however you
03:23 - want
03:24 - you take a copy copy everything
03:27 - and then in the virtual ground you
03:29 - create a new sprite
03:31 - and then you paste the uh
03:32 - the the thing that just copy on the
03:35 - ground and then you just make the make
03:37 - it look like you know however it is
03:39 - right
03:40 - so
03:41 - so let's say you see this is number
03:42 - three right so if you look at number
03:44 - three
03:45 - number three see this ground so what i
03:47 - did was i copied this and then i paste
03:50 - it here
03:51 - and then just adjust the uh the box so
03:54 - you can see right
03:56 - so if i take this
03:57 - do another copy
03:59 - go back over here you can see that see
04:02 - the the virtual ground and the uh
04:05 - and the ground is uh the same so you can
04:08 - see i have the
04:09 - the uh my
04:11 - purple box here that's where the ninja
04:13 - can stand on purple box here and purple
04:15 - boxes that's what the new skin stand on
04:17 - and then the tree stuff you can go
04:19 - behind all right
04:21 - so hopefully you guys understand that
04:24 - okay
04:26 - all right so that's about it so you can
04:29 - get this project and get this started so
04:32 - and then you have some more props here i
04:34 - added some props that you want to design
04:36 - your thing to be a little bit different
04:37 - you can add that and some objects here
04:40 - so you can use that for your game if you
04:42 - want to design different ground okay
04:45 - all right so i think let's get started
04:48 - all right so what you do is you can like
04:50 - make your copy of this project or you
04:52 - can remix it okay so for me i can say
04:55 - save as a copy
04:57 - okay so i'm gonna say
04:59 - i'm gonna change it to
05:03 - okay so it's gonna use this to teach you
05:05 - guys
05:07 - okay so let's go to our main character
05:10 - which is the black uh bar okay so uh the
05:14 - ninja girl gonna hide it i'm not using
05:16 - ninja go at the moment so we're gonna
05:18 - work on the main character so the main
05:20 - character basically is the uh the hitbox
05:22 - where we can do the control so let me go
05:25 - back to
05:26 - stage one go to the virtual ground stage
05:29 - one for now
05:30 - okay
05:31 - all right let's hide the medusa for now
05:33 - we don't need her okay
05:36 - okay
05:36 - and then this one let's select the
05:39 - standing up ninja for now okay all right
05:42 - so we'll work on on the black uh black
05:45 - black box all right
05:47 - all right so let's create some variable
05:50 - so here we'll create some variables so
05:52 - let's make a variable
05:54 - for offspring
05:57 - we'll call it level so this is like the
05:59 - show the level what level you're on okay
06:04 - and then let's make some uh more
06:06 - variable so uh right now i'm going to
06:08 - create all the variable in one go for
06:10 - this black uh icon
06:12 - character here okay so i can make uh
06:16 - for all the global variables basically
06:18 - all the variable can be seen by other
06:21 - sprite we're going to put g in the front
06:23 - okay so i'm going to say g
06:26 - gravity
06:28 - okay
06:29 - okay next
06:32 - i'm going to say g
06:34 - is
06:35 - player dead
06:37 - so this keep track the players dead or
06:39 - not
06:41 - make more variable so g
06:44 - um
06:46 - and then this is the mouse position what
06:47 - you can do is um
06:49 - you can use the uh
06:51 - use the mouse position to see where you
06:54 - want to put items so we can put that so
06:56 - let's have that
06:58 - and then next
07:00 - we'll go gee and let's go on ground
07:09 - okay
07:11 - all right let's continue
07:13 - go g
07:15 - speed
07:17 - takes
07:20 - another one g global variable underscore
07:25 - velocity
07:30 - okay
07:32 - okay so we have couple more variables uh
07:34 - this is the depth
07:38 - let's kind of keep track of how much
07:39 - that the ninja have
07:42 - uh so and then next one we'll
07:44 - do it for this sprite only
07:46 - and uh this is a deviation this is a
07:49 - basically a change in y
07:51 - all right so click that
07:53 - and then we'll make one more
07:55 - for the sprite only we'll call jumping
07:59 - so you can see all the one that with the
08:01 - global wearable doesn't have the main
08:03 - character and this one has a main
08:04 - character i use a long case okay
08:07 - all right so let's take out these things
08:09 - we don't really need them to show up
08:12 - on the screen
08:14 - okay except maybe level and death okay
08:17 - all right so we have
08:19 - our
08:21 - our basic uh variable so now let's try
08:24 - to work on it okay let's go back to the
08:26 - main character
08:27 - okay
08:28 - so
08:29 - when green flag is clicked
08:33 - okay
08:34 - i'm gonna set the size
08:38 - to 35
08:41 - and then we're gonna set the level
08:45 - to one so here we're gonna grab the
08:48 - variable
08:50 - so set
08:52 - level to one
08:54 - so that's our first level
08:56 - and we're going to make a
08:58 - custom block
08:59 - called reset
09:02 - um
09:03 - this one doesn't matter you can run well
09:04 - refresh or whatever it doesn't really
09:06 - matter this is just refreshing uh this
09:08 - is just resetting the variable
09:10 - but others other things like platform
09:12 - detection we do need it so this one we
09:15 - are going to say
09:17 - go to
09:19 - negative
09:20 - 200. and
09:22 - zero so that will go to somewhere like
09:25 - right here and then we'll make it drop
09:26 - down later okay all right so
09:30 - all right then now let's set our
09:31 - variable
09:32 - okay
09:34 - set
09:36 - let's play it dead
09:38 - i'm going to say false
09:40 - you can use true or false or yes and no
09:42 - doesn't matter
09:44 - okay next we're going to say
09:46 - set the gravity
09:48 - velocity i'm gonna put it zero
09:53 - and then we're gonna say um on ground
09:56 - we're gonna put that at zero
10:00 - and then we're gonna say uh gravity
10:06 - we're gonna put minus one
10:08 - okay
10:09 - and then we have one more
10:11 - jumping
10:13 - we're gonna go zero
10:14 - all right so this is like uh when the
10:17 - game will be set or when the player dies
10:18 - we're gonna try to recreate you know put
10:21 - the same location put the player back to
10:23 - the left and then reset this variable
10:27 - so now we're going to call this function
10:28 - reset
10:29 - okay and then we're gonna broadcast a
10:31 - couple of message
10:34 - i'll broadcast the first one i'm gonna
10:36 - call it start game
10:40 - all right broadcast a new one
10:44 - new message we're going to call it start
10:47 - new level
10:51 - okay so we have these two methods
10:54 - so for start game uh what we're going to
10:56 - do is let's scroll down over here a
10:58 - little bit
11:01 - so when i say start game
11:04 - um what i'm going to do is going to
11:06 - change the ghost effect
11:08 - for right now let's uh let's leave it
11:11 - but later we do need to set the ghost
11:13 - effect so that you don't see the uh
11:15 - the character
11:16 - right so so you want to only see the
11:19 - ninja but for now let's keep it right
11:21 - here
11:22 - okay we're gonna put the ghost effect in
11:23 - first and then we'll
11:25 - we'll do it we'll do it
11:26 - later okay set goes effect right now we
11:29 - keep it at zero so uh when the actual
11:32 - when we actually got it working we'll
11:33 - make it as 100 okay
11:35 - so for now we're gonna keep it at zero
11:38 - show
11:40 - okay
11:40 - and then we're gonna use a repeat until
11:45 - here we'll repeat until and then we'll
11:47 - use the
11:48 - equal operator
11:51 - uh take it take this player dead
11:55 - so the player that you go to true when
11:58 - the player die
11:59 - then repeat until that so when the
12:02 - player dies we're gonna restart
12:04 - everything but if his player is not dead
12:06 - yet so we're gonna broadcast whatever is
12:08 - inside so i'll broadcast
12:12 - a couple of things so we're gonna
12:13 - broadcast
12:15 - new message
12:17 - start all control
12:19 - [Music]
12:21 - message
12:28 - check
12:30 - platform
12:33 - detection
12:36 - okay
12:38 - broadcast a new message
12:41 - called
12:44 - check
12:46 - player
12:47 - position
12:48 - okay all right so we broadcast few of
12:51 - these
12:53 - okay so let's go to the my block
12:56 - make a new block
12:57 - called movement
13:00 - control
13:02 - make sure you select this run without
13:04 - refresh click ok
13:06 - so let's do our custom block all the way
13:09 - on top here so we have everything
13:11 - together
13:12 - we're going to do the
13:14 - if and else
13:16 - here
13:17 - okay so for the if and nails
13:21 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
13:22 - going to grab something here we're going
13:24 - to grab it in
13:26 - and then we're going to grab our oil and
13:27 - put it on the first block
13:29 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
13:31 - going to make the um
13:32 - key let's go to get
13:35 - one key press so what we're going to do
13:38 - is uh left left and right arrow keys so
13:41 - left arrow
13:44 - right arrow
13:44 - [Music]
13:46 - and then we'll make one more
13:48 - down arrow
13:50 - sorry down arrow
13:53 - so what we're going to do is we're going
13:55 - to make it go inside this if if it's a
13:57 - left arrow
13:58 - or a right arrow
14:02 - and oops
14:04 - grab it
14:06 - and let me zoom back out
14:10 - this one down arrow put this here okay
14:13 - so let's zoom out again so
14:17 - if it's left arrow or right arrow and
14:19 - down arrow we're gonna go in here we're
14:21 - gonna try to use the uh
14:25 - we're gonna use the custom number two
14:27 - which is the uh the shorter one
14:30 - otherwise we'll use the custom number
14:32 - one which is the taller black
14:34 - black icon right here okay
14:38 - okay
14:39 - and then we have
14:41 - another if and else
14:45 - control
14:46 - so put another if and else here
14:49 - and then inside here we put another if
14:51 - and else okay
14:53 - all right so now let's duplicate this
14:56 - it is right arrow
14:59 - we're going to set the uh
15:02 - the g speed x
15:05 - to 10
15:08 - okay and then we'll duplicate this
15:12 - and then duplicate that
15:15 - and then we'll put this as negative 10
15:19 - okay
15:20 - and then we'll
15:21 - okay one more we'll set this to zero
15:25 - okay
15:27 - all right so let's make the new block
15:31 - run without refresh
15:32 - uh this one the uh
15:34 - the name we're gonna say move
15:37 - hitbox
15:39 - okay
15:41 - and then we'll add a variable called
15:43 - speed x
15:45 - okay
15:46 - okay
15:48 - so here what we're going to do is
15:52 - we're gonna say change
15:56 - change this change x by
16:00 - speed x
16:02 - and then we're gonna set the
16:04 - variable called deviation which is the
16:07 - change of y
16:10 - we'll set it to zero
16:11 - let me zoom in a little bit more
16:17 - all right so next we're gonna say uh
16:22 - repeat until
16:24 - and then we're going to use the o
16:26 - operator
16:28 - then we're going to use the equal
16:31 - put in the deviation check here
16:34 - put in five so basically just like it's
16:37 - a change of why they're checking if it's
16:40 - equal to five or
16:42 - if it's touching
16:46 - the
16:47 - virtual ground
16:48 - which is this box here the the purple
16:50 - one okay
16:52 - uh not touching sorry
16:54 - not
16:57 - not touching okay
16:59 - so it was deviation equal to five or not
17:02 - touching the virtual ground
17:05 - we're gonna say
17:07 - change y
17:08 - by one
17:11 - and then change the
17:15 - change deviation by one
17:19 - and then we're gonna have an if
17:20 - condition here
17:23 - put it in the bottom
17:26 - if the deviation is equal to five
17:29 - we're gonna say
17:32 - change
17:34 - x by
17:36 - i'm going to use the up minus sign here
17:40 - put 0
17:41 - and then the speed x grab it from the
17:45 - and then
17:46 - you have to change y
17:52 - and you're going to get the operator
17:55 - again
17:57 - the subtract
17:58 - sign put
18:01 - zero
18:02 - and
18:03 - deviation here
18:05 - okay so this kind of move the hitbox and
18:08 - then uh
18:10 - making it
18:11 - go down
18:12 - within uh within certain
18:15 - points until it touches the virtual
18:18 - ground
18:20 - all right so what we're going to do is
18:21 - we're going to call the function so let
18:22 - me zoom back out a little bit
18:26 - so here where we have all these uh
18:28 - functions that we are calling right so
18:30 - um
18:31 - let's say
18:34 - when
18:36 - start all control
18:38 - we are going to call the movement
18:40 - control
18:42 - okay
18:44 - and then um
18:46 - event
18:48 - when i receive uh
18:50 - check platform detection
18:53 - um
18:54 - we have to call this moving um hitbox
19:02 - and then the g speed x
19:05 - i think i'm not sure it's gonna work
19:06 - exactly yet because i'm not completing
19:09 - all the code let me just test it out
19:12 - so let's try it out so what we had so
19:15 - far is kind of moving the box so it's
19:17 - not really detecting the platform so we
19:20 - do need to detect the platform
19:22 - so let's just try to finish this real
19:24 - quick it might be over 25 minutes but uh
19:26 - it will be a good stopping point after
19:28 - that
19:30 - okay
19:31 - all right so let's continue let's go
19:34 - back to my block
19:35 - create a new one
19:37 - we're going to call it check
19:39 - hit
19:40 - ground
19:41 - and we're going to use this on the
19:42 - boolean click the one in the middle is
19:45 - jumping
19:46 - okay
19:48 - make sure you have check without
19:49 - run while refresh okay so this is for
19:52 - the check move uh check the ground for
19:56 - the uh
19:58 - for the uh character jumping so let's go
20:02 - so we're gonna say repeat until
20:09 - repeat until
20:11 - okay let's zoom back in
20:14 - okay repeat until
20:16 - here inside here
20:19 - okay so now let's put in the operator
20:23 - knot
20:25 - and then we're gonna go to here i'm
20:27 - gonna grab that and say not touching the
20:29 - virtual ground
20:31 - and then we're gonna use some control
20:33 - here so if and else put this inside
20:37 - okay so we continue here so grab this
20:39 - one put this here
20:42 - uh go here say change y
20:46 - i minus one okay
20:49 - and then we're gonna say set
20:52 - uh the velocity
20:55 - to zero
20:57 - okay copy that
20:59 - and then this is plus one pushing the
21:01 - character back up
21:04 - and then we're gonna set the underground
21:07 - to one
21:10 - okay
21:11 - and then scroll down a little bit we'll
21:14 - get another if condition here
21:17 - put inside here
21:19 - we're going to use the operator equal
21:21 - sign
21:24 - using the jump
21:27 - if jumping equals to 1
21:31 - and then we're going to set it back to
21:36 - zero
21:37 - okay all right so this
21:40 - so this is to help to uh check if the
21:43 - player is touching the ground or not
21:46 - okay so that part is done
21:49 - okay so let's go to my block again so
21:51 - make a new block
21:53 - so make sure you have this on
21:56 - so the block this time we're gonna call
21:58 - jump control
22:01 - okay so
22:02 - after that
22:04 - we're almost done
22:06 - so use the if condition here
22:10 - and then
22:10 - check put another if condition inside
22:15 - so here let's go uh sensing
22:19 - uh key presses up arrow key
22:23 - okay
22:24 - and then we're going to use the n
22:26 - operator here
22:29 - use a greater than
22:32 - and then use the equal
22:35 - okay
22:36 - um
22:38 - you can use an equal also but i think i
22:40 - had earlier greater than
22:42 - uh for the on ground i think it's only
22:45 - once in zero it could be one equal to
22:47 - one is working as well so that's fine
22:50 - so
22:51 - we can put that here
22:53 - okay and then jumping we'll hit it zero
22:57 - so basically
22:59 - if it's on the ground and jumping is not
23:02 - jumping then we're gonna allow to jump
23:04 - so
23:04 - i'm gonna set
23:08 - so set the on ground
23:10 - to zero
23:12 - uh that means it's uh no longer on the
23:14 - ground when it's jumping up
23:16 - i'm gonna set the jumping to one
23:19 - i mean he's jumping
23:21 - and then we're going to set the
23:23 - g velocity to 15 that's how high you can
23:27 - jump
23:29 - okay
23:30 - all right so then we have the jump
23:31 - control
23:34 - okay all right so let's go back to uh
23:37 - our code here
23:39 - where we have all the broadcast messages
23:44 - so on here
23:47 - okay so we're gonna finish it up right
23:49 - now
23:51 - over here
23:52 - okay so we're going to call
23:56 - this one we'll put this on top of that
23:59 - and then we're going to use the operator
24:02 - copper zero here and then we're gonna
24:05 - check the g velocity
24:09 - okay so this will if it's greater than
24:12 - zero the g velocity then it will call
24:14 - this guy
24:16 - uh
24:20 - so we'll call this uh uh this function
24:23 - saying if it's jumping then it will do
24:25 - this logic here okay all right so we're
24:27 - done with that part so next we're gonna
24:30 - call the jump control here
24:34 - and then we're going to draw the if and
24:36 - else condition i think we're almost done
24:40 - and then we're going to use the sensing
24:43 - if it's the arrow here
24:47 - okay we're gonna change
24:52 - change the g velocity
24:55 - by the gravity
24:59 - okay the gravity is negative one
25:01 - okay
25:02 - and then otherwise
25:04 - we're gonna make it a little bit faster
25:06 - so we're gonna say
25:08 - you can't put negative two or something
25:09 - like that i think i haven't multiplied
25:11 - before so we're gonna continue use that
25:14 - multiply by two
25:17 - and then we're gonna have another one
25:19 - here say uh change
25:21 - change y
25:24 - change y by the g gravity
25:28 - i mean g velocity
25:30 - okay
25:31 - all right so i think should be good
25:33 - let's check it out
25:37 - okay so let's check it out so let's save
25:39 - it
25:40 - let's run it okay so we can move the
25:44 - black box you can see i can jump on the
25:46 - black box
25:48 - okay
25:50 - so you see i can slide so when i slide
25:52 - you see the black box change the smaller
25:54 - black box so seems like everything is
25:57 - fine
25:58 - so the next uh maybe uh the next uh
26:01 - video what we can do is we're gonna put
26:04 - the uh ninja overlaying on this black
26:06 - box and then we're gonna hide this black
26:09 - box make it the ghost effect 100 so
26:11 - you'll not see the black box you only
26:13 - see the ninja will make the ninja follow
26:15 - the uh
26:16 - the black box
26:17 - okay so that's the end of the video i
26:20 - hope you guys like the tutorial give us
26:22 - a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video so
26:24 - we'll probably cut uh continue with this
26:28 - with a couple more tutorials to finish
26:30 - out this game okay
26:32 - all right thank you guys
26:37 - [Music]
26:44 - you
