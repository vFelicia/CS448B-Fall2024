00:03 - [Music]
00:09 - hello and welcome back to kids calling
00:11 - playground
00:12 - i haven't made a video for a while i
00:15 - thought of making this a video for
00:17 - our special 1k subscriber
00:20 - we're going to work on this halloween
00:22 - memory game
00:24 - so basically the player will click on
00:27 - the
00:27 - orange box here it will reveal the card
00:31 - underneath
00:32 - and if you have a match then uh then you
00:34 - will get that
00:36 - uh match if you don't have a mesh then
00:38 - the card will cover up the uh
00:40 - thus again will cover up the sprite
00:43 - again
00:43 - so basically kind of like flipping the
00:45 - card over like a memory game i
00:47 - uh we used to play right i think
00:50 - everyone remember when that kid they
00:51 - have played this kind of game before
00:53 - so um so let me show you next
00:57 - okay so we're going to be learning this
00:59 - um
01:00 - we're learning a variable we'll be
01:02 - having a list
01:03 - we'll have a couple of lists on there so
01:06 - if you don't know about lists i would
01:09 - suggest you maybe
01:10 - watch this video here or this video here
01:14 - about lists
01:15 - before you go into this memory game
01:18 - because it will actually require you to
01:20 - have a good understanding of list
01:21 - and variable and we'll be working on
01:24 - custom block
01:25 - a lot of broadcasting messages uh loops
01:29 - and then a sprite interaction between
01:31 - the you know the sprite
01:33 - and the uh you know the orange box
01:35 - that's covering the sprite so
01:37 - there's a lot of sprite interaction
01:39 - between them so
01:40 - without further ado let me show you the
01:43 - game
01:44 - okay okay so this is the game itself
01:48 - so i'm gonna go on the full screen here
01:51 - so i'm gonna start the game and what
01:53 - happened is the cat
01:54 - once i saw the game the cat will give
01:56 - some instruction and all the cat
01:58 - all the other sprite behind here will
02:00 - change and then you can click on it each
02:03 - one of them to open it
02:04 - okay all right so we have some music in
02:07 - the background
02:08 - and you can click on it let's say okay
02:11 - this is a lollipop
02:13 - uh this is not matched so as you can see
02:16 - that was not matching it
02:17 - i mean you can make it longer slower so
02:20 - see i got a match
02:21 - so these will stay on so we'll try to
02:24 - get the other one
02:25 - so let's see so lollipop oh okay this
02:28 - one
02:29 - this one okay so this one
02:32 - i don't know nope not that one this one
02:34 - is
02:43 - okay here it is there we go
02:46 - okay so you get all of it
02:49 - so that's it so that's the end of it
02:53 - so as you can see um after you get all
02:55 - of it then just say good job you win
02:57 - and uh you can like and maybe like do
03:00 - something like hide all this bright and
03:02 - then show the background of this image
03:04 - so on all these price uh uh from
03:07 - the free page design by freepix
03:10 - so um these bright i got it from premium
03:13 - packs so it costs some money
03:15 - not sure i can share them but you guys
03:18 - can also
03:19 - download it here in like in halloween
03:22 - uh if you go to like i'll have the link
03:24 - below like a
03:26 - flatikon.com and then you can look for
03:29 - halloween costumes
03:30 - a lot of these price here you can click
03:32 - on this download pack
03:34 - after you log in with your google
03:36 - account or something like that
03:37 - it'll provide you like 50 different
03:39 - costumes here that you could use for the
03:42 - game so after you download it you can
03:45 - unzip
03:46 - it so it will have like all these kind
03:48 - of custom here as you can see
03:50 - different custom can just unzip it and
03:51 - put it in your folder
03:53 - and then you can load them up uh when
03:55 - you when you work on the game
03:57 - so let me go to the game itself
04:02 - okay so i created a new project um
04:06 - i will just create all the variable and
04:09 - uh
04:09 - and lists together in one in this first
04:12 - tutorial
04:13 - so that we don't have to go back and
04:14 - forth and find what variable and what
04:16 - list is needed
04:18 - so let's click on this you can say make
04:20 - a variable here
04:22 - so i'm just going down the list i'm
04:25 - going to call this a break
04:28 - input index so this will use
04:31 - for breaking the uh the the matching
04:34 - number
04:35 - uh for the different sprite so we will
04:38 - need that
04:39 - so i'm just gonna make all this variable
04:41 - go ahead
04:42 - i'm calling make another variable called
04:45 - broadcast
04:46 - one okay and make another variable
04:50 - called broadcast
04:54 - two
04:56 - all the variable i'm making is for all
04:58 - sprite right now
04:59 - i don't think i have anything that's for
05:01 - this sprite only
05:03 - um we need something called current
05:06 - character so we're gonna have to check
05:07 - the character
05:09 - and and stuff like that to match
05:12 - so say current character then next one
05:16 - you want to create one called index so
05:18 - index is for loop where you can look
05:20 - through things and check things
05:22 - on index where the position is
05:25 - on your on your loop you have another
05:28 - one called
05:28 - is game
05:33 - started so this is a kind of like a
05:36 - brooklyn flag
05:37 - if the game is started or not you can
05:39 - put like
05:40 - osprey as well
05:44 - and then we need more
05:47 - calling match
05:50 - number so this was using to match the
05:53 - different number on the
05:55 - on the sprite when you're matching the
05:57 - uh
05:59 - the uh when you're matching between the
06:00 - two to uh sprite underneath the card
06:04 - so next is match
06:08 - sprite so this is the sprite's name
06:11 - we'll use that for later
06:15 - and player
06:19 - choice one okay so this is what the
06:23 - player choose for the first
06:25 - first choice and then player
06:29 - choice two so this is the second choice
06:32 - the player choose
06:34 - okay so we have all these uh
06:37 - variable now so uh if you
06:40 - if you have a if you don't see it then
06:43 - just pause it and just look through all
06:44 - this variable here
06:46 - okay so next we're gonna create a few
06:48 - lists as well i'll just do everything in
06:50 - this um
06:51 - here so that we will be able to use it
06:53 - later on
06:54 - so game match
06:58 - number list okay we are going to use
07:01 - this to store the
07:02 - matching number on the list for the
07:05 - sprite
07:07 - game sprite
07:11 - nameless so this is like when the game
07:13 - started those choose the sprite
07:16 - uh what are the names that's chosen for
07:18 - the sprite
07:19 - so we're gonna create that and save it
07:20 - here so we have a couple of lists that
07:22 - we need
07:23 - there's a number list for all the sprite
07:28 - and we need something called player
07:33 - selected
07:36 - match list so this is for
07:39 - keeping track of the player what is
07:41 - selected
07:43 - and last but not least we have this one
07:46 - a sprite nameless
07:47 - so this is keeping track of all the
07:49 - sprite
07:50 - in the uh game all right so
07:54 - again we have this uh list here so um
07:58 - just pause the video make sure you got
07:59 - all this list down
08:01 - here okay
08:05 - okay so i'm going to uh i have my sprite
08:08 - already in my backpack which i will be
08:10 - using
08:11 - but uh if you don't have it i'll show
08:13 - you how to do it in a second so i just
08:14 - load this in
08:16 - and then i'll load my first sprite which
08:18 - covers for the to cover
08:20 - and i'm gonna lower in my background as
08:22 - well so in the backdrop
08:24 - i will load this right here and then
08:28 - i'll delete this
08:29 - so i have the really nice
08:32 - halloween style backdrop okay just kind
08:36 - of make sure that
08:37 - the scr the backdrop is like a little
08:39 - bit bigger than this rectangle here so
08:41 - that will cover
08:41 - everything okay
08:45 - so as you can see i downloaded the uh
08:47 - the sprite
08:49 - file the file i have was like custom
08:54 - avatar that i download from this site
08:56 - and then i'll
08:57 - extract it over here so here's all the
09:00 - different sprite that we had right so we
09:02 - can use that to load into our game
09:05 - so what you need to do is uh you can go
09:08 - like this say
09:09 - uh paint a sprite
09:12 - so you go to this sprite
09:14 - [Music]
09:15 - so after that after you say paint the
09:17 - new sprite you go to here and you say
09:19 - upload costume from here you can go to
09:23 - your
09:24 - here so you're gonna
09:28 - select all of it in one go and you can
09:31 - say open
09:32 - so what it does it's gonna create all
09:35 - these costumes for you in
09:36 - one uh one sprite so that's what we want
09:40 - just so we have just like how i created
09:43 - here
09:44 - right for mine i have all the different
09:47 - sprite here as you can see the pumpkin
09:49 - bag
09:50 - the broom and everything right so i also
09:52 - have 50 sprite
09:54 - it doesn't matter how many you have but
09:55 - uh this one also gives you 50.
09:57 - so it doesn't matter so you can use this
09:59 - here i think this is for free
10:01 - the one i had is premium so it's not
10:04 - free
10:05 - i'll see if i can share the project at
10:06 - the end of the tutorial you can download
10:08 - that if you like
10:10 - uh so so you can upload it after you
10:12 - upload it just change the size to 40
10:15 - so you can have like a a set about the
10:18 - same size as this right
10:20 - or whatever that's able to cover so
10:22 - basically you want to have the
10:24 - the sprite that is like not too big not
10:26 - too small
10:27 - and it's able to be covered by this
10:29 - yellow box so this yellow box is very
10:31 - easy right
10:32 - you can just draw it with the uh with
10:35 - some color
10:36 - right we have 760 100
10:39 - and then the outline border just put
10:42 - five and just draw the
10:43 - square like this right so just paint
10:46 - this like a paint a little sprite
10:48 - just hold shift when you draw on the
10:50 - square kind of like this
10:52 - center it so that's how you get the
10:53 - square right so
10:55 - let me delete that we don't really need
10:57 - it so i already have it
10:58 - so what you need to do is just draw one
11:00 - square
11:02 - we're gonna have to duplicate all this
11:03 - later on so once you loaded all your
11:05 - sprite
11:07 - and your your square uh you draw your
11:09 - squares and we'll start the code so let
11:11 - me delete this
11:12 - i don't need this anymore
11:15 - since i'm using my own okay
11:19 - so now we're gonna go to the cat okay
11:24 - so for the cat we're going to add some
11:27 - code here
11:29 - so when green flag is clicked let me
11:31 - zoom in a little bit
11:35 - so what we need to do we are going to
11:37 - reset some variable
11:39 - so make sure that the game start every
11:41 - time we get things resetted
11:43 - so uh this is the first variable we'll
11:45 - reset so set
11:46 - game started so we'll say no so put n
11:51 - then we're gonna duplicate this
11:53 - duplicate it again
11:54 - we are going to set the player's choice
11:58 - 1 and play as choice 2
12:01 - and we are going to delete this okay so
12:04 - nothing there
12:05 - blank ok next we will
12:09 - get some here
12:12 - delete all from number list
12:17 - so we'll clear out the number list for
12:18 - now and we're going to add it back in
12:21 - later on so we'll make sure we clear
12:22 - every time
12:23 - and then we say delete all
12:27 - game matching number list so this is for
12:29 - the game to choose they can
12:32 - choose the number for the list so we
12:34 - delete that as well
12:36 - okay then what we need to do we are
12:38 - going to
12:39 - add
12:42 - so we are going to add to this number
12:44 - list so we are going to form
12:45 - 12 different boxes like one two three
12:48 - four
12:48 - five system in nitrogen 12 so we are
12:51 - going to add this
12:52 - number one so repeat this
12:55 - like 12 times kind of thing so we have
12:59 - four here
13:00 - so let me drag this down a little bit
13:02 - and duplicate this
13:04 - underneath and duplicate four more
13:07 - underneath here so just rename
13:10 - put it as one two three
13:14 - four five
13:17 - six seven 8 9
13:23 - 10 11
13:27 - and 12. okay so we have all the
13:32 - number added to the list so if you run
13:35 - the game now you will see
13:37 - that all the numbers added to the list
13:39 - you can show that
13:40 - in the variable right number list we can
13:44 - see that
13:45 - one two three four five six seven eight
13:46 - nine ten eleven so every time i run this
13:48 - will
13:49 - repopulate this list here okay
13:53 - okay the next thing we want to do we are
13:55 - going to have another start event again
13:58 - we're gonna we are going to clean up the
14:00 - other things here
14:04 - i mean you can put it all in one but it
14:05 - doesn't matter so this one doesn't
14:07 - depend on this so i just create another
14:09 - one
14:09 - so that way we can clean them up both at
14:11 - the starting of the green black
14:13 - okay so we will say delete all
14:16 - [Music]
14:18 - so now we are going to delete the
14:21 - sprite name list and
14:26 - delete the game sprite name
14:30 - list
14:34 - and then delete one more player selected
14:37 - match list
14:38 - okay so we're cleaning up all this list
14:40 - we'll use this list later to match
14:42 - things okay what we need to do is we're
14:44 - going to add something to the
14:46 - to the sprite name list so basically
14:48 - this brightness
14:49 - is contained all the um
14:53 - sprite uh that you have for the name so
14:56 - you have to look at the costume so this
14:57 - first one is the witch right
14:59 - so what you do i i'm going to add a few
15:02 - in here for now
15:03 - so what we have to go in and you have to
15:05 - have this like this
15:07 - so which then you're the duplicate you
15:10 - have to look into the next one
15:12 - and the next one is candy corn right so
15:15 - we'll take that copy that name
15:17 - and go back to here and we'll put candy
15:20 - corn and so on and so forth
15:22 - so you have to keep going like this i
15:24 - mean depending on how many costumes you
15:26 - want to use if you're using 50
15:28 - then obviously you have to do all 50 of
15:30 - them uh then you don't have a shortcut
15:32 - for this
15:33 - so duplicate this guy and you put in the
15:36 - i number three
15:38 - so basically you keep going and you can
15:40 - get all the sprite names so basically we
15:42 - will need this right name to match
15:44 - later so it's very important you get all
15:46 - of them
15:47 - and put it into your code here
15:52 - all right next we'll get
15:55 - more okay so
15:58 - i'm gonna i'm gonna speed this up okay
16:01 - since um
16:01 - don't want you to watch the whole video
16:04 - me putting in the
16:05 - name here so i'll speed this up so that
16:08 - we can get all them filled up
16:11 - okay so we have created all the uh
16:15 - all the 50 costume here all the name
16:19 - okay from 1 to 50 and what we're going
16:22 - to do next is
16:23 - broadcast is a game instruction okay
16:29 - okay we are going to change the cat a
16:32 - little bit i think
16:33 - 85 percent i think i kind of put them in
16:36 - here or something like that
16:39 - all right what we can do next is um
16:43 - if the cat is too big or too small you
16:45 - can change it later
16:46 - and we can probably move them around
16:48 - later if it's not in the right position
16:50 - um okay say
16:53 - when we start the game instruction what
16:56 - we want to do
16:59 - we can say look
17:03 - make this cat go to the front of
17:04 - everything so that it will not be
17:06 - covered by the car
17:07 - you know the sprite or the boxes right
17:11 - okay and then we are going to say
17:17 - so we are going to say this so
17:20 - this is a hollow matching game um
17:24 - click on the orange box to reveal the
17:25 - card underneath okay
17:28 - and duplicate again
17:32 - i have the text already typed up so then
17:35 - click on the another orange box to try
17:37 - to match the first card you just open
17:39 - so basically you select two card to open
17:42 - and then what we have to do is
17:48 - so with a new message say
17:51 - prepare okay
17:58 - okay now we are going to after we say
18:01 - prepare game we're going to go back up a
18:03 - little bit
18:04 - i'm going to call this part because our
18:06 - last space up here
18:07 - so this is our start right okay so we
18:11 - are going to do the
18:12 - event that we had broadcast below for
18:15 - prepared games so we are going to
18:18 - pick this up say prepare game
18:21 - [Music]
18:22 - we're going to use the loop here
18:27 - say repeat six times so uh what we want
18:29 - to do is we want to get
18:31 - six match right so we have 12 boxes
18:33 - that's why we repeat six times so
18:35 - because there's 12 boxes to match so
18:37 - there's only six pair right
18:39 - so that's why we repeat six then we are
18:42 - going to get
18:44 - this here uh what we're going to use is
18:47 - we're going to use the index to
18:50 - see what is the number we picked from
18:53 - the
18:53 - sprite nameless that way we can once we
18:57 - pick that
18:57 - uh let's once we pick let's say which we
19:01 - don't want the witch to show up again
19:03 - so what we're going to do is we'll
19:04 - remove from the nameless
19:06 - so here we will say operator
19:10 - pick random one two
19:14 - and you have to use this
19:17 - something called length of list so this
19:19 - one let's say
19:21 - we have a link of uh sprite nameless
19:23 - right we're using sprite nameless
19:25 - so i say this so if i run this right
19:28 - now if i run that because i didn't run
19:30 - it out last time i only have five so now
19:32 - if i run it we'll have 50 right
19:34 - so we have 50 items in here right you
19:36 - remember we added all 50
19:38 - so all the way to 50. so when you run
19:40 - this it will give you the list
19:42 - of the linked is 50. so we are going to
19:44 - pick
19:46 - one a random one to the
19:49 - list of 50. next we are going to say
19:53 - add the item
19:57 - [Music]
20:01 - and we are going to use this index
20:06 - that we just picked up
20:10 - so we are saying the sprite name this
20:14 - and we are going to add this to the game
20:17 - match
20:18 - uh sprite name game sprite
20:22 - nameless so this is going to add it to
20:25 - here so what we're going to do we're
20:26 - going to pick it up and we're going to
20:27 - add it so this
20:28 - is going to be our six different sprite
20:31 - that we're using for the game
20:33 - next what we want to do is we want to
20:35 - delete this
20:38 - index from this
20:41 - sprite name list so basically once we
20:44 - pick
20:44 - this sprite let's say we pick the witch
20:47 - like
20:48 - i said i don't want to pick the witch
20:49 - again so they don't have the same match
20:51 - so always there will be six pair they
20:53 - will never be like
20:55 - a five pair you know like you have four
20:57 - witch or something you don't want to do
20:58 - that right so that's why you want to
20:59 - remove that
21:00 - so remove that then we can we are going
21:03 - to repeat again
21:05 - sixth time so this time we
21:08 - are going to so this time we are going
21:11 - to pick up
21:11 - six uh pair of numbers
21:14 - uh basically from our list right here
21:17 - right we have 1 through 12 right
21:19 - we'll pick up six pair number randomly
21:22 - and then trying to match them
21:23 - okay so what you want to do is this
21:26 - we're going to reuse the index again
21:28 - so this time instead of the uh the
21:31 - sprite list will do number list so this
21:33 - number has 12 items so if i say this
21:35 - so you see 12 here right so this is 1 2
21:38 - 3 4 5 6 7 9 12 that we added
21:40 - then next we'll say
21:44 - variable so match
21:47 - number set
21:51 - set the match number
21:54 - so we are going to use the index again
21:57 - we're going to use the number list
22:01 - so what we want to do is we're just
22:03 - going to pick a random
22:05 - index from this number list so i know
22:07 - we're using a lot of lists
22:09 - i know a lot of scratcher you know kids
22:12 - they always do like really cool stuff
22:15 - different game
22:16 - but when it comes to lists i think a lot
22:18 - of kids have problem
22:19 - so basically if you guys have problem
22:21 - with this i would suggest you watch the
22:24 - other two video
22:25 - like understanding a list or finding
22:28 - duplicate in the list that will
22:29 - really give you a head start on this
22:31 - game so
22:33 - now we get the uh let that get out of
22:36 - the way so now you understand
22:37 - the list and you go to this game will be
22:39 - much easier for you to understand
22:41 - so we find a matching number from the
22:43 - list
22:44 - then we have to delete from the matching
22:47 - number basically
22:48 - uh the number list so basically you know
22:51 - we find a matching number that we want
22:53 - we don't want that to be showing up on
22:55 - the list again so
22:56 - we pick up number 12 number 12 should be
22:58 - deleted from the list right
23:00 - we don't want to pick number 12 again so
23:02 - what you want to do next
23:04 - is
23:06 - [Music]
23:07 - delete this first duplicate we're gonna
23:09 - use some of the code here
23:12 - okay we're gonna set the index of random
23:15 - number one
23:16 - to the length of number list so now
23:17 - number this actually was 12
23:19 - earlier we took out one and we deleted
23:22 - now is what is 11
23:23 - right so we will have 11 on this so
23:25 - again we're gonna pick a random number
23:27 - here
23:28 - so what we're going to do is we're going
23:30 - to add it to this matching number
23:32 - so i'll show you so
23:36 - you add it to the matching number that
23:39 - we assigned to it in the first
23:40 - place so the first time you added some
23:43 - number it could be one could be seven it
23:44 - could be nine doesn't matter right
23:46 - then we add the next pair number to
23:48 - match that what we're going to do is
23:50 - we're going to use the join
23:52 - operator okay
23:55 - and we gotta grab another join put it
23:58 - behind there
23:59 - so what we're going to do is go back to
24:01 - the variable so the
24:02 - matching number already have some item
24:04 - in there right because it got through
24:06 - the first
24:07 - here right they picked up something so
24:09 - matching number will have like let's say
24:11 - four or whatever it doesn't matter what
24:13 - we can do is we'll put a pipe character
24:15 - that will split the between the two uh
24:18 - matching number that we could use later
24:21 - to uh match
24:22 - so we know which one match with which
24:23 - one okay
24:25 - so next we will go
24:28 - the index of
24:32 - a number list so basically just pick one
24:35 - random one from here
24:36 - and pick that number and join it
24:38 - together now we are going to
24:41 - put this into here
24:45 - and we are going to delete this same
24:47 - thing here so
24:50 - okay i have an actual one here let me
24:52 - remove that
24:56 - okay all right and then i'll delete this
25:00 - and then i'll say
25:01 - add
25:04 - so i add this matching number that we
25:06 - just got
25:09 - we've formed the pipe between the two
25:12 - number
25:12 - and we are going to add this to the game
25:15 - matching numbers this is where we
25:17 - keep track of the uh the matching
25:22 - sprite okay okay next
25:27 - we will broadcast a message
25:33 - called setup so the hardest part of this
25:37 - game is setting up the game
25:39 - i mean after that it will be easier and
25:42 - then
25:42 - we will set the
25:47 - uh his game started to white so this
25:50 - will restart the game
25:52 - so i have not coded the setup game so
25:54 - self game is another
25:56 - thing it's gonna be really hard as well
25:59 - so i will have to stop here
26:01 - and then you know we'll continue next
26:02 - one but before that let me just show you
26:04 - the running of this code okay let me
26:07 - zoom back out
26:10 - so what we had so far is we have the uh
26:13 - the uh initializing the code for the
26:16 - game we
26:17 - do a set of 12 boxes and then we have
26:20 - loaded all
26:21 - of our uh sprite name into this
26:25 - list and then we have uh created the
26:27 - code for preparing the game to choose
26:29 - the six
26:30 - matching uh things for our game six
26:33 - matching uh
26:34 - basically six matching cards okay
26:38 - okay i will run it one time for you guys
26:40 - to see so i will click on the green
26:42 - flags
26:42 - so what the cat's gonna say something
26:44 - and then it will prepare this list for
26:46 - us
26:47 - so we'll run this so now if i show you
26:50 - this
26:52 - so as you can see the game what did they
26:54 - choose it choose number 49
26:56 - sprite which is the toe which is one so
27:00 - six and eight is the matching one that
27:02 - we found
27:03 - so we can put it in the sixth position
27:05 - the sixth box
27:06 - uh sprite and the eight box for this guy
27:10 - and then the next one is the slime we we
27:13 - we picked uh two and twelve right will
27:15 - be random so
27:16 - we'll take slime we'll create a second
27:19 - box and then the 12 box whatever right
27:21 - so as you can see you have one you have
27:23 - two you have three
27:25 - four five six seven eight
27:28 - nine ten eleven twelve so we have all
27:31 - the number that we want from the box
27:34 - and each of them correspond to each of
27:36 - them over here
27:37 - so one is for toe two is for slime
27:40 - right number three here the list is for
27:43 - fang and then eyeball and bat and then
27:45 - zombie so that we know okay at this
27:47 - position number six we are going to put
27:50 - this custom
27:51 - toe at position number eight this box
27:54 - will put
27:54 - custom toe as well so that you know you
27:56 - have to match so let me run it again you
27:58 - can see it will cleanse it up and then
28:02 - after the cat talks something it will
28:03 - recreate again
28:05 - so you see this is different different
28:06 - this time the eye the halo and
28:09 - skull and x right and then the number is
28:11 - also different so every time you run
28:13 - this
28:13 - it will generate a list for the game
28:16 - both the matching
28:17 - the number that match the game and the
28:19 - sprite for that game
28:20 - so this one this is how you generate the
28:22 - list for right now
28:24 - so that way you have the game prepare
28:26 - you know
28:27 - for this part and then on the next video
28:30 - we'll show you how to actually
28:32 - put the all the things together alright
28:34 - so we'll stop right here
28:36 - and then we'll continue on the next
28:37 - video all right thank you guys for
28:39 - watching please like share and subscribe
