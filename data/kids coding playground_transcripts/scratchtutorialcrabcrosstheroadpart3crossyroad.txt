00:45 - alright now let's get started okay what
00:51 - we're going to do next is that we are
00:52 - going to work on the coal for the cake
00:54 - first okay we will go here we'll say
01:02 - start so when green flag start what we
01:06 - want to do we want generate the cake
01:08 - somewhere on the top lane only okay now
01:11 - let me put this over here chilly so we
01:14 - don't want to block that so I have the
01:16 - life on one side disco on the other side
01:19 - and then we have the cake on top so what
01:23 - we want to do we want to generate them
01:24 - kill me like this and you can change the
01:29 - cake sighs let's see okay how we are
01:37 - going to set the size of the cake now
01:40 - we'll make it forty 15 then we will say
01:45 - go to X&Y
01:49 - what we're going to do is we are going
01:51 - to set it up on top 160 so somewhere on
01:55 - top this Lane for the exposition will
01:58 - pick a random so what we're going to do
02:02 - is we are going to make it negative 200
02:05 - - 200 so basically anywhere on top here
02:09 - and we are going to have the
02:13 - it's a show so if I push this now as you
02:18 - can see the kick is somewhere on this
02:20 - side nobody can move it a little bit
02:22 - higher thing is okay you know what right
02:30 - so let's say we stop we start again you
02:32 - see the kick is in different position
02:34 - this is the tenth position when it's
02:36 - always generating on the top plane
02:40 - [Music]
02:42 - so next what we're going to do is we saw
02:46 - the remember the message got kick right
02:49 - so when the when the crap catch the cake
02:53 - we bought just catch a cupcake so we
02:57 - need to add this here now we go back to
03:01 - the event or say when I receive we are
03:11 - going to hide it we are going to change
03:16 - the score by one and what we can do it
03:23 - we will broadcast a new message say
03:29 - start again so when we see this message
03:33 - later the crap can move back to this
03:35 - position and we'll say wait for two
03:40 - seconds before generator kick again what
03:44 - we can do is we are going to placate his
03:46 - cohere so after we catch the cake we
03:50 - come back we it will create even create
03:53 - a new click again all right we will have
04:00 - to have some Co here to make the crap go
04:02 - back right because we would grab the
04:04 - cake that the crap you don't want the
04:06 - crowd to stay there right so what you
04:10 - can do is in the crap you had say when I
04:16 - receive start again
04:22 - and we are gonna move on back to this
04:24 - position now go to this position and
04:31 - what do a wait for one second before I
04:33 - begin so they pick with generate now
04:36 - let's just try it out
04:37 - oh we don't know much car run pass here
04:41 - - to kick if you can see once we catch
04:51 - the king we have two schools or two
04:53 - right don't step five lines but we need
04:57 - to do with the hit the crap right you
05:01 - remember that the colony the crab would
05:03 - broadcast hit crap what we need to go is
05:07 - where the go back to the crap and we
05:10 - have to start a new section of coal what
05:14 - we say is it crab so what we want to do
05:19 - is wouldn't it hit the crap we want to
05:22 - set this action stop action so yes that
05:32 - means it we want to stop the other
05:34 - action on the other thing how this car
05:37 - making sure that it doesn't get hit more
05:38 - than once and we want to change the life
05:44 - by minus one and then what this week to
05:50 - our custom be basically the cat the the
05:53 - crap that hit right we want to switch to
05:55 - custom B and we want to do a little
05:58 - weight and we want to check you we won
06:11 - the check if the live is here oh oh you
06:16 - can always say that life is 0 or less
06:19 - than 0 you want but I think it's ok then
06:23 - who have this to stop it will never go
06:25 - to negative so we can say life life's
06:32 - equal to 0
06:34 - then you can say stop all or you can
06:37 - have a podcast and not a message saying
06:39 - game over you can do that I think you
06:42 - guys know how to do that now you can
06:44 - just for now we can say stop all here
06:48 - and if not we want to switch it back to
06:52 - custom a after I get hit where wants to
06:56 - back to custom a and we want to reset
06:59 - this in the variable stop action to know
07:08 - so now and we want to podcast start
07:12 - again so let's just select start again
07:24 - so what it does is if we get hit or he
07:28 - get the cake the crab will come back
07:30 - here so let's test this out real quick
07:33 - so you can see if I catch the cake the
07:38 - crab will go back to the to the middle
07:40 - gear or I can hit back wanna see see I
07:43 - get hit back or I turn a little bit to
07:45 - and I come back so as you can see so if
07:51 - I have one more live the game and you
07:53 - see hit that even though the car hit the
07:56 - crab multiple time right because it runs
07:58 - in molar so we don't take more than one
08:01 - life because it's not action will help
08:03 - to uh to to do that right that's why we
08:07 - needed that okay so so far we have one
08:10 - car walking we have the crab walking
08:12 - with the life working with the squirrel
08:14 - walking and where the kid walking okay
08:16 - so next I want to show you guys is uh
08:19 - let's let me do one edit
08:22 - I'll show you one edit with the old one
08:24 - truck so what I did was you can just
08:28 - search for old truck cartoon PNG you can
08:31 - download this truck but this is not a
08:33 - transparent background unfortunately you
08:37 - can make some change to it so let me
08:40 - upload it I'll show you so this is the
08:42 - old truck download as you can see it
08:46 - couldn't you see
08:47 - you see some white celebration it is a
08:49 - transparent that you can see the cat
08:51 - here so this is messed up right so what
08:54 - you need to do you go to here use this
08:57 - magic thing magic Walker just come and
09:01 - highlight the truck okay so as you can
09:08 - see you can't fill out the truck so you
09:09 - see the truck is pretty good in - a
09:12 - little bit on top but I think can really
09:15 - do anything with that so so it's not see
09:20 - it's not 100% perfect right but it's
09:23 - near perfect so as you can see now you
09:25 - know you it's not completely blocking
09:28 - the cap right so you can see it's
09:30 - transparent now so what you can do is
09:33 - this so right click you can say safety
09:36 - local file go give you something called
09:39 - all Trump sprite - that means that older
09:44 - version of sprite or older version of a
09:47 - scratch so on when you export rice save
09:51 - again so this is the sprite for version
09:54 - 2 so it created this file after that you
09:58 - can come back to your Co here and you
10:02 - can use this and you say upload and you
10:05 - can use this truck too so it will all
10:08 - naturally convert to the pickup truck
10:11 - version 3 of sprite scratch so now you
10:16 - have the truck so what we can do is we
10:20 - can make the truck go a little bit slow
10:23 - we can put them somewhere around here
10:26 - this line here ok what we're going to do
10:31 - is we want to make walk on the truck now
10:36 - we are going to make him go to negative
10:43 - 250 right we'll use 250 and then we can
10:46 - go to 60 and you can change the size of
10:51 - the truck so here the truck we can set
10:59 - the side here
11:00 - well so this is 40 so as you can see the
11:04 - truck is still pre-baked and then
11:06 - depending on the year maybe you can say
11:09 - 30 so 30 seems okay with the truck okay
11:17 - now you can do the forever loop similar
11:21 - to the one that we had already right
11:23 - what we can do is actually we can drag
11:26 - it and send it over so let's just do all
11:30 - the size he actually probably will be
11:33 - easier let's remove this because I think
11:36 - different spray of different size so
11:41 - let's drag this over here you see this
11:43 - wobbly and then just rock drop it don't
11:46 - create it over there so now on this
11:49 - whole truck will change the position
11:51 - back so the truck is pretty much the
12:01 - same as the green car so because it's
12:04 - facing the same side we wanted to go to
12:06 - the other you know disappear and come
12:08 - back here oh the truck will make it like
12:11 - too so I'll go a little bit slower and
12:13 - if we hit the crap oh through the same
12:15 - vodcast
12:15 - okay so the truck is done now so let's
12:19 - just test it out in business you can see
12:21 - the truck is pulling little slow so you
12:25 - can adjust it a little bit maybe here or
12:27 - you want to ribbon on that yellow I mean
12:30 - depending where so you can change it so
12:33 - this is 70 actually so let's put in the
12:36 - 70 so now it's running so you can see
12:40 - the truck is gonna go slow
12:42 - to play a little bit in time before they
12:45 - actually you're gonna get the cake okay
12:49 - okay all right we got the truck we're
12:53 - gonna add the police car oh they don't
12:57 - upload that so same thing with a police
13:00 - car you can like make your make your
13:04 - over one McDow no the police car come at
13:08 - you raise that you know but uh well I
13:12 - don't want to do that again but you guys
13:14 - know how to do it what I can do is I can
13:15 - I exported from the other game and going
13:18 - to import the police car here okay so I
13:24 - went to my folder away I have the police
13:27 - car similar thing I just imported so now
13:31 - I have my police car okay so I have my
13:35 - police car here what I'm going to do is
13:38 - I'm going to take the code from the
13:40 - truck and copy over to the police car
13:44 - since the police car also facing the
13:47 - same side this is pretty much the same
13:49 - except for the location of the police
13:53 - car so as you can see the police call
13:56 - you when you move it we want to put them
13:58 - over here so it's about 108 right so
14:01 - we'll put 108 and since the police call
14:08 - you you can see the police cars actually
14:10 - pointing the other way right it's
14:12 - pointing to your left side if you can
14:15 - zoom in a little bit you can see it see
14:18 - the police car the head is on this side
14:20 - so what you have to do if you want to
14:21 - put a police car on this side run across
14:24 - what you have to do is you have to
14:26 - actually change it instead of a positive
14:28 - number
14:29 - yeah they use a negative number so
14:31 - that's why I'm purposely showing you
14:32 - putting it on this side so now the
14:35 - police cars are because of the direction
14:37 - right you see this direction negative 90
14:39 - so if you put 90 degrees cause facing
14:42 - the other side so we want to go this way
14:45 - then you put negative 90
14:47 - says negative 90 so you do not want to
14:50 - put neck so this should be negative 90
14:53 - right or you can change it here also
14:55 - that's fine you can drop this out so now
14:59 - you have this so what happened is the
15:02 - police car will go on to here and
15:05 - disappear now let's just test it out so
15:09 - as you can see the police cosmic
15:10 - traveling pretty fast okay we're missing
15:13 - something
15:14 - okay the police cars not coming back
15:18 - we forgot to set the position back so
15:24 - you see this is I messed it up right I
15:26 - had a negative right negative 250 250
15:32 - let me let me try since it's the
15:35 - opposite right so let's let's run it
15:37 - again
15:38 - so you see you got stuck over there
15:41 - right okay let's try this okay okay okay
15:56 - I made a mistake here or 250 so that was
15:59 - too much so we actually want to put it
16:01 - like 230 here someone is over 230 we
16:05 - will come back what's over here thinking
16:09 - this this is all messed up to 30 let's
16:16 - not use 250 here because sometimes some
16:19 - sprite depending on the size it might be
16:21 - messed up okay all right so we got the
16:24 - police car we call it negative 99 also
16:28 - we're pointing into this direction I
16:32 - think we can take this now let's take
16:36 - put it back in Figure web- 990 here
16:39 - let's just try it again make sure it
16:41 - works
16:42 - [Music]
16:45 - okay so we are we've good there so let's
16:48 - move make some article on the other side
16:51 - okay we have that with the truck we can
16:57 - have a truck truck oh they don't have
17:04 - truck here okay they don't have the food
17:07 - truck okay they don't have the foot
17:12 - truck anymore
17:14 - oh there it is okay also we want the big
17:20 - truck as well okay all right
17:25 - so this big truck has a different
17:28 - costume now what we can do is we can
17:32 - move the big truck on the top lane like
17:35 - right here and we can switch it to
17:39 - costume so that they have different
17:41 - costume okay gonna drag this in this is
17:45 - this truck oh let me just copy the coal
17:49 - from the outside will be faster actually
17:50 - well not enough time if not so let's
17:55 - finish that so we copy it over here
17:57 - we're gonna adjust it a little bit so
18:01 - the position will change it actually we
18:07 - can change it to okay let's try them on
18:17 - this side we'll put them on the other
18:23 - side like this I'll come on this side
18:26 - and we'll put 155 and the truck let's
18:32 - put them at a 40% probably will walk and
18:40 - since it's coming on the other side you
18:42 - have to use the minus
18:44 - five because we're flipping him around
18:48 - and we have to point him to negative 90
18:52 - and what I set this over here okay
18:59 - all right so now the truck will be going
19:02 - this way for this we are going to have
19:08 - to check the position differently
19:11 - because it's going this way now for the
19:15 - sprite so it depends on how the spray is
19:18 - going so if this condition may be
19:20 - different and yeah they check if it's
19:24 - greater than 230 it was less than I mean
19:30 - less than negative to Authority sorry
19:33 - because it's coming from the other side
19:35 - right so negative 230 then we want to
19:38 - set them to 245 so the truck will go
19:45 - back to the right side okay let's test
19:48 - this out for now ignoring this truck
19:51 - here we'll hide this guy let's just try
19:53 - it right now
19:56 - okay so this is not correct so many
19:59 - truckers
19:59 - right okay okay um I think the Russian
20:12 - is wrong on the truck
20:14 - oh I have 90 here that's why let's take
20:20 - this back out let's put them back with
20:24 - negative 90 okay let's try no okay I
20:38 - made a mistake with the movement so on I
20:41 - change it back to positive five cents I
20:44 - rotate it to negative pointing this way
20:46 - so now let's test it out again and
20:49 - she'll walk now sort of just going this
20:51 - way then it goes to the end they'll come
20:54 - back so you just have to play with this
20:56 - up picture this negative and this
20:58 - this position check-in and the movement
21:01 - so depending on the kind of sprite
21:04 - Howard face it might be change
21:06 - differently okay all right so we got
21:09 - that
21:09 - so now let's get to the foot truck so
21:13 - the food truck is the last one I believe
21:16 - for our game oh maybe oh we have a light
21:20 - yeah I think my whole game has a bus
21:21 - also okay now let's copy take oh no I
21:27 - won't take it take this one okay alright
21:34 - so let's try the foot truck put them at
21:40 - the bottom here let's see show him okay
21:49 - he's a little big so foot truck let's
21:54 - say make him 20% yeah it looks good I
21:58 - think because of this little thing on
22:00 - top I could actually hit the crap even
22:02 - though it's not exactly
22:04 - neither okay so one down here okay we'll
22:11 - change the x position oh whatever
22:18 - let's try this here's negative nine year
22:28 - and negative 8086 you see a succes right
22:34 - so let's try four switch this different
22:43 - location let's see
22:52 - okay well if you will go on to call from
22:55 - this side so they'll come back over here
23:02 - and now let's try and test this out
23:06 - what's getting it wrong I think is this
23:11 - would be like this okay okay so then
23:26 - this is not correct let's let's do this
23:33 - let's put them back let's just make it a
23:36 - little easier put 90 and we're going to
23:42 - use the positive number here okay all
23:47 - right I think we should just whatever
23:49 - the truck is facing we'll do that
23:52 - easier use changing around
23:57 - okay so we have that already now we add
24:00 - one more one more
24:03 - the school bus is at one more save the
24:06 - bus is there okay
24:09 - this will be our last one and also in
24:15 - this truck actually if you want you can
24:19 - come and change to you we call it change
24:23 - the the costume between each time so
24:27 - that way you know if they run through at
24:29 - the next costume you can put it like
24:31 - this so the custom of the truck is
24:35 - different same thing with the foot truck
24:36 - you can add that as well because the
24:42 - foot chalk has different costume as you
24:44 - can see right okay the school bus
24:48 - alright so we are almost there
24:51 - so the bus
24:54 - we'll make the bus go maybe this the
24:57 - other way so let's see what we can do
25:02 - will copy the cohere drag it over to the
25:09 - bus okay so the bus we are going to make
25:14 - him maybe 45 40 40 but just saw the bus
25:20 - this row here going to hat that um so
25:28 - this is around 15 right I don't know
25:33 - well let's let's just see all my cars
25:35 - yeah
25:41 - [Music]
26:04 - um can try this okay so have the spool a
26:15 - bus going directly let's see yep
26:18 - looks like it's correct no so so far we
26:23 - have all the code now or all the Stefan
26:26 - sprite from now that's nice the KML
26:31 - it's a little tough we'll try across the
26:35 - street so as you can see it's not
26:56 - anything to get it but but we can we as
27:02 - you can see you can change a little bit
27:04 - the car or no slower with the police
27:06 - cars going too fast right okay make
27:13 - myself a little easier let's go to
27:15 - everything by 1/6 okay this is too is
27:22 - fine this is 8/3 is fine
27:26 - this guy's five is boiling the only one
27:31 - is police called us make him seven it's
27:35 - too fast okay now let's say we have a
27:37 - better chance
27:39 - [Music]
27:45 - okay so you see them cut the cake there
27:49 - you go
27:50 - so that's how the game works so you guys
27:52 - kind of change the speed that you like
27:55 - or cross and get it to last another game
