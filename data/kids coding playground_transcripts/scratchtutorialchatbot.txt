00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be making a chat bot so like
00:13 - you can engage a
00:14 - conversation with it i guess well not
00:16 - really because
00:18 - i didn't put too much work in it you
00:20 - guys can add some more if you guys want
00:21 - to
00:22 - um i it can also tell you the day of the
00:25 - week
00:26 - the current date and the time you can
00:28 - also chat with it i guess
00:30 - and we'll be learning these following
00:32 - concepts in scratch
00:34 - list the type text thing we learned that
00:36 - in the
00:37 - indie cat game so if you don't know how
00:40 - to do this
00:40 - you should check out our indie cat game
00:43 - i also show you how to do it in this
00:45 - video
00:46 - and we'll be also learning custom blocks
00:48 - loops sensing blocks related to data and
00:50 - time
00:51 - and i got this idea from my friend and
00:55 - his name is uh his username and scratch
00:58 - is called rayleigh1123
00:59 - you can check out his scratch account
01:01 - right here there's a link to him and
01:03 - follow him
01:04 - he can also he also made the chain
01:07 - reaction game tutorial on our channel so
01:09 - if you haven't checked that out be sure
01:11 - to check it out okay so
01:13 - now let's continue on to the game so
01:17 - let's go here i'll show you how it works
01:20 - so let me i just got some chat bot png
01:23 - from online can you
01:25 - search it up or get anything you want in
01:27 - the beginning i'll say
01:28 - hello there your username
01:32 - how are you and you can respond with i'm
01:34 - doing fine
01:39 - and it will reply i'm glad to hear that
01:43 - um i know the popping sounds a bit
01:45 - annoying
01:46 - i just added that because why not and
01:48 - you can ask it to play music
01:52 - you'll play a random i originally had
01:55 - a different music wait let me turn on
01:56 - the volume a bit more so you guys can
01:58 - hear it
02:01 - so music play music
02:04 - i originally had other songs but um i
02:07 - took it out because
02:08 - it was copyrighted so if i used it in
02:11 - the youtube video it would be considered
02:12 - copyrighted so i didn't use it
02:14 - i just used some from the scratch
02:15 - library so i'll play a random song
02:19 - i have three songs
02:22 - [Music]
02:32 - the current date is 22
02:36 - 20 20. what is the
02:41 - day of the week
02:44 - it is wednesday yeah today is wednesday
02:47 - so that's right
02:48 - and we also have what is the time
02:54 - the current time is 2
02:57 - 21 25 that's basically 9 25 in our time
03:02 - so without further ado let's make a new
03:05 - project
03:06 - file new i'm going to rename this
03:10 - chat bot uh delete this sprite
03:15 - the sprite one backpack i already have
03:17 - the chat bot
03:19 - as you can see the background's a little
03:22 - off
03:22 - i'll make the background a different
03:24 - color so
03:26 - in one of our videos we taught you guys
03:28 - how to remove the background so
03:29 - you can also watch that but for now i'm
03:32 - just going to
03:33 - change the background color so
03:36 - just convert to vector it's our vector
03:38 - just select
03:39 - this color go to backdrop
03:43 - and just draw a square take out this
03:46 - just draw a square i know it's kind of
03:49 - hard to see because it's all
03:50 - white okay there you go so now the
03:53 - backdrop is completely blended into the
03:55 - chatbot background
03:57 - so next let's make some variables of
03:59 - lists only two
04:00 - only one variable we don't need this
04:03 - actually so we need one variable
04:05 - two lists so our one variable we will
04:07 - need is letter which is for the
04:09 - type text we'll also need two lists
04:13 - one is called days of the week
04:18 - days of the week and make another list
04:20 - called words
04:23 - okay so we have two lists and one
04:25 - variable letter
04:26 - days of the weeks and words so for the
04:29 - bot
04:29 - we're going to start out by making a
04:31 - block called type say
04:35 - type say and then we can add an input
04:38 - call it
04:39 - text so that's it
04:42 - for the block so let me zoom in this
04:45 - code
04:46 - let's start with the type text so in the
04:48 - beginning i'm going to set the letter to
04:49 - one because there's one letter in the
04:51 - beginning
04:52 - set the letter to one
04:57 - delete all of the words in the word list
05:02 - and then repeat
05:06 - repeat the length of text so it will
05:09 - repeat
05:09 - how however long the text you write as
05:13 - length of text
05:18 - text and it will change the letter by
05:21 - one so
05:21 - keep on going by one letter so change
05:23 - the letter by one
05:25 - it'll say the words say
05:29 - the list words the words
05:32 - in the word list and i'm just gonna
05:35 - get the pop sound because why not it's a
05:38 - bit annoying you can take it out if you
05:40 - want to
05:40 - i'm just going to add it and wait wait
05:43 - 0.15
05:44 - 0.15 seconds this is just to make it
05:47 - type out slower a bit wait one seconds
05:52 - and then say blank so we can set it back
05:55 - to blank
05:58 - so that's all we have for now that's the
06:00 - type text
06:02 - and one more part i forgot about this
06:04 - part we have to add
06:08 - the letter
06:12 - letter add the letter
06:18 - letter letter of text so add the letter
06:22 - the text so to to the
06:25 - word list so this is what we have for
06:28 - now
06:28 - remember to add this so next
06:31 - we're gonna have to um set the days of
06:34 - the week so get a one flag clicked
06:37 - hide the
06:40 - orderless days of the week i know it's
06:44 - already hidden but i'm just gonna put
06:45 - this
06:46 - if it's not if yours is not hidden then
06:48 - put this in the beginning
06:49 - we want to delete all of the days of the
06:51 - week in the beginning clear it all
06:54 - we're going to add all the days of the
06:56 - week so sunday
06:57 - monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday
06:59 - so i'm just going to duplicate a couple
07:01 - of these
07:02 - until i get seven so i get seven
07:07 - so add sunday
07:11 - monday
07:15 - monday tuesday
07:19 - tuesday wednesday
07:26 - thursday
07:29 - friday and
07:32 - saturday so all the days of the week
07:38 - are here and next we're gonna
07:43 - get it one flat clicked this is for the
07:46 - chatting the actual chatting for the bot
07:48 - so
07:50 - get it when flag clicked i think i
07:52 - should zoom in a bit more
07:54 - when flag's like you want to go to zero
07:56 - zero
07:58 - set the x and y position to the origin
08:03 - um and then we can type say
08:07 - type say join we'll need a couple joins
08:11 - join join so we can type say hello there
08:21 - hello there and then we do the username
08:24 - so i'll say hello there username how are
08:27 - you
08:27 - so that's what i'm gonna do hello there
08:30 - username
08:34 - how
08:38 - how
08:42 - sorry accidentally i dragged uh uh
08:45 - pick random you're supposed to drag a
08:47 - join so i should say hello
08:49 - there username how are you
08:53 - how how are
08:57 - and before before after here you should
09:00 - always add a space so
09:01 - it'll be spaced out and you should add a
09:03 - space before here so it'll also be
09:05 - spaced out
09:05 - so when you play it it'll say hello
09:08 - there
09:09 - my username wrestle12345 how are you
09:14 - so that's just a greet the
09:17 - user so get a forever loop
09:21 - let's get a forever loop um this will
09:24 - only
09:24 - say a couple things so we will not be
09:26 - using a list
09:27 - so if you want to do more like to say
09:30 - answer many questions then you have to
09:32 - do a list that's a bit complicated
09:34 - so we're just going to do it this way
09:36 - for now so we're going to ask
09:38 - blank in the beginning
09:41 - just let them ask anything we want get
09:44 - an if then statement
09:46 - if
09:49 - the answer answer contains a date
09:54 - so if the answer that they answered
09:57 - contains
09:57 - date which means the date of the week
10:00 - the date
10:01 - with current date and we type say
10:05 - type say join we'll need a lot of joins
10:08 - again
10:10 - join we'll need five joins okay
10:15 - so three four five
10:18 - five joins the current date
10:21 - is
10:27 - the current date is join the current
10:29 - month
10:31 - the current month join the current
10:35 - uh you have to put a slash just to like
10:38 - separate it that's what they do
10:40 - the current the current uh date
10:45 - and the current and then you put a
10:47 - slasher here
10:49 - and then the current year
10:52 - so when you play this
10:55 - and put it together i'll show you what
10:57 - happens so
10:59 - this is what we have so when you play
11:03 - yeah just say that i think i should uh
11:06 - take this out for now because
11:08 - it's going to waste a lot of time so
11:09 - i'll just show you uh
11:11 - let's say what is the date
11:16 - [Music]
11:18 - the current date is 7
11:22 - 22 20 20. so that's right right now
11:25 - it is july 22nd 2020
11:30 - so that is correct so we can just
11:32 - duplicate this we'll need to do
11:34 - now we're gonna do the current um
11:37 - time so if the answer contains time
11:41 - then we can do the current time
11:45 - the current time
11:49 - is we have to join the current hour
11:53 - per hour and get another join
11:56 - this time we'll put a colon to separate
11:59 - it
11:59 - that's what they do and then we join the
12:02 - current
12:02 - minute
12:06 - so right now i'm for now i'm just going
12:08 - to take this out because it's going to
12:09 - waste too much
12:10 - time so when i plant
12:13 - what is the time
12:17 - the current time is 21.35 so that's
12:22 - basically 9 35
12:23 - in our eastern time so
12:26 - 21 35 that's the correct time
12:31 - so now we have this let's work on the um
12:34 - the current day of the week so duplicate
12:38 - this we'll need an or get an
12:41 - or or statement so if the answer
12:44 - contains day
12:48 - or no actually no not or and sorry
12:51 - so this is to check double check if they
12:54 - actually meant the day of the week
12:56 - so if the answer contains day and
12:59 - week just put that in here
13:03 - then we can type say
13:07 - it is and then we get the item
13:12 - the item days of the week
13:16 - item the current day of the week
13:20 - current day of the week
13:24 - of days of the week so as you can see
13:27 - up here we set the days of the week so
13:30 - i'll open it up so
13:31 - this is the index one two three four
13:34 - five six seven
13:35 - so the current day right now is four
13:38 - which is um wednesday so if you were to
13:41 - take this out
13:42 - click on it it would say four which is
13:44 - wednesday
13:45 - so that means i'll select the fourth
13:47 - index of the
13:48 - list so right here it'll say it is
13:53 - wednesday which is today uh
13:57 - of the week so if you put this in just
14:00 - drag that in here
14:02 - under here so next we're gonna add the
14:05 - um
14:07 - this is like a little conversation i
14:09 - guess so
14:11 - if let's get an or
14:14 - okay we'll need and
14:18 - two ores two ores
14:22 - so just duplicate this
14:25 - so if the answer contains doing great
14:31 - so in the beginning notice that how it
14:34 - says hello their username how are you
14:37 - so the user might reply with i'm doing
14:39 - great
14:42 - uh doing good
14:46 - or doing fine there of course there are
14:49 - many other ways to do this
14:51 - with lists but right now we're doing
14:53 - like this doing oh oops week i was
14:55 - looking at something else
14:56 - fine and then instead of this we can
15:00 - just make it type say
15:02 - i'm glad to hear that i am
15:05 - glad to hear that
15:13 - i'm glad to hear that so you put that
15:16 - right there
15:19 - i'm going to duplicate this
15:22 - so this time we can check if they're
15:23 - doing bad let's say if they're doing
15:26 - a bad if they're having a bad day or
15:28 - something
15:29 - if they're doing bad or something
15:32 - doing bad or doing horrible
15:36 - if the answer is doing horror
15:40 - or ripple i think that's how you spell
15:43 - it
15:44 - then you can say i am
15:48 - i am sorry to hear that
15:57 - put that in here so this is just for a
15:59 - little conversation
16:01 - and finally we can do something else so
16:03 - let's get some sounds so this is the
16:05 - music
16:05 - playing music let me hide this list
16:08 - first
16:10 - sounds i'm just gonna take two like
16:13 - three random sounds
16:15 - put that up there
16:19 - um go to just gonna take the first three
16:23 - sounds whatever uh
16:27 - loops chill
16:32 - just take the first three sounds
16:35 - so for the code we're gonna do if
16:40 - the answer contains
16:43 - the answer contains
16:50 - answer contains play music so if they're
16:53 - asking
16:54 - us to play music then we can uh
16:57 - start sound pick random one to three so
17:02 - it will pick a random
17:04 - the first three uh sounds so
17:07 - the first three sounds right here are
17:09 - the bossa nova cave and chill the three
17:11 - sounds i have
17:14 - so now let's try it out
17:18 - the whole thing save it real quick
17:22 - so hello rosslyn12345 how are you
17:28 - i would reply with doing great
17:32 - then it will say i am glad to hear that
17:36 - you can ask it what's the date
17:41 - the date
17:44 - the current date is 7 22
17:48 - 20 20. yeah and you can ask it
17:52 - time what is the time the current time
17:56 - is 21.41 so now it's 9 41
18:00 - in our time you can add and then you can
18:02 - say
18:04 - what is the day of the week
18:11 - and you can say it is wednesday
18:15 - so next you can say play music
18:20 - then i'll play a random sound
18:29 - and after it's done you play music again
18:32 - it'll pick random one to three so
18:36 - it could be any song really
18:37 - [Music]
18:41 - so yes i'll scroll through it one last
18:43 - time
18:44 - take a look through it
18:54 - so that's it for the chat bot don't
18:57 - forget to check out
18:58 - um rayleigh1123 who
19:02 - gave me the idea of this game uh his
19:05 - scratch account will be in the link in
19:06 - the description
19:08 - uh thank you guys for watching please
19:10 - like share and subscribe
19:12 - and i'll see you guys in the next video
