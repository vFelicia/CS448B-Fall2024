00:00 - welcome back guys in case you're
00:02 - included right here
00:04 - um today I'll be showing you guys our
00:06 - project we made at a coding camp in 24
00:09 - hours
00:11 - um I know I haven't been uploading
00:12 - recently but here's just a non-tutorial
00:15 - video you guys can watch for
00:16 - entertainment of me and my friend and my
00:19 - brother and we were working on this
00:21 - coding project for a coding competition
00:25 - we were given 24 hours to work at it but
00:28 - we only used like eight hours because we
00:30 - had to go home we didn't stay overnight
00:33 - um and also sounds better at the title
00:35 - so
00:36 - sorry if I click baited you into
00:37 - watching this video
00:39 - yeah without further Ado enjoy the video
00:44 - we arrived at the coding place around 12
00:46 - o'clock noon
00:47 - and we immediately started to get to
00:50 - work
00:51 - we spent the first hour kind of
00:53 - brainstorming what ideas
00:54 - of what game we should do and then we
00:56 - finally settled on making a shooter game
00:58 - where we shoot like aliens or zombies
01:01 - we decided to go through some projects
01:05 - um on scratch some popular projects on
01:07 - Scratch and we found a pretty cool
01:09 - shooter game so we decided to make a
01:11 - similar concept to it so thanks to the
01:13 - people who made the project
01:15 - um for giving us the inspiration of our
01:17 - projects I'll link their project in the
01:19 - description below
01:21 - by hour two we were already working on a
01:23 - project with the code the movement the
01:26 - jumping uh with the shooting so I was
01:29 - working on the movement while my friend
01:31 - was working on the shooting of the
01:33 - character and then my brother was also
01:36 - drawing the Sprites and for the
01:38 - character and for the enemies
01:40 - and everything seemed to go really well
01:42 - we had a system where on Google Drive we
01:44 - would
01:45 - um upload each of our projects when we
01:47 - got to a good stopping point and then we
01:49 - re-upload each of the projects into each
01:51 - of our computers and we will start
01:53 - working from there so we can work on
01:55 - multiple Parts
01:57 - um all at the same time so that worked
01:59 - out pretty well that definitely saved us
02:01 - some time instead of all working on one
02:03 - computer which would take a while by the
02:05 - end of the second hour we already had
02:07 - our shooting and our movement finished
02:10 - at R2 I also wanted to change the
02:12 - movement
02:13 - um I had from the beginning
02:15 - um I wanted to make and have some
02:16 - friction when you're like walking like
02:19 - you know having platforms when you walk
02:20 - there's like a little friction so I
02:22 - instead of keeping how it was before I
02:25 - just like kind of strapped that and
02:27 - redid the scripts I made it so now
02:29 - there's some friction so the game looks
02:31 - a little bit better I also ended up
02:33 - adding jumping and crouching together
02:35 - with the basic movement
02:38 - so this clip right here was from around
02:40 - hour three and it's just a video of us
02:42 - working together
02:48 - around the three hour mark we decided to
02:50 - start working on the enemies that follow
02:52 - you and attack you and we added some
02:55 - extra like touches onto our movement and
02:58 - stuff we added double jump and we added
03:01 - some new weapons and stuff
03:03 - um my brother was drawing all the
03:05 - costumes for the characters and the
03:08 - enemies and also the skins for the guns
03:12 - um so yeah in this next clip you will
03:13 - see us uh finishing up movement and we
03:17 - were working on the enemies
03:19 - um and some of the code was done on my
03:22 - friend's computer like the um different
03:24 - guns and stuff like switching guns and I
03:26 - don't have a recording of that but I'll
03:28 - show you the final product after this
03:30 - section of the video
03:32 - also if you haven't subscribed to our
03:34 - Channel right now it'd be a great time
03:35 - to subscribe to our Channel thank you
03:37 - guys for all your support remember when
03:40 - I was saying how we had a system on
03:42 - Google Drive where we were like
03:43 - uploading our projects there and like
03:46 - um downloading each one so then we can
03:48 - work at different parts while my friend
03:50 - finished up a gun part and I downloaded
03:52 - his project so in this next part you can
03:55 - see that I already have the gun script
03:57 - in my projects
03:59 - foreign
04:00 - you can see that I'm working on the
04:02 - script for the enemies to follow the
04:04 - player
04:40 - foreign
04:57 - so this part's around the forearm work
04:59 - uh you had the Skins my brother imported
05:02 - them in and we have the basic gameplay
05:05 - of the game and here I just showed you a
05:08 - quick demo of How It's like
05:11 - um it's not completely finished yet but
05:12 - you're about halfway done
05:14 - right now it's hour four I've been
05:16 - working for like four hours already I've
05:19 - had my bid spray here's our video in
05:22 - Productions
05:25 - that's what we're working on right now
05:27 - okay yeah so that's it hour four guys
05:30 - see you in another hour
05:34 - in this next part I'm working on the
05:37 - double jump for the player
05:39 - let us know in the comment section below
05:41 - if you would like to see a scratch
05:43 - tutorial on this project
05:45 - so after hour four I kind of forgot to
05:47 - record some clips and stuff so we're
05:49 - just going to skip to hour seven where
05:51 - the last clip was
06:36 - foreign
06:49 - like seven right now and we've been
06:51 - working on this game for like seven
06:52 - hours now I'm on Geometry Dash because
06:55 - I'm bored right now
06:57 - so yeah see what my brother's up to
07:01 - he's watching some okay
07:07 - um
07:14 - so around our eights we have to go home
07:16 - because we didn't stay overnight so we
07:18 - worked on it a little bit the next day
07:19 - but I didn't really record anything but
07:22 - I'll see you guys tomorrow morning it is
07:25 - now hour eight of the challenge and we
07:28 - will be
07:30 - going home
07:31 - and we will be going tomorrow morning
07:33 - and finishing up the project
07:36 - I'll see you guys tomorrow
07:38 - the next day so the next day we just
07:41 - added some finishing touches to our
07:43 - project so here in this next clip I'll
07:46 - show you our final product of our
07:48 - projects
07:50 - here we have the final products for our
07:52 - project after we were finished so here
07:54 - let's start our project
07:56 - so you have the pistol you can it's just
07:59 - a basic pistol
08:01 - um and then we have the machine gun and
08:02 - the laser gun so the laser is like a one
08:04 - shot and machine gun is the weakest gun
08:06 - but it attacks the quickest and as you
08:09 - kill more enemies uh the enemies will
08:11 - respond faster move quicker and have
08:13 - more health
08:14 - and um
08:16 - and when you kill an enemy you gain
08:18 - Health but I haven't lost any health yet
08:20 - so
08:21 - we'll see about that and you can double
08:22 - jump I forgot if you did a double jump
08:24 - so you can double jump oh no they're
08:25 - going pretty fast now okay
08:27 - heels
08:32 - see how long it survive for oh see I
08:35 - killed one up I died so when you die you
08:37 - can have the option to respawn
08:39 - and we respawn you just basically just
08:41 - start again
08:43 - so yeah that is pretty much our game our
08:46 - alien shooter game we made
08:49 - so the next day around noon we we had to
08:52 - present our projects in front of judges
08:54 - uh they asked us questions on like how
08:56 - you made the project
08:58 - uh what ideas did you come up while
09:01 - making the project who did what part of
09:03 - the project stuff like that we answer
09:05 - the questions and they actually
09:07 - surprised me we won a certificate for
09:11 - like Best in Show or something
09:12 - uh for our projects so that was pretty
09:16 - cool
09:17 - this code day was overall a pretty fun
09:20 - experience we got to learn a lot and we
09:22 - learned how to work together on making a
09:24 - project
09:26 - anyway that's the end of this video
09:27 - thank you guys for watching if you did
09:30 - enjoy this video don't forget to like
09:32 - share and subscribe to kidscoding
09:33 - playground and you can check out our
09:35 - other tutorial videos too this was not
09:37 - really a tutorial video but more of a
09:39 - you know creating a game in 24 hours
09:41 - kind of like a entertainment video
09:44 - but yeah that's pretty much it thank you
