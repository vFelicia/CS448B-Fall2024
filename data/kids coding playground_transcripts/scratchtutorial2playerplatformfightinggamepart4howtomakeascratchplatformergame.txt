00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so hello scratchers to another episode
00:09 - on kids coding playground this is going
00:12 - to be the fourth episode for the
00:14 - two-player fighting game in the last
00:16 - video I forgot to add the one flag
00:18 - clicked hide so if you haven't had that
00:20 - added that then please add it so it in
00:22 - the selection screen the sprite player 1
00:25 - will not show and one last thing to
00:29 - duplicate this put that in here so in
00:33 - the beginning I'll switch to the idle
00:35 - costume well we're going to make three
00:38 - variables so our three variables are
00:42 - going to be player 1 hp I don't 1/8
00:46 - already have player 1 hp player 2 HP MN
00:51 - 2 HP and one more player 2 character
01:03 - [Applause]
01:05 - Claire to care so we have all the
01:13 - variables so in case you missed anything
01:16 - I'm gonna drag around this let you
01:18 - guys see code if you missed anything
01:38 - okay so that's all the code for the
01:41 - player one now let's show the code
01:43 - it's the code for the jam you guys don't
01:46 - have that it's the code for the begin
01:48 - button code from the character one
01:52 - select button this is the code for the
01:55 - dragon character to select button so
01:59 - that's all the code we've got from last
02:01 - time so we're going to be making the
02:04 - player 2 so I'm just going to drag it
02:08 - back pack clear to you so what let it
02:12 - load then move it up here so I'm gonna
02:17 - drag all the code into this glitter zoo
02:24 - so just drag all your code into players
02:28 - ooh
02:52 - okay so that's all the code for the
02:55 - player to I just directing all the code
03:01 - to get messy I like spread it out so let
03:14 - me just spread it out a little bit more
03:18 - so you guys can see it okay here we go
03:24 - spread it out okay so next for the run
03:29 - control we want to UM
03:31 - instead of greater than nine we want to
03:34 - do greater than seven because this only
03:36 - has seven costumes for running so one
03:41 - two three four five six seven
03:44 - actually there's eight costumes so
03:48 - there's gonna be eight costumes actually
03:50 - eight run costumes see one two three
03:53 - four five six seven eight
03:58 - so we're gonna continue with the code so
04:04 - we're gonna have to change it and
04:06 - incentive and set a player one character
04:09 - for all of these we're gonna do player
04:11 - two character run player one costume
04:18 - index so we want to change it to player
04:21 - 2 because this is player two and player
04:27 - two so we have eight costumes for the
04:32 - ninja girl on adventure girl and the
04:34 - teeny so you put seven right here and it
04:40 - starts at zero because we set it to zero
04:42 - right here so that's why you put a seven
04:47 - I'm gonna change this to GN which is a
04:50 - teeny so in the costumes you can see the
04:55 - genie raise GN and the genie doesn't
05:00 - have slide costumes and that's why we
05:01 - put the genie right there
05:05 - so next we're gonna things just change
05:11 - this code instead of player one
05:13 - character should be player two character
05:15 - and we should change this too so yeah
05:27 - you change this to player two character
05:30 - you have to change this to player two
05:32 - character what else if you change this
05:38 - to player two character and that's I
05:43 - think that's pretty much all you have to
05:45 - change these are already all changed so
05:49 - that's it for the player too
05:54 - so for player two we have two so then
06:00 - now we have to go to the start game over
06:04 - here switch costume to that and if it's
06:08 - touching so now we're going to work on
06:13 - the button so in the last video if you
06:15 - haven't washed it
06:16 - you made the two buttons so I taught you
06:20 - guys how to make it in there
06:22 - I'm just gonna drag it from the backpack
06:24 - because we have in the backpack anyway
06:29 - so let me just duplicate this code into
06:33 - here into here so this is the character
06:45 - one so we need to change the player one
06:49 - character right here it's a AG
06:52 - adventuregirl instead and change this to
06:57 - a Z also and instead of broadcasting
07:01 - clutter one select we have to broadcast
07:03 - player to to Silla and this has to
07:09 - receive player to select so now we can
07:13 - duplicate all this code into the beanie
07:15 - icon
07:17 - except we'll need to make a new a new we
07:22 - also have change this is 65 instead of
07:25 - negative 65
07:26 - we didn't make new x and y position as
07:30 - well so move this here move this here
07:38 - and finally move this there as well so
07:44 - in this one we're gonna set the x and y
07:46 - position to 170 y 60 and instead of a G
07:51 - we're gonna be n as in PE and this we
07:57 - also change this to GN as in Keaney so
08:00 - now we have all the icons ready and the
08:04 - begin button so okay what oh I did in
08:10 - here sorry
08:10 - she just back to AG in this back to easy
08:14 - oops did it in the wrong thing 65 and
08:19 - this has to be the one that's changing
08:21 - to GN genie this has to go to 170 and
08:29 - this has to become cheney so you have
08:37 - all the code for the genie let's move on
08:41 - to the HP bar we're gonna be working on
08:43 - the HP bars today but before we can do
08:48 - the HP bar be able to change the x and y
08:51 - position this make it face negative 90
08:55 - so the go face to the left side and we
08:59 - can change these arrow keys and the
09:05 - should be the right arrow key should be
09:09 - the down arrow key and the jump okay I
09:15 - found it so now we got to change this to
09:18 - up arrow key up just so have you guys
09:24 - how it works now
09:25 - [Music]
09:31 - I'm going to change these to play
09:34 - through character this should be good to
09:39 - clear to character this should be clear
09:42 - to character and so is this one
09:47 - so make sure to drag all your code into
09:52 - the other sprite or else I'll be wrong
09:55 - so now when you play it
09:57 - [Music]
10:01 - and now both of them can jump jump in
10:05 - slide so that's all the stuff for now
10:27 - and if you select these two but you
10:34 - cannot slide the food and I'm pushing
10:36 - down the down early in this so I'm gonna
10:49 - drag the player 1hp the bar and then the
10:56 - help so I already have it in my backpack
11:01 - but it's draw it I'll show you guys how
11:04 - to draw paint a new sprite you want to
11:07 - get the line tool make it black about
11:12 - four outline yeah and then you have to
11:16 - make it onto this cross like this one
11:19 - it's on the cross with that but on this
11:23 - one I'll drag this one into I've here
11:27 - this one in this one has to be opposite
11:29 - of the cross that the tip is like that
11:33 - so when you lose HP it won't lose from
11:37 - this side they said o get smaller from
11:40 - this side and to make it and this is
11:44 - also on the cross and this is on the
11:48 - opposite side so it's a drawl the
11:52 - healthbox
11:53 - you hold down the shift key to make a
11:56 - perfect line you can hold down the shift
12:00 - key right here and connect it up here
12:05 - can make make it like a black or
12:08 - Jilla and then write HP red or orange
12:13 - color I'm just gonna do bread HP of
12:17 - course you can use any font you want HP
12:28 - so you have to copy face this you can
12:32 - copy paste it to the health to compare
12:37 - of course this is way too small right
12:39 - now it's obviously way too small so that
12:41 - means have to make it bigger so I can
12:45 - like either expand it but that won't
12:46 - look good so that's how you do it you
12:51 - just have to keep on measuring until the
12:53 - tip matches the tip of the health bar so
12:57 - it's sure you just have to keep on
13:00 - trying until it's perfect fit just work
13:03 - on the code for it now so one flag
13:10 - clicked you want to hide in the
13:11 - beginning before the game starts we're
13:14 - gonna hide so next we want to get if
13:19 - when it receives the start game button
13:22 - the start game message then we can go to
13:28 - this x and y position we want it to be
13:31 - on the same x position
13:33 - I've same y position because we want to
13:36 - be at the same height but the x position
13:38 - can be different
13:39 - so this is that line x position we
13:42 - wanted to go to the front in the
13:43 - beginning so they'll go in front of the
13:47 - health bar okay show and for the p2 it
13:54 - health bar it's basically the same thing
13:58 - but we can work on the health first so
14:02 - when I receive start game resuming start
14:10 - game
14:12 - start game that we have we can go to
14:15 - this x and y position the same as the
14:17 - health box and we want to show in the
14:20 - beginning once it receives the message
14:24 - get her forever you set the color effect
14:29 - a zero in the beginning and set the size
14:33 - to player 1 HP set size to clear when HP
14:37 - what this means is player 1 HP we will
14:44 - set it with the win fly clicks so when
14:47 - flat clicks we want to set the player 1
14:49 - HP to 100 so that means I'll set the
14:51 - size of it to 100 the size of the HP bar
14:56 - to 100 Guinea and you can hide her here
15:00 - so next we want to get it then statement
15:05 - so if the player HP is less than 51 so
15:10 - if it's less than 50 51 HP that makes 50
15:15 - or under so if player HP player 1 HP
15:18 - just less than 51 then we can set the
15:24 - color effect to 170 so I'll become bread
15:28 - set the colour effect 270 so become
15:34 - bread and get another if-then statement
15:37 - so if the HP is less than or equal to
15:45 - less than or equal to 0 the player 1 HP
15:51 - is less than or equal to 0
15:55 - player 8 1 HP is less than or equal to 0
15:58 - and we can hide for this player 2 HP we
16:07 - can just drag in the code from here to
16:10 - here gotta change the x and y position
16:13 - we had to change the x position though I
16:16 - want to change the x position to 66
16:21 - does it have it written down right here
16:24 - 66 and the player to health is 2 when I
16:31 - receive start game then we can go to and
16:41 - I almost forgot you can just copy it
16:43 - from here actually and I missed this
16:52 - room so now if the code copy pasted you
16:58 - have to reset the X&Y position this one
17:01 - should be 240 and 7 negative 240 and
17:05 - this is all the same thing and instead
17:10 - of player 1 HP with to do player 2 HP
17:12 - for everything Claire 2 HP player 2 HP
17:19 - player 2 HP and player 2 HP so I'll show
17:25 - you guys
17:25 - I'll set their HP to like 15 and you
17:28 - will see it become bread so if I if I
17:31 - were to set it we hide these variables
17:33 - first
17:34 - [Music]
17:37 - I respect that
17:39 - HP to 50% and it will become bread
17:47 - [Music]
17:50 - at the high turn as you can see it's red
17:58 - because it's under 50% HP so thank you
