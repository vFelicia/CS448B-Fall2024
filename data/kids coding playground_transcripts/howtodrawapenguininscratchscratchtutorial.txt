00:08 - welcome back guys it's kids and
00:09 - playground here today we're back for
00:10 - another video in scratch and today we're
00:12 - starting a new series called how to draw
00:15 - so if you're wondering how we draw our
00:17 - sprites uh we'll be going thoroughly to
00:20 - teach you and my dad drew this penguin
00:22 - so i'll be trying to attempt to draw it
00:24 - today and uh yeah we're starting this
00:26 - new series called how to draw so hope
00:28 - you catch along and you start um drawing
00:31 - along with us and uh
00:34 - and be better at us at drawing and yeah
00:37 - so you can i made a bunch of different
00:38 - costumes he drew the original one i made
00:40 - a bunch of different costumes red
00:42 - penguin ice penguin evil penguin
00:45 - reverted penguin
00:47 - futuristic penguin a drastic penguin and
00:50 - mini penguin i made a bunch of
00:53 - these things and
00:55 - uh i'll be trying to attempt to draw
00:58 - the normal penguin and let's start a new
01:01 - costume
01:04 - paint a sprite
01:05 - so now
01:07 - and then now let's start drawing first
01:10 - thing you want to do is get the two
01:11 - ovals it's pure black
01:14 - and you want to make oval like ellipse i
01:16 - think it's called ellipse
01:18 - something like that
01:21 - you center it
01:23 - and then you make
01:25 - another one and you put it over the
01:28 - other oval so it kind of looks like a
01:30 - lollipop
01:32 - maybe a little bit lower and that looks
01:34 - around the same it might be a little bit
01:36 - smaller than the other one but we'll
01:38 - increase the size and then now we're
01:40 - going to make the stomach
01:43 - which is also our lips
01:45 - but it's um
01:47 - gray
01:49 - a light gray so
01:51 - that's good
01:56 - yeah uh there we got the stomach
01:59 - now we're gonna make the eyes
02:02 - the eyes is first a white circle and you
02:04 - hold shift down while you're doing this
02:06 - to make a perfect circle
02:09 - see look it's very perfect it won't end
02:12 - up like an oval or ellipse or anything
02:14 - so
02:15 - and you just duplicate it
02:17 - ctrl c ctrl v
02:21 - and then
02:22 - make the black circle
02:25 - inside
02:30 - pure black
02:31 - for the pupil
02:33 - or the eye
02:34 - itself so
02:36 - just a smaller black circle
02:38 - inside of the white circle so ctrl c
02:41 - ctrl v
02:42 - and put it to the next one
02:45 - little cute little mini penguin and now
02:47 - we're gonna make the beak and the feet
02:50 - so the way you draw the
02:54 - feet is you use a light color a light
02:57 - yellow
03:00 - and
03:01 - that's the
03:03 - mustard yellow actually for the inside
03:05 - and of a kind of orange color for the
03:07 - outside well it looks like american
03:09 - cheese or
03:11 - some sort of cheese
03:12 - so yeah you have to make that so it's a
03:14 - darker inside lighter outside so dark
03:17 - mustard yellow
03:18 - and
03:20 - a pastel orange
03:23 - yellowish color
03:25 - and the thickness should be four
03:29 - and then you put you make this little
03:31 - mustard little feet
03:34 - you put it over here and then it's you
03:36 - have to put
03:37 - a backwards after i'll do that in a
03:39 - minute back
03:41 - so it'll be behind the penguin and you
03:42 - ctrl c ctrl v
03:44 - make a new one and put on the other side
03:46 - of the penguin
03:47 - and just go make it go to the back
03:49 - then we have the feet now the only
03:51 - missing part is the beak so this is the
03:54 - tricky part you make um
03:55 - [Music]
03:57 - a circle
03:58 - i have a square square
04:00 - and then you cut part of it off you cut
04:02 - the half so you click this you click one
04:05 - of the corners and you backup space with
04:07 - the reshape tools
04:10 - delete or delete yeah and um now you
04:14 - have a triangle because you know two
04:16 - triangles make a
04:19 - square you rotate it
04:21 - and you kind of reshape it a little bit
04:23 - to make it look more longer and more
04:25 - like a beak
04:26 - because you know a square one half of a
04:29 - square is a triangle and that's 180
04:31 - degrees and a square is 360. so that's
04:34 - why you click use the reshape tool
04:37 - against that to make a beak so right
04:39 - here we have made ourselves a dwarf
04:42 - penguin
04:44 - that looks pretty cool honestly and then
04:46 - i'll teach you how to make like some
04:48 - coloring schemes because you can be very
04:50 - creative with this if you have some free
04:52 - time like
04:53 - what if you want to make a uh i don't
04:56 - know superman superman
04:59 - super penguin see look you can be very
05:02 - creative with this and make some good
05:04 - designs and
05:06 - you can send me the projects on my
05:08 - account dumbbell

05:29 - like this one
05:30 - like what i did red penguin
05:33 - iced penguin evil penguin
05:37 - reverse penguin so there's a lot of
05:39 - possibilities you can make future
05:40 - penguin actually spend a while on this
05:42 - one like a little lever
05:43 - three little buttons
05:45 - and like the buttons
05:47 - yeah actually a little drone and a
05:49 - little control panel so ammo propeller
