00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:08 - playground here
00:09 - today we'll be working on another python
00:11 - tutorial on shrinky.io
00:13 - so we're going to be working on a rock
00:14 - paper scissors game so before we begin i
00:17 - would like to
00:18 - demonstrate the game so let's run it so
00:21 - in the beginning it'll say
00:22 - welcome to rock paper scissors and
00:24 - choose rock paper scissors okay i'm just
00:26 - gonna choose bra
00:28 - okay rock okay you choose rock
00:31 - you chose rock computer chooses rock we
00:33 - drew so we drew the game
00:36 - so if you if you don't type a valid
00:37 - answer like
00:39 - if you don't type either of these like
00:41 - rock paper scissors like
00:42 - let's say you just type this or
00:43 - something oh just ask the question again
00:46 - it'll just keep on asking the question
00:48 - until you answer one of the valid
00:49 - questions
00:51 - okay so i'm just gonna show one more
00:54 - time let's see if i can win this time
00:56 - scissors okay so the computer won this
01:00 - time since i picked scissors and the
01:02 - computer chose rock
01:03 - okay let's see if i can win paper
01:07 - because we drew okay i'm going to try it
01:09 - one more time i'll just show you we drew
01:12 - okay i guess we can do it okay finally i
01:15 - won so i use paper
01:17 - and computers rock so i won okay so now
01:20 - let's get on to the project so
01:22 - just a quick reminder on trinket.eo just
01:25 - click new trinket
01:26 - python 3 and then you get the
01:29 - new project so i'm going to rename it
01:33 - to rock paper scissors
01:36 - um and then we're going to i'm just
01:39 - going to make this
01:40 - text a bit bigger so you guys can see it
01:42 - better
01:43 - so at first we're going to import the
01:45 - random thing
01:46 - import random this is a
01:50 - a library so we're going to import the
01:52 - random let's go down like two lines
01:54 - okay so we're gonna define a variable
01:57 - called items
01:58 - so we're gonna make items is rock paper
02:01 - and scissors so we're gonna
02:03 - items is equal to brackets
02:07 - um this i'm gonna put them on all caps
02:10 - okay
02:11 - rock comma another quote
02:15 - paper comma quotes
02:18 - and and look at scissors caps
02:24 - okay scissors all right i'm going to add
02:29 - semicolon is optional so this right here
02:31 - is called arraylist
02:33 - so we just made an arraylist for okay
02:36 - and then next we're gonna
02:37 - make a welcome message okay so we're
02:38 - gonna do prints
02:41 - prints oops uh print
02:44 - welcome so i'm gonna put quotes welcome
02:47 - to
02:48 - rock paper scissors
02:51 - so game okay so that's what i'm gonna
02:54 - put right here
02:56 - a little welcome message and then now
02:59 - we're gonna do this player
03:01 - is equal to this
03:05 - so what this means is um in the
03:08 - beginning and how in scratch we set the
03:10 - variable to a blank
03:12 - string that's what we're doing right
03:13 - here we're just setting it to blank
03:15 - until they enter something so we're
03:16 - going to set the player to blank
03:19 - so the player thing is basically the
03:21 - choice the player makes like rock paper
03:23 - scissors
03:25 - okay next we're going to make a loop
03:28 - so while
03:32 - player not in items so
03:35 - if it's not in the items then we are
03:38 - going to do this
03:39 - so after this you need a colon and then
03:42 - enter
03:42 - so this is a loop then player
03:46 - is equal to the input
03:49 - and then put uh quote uh parentheses
03:53 - and then we're going to ask choose rock
03:55 - papers or scissors so
03:57 - after this we're going to make ask them
03:59 - if they want to choose rock paper or
04:01 - scissors so
04:02 - we're gonna choose
04:06 - paper or scissors
04:10 - okay and then we're gonna do upper so
04:15 - it will make the whenever you
04:18 - choose an answer it will make the rock
04:20 - paper scissors uppercase so you can
04:22 - easily
04:23 - identify which one is which okay
04:28 - we are going to print
04:31 - so after they are done choosing we're
04:33 - going to print
04:34 - you choose
04:38 - you chose um you chose
04:42 - player so we're going to do a call
04:46 - i mean oops a um
04:49 - comma and then we're going to write
04:50 - player so that's what the player chose
04:54 - and like that okay so you chose
04:57 - player so it's going to print whatever
04:59 - you chose
05:01 - and then next we're going to do computer
05:04 - so we're going to find another variable
05:05 - so this is going to be called computer
05:07 - this is basically what the computer
05:08 - chooses item
05:12 - um in our last python tutorial we did
05:14 - random
05:15 - pick random stuff so we're going to do
05:16 - it in here as well random.randint
05:21 - and then we're going to put parentheses
05:23 - 0
05:24 - to 2. so we're doing zero to 2 because
05:27 - in python they start in zero
05:29 - and there's three items rock paper and
05:31 - scissors so we're going to do 0
05:32 - 1 0 1 2 those are all the
05:36 - different items so zero to two pick
05:37 - random
05:39 - okay and after this we're going to print
05:43 - um computer chooses the computer
05:47 - whatever this variable is
05:50 - basically computer choice computer
05:53 - chooses
05:56 - and then we're gonna put a comma
06:00 - computer okay
06:04 - okay next we're gonna add the rules so
06:07 - like which one beats which like rock
06:10 - paper scissors
06:11 - and stuff like that like rocks beats
06:13 - scissors paper beats
06:14 - rock scissors beat paper also be sure to
06:17 - add an s as you can see right here i did
06:19 - not i forgot to add an s
06:21 - items so as you can see right here i
06:24 - define
06:24 - item as with the s so i forgot to add an
06:28 - s right here so be sure to match this
06:30 - items
06:31 - with this one so has to be the same
06:33 - thing or it'll error out
06:35 - as you saw right there so be make sure
06:37 - to be the same and then after that we
06:39 - can
06:39 - work on the rules so rules equals we're
06:43 - different brackets
06:45 - um okay so this is like a map key
06:48 - um a variable uh value pair so
06:52 - we're like we did in the turtle race so
06:54 - we're going to
06:56 - do rock colon
07:00 - rock colon
07:02 - scissors so this means rock can beat
07:06 - scissors
07:08 - comma quotation marks paper
07:13 - colon rock so this
07:16 - paper can be rock and finally we have
07:21 - scissors
07:24 - colon paper
07:28 - okay and then we're gonna
07:31 - close it off and semicolon
07:34 - okay so after this we are going to make
07:37 - an if
07:38 - statement so if
07:41 - player okay so if the player selects the
07:45 - same thing
07:45 - as the computer
07:50 - so if the player selects the same thing
07:52 - as the computer
07:54 - then we are going to
07:57 - um enter and then we're gonna write
07:59 - prince
08:01 - we drew because they select the same
08:04 - thing so no one wins it's a draw
08:06 - okay and then next else if
08:10 - else if rules
08:14 - is player okay so i'll explain this in a
08:17 - minute
08:17 - hold on let me finish this so the
08:20 - computer
08:23 - i will explain this in a sec and
08:26 - prince you won so let me explain this
08:31 - you win okay
08:35 - so what this means is let's say the
08:38 - computer
08:39 - picks rock uh scissors okay
08:43 - so i just said um the computer let's say
08:46 - the computer picks scissors
08:48 - and the player picks rock so we're going
08:50 - to go back in here and look for it so
08:52 - if the rules the player is scissors
08:56 - and is equal to the computer which is
08:57 - scissors that means the player picked
08:59 - rock which
09:00 - meaning the rock will beat the scissors
09:03 - so right here we have
09:05 - um so computer picks let's try this one
09:08 - so
09:08 - rock the computer picks rock the player
09:11 - picks paper
09:13 - so we're going to go back in find if
09:15 - this thing
09:16 - the key is equal key value so the rock
09:20 - if it's equal to the computer that means
09:22 - that the player must depict paper
09:24 - beating the computer
09:26 - okay so else if it's not like this then
09:29 - we will
09:31 - make the player lose going to print
09:36 - computer wins
09:43 - all right we'll save it
09:46 - now let's run the code so
09:49 - welcome to rock paper scissors game
09:51 - choose rock paper scissors choose rock
09:54 - so i choose rock computer chooses rock
09:56 - so we drew
09:57 - so as you can see it's working let's try
09:59 - it one more time
10:00 - scissors so it's kind of like luck base
10:04 - so
10:05 - computer shows scissors i'm trying to
10:06 - find one where i win
10:08 - paper i guess the computer's choosing
10:11 - the same thing as me
10:15 - scissors it's kind of luck based
10:20 - uh let me okay as you can see i i picked
10:24 - rock computer choose scissors so
10:26 - therefore i win okay and vice versa if i
10:30 - pick scissors and the computer just rock
10:32 - then i would lose
10:34 - so that is pretty much the game
10:37 - i hope you guys enjoyed this mini rock
