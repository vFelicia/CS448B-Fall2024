00:01 - [Music]
00:08 - alright guys welcome back to the channel
00:10 - again two kids coding playground so
00:13 - today will continue while walking on
00:15 - this scratch tutorial platform game so
00:19 - this game basically you control this
00:22 - little sprite year and you jump around
00:24 - collecting the gym and what where we
00:28 - left off last time was we created these
00:30 - simulated gravity and getting stuck
00:33 - again those two custom block where you
00:36 - know when the player start what we want
00:39 - to do and you know keep making a player
00:43 - fall down to the ground so that's what
00:44 - we did so today we'll continue working
00:48 - on this too or make the play open so we
00:52 - already have the custom and loaded to my
00:54 - sprite so we loaded all the running
00:57 - jumping sliding right so we'll be using
01:01 - these custom so how do we do that
01:03 - we already created our variable last
01:06 - time so these are the variable we're
01:08 - fall speed jump costume index jump speed
01:13 - run custom index and run speed and then
01:16 - the score so these are the variable
01:19 - we'll be using let's put this all with
01:21 - you okay alright so before I begin the
01:25 - lesson please like share subscribe to
01:28 - our channel and bring the notification
01:30 - Bell to get all the latest update from
01:32 - this channel and now you know anyone who
01:34 - is interested please share our channel
01:37 - with them alright okay when we left off
01:40 - last time was the we're gonna make the
01:43 - ninja I mean not a ninja the treasure
01:45 - hunter sprite runs around and jump jump
01:49 - today okay what we need to do is
01:53 - similarly we have the similar gravity
01:55 - with dip and a new block so doing this
01:59 - kind of work doing the block create a
02:02 - new block define the block is actually
02:03 - good way to do programming this way you
02:06 - can separate your method this is called
02:09 - a kind of method
02:10 - right so you separate all your logic
02:12 - into one method or one block and you can
02:16 - reuse that block later on if you're
02:17 - doing a more complex game so that way
02:20 - you don't have to move things around
02:21 - within the you know all the start script
02:24 - for all the loops inside here so you
02:27 - know you separate out it's a little bit
02:29 - cleaner so instead we put all this thing
02:31 - inside here it's hard to see what's
02:33 - going on right
02:33 - okay so we'll walk on the run block so
02:36 - what we do is we pull the corner to run
02:39 - intro so basically this will control how
02:42 - the player run ok we'll move this block
02:46 - to the bottom on a scroll down a little
02:48 - bit okay
02:51 - all right what we want to do is we're
02:54 - gonna check the index so on because if
02:58 - the running index is more than 901 go
03:02 - back to 0 basically when we have 9
03:04 - costume with the running index right so
03:06 - you have 0 all the way up to number 9
03:10 - right as you can see room number 9 right
03:13 - here right so that's what we can focus
03:15 - on ok unitive brain is operated out so
03:21 - what we go to say is if the running
03:27 - index running custom index is greater
03:33 - than 9 so we will set it back to 0 okay
03:42 - all right so this is the first thing
03:44 - this block will do you would if this
03:46 - being called check the index and all
03:48 - seven back to 0 this is a greater than 9
03:51 - ok next we'll check will say if ok and
04:02 - then we have a user sensing so we're
04:04 - going to tell what kind of what key the
04:08 - user clicked on right here
04:11 - ok so we click on the left arrow key
04:15 - what we want to do is we're gonna turn
04:17 - the player around
04:19 - you will say coin and direction negative
04:21 - 90 okay
04:24 - or you can drag that little circle or
04:26 - you can just type it in like that and
04:28 - what we're going to do we're gonna move
04:31 - and we're gonna we are going to use a
04:34 - variable yes we have already fine I'll
04:36 - run the speed which is then we can put
04:38 - it in here so I use a variable that way
04:41 - you know you want to change it slower
04:42 - faster you can change that and then what
04:45 - we're going to do change the costume
04:47 - okay so just like what we did for the
04:51 - ninja game if you don't know that's fine
04:55 - if your first time watching this video
04:56 - that's also fine sort of thing what we
04:59 - want to do is we want to get the costume
05:01 - so we have run right so let's look at
05:04 - our costume for run so you go down here
05:07 - to run you see that run we don't have to
05:11 - rename it if we don't want to what I'm
05:13 - going to do is I'm gonna copy just this
05:16 - first part here okay I'm gonna play in
05:19 - this joint so we'll be running on this
05:21 - one score 0 0 ok and this one will put
05:24 - the index in there the running custom
05:28 - index ok so that will change based on
05:31 - that will be run 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 3 and
05:35 - so on and so forth and we are going to
05:37 - change this by 1 okay all right so we
05:44 - have the left arrow done what we can do
05:47 - is duplicate this and we are going to do
05:51 - the right arrow
05:54 - okay so right arrow similar right arrow
05:57 - weather point 90 right so we'll delete
05:59 - that make sure it goes to 90 and more
06:02 - than speed same thing we're gonna use
06:04 - the run index ending and then this
06:06 - change by 1 also okay so let's test it
06:10 - out so just pay attention to this run
06:12 - indexes will change when I start moving
06:14 - so you can see oh I forgot to call it
06:18 - right ok my back
06:20 - ok so we have not called this right so
06:23 - we make sure we want to call the the
06:26 - call right you don't call the call
06:28 - you're not gonna what
06:29 - so let's take a look back a little bit
06:32 - and see where we are
06:33 - okay we have this we can use that what
06:36 - you can do is you can use both to work
06:38 - them together I think we can put it in I
06:40 - think maybe fine sometimes you know they
06:43 - do have problem with you have more than
06:44 - one of these things inside forever loop
06:46 - if you have a more complex code then you
06:48 - to split split away so now I added this
06:51 - run control P calling a forever loop so
06:54 - we'll keep on checking what we are going
06:56 - to do so that's it laughs you can see
06:59 - right kind of thing
07:04 - so when let me run this we can see it is
07:08 - channel table see some time doesn't work
07:11 - correctly or laggy so I would say I
07:13 - think when we were trying earlier was
07:15 - still kind of lagging because of this
07:17 - forever loop point two different sets of
07:19 - functions some time has happened so what
07:22 - I will suggest is break this in half so
07:24 - don't do this so you will just call one
07:27 - thing or the other stuff similar gravity
07:31 - right so let's say let me try to cannot
07:33 - just show to you so let me say run
07:36 - control here I'll stop it some time it
07:40 - does have this little lock you see kind
07:41 - of like Caliban Jana nobody lagging
07:44 - right so that that has that problem but
07:47 - if you break this in into to watch me
07:49 - walk a lot better so we'll throw this
07:52 - away
07:52 - I'll put this here so we'll only use the
07:55 - so two of them over when we're doing at
07:58 - the same time so different thread I
08:00 - guess if you would look at the
08:02 - programming concept so there's two
08:03 - different things doing here so I think
08:05 - this will run more smoothly you see see
08:07 - a lot more smooth alright with this
08:09 - person money so one thing is you see how
08:12 - this person running at everyone is
08:13 - running when I stop the key kind of gets
08:16 - stuck in this position right so what we
08:18 - can do is we can fix this a bit so we
08:22 - can kind of make the the you know the
08:26 - sprite can stand back on the original
08:29 - form so there's not moving or something
08:31 - so we have to make it look like it's you
08:34 - know standing back so what we can do is
08:36 - you can do this
08:37 - I'll stop this so you get this when
08:41 - stock is clean you can get it for you or
08:46 - loop again
08:47 - and then you can get it if statement
08:50 - here and what you want to do is you want
08:54 - to check if there's any key press ok
08:57 - we're gonna use all in operator and we
09:02 - have to take a not so we say if it's key
09:07 - press the UST TTT yeah key press that's
09:12 - any any yeah right here so if there's no
09:15 - key pressed or not any key press minnow
09:18 - key press and what to check the fall
09:21 - speed as well because the one make sure
09:25 - that okay there's no key press and he's
09:27 - actually on the floor right we won't
09:30 - change a custom if he's jumping in the
09:32 - air then we don't want chain him to
09:33 - straight custom than coming down right
09:35 - so that's why we need to check this fall
09:37 - speed so what we do is we take this fall
09:41 - speed and we take the variable fall
09:47 - speed here if it's less than zero
09:49 - meaning he dropped all the way to the
09:50 - ground then we will switch to costume or
09:56 - switch to costume the idol of stone okay
09:59 - so now let's try it again so if we were
10:03 - running around you we stop yes we can
10:05 - see he changed it back to the I go
10:07 - costume so he doesn't get like a stuck
10:09 - in there
10:10 - you know how how he kind of move and it
10:12 - got stuck right so as you can see change
10:14 - back to this original standing costume
10:17 - that's what we want okay all right so
10:20 - we're done with that piece so we got the
10:23 - ninja running right he's running fine
10:26 - going across right but the co here this
10:29 - is all running go again let's take a
10:31 - look so this is our running code okay
10:34 - alright so we want to make the jumping
10:37 - cop so for the ninja we want to make him
10:39 - jump as well right so what we can do is
10:42 - we thought did find another block
10:46 - we call it jump rope so this is the rock
10:51 - this is the method and you could say
10:53 - custom method a custom block and
10:55 - programming so this will help the player
10:58 - to jump so same thing similarly when we
11:02 - start we want to set the the jump this
11:07 - is a jump custom index to zero and since
11:10 - our custom for jump we have ten ten of
11:13 - them right you can see John 0 jump 0 0 0
11:16 - - John 0 0 9 9 so which is 10 time so
11:21 - what we can do is go after code we are
11:24 - going to use a repeat rate repeat 10
11:27 - times right here and what we can do is
11:31 - we can switch to costume
11:33 - Mizanin Lopez I think I can see switch
11:37 - to costume so what do you think where
11:40 - they do so whether form some kind of
11:43 - expression like this right so we need to
11:46 - use the one in the join right join
11:48 - condition here so joining two things so
11:51 - we go back to our costume I like to copy
11:53 - and paste in server typing at some three
11:56 - mistis then it will be wrong
11:58 - so I copy and paste I put it in here
12:00 - which have no space it's jump underscore
12:03 - underscore 0 0 0 array 0 0 and what we
12:07 - need is the index right the the jump
12:11 - costume index here which is 0 in the
12:13 - beginning ok next what we can do is we
12:18 - are going to increase the John costume
12:21 - by 1 so it was the second custom look
12:25 - and feel and what we also need to do we
12:29 - can make the custom this unit this
12:32 - character here come on when it jumps and
12:35 - landed kind of balance it out so what we
12:38 - can do is we will use a change Y sorry
12:44 - got the wrong one or say change Y by
12:47 - minus 1 okay and then
12:55 - we have if so we have they have a
12:59 - customer a of touching platform okay
13:06 - similarly you I think we already had
13:08 - some coherent copy from right here okay
13:11 - duplicate this all right let me put it
13:14 - here or drag it down over here so it was
13:18 - touching a platform and it's touching
13:20 - this a cream color right then what we
13:23 - want to do is we will set the fall speed
13:28 - to the jump speed so basically it is
13:31 - actually on the floor then we are
13:33 - letting jump on the platform if he's in
13:36 - the midday HRH um again will not allow
13:37 - them to jump so no double jump but we
13:40 - can make in that that's double jump that
13:41 - will be a later time we can try that but
13:43 - for now there's no double jump so that's
13:46 - why we want to make sure that he is
13:47 - actually on the platform before he makes
13:49 - the job and then we can add the change
13:54 - the Y again I plus one kind of just
13:58 - balance it now so that it'll look a
14:01 - little bit better when it's jump okay
14:03 - let's try it try what we had so as you
14:05 - can see he runs around oh we forgot
14:09 - haha okay I forgot to code it the the
14:12 - code for John right so we haven't call
14:14 - anything so what we need to do is we
14:16 - will actually have to call this function
14:18 - I have keep on forgetting hmm that's bad
14:21 - okay so what we want to do we want the
14:23 - up arrow key to jump right so we can say
14:28 - go to this event so when when space key
14:33 - press R instead that went up arrow press
14:35 - and what we want to do we're gonna call
14:38 - this jump control so every time the
14:40 - arrow keys press it will call this
14:42 - function here okay now let's see how it
14:46 - goes save it let's run it again so if I
14:52 - jump you see whoa he's jumping really
14:54 - high coming back down it's like just
14:59 - don't get crazy so
15:02 - okay all right let me check our own on
18:06 - [Applause]
18:39 - okay um I think there's something wrong
18:42 - here instead of exchange why I had set
18:44 - y21 so died trying to mess them up okay
18:48 - we have to say change Y by on so that
18:52 - says we've been very careful when you're
18:54 - making the code change sometime you know
18:57 - you just mistake that set Y and change Y
18:59 - you can see the wrong one and you pull
19:01 - it and you get some issue so now let's
19:03 - try so what we had let's see we'll start
19:07 - again so you can see jumping yep he is
19:10 - fine his jumping time so he is fine
19:16 - right yep yep you can jump on top you
19:21 - can jump over here so as you can see
19:23 - there's the that's this little thing you
19:27 - see how are you falling like this so we
19:30 - can try to fix that let's see if we can
19:31 - fix that a little bit better let me take
19:34 - out something variable here jump index
19:37 - speed we'll take out these I think we're
19:40 - pretty good with that so that we have
19:42 - more space you see so what we can do is
19:44 - we can add something in here so what
19:48 - this condition here what I'm going to do
19:50 - is add this before this so um if he's
19:54 - hitting this blue but I'm in this brown
19:57 - color will make him go back down so what
19:59 - we can do is do this right you click on
20:02 - this droplet and you can get this blue
20:05 - brown color here so that way let's let's
20:08 - see if this is better so let's see so we
20:13 - are
20:13 - oops
20:20 - so I can take this out right now let's
20:23 - see how it behaved and also I'll make
20:26 - sure that your your blog can't run
20:28 - without our screen refresh it's really
20:31 - important so will not be lag no lags on
20:35 - that so change really quickly so through
20:37 - that same thing for this run control as
20:40 - well as this jump control so make sure
20:42 - you have this checked they fall is not
20:44 - checked just make sure you check it run
20:46 - what else will refresh and also one more
20:50 - thing here this fall's mean don't say 0
20:54 - less than 0 let's say less than 1 let's
20:56 - do that because sometimes the false
20:58 - Peaks would be 0 minus 0 minus 1 so
21:01 - let's let's try it again now so this one
21:05 - will come up blocks and we can't jump on
21:07 - top of that so I so now I'm the - I can
21:12 - either change the platform just adjust
21:14 - your platform so that way you know he's
21:16 - so stable to get up there or you're the
21:18 - changed here so what you call it change
21:21 - the height that Jeong Jeong speed so
21:24 - what we can do is move this come on
21:27 - platform back down a little bit let's
21:29 - stop this thing so it just kind of just
21:34 - sit accordingly to the character let's
21:37 - just try now let's see if it's better we
21:40 - should you go back to the co if not you
21:42 - stop moving it'll move the platform okay
21:44 - let's try it again
21:45 - let's run this so we can jump up no yep
21:51 - spine won't fix the tree on top so can't
21:56 - jump up so so when you see this one when
22:00 - it jump it come up it kind of go through
22:02 - here because what happened is is
22:04 - checking abyss touching this cream color
22:06 - or not if it's not either moving up down
22:09 - so what we can do is add this back in
22:12 - here let's put that in here ok now let's
22:15 - try it again so make sure that does not
22:17 - happen ok so you see you cannot you
22:21 - cannot jump up like that so it's kind of
22:24 - pushing back down takes a little fast
22:28 - let's try okay okay so what justice
22:41 - actually because this is too high on
22:44 - here that's why that is not working okay
22:48 - so we're gonna try to adjust a platform
22:50 - once more to make it a little bit better
22:52 - okay oh there's ninja out of the way the
22:58 - platform up a little bit oops
23:08 - okay okay
23:14 - all right let's save it let's go to the
23:18 - coal let's move to push down a little
23:21 - bit okay and let's go back to the ninja
23:24 - let's try it again okay so it cannot
23:30 - jump on top okay yeah sometime you know
23:43 - they do have that small issue so we try
23:49 - to use that code of block and thumb
23:51 - jumping on top like that I think
23:54 - initially my game was working I don't
23:56 - know why thing here I think it because
23:58 - of this tree sometime it doesn't see
24:01 - that that's why okay alright so we have
24:06 - the basic of the ninja walking running
24:09 - around and jumping so we'll stop the
24:12 - video here and next one we'll walk on
24:15 - the sliding the ninja getting this gym
24:17 - okay thank you for watching see you guys
24:21 - next time
24:22 - [Music]
