00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to
00:09 - kids quoting playground and today we'll
00:11 - be doing a project
00:13 - called cat in the basketball we will be
00:15 - learning these following concepts in
00:17 - scratch
00:18 - broadcast messages touching sprites of
00:20 - sensing
00:21 - use pick random motion slash movement
00:24 - and
00:24 - key press and sprite on click
00:30 - so cat and basketball today we will work
00:33 - on this project
00:34 - this is how the layout looks like
00:37 - so this is our new project first of all
00:39 - we need to rename the project to
00:42 - cat and a basketball
00:46 - then we can rename the cat from sprite
00:49 - one to cat
00:52 - and then we'll need to get a bunch of
00:54 - sprites
00:56 - start from the basketball sprite
00:59 - then we need to get the c-a-t
01:03 - letters we need the letter c
01:08 - letter a and the letter t
01:21 - t okay
01:26 - and we also need a backdrop we might
01:29 - choose a basketball backdrop
01:33 - okay so now we need to put the
01:36 - cat up here cat
01:41 - so first we'll start out with the code
01:43 - for c okay
01:45 - so you need to do a one on click when
01:48 - this
01:49 - flag is clicked then we'll need
01:52 - we'll need to go to this position
01:56 - negative 119 130 then
01:59 - we will go when sprite clicked
02:03 - we need the one sprite click so that
02:05 - means if the c button
02:07 - is pressed then we will glide somewhere
02:09 - down here
02:11 - so as you can see this changed so we
02:14 - will apply
02:14 - probably three seconds
02:18 - three seconds to this position we can
02:20 - wait one second
02:22 - so it stays down there for one second
02:24 - then we'll move back
02:26 - up to this position right here
02:31 - maybe another three seconds we need a
02:35 - distance negative 119 and 130.
02:41 - then finally we might want to make the
02:44 - letter c
02:44 - change color so we can go to events
02:49 - and then click on the when space
02:52 - key press then you can change the color
02:55 - effect by 25
02:57 - change color effect by 25 so now we have
03:01 - the c button done
03:03 - now let's head on to the a button
03:06 - so for the a button when clicked we want
03:09 - to go to this position
03:13 - 7 126
03:16 - and then we need to when the sprite
03:19 - clicked
03:20 - we want to glide two seconds
03:23 - to maybe somewhere down here
03:26 - so when this break is clicked then we'll
03:30 - might glide somewhere down here how
03:32 - about that
03:34 - so we collide maybe two seconds instead
03:40 - to this position wait one second
03:44 - then we can glide back to the home
03:47 - position
03:56 - we this is all for the a the a sprite
04:00 - now we will head on to the t sprite okay
04:05 - so when the space bar is clicked
04:08 - we want to turn right 90 degrees so
04:14 - it'll just turn right 90 degrees if you
04:16 - click on
04:18 - spacebar and change color by 25
04:22 - and we always want to set the position
04:26 - to where i replaced it so in this case
04:29 - the position is 111
04:32 - 127 okay so now
04:35 - if you run it and click on c it glides
04:38 - down here
04:40 - and it will glide back up
04:44 - now if you press space bar this one turn
04:47 - they both turn
04:48 - change color and the t rotates
04:52 - by 90 degrees if you press the a it
04:55 - glides down
04:56 - and glides back up
05:01 - so this is how we do the animation for
05:03 - the cat
05:04 - letters and next i'll be moving on to
05:08 - the basketball and the cat
05:12 - please like share and subscribe
05:15 - and ring the notification bell to
05:17 - receive the latest updates from this
05:19 - channel
05:22 - so now we will be working on the cat and
05:24 - the basketball so first we'll start out
05:26 - with the cat
05:28 - so first of all we need a one click
05:32 - we want the cat to be somewhere right
05:34 - here maybe
05:36 - so we want to go to right here
05:40 - and then we want to repeat until
05:42 - touching the basketball
05:45 - so then when it touches it it will make
05:47 - the basketball bounce all around
05:52 - basketball yes and it will move 10 steps
05:56 - that means i'll move 10 steps every time
05:59 - next costume it'll make it look like
06:01 - it's running
06:03 - and wait 0.1 seconds so it looks more
06:06 - realistic
06:07 - and it won't keep on going very fast
06:11 - it'll have like a short pause we'll
06:13 - broadcast a message
06:15 - called kick and we'll and the basketball
06:18 - will receive the message kick
06:21 - so then next we will be going onto the
06:25 - basketball
06:26 - so the basketball will receive the
06:29 - message kick
06:32 - and we also need to set its position
06:35 - so first we need a one flag clicked then
06:37 - we might want to move
06:39 - the basketball somewhere maybe
06:42 - right here and then we
06:46 - find this and then now we can
06:50 - work on the kick function the
06:53 - broadcast message so we want it to turn
06:58 - pick random negative 180 to 180 degrees
07:03 - so it'll pick a random degree in between
07:07 - that range to 180
07:12 - and we want a forever loop and forever
07:14 - loop means everything inside will repeat
07:16 - forever
07:17 - until the stop button is pressed
07:20 - next we want to put a move 10 steps so
07:23 - it'll make like the bouncing effect
07:26 - and if on edge bounce that means if it's
07:28 - on the edge it'll keep on bouncing
07:30 - and we can add change color effect by 25
07:34 - it'll make the basketball change colors
07:38 - so finally now we can play it all
07:42 - together
07:46 - see now the basketball is bouncing
07:48 - around you press the c
07:51 - it moves down there comes back
07:55 - you press the spacebar they change color
07:58 - and this one rotates by 90 degrees
08:01 - press a the a goes down here
08:04 - and goes back up
08:08 - so thank you for watching guys and see
08:11 - you guys next time
08:26 - you
