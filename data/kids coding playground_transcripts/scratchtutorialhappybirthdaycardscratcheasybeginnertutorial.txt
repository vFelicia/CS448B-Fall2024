00:07 - welcome back guys in today's another
00:09 - kids covered in playground video and
00:11 - today we will be doing another special
00:13 - one of the special series videos so
00:17 - today we will be working on a project
00:20 - called the happy birthday card it's
00:23 - featuring projects for kids like you you
00:26 - can send projects to us and then we can
00:28 - teach you a tutorial in our channel we
00:31 - will also give you details on how to
00:33 - submit your project later so then you
00:35 - can give it to us and we can make a
00:37 - small tutorial today we will be
00:39 - featuring a project my little cousin did
00:41 - named jaylen he he started scratch
00:45 - following our channel last week so that
00:48 - we so he made a happy birthday card for
00:50 - me I am very proud of him so he did a
00:54 - really good job so let's jump into the
00:57 - video so we will be learning these
01:01 - following concepts in the this is our
01:04 - first video of patience projects from
01:06 - the kids IQ series so this is the
01:09 - birthday card my cousin jaylen made for
01:11 - me we are learning these concepts in
01:13 - scratch repeat until hi special place
01:16 - out it should be really easy for
01:18 - beginners and yes so it's like about
01:25 - this so I put it under score for
01:28 - whatever name you could put there and
01:34 - the birthday sound and there's a party
01:39 - background so the balloons will pop when
01:46 - they get up there you have to learn the
01:49 - song ends candles will be blown out so
01:55 - let's jump right into it let's start
02:00 - with the cake so if the flag is clicked
02:03 - it'll switch the costume to cake a place
02:07 - our birthday that's making the sound
02:09 - switch costume to cake because there's
02:11 - two costumes for the cake
02:12 - the one with the candles and one without
02:14 - the candles now let's move on to sprite
02:17 - one which is basically happy birthday
02:18 - spray will repeat eight times change
02:21 - color effect by 25 and I'll wait one
02:23 - second and the balloon code so if flag
02:28 - clicked oh sure that means you can see
02:30 - it it'll set X so negative 186 set Y to
02:34 - negative 38 yeah Oh show from the
02:37 - beginning so repeat 90 times change Y by
02:40 - 2 if Y position is more than 130 then
02:47 - we'll start the sound plot and no hot so
02:53 - the repeat 90 is for like if it's like
02:57 - right here that means they'll keep on
03:00 - moving up so let's repeat 90 times
03:03 - that's 90 times so if it's lower if it's
03:06 - lower it will repeat more if it's higher
03:08 - it will repeat less so that's what I
03:11 - basically means so there's a lot of ways
03:15 - you can do this and there's another way
03:18 - that's easier than repeating 90 times in
03:20 - the Y position things yes awesome
03:24 - we will work on that when we get to our
03:26 - project so let's make a new project
03:31 - let's start so i zoomed in a little bit
03:35 - let's get the cake sprite let's get the
03:37 - sprites first and then let's get the
03:39 - background so let's get the cake sprite
03:42 - and let's get the the balloons right
03:49 - we need three balloon three right there
03:58 - so we need three balloons we need to
04:02 - make a sprite when you paint the sprite
04:04 - so we can do this text okay happy
04:27 - so let's check increase the size of this
04:31 - cell a little bit too big so I think we
04:41 - can - some underscores so it isn't that
04:44 - big I think a little bigger will do it
04:52 - so that's about the middle let's get our
04:55 - backdrop the party backdrop and let's
05:01 - start coding so we gotta set the size to
05:04 - 200 before we start so then the cake is
05:07 - or bigger and then if start when the
05:13 - green flag is clicked those switch
05:16 - costume to cake a cuz that's the one
05:20 - with the candle so if you can see it
05:22 - better that's the one with the candles
05:25 - and then it will then it was good so
05:31 - we'll be learning sounds so there's a
05:33 - birthday sound right here right here so
05:37 - let's take the sound play sound birthday
05:40 - until done and then switch costume to
05:43 - cake because that's when it lights out
05:45 - the candles that's when someone blows
05:49 - out the candles so the happy birthday
05:53 - name this thing so we can rename it to
05:56 - birthday lame yeah and then we can flag
06:03 - clicked it will repeat eight times eight
06:11 - is a fine number because and it'll
06:15 - change color effect so change color if I
06:16 - eight times basically and we'll keep on
06:20 - blinking so wait one second so you'll
06:25 - have a recoil before it goes again or
06:28 - else it'll blink way too quickly just
06:31 - move on to the blue we're almost there
06:34 - so the balloon so we can change
06:37 - the costumes of some balloons so let's
06:40 - work on this one so let's if like licked
06:44 - its to mount one see if you can still
06:48 - see that so there's another way to do
06:50 - this we can show so when I set the set X
06:55 - the set X and the set Y thing you can
06:59 - use a go-to it's basically the same
07:01 - thing in two and then so let's try this
07:09 - a little bit down because the go to a
07:11 - little bit too up you can change the
07:13 - size let's say about 60 it's about the
07:17 - right size so there's a the other way
07:22 - that I was telling you you can repeat
07:24 - until instead of using repeat 90 times
07:27 - because you didn't you can always s you
07:30 - always have to estimate numbers but you
07:32 - can do a repeat until touching edge and
07:38 - then don't change Y by 2 so slowly go up
07:45 - and then know start the sound pump
07:51 - because it will make the sound when it
07:54 - touches the edge and then it will hide
07:58 - so this is the same code for all of them
08:01 - so we can another way you you don't have
08:06 - to duplicate this you can just drag it
08:08 - and then it can go up to here too and
08:14 - here so let let's change the size to 60
08:20 - again you can also change the color as
08:23 - well not around 90 size is 60 so we can
08:38 - you change the costumes you should
08:40 - adjust to the purple one this one to the
08:43 - yellow one we can move this one a little
08:45 - bit up this one
08:46 - a little bit like right here you can
08:48 - also do that you can take out this one
08:50 - and bring that one in and then you can
08:56 - take out this one and bring this one
09:01 - let's see how it goes as you can see the
09:05 - happy birthday thing is changing and
09:08 - then the dingoes won't light out and the
09:12 - song ended and then the balloons popped
09:14 - so that's the end of our video guys and
