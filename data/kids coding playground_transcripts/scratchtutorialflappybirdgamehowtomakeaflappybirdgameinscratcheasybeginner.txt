00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - today we'll be making a flappy bird game
00:12 - so we're going to be making a simple
00:14 - flappy bird engine and i'll be trying to
00:16 - do this as fast as i can
00:18 - it i can probably do it in under 10
00:20 - minutes this is a really simple flappy
00:22 - bird game
00:23 - um so we'll be learning these following
00:25 - concepts in scratch
00:26 - we're going to be using keys to control
00:28 - the sprites uh custom block
00:30 - broadcasting messages and sensing blocks
00:32 - so we're gonna move on to the
00:34 - um demo so i'm gonna zoom in so
00:37 - you can either use a space bar clicking
00:40 - or up
00:40 - arrow to like
00:44 - you just dodge them and every three
00:45 - pipes you dodge you get three points
00:48 - i'm doing this because we have all three
00:50 - pipes in one costume
00:52 - [Music]
00:54 - and if you touch the top you lose if you
00:56 - touch the bottom you lose and if you
00:58 - touch a pipe
00:59 - you lose so yeah um so if you touch the
01:01 - top you lose
01:03 - you touch a pipe you lose and let's just
01:05 - fall and you lose so
01:07 - that's three ways to lose so yeah let's
01:10 - go so let's go
01:12 - um let's start a new project
01:15 - okay new projects
01:18 - okay so let's delete the scratch that
01:20 - will not need it so
01:21 - we're gonna um also rename this thing to
01:25 - flappy bird and
01:26 - i have i have uh every sprite
01:29 - uh in the backpack so if you want to
01:32 - download the sprites
01:34 - um just go to the link in the
01:36 - description in the google drive and
01:38 - you can just download it there um and
01:40 - we're still seeing a lot of messages
01:43 - on people of people um
01:46 - asking us for requests on the
01:49 - access for the game you actually do not
01:52 - need requests
01:52 - you just have to um use your own
01:54 - personal account to get into the google
01:56 - drive to download these sprites
01:58 - so we have the pipes flappy bird ground
02:00 - and loose
02:01 - so you lose you can just draw yourself
02:03 - so right now we're gonna do
02:04 - a backdrop i have it uploaded right here
02:07 - so let's
02:07 - go to backdrops boom okay so let's
02:10 - delete this one
02:12 - okay so now let's go on to the code for
02:14 - the flappy bird
02:15 - so right now we're gonna make a new
02:16 - block let's name it fly
02:19 - so we're gonna name the new block fly
02:22 - and if we're gonna need
02:25 - two ores put an ore right there put an
02:27 - order right there if
02:29 - key space is being pressed
02:32 - oops if key space is pressed and
02:36 - or key up arrows press
02:40 - or mouse down
02:44 - then we're going to set we're going to
02:45 - make a new variable we're going to make
02:46 - a
02:47 - variable called speed y so
02:50 - let's set the speed y to 10
02:55 - and then we're going to make this and
02:56 - then after that we're gonna set the
02:58 - speed wide and negative two
03:00 - so like it will just keep on going down
03:01 - after we go up
03:03 - so oh change not sorry not set change
03:07 - the speed y under here speed y
03:10 - by negative two so that's the fall speed
03:13 - and then we're going to change the y
03:14 - by the speed y so just change the y by
03:17 - 10 basically
03:18 - so change the y by speed y
03:24 - and then we're going to get a one green
03:25 - flag clicks let's put that under here
03:27 - and zoom in a little bit
03:28 - um also i set it wrong so you're
03:31 - supposed to actually change it by
03:32 - negative two
03:33 - right here i actually accidentally said
03:35 - ten so
03:37 - so now let's get a one green flag
03:39 - clicked we're gonna go to negative 180
03:42 - y zero that's what we're going to do
03:44 - like somewhere right here
03:46 - and then we're going to wait 0.5 seconds
03:48 - just half a second before the game
03:50 - starts
03:50 - so like all the flappy bird will just be
03:52 - in place for like half a second
03:55 - and after that we're going to get a
03:56 - forever loop and call this function
03:59 - black and then after that we're going to
04:01 - get a one green flag clicked
04:05 - get a forever loop if
04:09 - if the touching edge uh
04:13 - touching right there if touching edge
04:16 - which means if it's touching the top
04:18 - edge then we're gonna broadcast a new
04:19 - message let's name it game over
04:22 - so this is an infinite game so you can't
04:24 - win
04:26 - so you can only lose um now let's go on
04:28 - to the pipes
04:30 - so for the pipes we're gonna get a one
04:31 - green flag clicked
04:34 - and in the costumes for the pipes i just
04:37 - um
04:37 - took this thing and then i just
04:40 - downloaded from online and i made three
04:42 - different things like here
04:43 - three different sets and i made them
04:45 - different elevations and then it's like
04:47 - a different difficulty so make it a
04:50 - little bit more variety in the game
04:53 - so after this we're gonna get make
04:55 - making new variables needed
04:56 - score and then we're going to set the
04:59 - score
05:00 - to zero in the beginning and then we're
05:03 - going to go to the back layer with
05:05 - the pipes go to back
05:08 - layer with the pipes and then we're
05:10 - going to get a go to
05:11 - go to 240 so like
05:14 - somewhere in here x is 240 and then
05:18 - we're going to pick random for the y
05:19 - position
05:20 - maybe pick random negative 20.
05:24 - negative 22 40.
05:27 - and then we're going to repeat until
05:30 - let's get it repeat until
05:32 - and then it's touching the flappy bird
05:35 - so this is a pipe
05:36 - it'll just repeat until it's touching
05:37 - the flappy board and then i'll move
05:39 - negative three steps
05:42 - so just move to the left and then if
05:47 - the x position is less than
05:52 - of the x position is less than
05:55 - the negative 450 so we're doing negative
05:58 - 450 because the end
05:59 - of this thing right here
06:03 - the last um um
06:06 - doesn't oh it's like if you end it at 2
06:08 - 4 negative 240
06:10 - it would just randomly glitch all the
06:12 - way right here so we don't want that we
06:14 - want all the pipes to
06:15 - finish at the end before moving so we're
06:16 - going to do negative 450
06:18 - and then after that we're going to get a
06:20 - go to so we're going to go to
06:24 - go to 450
06:27 - so the reset position after it's done
06:29 - will be like right here
06:31 - 450 uh pick random negative 20 to 40. so
06:36 - you just duplicate that
06:37 - and then um we're gonna change the score
06:39 - by three every three uh
06:42 - every three pipes you pass because it's
06:44 - one sprite we can't just do one
06:46 - for each so that's why we do three um
06:49 - and then after this we're gonna
06:51 - broadcast game over here and then for
06:54 - the ground
06:54 - let's go to the ground one green flag
06:57 - clicked we're gonna go
06:58 - to let's zoom in a little let's go to
07:01 - zero negative 210
07:02 - wait one second and then forever
07:07 - if the uh if touching flappy bird so if
07:11 - the ground
07:12 - is touching the flappy bird then we're
07:15 - gonna broadcast a message called game
07:17 - over
07:18 - uh and then after that we're gonna
07:22 - go to the lose so for the costumes is
07:24 - what i did
07:25 - i just got um two of these things i got
07:28 - from online
07:29 - and put them together so like there's
07:31 - one right here one right here
07:32 - so we put the link in the description
07:34 - and the google drive to download these
07:36 - so remember you can download these from
07:37 - the google drive so after that
07:40 - this is that this is the end so we're
07:41 - gonna get a one green flag clicked
07:44 - go to zero zero go to the front layer oh
07:47 - yeah i forgot to zoom in so you guys can
07:48 - see it better
07:50 - go to front layer and we're gonna hide
07:53 - and then after that we're gonna get a
07:55 - when i receive game over
07:57 - show and stop all
08:01 - alright so now we're finished let's demo
08:03 - the game
08:05 - okay so now let's go full screen so i'm
08:08 - just going to use the spacebar so as you
08:09 - can see the flappy bird is jumping
08:11 - and every three pipes you pass you'll
08:14 - get three points
08:15 - as you can see and you can
08:18 - even use the clicking you can even click
08:21 - with this
08:23 - you can even use the clicking settings
08:25 - oops accidentally clicked off the screen
08:27 - so
08:28 - it's glitching now let me refresh the
08:30 - page and we'll come back
08:32 - okay so now we refresh the page let's
08:34 - see
08:36 - so sometimes it will fall too fast and
08:39 - glitch
08:40 - a little bit um so you can add a little
08:42 - bit more wait time if you'd like
08:46 - right here so stop this you can add a
08:48 - little more wait time
08:49 - maybe let's add one second instead of
08:51 - 0.5
08:52 - so then now you have a little bit more
08:54 - wait time
08:56 - so yeah as you can see
08:59 - it's fully functioning
09:03 - and as you can see every time the pipes
09:05 - will change its position
09:07 - the y position
09:10 - so yeah that's pretty much the game
09:12 - flappy bird so thank you guys for
09:14 - watching
09:15 - don't forget to like share and subscribe
09:18 - and i'll see you guys in the next
09:19 - tutorial bye
