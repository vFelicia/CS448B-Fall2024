00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video
00:09 - on kids going to playground so this is
00:11 - going to be the part 3 for the rock
00:12 - blaster 2.0 game
00:14 - so before we start i'm going to review
00:16 - some code for the
00:17 - sprites so this is for the shopping cart
00:20 - so this is like
00:21 - for the moving side to side
00:24 - when you put your mouse pointer on it
00:26 - it'll get bigger
00:28 - this is uh when i receive open shop then
00:30 - it'll stop everything in here
00:32 - so for the rocks same as almost the same
00:36 - as last time we just added the if then
00:38 - touching laser
00:39 - then change the money by 100 and go back
00:41 - to here and then starts our magic spell
00:44 - and then um player same thing just the
00:47 - movement
00:48 - and this broadcast start game and then
00:50 - for the laser
00:51 - we just did this in the last video uh
00:54 - when i receive start game
00:55 - this is just for the shooting when when
00:58 - the space bar is pressed
00:59 - i can create a clone myself wait until
01:01 - not
01:02 - key space is pressed so then no one can
01:04 - spam the spacebar
01:06 - and then we have this one this is just
01:08 - to go to the player
01:10 - and if touching repeat until it's
01:12 - touching the edge
01:13 - okay and then this is just to set up for
01:15 - the laser
01:17 - and then the background backdrop will
01:20 - work on that today i think
01:22 - and then for the pause button when the p
01:24 - is pressed
01:25 - and if shop is equal to no in shop is
01:27 - equal to no
01:28 - that means the player's not in the shop
01:30 - then we'll show and broadcast pause game
01:33 - and of course not every uh sprite is
01:36 - paused right now
01:37 - because we have not done the code so we
01:39 - should work on that right now so let's
01:41 - go to the aliens and enemies
01:43 - actually you can rename the rocks to
01:44 - enemies so you guys won't get confused
01:47 - enemies and then um i'm gonna get uh
01:50 - when i receive
01:52 - when i receive a pause game
01:55 - then i'm going to stop other scripts in
01:57 - the sprite
02:01 - and then delete this clone so they'll
02:02 - delete all the clones
02:05 - from the aliens and the rocks and stuff
02:07 - like that so
02:08 - uh let's play it so i'll show you guys
02:11 - so when you press p
02:13 - then i'll delete the clones and it'll
02:14 - stop all the scripts
02:16 - in the sprite okay so now we have that
02:18 - done
02:19 - let's work more on the shopping cart
02:22 - actually no we finished the shopping
02:24 - cart sorry about that so we're gonna do
02:26 - the open shop let's go to the shop
02:27 - background right here i have it right
02:29 - here
02:30 - so when flag clicked i want to hide the
02:32 - shop background
02:34 - so this shop background will only show
02:36 - up when you're inside the shop
02:38 - and then when i receive start game
02:42 - start game then i want to hide
02:45 - so in the beginning we always want to
02:47 - hide the shop background
02:49 - and then when i receive open shop then
02:51 - we want to go to zero
02:52 - zero which is the origin the center and
02:56 - then we want to set
02:56 - in shop to yes so then to let other
03:00 - sprites
03:00 - know the player is in the shop
03:04 - in shop to yes and then we want to show
03:07 - the variable money
03:09 - to let them know how much money they're
03:11 - at um
03:12 - and then let's show and then we have to
03:15 - show the background of course
03:17 - and then we want this to go to the front
03:18 - layer so we wanted to go into the front
03:21 - layer and then go back a little bit so
03:22 - we're going to make it
03:23 - go backwards five layers
03:27 - okay so that's the shop
03:31 - so uh let's work on the buttons now
03:35 - so for the buttons
03:39 - i'm gonna receive open shop
03:41 - [Music]
03:43 - we wanna for this is for the skin one
03:45 - the blue
03:46 - the blue spaceship so when i receive
03:48 - open shop we want to go to the front
03:50 - layer
03:50 - with this sprite go to the front layer
03:55 - and then i made it go to negative 50 80.
03:58 - i already have the same coordinates
03:59 - because
04:00 - i got from the backpack but negative 50
04:03 - 80 is like
04:03 - somewhere around here so
04:07 - just i just um dragged it over there and
04:09 - then just got the coordinates
04:11 - and then i want to set the size to 100
04:14 - in the beginning
04:15 - because when you um sometimes when you
04:18 - stop the game
04:19 - and your mouse is off uh on the sprite
04:22 - then that means the sprite is bigger
04:23 - than a hundred percent so we're going to
04:25 - set the size
04:26 - back to 100 in the beginning then we
04:28 - want to show
04:31 - and now we're going to do the script to
04:33 - make the sprite bigger
04:35 - when it's touching the mouse pointer so
04:37 - get a forever loop
04:38 - and change the size change the size
04:43 - by 100 minus
04:46 - so we're going to get the division sign
04:48 - so um we want to get a division and the
04:51 - subtraction
04:51 - symbol so we want to put the division in
04:54 - here
04:56 - got a size so 100
05:00 - minus the size divided by three
05:03 - so i put this in here so if it's not
05:05 - touching the mouse pointer then i'll
05:07 - go back to normal size or shrink
05:10 - and if touching mouse pointer
05:17 - then change the size
05:21 - by let's just duplicate this so instead
05:24 - of 100 we're doing 150
05:27 - divided by minus the size divided by
05:29 - three so you want to put this in here
05:31 - so if it's touching the last pointer
05:32 - it'll get bigger and
05:35 - if uh we're gonna get an if-else
05:38 - statement
05:40 - if um mouse down
05:44 - if the player is clicking down on the
05:47 - button
05:49 - oh there's a mouse down right here then
05:51 - we want to set the brightness
05:52 - negative 10. just make it a little bit
05:54 - dimmer
05:56 - it just makes the game look better i
05:58 - guess
05:59 - we're going to set the brightness
06:02 - to negative 10. and then we want to wait
06:06 - until the mouse down is clicked
06:08 - wait until mouse down so you wait until
06:10 - the player is clicking onto the sprite
06:16 - then we want to broadcast another
06:17 - message called check spaceship
06:20 - purchase purchase check
06:25 - space ship purchase
06:30 - so this is to check if the player is
06:32 - buying the spaceship
06:34 - and then else we want to set the
06:36 - brightness to zero
06:38 - make it back to normal
06:41 - brightness and then we want to get
06:44 - when i receive when i receive
06:49 - um check spaceship purchase we want to
06:52 - make a new
06:52 - variable called spaceship uh spaceship
06:55 - purchase status
06:56 - so let's just check if the player has
06:59 - enough money to buy the spaceship
07:02 - so the spaceships and the um
07:05 - uh triple shot are all like one time
07:07 - purchase
07:08 - so since it's a one-time purchase we
07:10 - have to make this variable so space
07:13 - ship purchase status
07:17 - so when you go back in the store the
07:19 - spaceship would be already purchased
07:21 - [Music]
07:23 - so we're going to get an if else
07:25 - statement if
07:29 - the uh spaceship purchase status is
07:31 - equal to unlock meaning
07:33 - the player has has enough money to buy
07:35 - it
07:36 - and already bought it then uh
07:40 - when spaceships purchase status is equal
07:42 - to unlocked then we want to
07:44 - broadcast another message
07:45 - [Music]
07:48 - broadcast switch to blue spaceship
07:50 - because you can select different skins
07:52 - so if they already have it and they
07:54 - click on the sprite and that means
07:55 - you'll switch them to the blue spaceship
07:58 - so we want to make a new broadcast
08:00 - called swish to
08:01 - blue of course blue
08:04 - space ship
08:10 - switch to blue spaceship and then we
08:12 - want to stop the script
08:13 - because that means because they already
08:15 - bought it so stop the script
08:19 - else we wouldn't get an if else
08:20 - statement
08:22 - put it in the else area if the money is
08:25 - greater than or equal to
08:27 - um one thousand so i made this
08:30 - out of one thousand uh money and each
08:34 - character you
08:34 - each enemy you kill you'll get a hundred
08:38 - so you gonna get an ore an equal
08:41 - and a greater than so if the money
08:46 - is uh equal to one thousand
08:49 - or the money is greater than one
08:52 - thousand
08:54 - then we wanna change the money by
08:56 - negative one thousand
09:00 - so subtract one thousand dollar money
09:03 - from your uh um from your account i
09:08 - guess
09:09 - so we want to set the spaceship purchase
09:11 - status to unlocked
09:12 - after you buy it
09:17 - unlocked and then we want to switch
09:19 - costume to costume2
09:21 - so then the button will switch to like
09:23 - the dark one noting
09:24 - notifying the player that he's already
09:26 - bought he or she has already bought
09:28 - the skin then we want to broadcast
09:31 - another message
09:33 - uh switch the blue spaceship broadcast
09:36 - that
09:37 - else we want to set the spaceship status
09:39 - to locked
09:40 - set the spaceship purchase status to
09:43 - locked
09:44 - if they cannot afford it and we want to
09:47 - switch costume to costume one so then
09:50 - the uh so then it will stay on the first
09:53 - one
09:54 - okay and then next we want to get
09:57 - another broadcast when i receive
10:01 - check spaceship purchase status and if
10:06 - the um spaceship purchase status is
10:08 - equal to unlocked
10:11 - [Music]
10:13 - spaceship purchase status then we want
10:16 - to forever
10:18 - switch to costume too so then if the
10:20 - player comes back to the shop
10:21 - you'll always see the second costume
10:24 - which means it's already purchased
10:26 - switch costume to costume two
10:29 - then we want to get a one flag clicked
10:32 - when flag was clicked we want to hide
10:35 - this
10:36 - button because they're not in the shop
10:39 - and then in the beginning we always want
10:40 - to set the spaceship purchase status
10:42 - to locked
10:47 - [Music]
10:50 - oops it locked and then you want to
10:53 - switch the costume to costume one
10:56 - which is the first costume
11:00 - and then when i receive start game
11:04 - start game then you want to hide
11:08 - and stop other scripts in the sprite
11:12 - in the beginning okay
11:15 - so now we have this one down we can just
11:18 - uh drag the code into the other buttons
11:20 - but we have to change up
11:22 - we have to change it up a little bit
11:25 - so guys we need one more change to our
11:27 - code so for the pause button
11:29 - when i receive open shop it'll hide so
11:32 - then it'll hide in the shop
11:38 - and then um i will show you guys if it
11:40 - works i'm gonna set my money
11:43 - to like 1000 so then i can actually buy
11:46 - it
11:47 - so then i'm gonna play it click p
11:51 - open the shop and then the button is
11:52 - right here when you click it
11:54 - you can select the blue skin and we need
11:57 - we need to make an exit button so we'll
11:59 - make the exit button right now so then
12:01 - when
12:02 - i can show you guys when i exit it can
12:04 - become the blue spaceship
12:06 - so let's get to the exit button so i'm
12:08 - just going to drag and drop
12:10 - this code from here into here
12:14 - because it's pretty much the same thing
12:16 - except we're gonna put a little weight
12:18 - in the front
12:19 - and then it'll delay by one second i'll
12:21 - show one second later
12:23 - and then um we'll need a new x and y
12:25 - position so the x and y position i did
12:27 - was
12:27 - 150 negative 70.
12:32 - and then set size to 100 percent zero
12:34 - percent
12:37 - and then show forever we want to do the
12:40 - same thing
12:40 - and if instead of this we're going to
12:43 - take this out
12:44 - if it's uh
12:48 - in shop is equal to yes that means it's
12:50 - inside the shop
12:52 - so we need two ands and the player is
12:55 - touching the mouse pointer and it's um
12:58 - mouse down so we're going to say yes or
12:59 - here if the in
13:01 - shot is equal to yes and
13:04 - touching mouse pointer
13:08 - so i'm just going to delete this and
13:11 - mouse down
13:13 - then we can wait until
13:17 - wait until mouse down
13:20 - wait until mouse down and then we'll
13:22 - broadcast start game
13:24 - so then i'll start the game again when
13:26 - you exit the store
13:29 - oh oops don't use the weight just
13:33 - starting
13:35 - and then we'll need to add a little bit
13:37 - more code get it when flight clicked
13:39 - in the beginning we want to hide and
13:42 - want to receive start game
13:48 - start game then we want to set the in
13:50 - shot to no
13:51 - because in the beginning you're not in
13:52 - this shop
13:55 - set the in shop snow and then hide
13:58 - so that's pretty much it now let's test
14:01 - it out
14:03 - and instead of 100 and 150 we have to
14:05 - change this to 50
14:08 - and 75 so it won't be very big because
14:10 - it'll get too big
14:11 - and then we want to get a point
14:13 - direction of 90 so then it will uh
14:15 - point to the right side so let's play it
14:18 - now
14:18 - i'm gonna click p go to the shop
14:22 - so then the exit button
14:26 - and this is supposed to be the other way
14:28 - around so you have to put the
14:29 - subtraction sign
14:30 - into the division sign size like that
14:33 - put this in here
14:36 - and then we do the same thing for this
14:37 - one
14:40 - put that inside here like that
14:44 - so now let's play it click p
14:48 - go to the shop and then you get the exit
14:51 - button so
14:52 - when you click 1000 exit
14:55 - and then you have to select it right now
14:57 - we have not had the selection so we have
14:59 - to select it
15:01 - so then we have to um make it switch to
15:02 - the blue costume
15:05 - when i receive switch to blue costume
15:09 - you want to switch the costume to the
15:10 - blue costume
15:12 - this one
15:16 - so now let's play
15:19 - so now you have the blue costume select
15:22 - it
15:23 - click exit and now you have the blue
15:24 - costume so now you can play with the
15:26 - other skin
15:29 - and i'll show you guys one more thing so
15:32 - this one seconds
15:33 - needed because if you take it out and
15:36 - you play it
15:37 - and you click and then click here
15:40 - it will come back because it's at the
15:42 - same x and y position
15:44 - if you want to change this then you can
15:45 - just put the weight one second or you
15:47 - can make it go to a different x and y
15:48 - position
15:50 - so that's it for part three
15:53 - um so thank you guys for watching don't
15:55 - forget to like share and subscribe
15:57 - i'll see you guys in the next video
16:10 - you
