00:54 - days ago so anyways
00:56 - let's see what we're going to learn
01:01 - christmas decorator we'll be learning
01:03 - these following concepts in scratch
01:05 - sprite editing broadcast messages using
01:07 - draggable
01:08 - music extension cloning key control
01:11 - and you can find the santa claus sprite
01:14 - here in the link below or you can get

01:33 - this uh
01:34 - plan so recently we saw six aob
01:39 - 5bv create a similar
01:42 - game and shared it in our scratch studio
01:44 - you guys can check out his project
01:46 - it is very cool as well the christmas
01:48 - tree decorator
01:49 - 6a by 6ao
01:56 - um so yeah you guys can check that out
02:00 - um oh yeah this also calls for our
02:02 - scratch studio you can join our scratch
02:04 - studio
02:05 - in the video um join our scratch studio
02:08 - you can definitely check that out
02:10 - you can share all of your fun projects
02:12 - and we'll view it sometimes and we might
02:14 - even give it shout outs
02:15 - like this one the christmas tree
02:17 - operator so
02:18 - um please join our studio and thank you
02:22 - so i'm in my game that i made
02:25 - uh a little help so
02:28 - so um we're gonna try playing this game
02:31 - so so
02:34 - this is not copyrighted music this is
02:37 - actually
02:38 - um music that i made from
02:42 - the music tool in scratch and extensions
02:45 - so
02:45 - it takes a lot of scripts to make this
02:47 - music 27
02:49 - so uh uh so there's a change of
02:52 - christmas tree there's a change in gift
02:54 - box there's no
02:55 - constantly falling so i'm gonna change
02:56 - the gift box see if this is the first
02:58 - one
02:58 - second one third one fourth one fifth
03:01 - one
03:02 - six one seven one eight one
03:05 - nine one and yeah it just keeps on going
03:09 - all over again so
03:10 - let's change our christmas tree so um
03:12 - there's a bunch of different christmas
03:13 - trees
03:14 - so you can it starts out as this one i
03:16 - think so it just changes christmas trees
03:18 - so i can take that and then we set the
03:20 - candy cane to draggable so you can drag
03:22 - it
03:22 - anywhere you want you can hang the
03:24 - stocking that's also draggable
03:26 - you can also play with the santa which
03:28 - is um
03:29 - arrow keys um and you can use up arrow
03:33 - to do
03:34 - um jumping and mix a little jump sound
03:37 - and all stuff
03:38 - it was pretty a cool game like you can
03:40 - change the gift boxes a little bit
03:43 - and do whatever you want so
03:46 - yeah this is basically what i'm saying
03:50 - so yeah
03:54 - so um we're starting here and
03:59 - we have sprite one which is not needed
04:02 - so we have everything in our backpack
04:05 - and
04:05 - we already took out the background
04:08 - because i think they're jpgs and they
04:10 - save a background
04:11 - so we took out all the backgrounds from
04:14 - in scratch too so
04:15 - um if you don't know how to take out the
04:17 - backgrounds you can watch our new video
04:19 - so um yeah uh
04:23 - so we have a but i mean that's not a new
04:26 - video so we're gonna be uh
04:28 - that's an old video we're gonna put that
04:30 - in our links in the description
04:32 - which is the um the
04:35 - to tell you how to erase the backdrop
04:38 - for many things
04:40 - like anything you want and we also have
04:42 - the backpack video links in the
04:43 - description
04:44 - if you um want to have the backpack
04:47 - video if you want to learn how to use
04:49 - the backpack
04:50 - i mean like why not so uh if you guys
04:52 - don't know how to use a backdrop
04:54 - backpack you can use it
04:57 - so we need the winter backdrop
05:02 - right here and then we can erase the two
05:08 - trees
05:10 - there we go winter backdrop we don't
05:13 - have we don't need backdrop one
05:18 - okay so um we will be working on next
05:21 - tree
05:21 - and next gift box right now so
05:25 - we're going to start our next tree so
05:27 - when the green flag is clicked you go to
05:29 - a position
05:30 - since i already have in my backpack it
05:31 - goes to the position i want it to go
05:33 - into
05:34 - so negative 195 why 130.
05:40 - so you can drag it anywhere you want and
05:42 - then you'll have it in the in your
05:44 - position you just have to drag it around
05:46 - you can put it in your position so like
05:48 - over there
05:49 - it'll be a negative 187y 64.
05:52 - so it's back to negative 195 why 130 so
05:58 - uh yeah so let's work on this so when
06:00 - the agree
06:01 - this is just a tada code
06:04 - not that much when the sprite clicked
06:07 - broadcast
06:09 - change tree because
06:13 - christmas tree hope you guys have set up
06:15 - your christmas tree already we didn't
06:17 - yet
06:18 - so we're about to set it up today i
06:20 - think so
06:21 - change tree we're also going to work on
06:23 - our second button which is the
06:27 - this one the box the gift box so go to
06:30 - the position a1
06:32 - and it will whenever when this sprite is
06:35 - clicked
06:36 - it will broadcast
06:40 - inside change tree change
06:46 - box
06:48 - so uh we're gonna work on the
06:54 - the uh christmas tree so let's work on
06:57 - that
06:58 - right now so it had a code 2
07:01 - here and the costumes we have christmas
07:04 - tree one which is the winter tree from
07:06 - the backdrop in the
07:07 - winter um this christmas tree
07:10 - links in description you can download
07:12 - all these christmas trees this one
07:15 - this one this one this one this one
07:18 - so i already positioned them so
07:21 - if you didn't position them yet which
07:23 - you probably did not because
07:24 - you're downloading this from our google
07:26 - drive so um you have to put your thumb
07:29 - here
07:29 - obviously you can't see my thumb but
07:31 - it's right there so
07:32 - um you gotta put it right here all the
07:35 - christmas trees have to be around the
07:36 - same size
07:37 - and then you gotta put the christmas
07:39 - tree in the middle so
07:40 - um as you can see my thumb is
07:44 - uh up there and it's around the same
07:46 - size for all of them that's the good
07:47 - thing and you got to center it
07:48 - just like that just like that yeah
07:52 - for all of them you gotta center them
07:54 - put the thumb some can be taller than
07:55 - others just a tad taller sometimes
07:58 - some can just be a tad taller that's
08:00 - pretty good so anyways
08:01 - let's start on the christmas tree so
08:03 - when the green flag is clicked
08:07 - it'll go to 132 you 11. i already have
08:11 - that
08:12 - it'll go to the back layer because you
08:14 - want the gift boxes to be in front of
08:16 - the tree
08:21 - you know switch costume to christmas
08:23 - tree so we have seven trees and
08:26 - that's christmas tree zero one two
08:31 - one three is in front of two for some
08:33 - reason two
08:34 - three four five and six so
08:38 - we have basically seven costumes and it
08:40 - just says christmas tree zero cause
08:43 - it's christmas tree zero and then so
08:45 - this is christmas tree zero this is
08:47 - christmas tree six
08:48 - so you can change that to one and you
08:50 - can change this one to seven if you want
08:52 - but i did that zero
08:54 - so when i receive change tree
08:59 - it will go to the next costume
09:04 - i'm pretty sure we we're gonna work on
09:06 - the gift box next
09:08 - so let's do the gift box right now
09:11 - so when the green flag is clicked we'll
09:14 - switch
09:14 - costume so we're not going to give you
09:16 - all these costumes because i
09:18 - designed the costumes but we will give
09:20 - you like each of these presents
09:22 - so then you can design them on your own
09:24 - and put like some in front of others
09:26 - some on the left some on the right
09:28 - like um some of these some of these
09:31 - so i designed all of these um this one's
09:33 - a gigantic one i don't know why i made
09:35 - it that big
09:36 - but okay um
09:39 - so we're gonna be working on this now so
09:42 - it'll switch costume
09:44 - to costume zero which is um
09:49 - zero obviously and i'll go to the front
09:53 - layer
09:54 - and change gift box
09:58 - to next costume
10:02 - so this will be um news for the gift box
10:06 - it'll change the gift box when you click
10:08 - this button
10:09 - so let's test it out so
10:12 - this is for the christmas tree this is
10:14 - for the gift box so you can download
10:15 - these again
10:16 - so gift box awesome
10:22 - i like this one the best it's the most
10:23 - presents and everyone likes presents
10:25 - so christmas tree
10:29 - godly okay so it works um
10:33 - so we can do this so we're gonna work on
10:36 - the candy cane right now
10:37 - candy cane should be really really
10:39 - really really simple so
10:41 - just uh four scripts of code
10:44 - no yeah four sorts of code and uh when
10:47 - the green flag is clicked
10:49 - it will go to the position i already
10:51 - have it at negative 39 y
10:52 - 28 it'll go forever
10:56 - set mode draggable because you can drag
10:58 - it anywhere
11:00 - you want to drag by the draggable
11:03 - so you can drag this anywhere you want
11:06 - even in even the people are playing the
11:09 - game you can drag it up here you can
11:10 - drag it down here you can drag it
11:12 - uh well i'm dragging this because i'm
11:14 - inside the project you can drag it over
11:16 - here that's basically what this does
11:17 - and the stocking is just exactly the
11:20 - same code
11:20 - so but just a different position so
11:22 - let's just
11:25 - bring this to here
11:30 - but then change the go to to where it
11:34 - already
11:34 - is uh so
11:37 - um i'm gonna make it i have i already
11:40 - have a position
11:41 - that's fine uh because i think i should
11:43 - keep it there because why not
11:45 - um next we're gonna work on
11:49 - the santa i'm pretty sure i'm supposed
11:51 - to work on this internet so
11:53 - let's do this so i'm going to start
11:57 - over here and then when the green slide
11:59 - is clicked
12:00 - it will go forever
12:05 - go to the front layer
12:11 - so i did it the front layer because you
12:12 - don't want it you don't want santa to go
12:14 - in front of the
12:15 - stocking or the candy cane so because
12:18 - it'll go behind the candy cane and then
12:20 - his face is behind the candy cane you
12:22 - don't want his face to be behind the
12:23 - candy cane you want him to be in front
12:25 - of everything
12:26 - so let's do this so if then
12:31 - so we have all the costumes over here
12:33 - idle run
12:34 - run run run run run jump
12:38 - basically that's all we have so well
12:40 - there's more
12:41 - in the links in the description you can
12:43 - download in our google drive but you can
12:44 - also go to this website and download
12:47 - santa die like i'm dying and on stuff so
12:49 - you can also do that
12:51 - and then you need a knot
12:54 - and then if key any press
12:58 - any key is pressed
13:02 - you need a knot so if not any keys are
13:05 - pressed like
13:06 - the right arrow or the left arrow if
13:08 - they're not pressed you'll switch
13:09 - costumes to the idle costume just like
13:11 - in the mongoose platformer
13:17 - so we are done with
13:20 - that so next we're gonna do a large
13:23 - script of code with the green flag
13:27 - it'll go to this position
13:31 - and a set rotation style left right
13:33 - because you don't want it to be
13:34 - upside down when it's running also it's
13:36 - going to run with
13:37 - his head up upside down so i have
13:40 - um his head on the ground and yeah so
13:43 - that's why you want it to be
13:44 - set rotation style to left right or you
13:47 - can do this part
13:49 - we can do this and click this button
13:50 - it's already left right i think but
13:52 - just in case we can we can do this so
13:55 - set rotation style right
14:00 - um it'll go to the front later
14:03 - again we gotta recap this
14:09 - and it'll go forever
14:12 - if then
14:16 - instead the right arrow is pressed
14:23 - and then you can point the direction 90.
14:30 - point in direction 90 right over here
14:33 - we'll move 10 steps and next costume
14:42 - so i'm going to work on the left arrow
14:44 - next so let's duplicate this
14:46 - change a little bit code change this to
14:49 - left arrow
14:50 - this is negative 90
14:53 - luke 10 steps next costume so that's the
14:56 - code
14:56 - for santa walking now we're gonna do the
14:59 - jumping
15:00 - code so let's do this
15:04 - so let's see my santa is
15:08 - walking frequently enough frequently
15:11 - he's walking um right
15:15 - normally so if he's not walking he's
15:18 - idle mode
15:19 - he's just smiling uh
15:22 - yeah so um let's change the stocking
15:25 - because it's at
15:26 - a position i don't want it to be and
15:28 - it's at the same position so
15:30 - i do have coordinates for this
15:33 - but i could drag this over here
15:37 - and then do the go to because the candy
15:39 - cane and the stocking are at the same
15:40 - position and i do not like that
15:42 - so let's see
15:47 - i think it's supposed to go over here
15:49 - right
15:52 - okay
15:55 - i think this is the right one yeah
15:58 - right there right there okay so let's
16:01 - just continue with our santa
16:03 - jumping so
16:06 - a jumping santa when the green flag is
16:09 - clicked
16:11 - it'll go forever if then
16:14 - [Music]
16:18 - repeat until
16:21 - so if then the up arrow key is pressed
16:28 - then it will switch costume to jump
16:33 - and it will broadcast jump
16:36 - and wait
16:41 - jumps will make a message jump
16:45 - and then the repeat until if
16:49 - the equal sign
16:53 - if the y position
16:57 - is equal to negative 85
17:02 - it's already a negative y is already
17:06 - at negative 85. so i use negative 85
17:09 - because sansa is on negative 85.
17:11 - so when it jumps it'll go down back to
17:13 - negative 85.
17:14 - so it'll change y
17:18 - by negative 10
17:22 - so negative 85 this is where he's
17:25 - standing so when he jumps he'll
17:26 - land back right on the spine
17:30 - and then when i receive jump
17:38 - then you know it starts and jump so
17:40 - let's get this
17:44 - right there
17:47 - i think it's already on santa but if
17:51 - i think uh i added the um the
17:54 - sound for the jump so let's do this
17:57 - choose a sound
18:00 - jump it says in the sprite library uh so
18:03 - you could get it if it's not in the
18:04 - santa for some reason so you can
18:06 - get that sound and then it will repeat
18:08 - five times
18:16 - change y by 30
18:22 - it'll go up and then
18:27 - a really small weight zero point zero
18:31 - two
18:33 - point zero two is the same thing but
18:35 - zero to make it
18:37 - uh make it so just in case if i didn't
18:39 - get it
18:40 - so let's see
18:46 - it's working so just like that
18:50 - drag the candy cane drag the stocking
18:53 - change the gift box we didn't add the
18:55 - music yet so
18:58 - there's a bunch of these so oh we
19:01 - i may take a little bit long because
19:03 - it's already 18 minutes and 57 seconds
19:05 - which is
19:06 - um 19 minutes now so
19:10 - um we're going to do the
19:13 - the code for the snow and the backdrop
19:17 - which is the sound
19:19 - and the jingle bell
19:23 - so we're gonna do that in the next part
19:25 - so anyways
19:27 - merry christmas
19:38 - you
