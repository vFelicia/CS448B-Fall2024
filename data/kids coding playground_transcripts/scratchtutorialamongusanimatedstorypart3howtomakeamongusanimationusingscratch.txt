00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to
00:09 - kidscoolingplayground
00:11 - so this will be the third among us part
00:14 - three the animated story
00:17 - so the part 2 we did the the first
00:21 - stage where you know the saiyan can take
00:25 - out the red
00:26 - among us sprite and then we go on to the
00:29 - next stage
00:30 - then there's a pink among us sprite
00:33 - there
00:34 - so what we continue to do is we did the
00:36 - door for our last
00:37 - video um so we'll continue working on
00:41 - stage three and then all the other
00:43 - weapons that you can use to take out
00:46 - this crew
00:48 - so let me just run through it one more
00:50 - time
00:51 - so just refresh everyone so you say
00:55 - start so
00:58 - okay let's do that again no this one is
01:00 - not correct you see how this is
01:02 - showing up you need to fix that
01:06 - so in here make sure that you code it
01:08 - for the first
01:09 - first one just in case you know
01:11 - something like this happen
01:12 - because a different episode right go to
01:14 - one
01:15 - so what you can do is do this okay let's
01:17 - start again so we have this one second
01:19 - for now we can change it back to like
01:21 - four seconds so the user can read but uh
01:24 - for right now we just keep it at one
01:26 - let's run it again
01:28 - so you have this right and then it comes
01:30 - to here
01:31 - then we call it the club
01:33 - [Applause]
01:35 - we can kind of hit them and then swirl
01:38 - effect
01:39 - we're going to push the up they open the
01:40 - door it hides the sprite
01:42 - and it goes to the stage two and you
01:44 - have the paint
01:45 - among us okay so that's what we left off
01:48 - last time
01:49 - so let's begin again so we'll continue
01:52 - here
01:53 - so uh what we want to do next is that we
01:55 - can work on the other one like the laser
01:57 - gun
01:58 - the infinity garnet and lightsaber and
02:00 - so on okay so we're going to do the
02:03 - laser gun so the laser comes a little
02:06 - bit different
02:07 - it's actually not a weapon over here
02:09 - when i did it at that time i actually
02:11 - did it with the uh
02:12 - a costume so we'll just do it like that
02:14 - so you can do it other way but
02:16 - so what you do is you we're gonna put
02:18 - this little laser gun i found online
02:20 - just kind of
02:20 - cut it up and then we just kind of move
02:23 - it and copy it and then move it over
02:25 - here so if you want to add different
02:26 - sprite
02:27 - you can just upload this sprite into
02:30 - here
02:31 - say upload and then you find your spray
02:33 - upload and then after that just
02:34 - kind of copy the image and put it in
02:36 - here
02:38 - if you guys want me to show you let me
02:39 - see if i can
02:41 - so we're going to show you here um
02:45 - so let's say you kind of pick a sprite
02:48 - when you download online sometimes
02:50 - they're not the icon is not
02:52 - clean even though it says png sometimes
02:54 - it's not like for example
02:56 - this is the old laser gun we had right
02:58 - so as you can see you have white
03:00 - it has some white background here so
03:03 - you have to use like the scratch 2.0 to
03:06 - clean it up
03:06 - if you don't know how to do that take a
03:08 - look at one of our uh how to uh
03:10 - series and then we actually show that
03:13 - and you can download
03:14 - scratch 2.0 and use the magic wand and
03:16 - do that
03:17 - so after you clean it up you can import
03:20 - it here after you import it here you can
03:21 - do convert to vector
03:23 - and you can kind of select this and then
03:25 - you can put it into your
03:27 - sprite here and then you can resize it
03:30 - however you want right
03:32 - since you see how this one has a has a
03:34 - back
03:35 - white background which is no good so
03:37 - this one i did is i clean up the
03:39 - background
03:40 - so after that you can just kind of move
03:42 - in and
03:43 - rotate and then just give that give it
03:46 - to your sprite
03:47 - so anyway if you need to know how to do
03:48 - that look at the uh
03:50 - what about to do uh how to video on how
03:53 - to clean up a background for a sprite
03:55 - okay
03:56 - not go into that for now so what happens
03:58 - is you just pick any weapon
04:00 - you created online or you can create you
04:02 - can draw your own
04:04 - and then just put it for this uh sprite
04:07 - okay okay so
04:10 - what we're going to do is we're going to
04:12 - create a code down here
04:14 - okay say when
04:19 - so number two is press so we did number
04:21 - one on the club so number two is press
04:24 - and same thing that what we did in club
04:26 - right it it's not
04:28 - not in progress basically the they're
04:30 - not saying anything then we want to do
04:32 - that right so same kind of logic we need
04:34 - okay let's go back to our sprite here
04:38 - let's
04:39 - zoom in a little bit we're calling for
04:42 - number two
04:44 - uh attack which is the laser gun
04:47 - okay so you drag the if and l statement
04:50 - here
04:51 - if and then i mean we don't need the
04:52 - else and then
04:54 - you the nut operator
04:58 - and then you drag the equal operator
05:01 - go to variable um select this
05:05 - dialog in progress say
05:08 - but yes basically saying is dialogue
05:10 - progress is no or you can actually do it
05:12 - like this
05:13 - if you don't want to do it or not then
05:14 - you can say
05:16 - no whatever it will be the same thing so
05:18 - this
05:20 - is the same as not yes
05:23 - okay since i did it not yes i can
05:27 - let's just continue using that uh what
05:30 - you can do is
05:32 - you can switch to
05:35 - custom number two so we're gonna delete
05:37 - that icon actually
05:40 - here this thing's messed up so we're
05:42 - gonna switch to custom number two which
05:43 - is the
05:44 - the sprite holding the laser gun
05:47 - okay put that over here and what we do
05:51 - is we're gonna do a wait for one second
05:53 - kind of show up a little bit
05:55 - and we're gonna broadcast a new message
06:00 - called fire
06:05 - laser okay so this will fire the laser
06:09 - and wait
06:09 - until the other uh message is finished
06:12 - right
06:13 - and we'll do a little bit away again
06:16 - then we want to switch it back
06:17 - to custom number one which is the
06:21 - standard costume okay so
06:24 - we're gonna use this fire the laser
06:26 - switch it back to
06:28 - this one okay okay so what we
06:32 - want to do is we're gonna have to code
06:35 - this
06:35 - uh the sonic power that suit from the
06:38 - laser and then like you know kind of fly
06:40 - to the
06:41 - the other sprites right to attack him
06:45 - so we need to do something here
06:48 - so what we want to do is we're going to
06:52 - create when green black is clicked
06:56 - we want to hide the sprite in the
06:58 - beginning
07:00 - now i'm gonna draw a forever loop here
07:06 - and what we're going to do is we're
07:08 - going to change the ghost effect just
07:10 - kind of make it blank
07:11 - blinking so goes
07:15 - effect by 25 and we're gonna wait
07:19 - for 0.1 second
07:24 - do that again duplicate the block okay
07:27 - and then duplicate one more time kind of
07:30 - like a blinking kind of thing
07:32 - okay so when when we run this
07:36 - so let's say i run this just if you want
07:38 - to test something right you can always
07:40 - just you don't actually have to run
07:41 - through everything what you can do is
07:43 - just click on the code block here on top
07:45 - so right now it's actually running you
07:47 - see it's yellow but it's high right so
07:48 - if you say
07:49 - show let's see where is it
07:52 - i don't know where that is actually
07:54 - maybe somewhere here actually let me
07:57 - stop this again okay here it is
08:01 - so so let's try this again
08:06 - so you'll see it it goes away so you see
08:10 - that it kind of flashes and goes away
08:11 - but what we want to do is we're going to
08:13 - have to
08:14 - make it show right and then this thing
08:17 - should
08:17 - should also you know uh show up
08:21 - so we want to show up in high right i
08:23 - think i did it wrong here
08:25 - so what i want to do is i'm going to
08:27 - kind of go dimmer
08:28 - and then i have to go back out actually
08:31 - so i'm going to have to do negative 25
08:34 - and then 25. okay let's try it again so
08:37 - my mistake i did a copy and i forgot to
08:39 - change the effect
08:41 - so oops so i don't actually have to do
08:43 - that
08:44 - just click on the green flag let me see
08:46 - this
08:48 - oh it is so you can see it's blinking
08:51 - you see this it's blinking that's what
08:53 - we want right so we're
08:54 - hiding making it dimmer and then making
08:57 - it uh making a brighter dimmer and
08:58 - brighter a bit demonstrating
09:00 - so that's why it's kind of having this
09:02 - blinking effect okay
09:04 - all right okay so
09:08 - we have the fire laser right so what we
09:10 - want to do is
09:12 - from here with this fire laser right so
09:14 - what we want to do is go back over here
09:18 - so when i receive fire laser
09:22 - i want to create a clone of myself
09:27 - so basically going to create one of this
09:29 - sounding tower
09:31 - okay and then you have to say when i
09:33 - start as a clone what you want to do
09:35 - so this will actually call this
09:39 - so what we want to do is we're going to
09:41 - set up another well another variable i
09:44 - think
09:45 - called got hit
09:48 - so got hit you have to create that for
09:50 - the sonic power only
09:51 - okay just for the clone so that you can
09:54 - so
09:54 - we don't want to so we want to keep
09:57 - track of
09:58 - if the actually the sonic power should
10:00 - hit him let's say i can
10:02 - shoot the other way and it will not hit
10:03 - him so we want to
10:05 - check that make sure that actually hit
10:07 - him before we change the
10:09 - you know the effect for this uh uh for
10:12 - this uh uh
10:12 - among the spray so that's why we need to
10:14 - create another
10:16 - variable called gap hit so we don't know
10:18 - how to do this you can click on make
10:19 - variable
10:20 - and say got hit put got hit here
10:23 - and then you can select for this sprite
10:27 - only
10:27 - okay so that will create the
10:31 - variable basically this is a private
10:33 - variable for sonic power okay
10:36 - okay so what we want to do is
10:40 - we want to set got
10:44 - hit to note so first
10:47 - meaning like when you start the clone
10:48 - that means it did not hit the uh
10:51 - hit the uh the other sprite this right
10:53 - right
10:54 - so and then we want to make this go to
11:00 - so that means when they fire the gun
11:03 - this clone should go to the cyan
11:06 - and we want to point in the direction of
11:08 - the science of the
11:09 - just like the club right so the science
11:11 - pointing to the to the right
11:13 - right now the signs pointing to the
11:14 - right so this thing will actually go in
11:17 - here
11:17 - okay so the cyan is pointing to the left
11:20 - then the sky will point it the other way
11:22 - okay so that's what we want to do
11:24 - so what we want to do is point in
11:27 - direction here
11:29 - and then go to sensing and you have to
11:32 - pick out
11:32 - from here put it here so always select
11:35 - the back one first
11:36 - before you select the front so you
11:38 - select cyan first
11:40 - and then you select direction okay
11:44 - and then we will do a move
11:48 - 50 steps what happened is we want the
11:52 - the sonic power come out from like right
11:55 - here we don't want it to come out from
11:56 - his stomach
11:57 - right we're gonna push 50 steps so that
12:00 - it's somewhere like this
12:01 - okay that's why we have that 50 set
12:04 - and then we'll say show so that way now
12:07 - after we
12:07 - do all this coordinate thing then we'll
12:09 - show that way
12:11 - you can always see it kind of flying
12:12 - like this i mean let me change the
12:14 - costume for this guy so you can
12:17 - see a little bit better so maybe
12:18 - something like this okay
12:21 - so you can adjust it so if you think uh
12:24 - 50 is not enough you can put 100 or 75
12:27 - whatever kind of justice so that it
12:28 - looks like this
12:29 - okay so i think i have 50 let's just try
12:32 - i think 50 is fine
12:33 - okay now next we will want to say repeat
12:38 - until
12:41 - okay so here we want to make sure that
12:46 - you know
12:47 - we want to destroy the clone if you're
12:49 - doing clone you have to make sure you
12:50 - delete the clone
12:51 - so we want to make sure that you know
12:53 - when you touch the edge or touch this
12:55 - guy the clone should
12:56 - disappear if not you keep on having too
12:58 - many calls on the
13:00 - game it's not good it can potentially
13:02 - mess up your game
13:03 - okay and it looks better when you when
13:06 - the bullet hit the
13:07 - hit this guy the laser hit this guy the
13:09 - laser disappear
13:10 - okay so what we want to do is we're
13:13 - gonna have to use the or join
13:15 - because we wanna check if it actually
13:18 - hit him
13:18 - or the edge right so we'll use the whole
13:21 - joint
13:22 - so all meaning either condition happen
13:25 - it will work so we'll say select the
13:28 - among the sprite which is the red one
13:30 - here
13:31 - and then duplicate this and then we'll
13:34 - say touching
13:34 - edge meaning you know it missed the uh
13:38 - mr spry and it hit it on the edge okay
13:41 - so after that you're gonna say
13:45 - set so we want to set this gap head to
13:49 - yes
13:49 - now since we it was every time the clone
13:52 - created is known
13:53 - but if it either touching the edge or
13:55 - touching this then we say
13:57 - got it yes i mean oh sorry i got it
14:00 - wrong
14:02 - so um we're gonna do that a little bit
14:05 - later only if you actually hit the
14:07 - among us sprite then we'll go through
14:09 - cut it yes
14:10 - my bad so what we want to do one make it
14:12 - move right so you have to say move
14:14 - 10 step as you can see it's just a 10
14:17 - step you don't need like negative a
14:18 - positive
14:19 - since you're already pointing to the
14:20 - direction so if you're pointing to the
14:23 - this side if you say 10 step and just go
14:25 - on this side you point this side
14:27 - 10 step it will go on the right side
14:28 - okay all right okay we need another
14:31 - condition here
14:35 - so if oops
14:39 - i'm making a lot of mistake today for
14:42 - some reason
14:44 - okay so we want to duplicate this so if
14:47 - it actually touch
14:48 - the among us you know then we say god
14:52 - hit
14:52 - is yes okay that means it hit the among
14:54 - us sprite
14:56 - okay and then
15:00 - what we want to do is so i've either it
15:03 - touch the edge or this it will finish
15:05 - the the code here will go out of this
15:07 - loop
15:08 - then we will do another check here
15:11 - okay so we say if the got hit
15:14 - it'll use another operator here to check
15:19 - and select the variable got hit
15:22 - if it is go to yes meaning like it got
15:24 - hit
15:25 - right here you go yes then we're gonna
15:27 - broadcast a message
15:30 - what has a message
15:34 - okay this time we're gonna say
15:38 - god hit by laser
15:41 - okay so this is for the the among us uh
15:44 - sprite to
15:45 - change the effect okay and after that we
15:48 - want to set this back
15:51 - just resetting it just in case you know
15:54 - you might not need to but uh just for
15:57 - good of it we'll just reset it back to
15:58 - no
15:59 - and then we can delete this clone
16:05 - delete this clone so basically make this
16:07 - disappear
16:08 - okay all right so let's zoom back out
16:12 - so let's see so this is everything that
16:15 - we had
16:16 - to find the laser we'll call this code
16:18 - and run this
16:20 - okay so that's what we have so far let's
16:22 - go back to the red
16:24 - uh the red um uh sprite here
16:30 - so what we need to do is we are going to
16:32 - have to code this right so
16:34 - because we haven't called the red sprite
16:35 - to change things right when we got hit
16:37 - right
16:38 - so where to do that so we will try to
16:41 - put it over here let me move this on the
16:43 - top
16:43 - so these are all the control moves are
16:45 - like from one place or another we'll put
16:48 - on top
16:49 - and then we are going to do the you know
16:51 - the effect on the bottom
16:52 - you know so this is the first one is the
16:54 - club
16:56 - so second one you can say got hit by
16:58 - laser
17:00 - uh what we want to do is we want to
17:03 - insert a swirl we'll do the
17:05 - fisheye effect by 25 play the sound
17:09 - and broadcast mission complete so
17:14 - so you remember the mission completely
17:16 - coded earlier on the portal
17:18 - so basically it will open up the portal
17:20 - or allow you to go into the door
17:22 - so for this one if it's not backdrop one
17:25 - seven
17:26 - or eight it will show the door and it
17:29 - will show it will show the
17:30 - portal inside inside so the portal okay
17:33 - so it's not one of these
17:34 - those have the portal so after your
17:36 - broadcast mission uh
17:37 - uh complete okay and then after that you
17:40 - can go back over here
17:42 - so you can see right here so if you push
17:45 - the up key
17:46 - and you're touching the portal or high
17:48 - broadcast next stage
17:50 - it will open it will not allow the open
17:52 - door again which
17:54 - will actually change the uh the
17:55 - background of the sprite here
17:58 - on the portal
18:02 - uh so right here not in the portal i
18:04 - mean on the background so you have like
18:06 - next stage you'll
18:07 - go on to the next background so let's
18:09 - just try it
18:10 - out let's see how it works not sure it's
18:13 - gonna work let's see
18:14 - should let's try it out so we're gonna
18:17 - start
18:17 - so you can see we have the club and
18:20 - let's just use a laser right now number
18:22 - two
18:23 - so you see it didn't work right
18:27 - so something is wrong so let's see
18:28 - what's wrong
18:31 - so we made some mistakes so we did a
18:33 - copy from here right so that's why
18:35 - so when when you're doing coding you
18:37 - always want to check if it doesn't work
18:39 - see how you're going to figure out how
18:41 - you do it so as you can see when we
18:43 - shoot
18:43 - it's touching among us so this is
18:45 - correct and you can open up
18:47 - like the variable right so let's say if
18:50 - you try to debug your code or
18:52 - some problem you see got hit is no no
18:55 - so let's just try it again so let's say
18:57 - we say yes
18:58 - so this is no so let's say hit two
19:03 - so i think you cannot really see it
19:05 - because of the clone
19:07 - okay so we were not able to get it
19:09 - working so let's just check through our
19:11 - code make sure everything is
19:12 - correct so here we have got hit this no
19:16 - and we see that touching either this or
19:18 - this and then we get
19:20 - yes so if this is yes then we're gonna
19:22 - broadcast this message
19:24 - so i think we might have some error on
19:26 - the uh here and the among us
19:28 - so here actually we actually did it
19:31 - wrong here
19:33 - we actually don't need that that way
19:35 - until
19:37 - so uh actually when we actually we know
19:39 - that it got hit because this is
19:41 - the sprite here that checks it if it's
19:43 - already touching the uh
19:45 - among us sprite uh we know that it got
19:48 - hit so
19:49 - and then we broadcast this message so
19:51 - when we look at this message we know
19:53 - that
19:54 - this guy got hit already so we actually
19:56 - don't need to have this way until
19:58 - uh touching club or touching the sonic
20:00 - power
20:01 - so i think i made a mistake because i
20:03 - did a copy from here
20:04 - so it's always i mean all the time you
20:07 - know you
20:07 - you will make mistake from coding you
20:09 - know not always one time it will always
20:12 - work so
20:12 - when i do coding i have never done it
20:14 - like one time i will always work
20:16 - so try to like learn how to debug and
20:18 - find out what the problem
20:20 - is so you just kind of check you know
20:22 - what what
20:23 - what would it be wrong you know things
20:25 - look correct here then you see like okay
20:27 - it's broadcasting this
20:28 - so what is it doing i think before i had
20:31 - like touching club or whatever and then
20:33 - i
20:34 - it was incorrect or touching sonic power
20:36 - whatever that is
20:37 - still incorrect so we shouldn't actually
20:39 - need any of that so
20:40 - when we receive this you should just
20:42 - change the fisheye
20:44 - so now let's try it again okay
20:47 - so let's try again uh we have the gun
20:50 - so let's say i shoot on this side right
20:52 - so it should come out on this side you
20:54 - see that
20:55 - come out on this side looks okay
20:58 - not a problem so if i shoot on this side
21:01 - so you can see
21:02 - it got hit it becomes yellow you see it
21:05 - got yellow and then it changed
21:07 - so after that it broadcasts the complete
21:10 - ignition and you can open the door
21:12 - push the up key then you see the
21:16 - the other sprite here which is the uh
21:18 - the uh
21:20 - the pink one but you see we don't see
21:22 - cyan yet so
21:23 - that is incorrect so we need to reset
21:26 - cyan to a position maybe right here
21:28 - okay so what you want to do is kind of
21:31 - open up cyan
21:32 - see where your cyan is okay
21:35 - click on them you see let's say let's
21:37 - say we move them right here
21:39 - so what you want to do is let's go back
21:40 - to cyan
21:44 - so we have the code for the backdrop
21:45 - right so backdrop one
21:47 - so we can duplicate this so sometime
21:50 - when you duplicate code make sure you
21:51 - change it correctly
21:53 - so that happened to me right so
21:56 - so this is backdrop two so we want the
21:58 - sign let's say go to somewhere here
22:01 - then you can make sure you delete this
22:03 - go to get the new go to from here
22:06 - put it here okay and then
22:10 - you can say show or you can have switch
22:13 - to custom one too
22:14 - just in case you know you're switching
22:16 - from another one to here
22:18 - it doesn't hurt or you can i think uh
22:20 - even show is fine because
22:22 - we always reset it after the gun or the
22:24 - club white
22:25 - we always reset it but anyway let's just
22:28 - do that
22:28 - so that you know whenever the screen
22:31 - change from one screen to the next
22:33 - it has the custom show as one okay let's
22:36 - run it again
22:38 - okay we're gonna use the club this time
22:40 - make sure that's the box
22:41 - so that works fine
22:42 - [Applause]
22:44 - so you open the door you can see that
22:46 - yellow is bright lighting up meaning
22:48 - it's working
22:49 - running the code so let's say use this
22:51 - so you can see
22:53 - fisheye and then the total open up you
22:55 - see that so now we're done with
22:57 - the second stage right
23:00 - so we push up again if we put up this
23:03 - will activate here we'll touch bottom or
23:05 - higher stage so let's go back over here
23:08 - we'll push up
23:10 - so you see this cool run now you see
23:12 - this photo is coming up right that's
23:14 - incorrect
23:14 - so this is stage three the portal should
23:17 - not come
23:18 - only come when after we broadcast the
23:20 - message saying
23:22 - the mission is complete so this is
23:25 - incorrect we need to fix that
23:28 - so what we want to do is go to the
23:30 - portal we add a small piece of code that
23:32 - will kind of
23:33 - take care of some of this problem uh
23:35 - what we can do also we can set the uh
23:38 - like the location of the portal where
23:40 - you want to go
23:41 - so um what we can do is since this is
23:44 - the
23:44 - second one let's say let's just put it
23:47 - here
23:48 - so we haven't done that so first stage
23:50 - we don't have a portal right second
23:51 - stage where portal let's say we want to
23:52 - put at this location
23:54 - then you can say okay go to this
23:56 - location
23:57 - right but don't show until the actually
24:00 - the
24:01 - stuff is done and also what we want to
24:04 - do is
24:04 - every time you receive something called
24:06 - next
24:07 - next stage we want to hide it so
24:10 - when you move from one stage to the next
24:12 - we want to hide it
24:14 - and only show when actually you know
24:16 - when you completed the mission
24:18 - so now let's test it again
24:22 - so here we use the club
24:25 - that works fine we're able to go into
24:27 - the door
24:29 - so so now switch to backdrop too it
24:32 - actually has the border over here you
24:34 - cannot see it because it's not shown
24:36 - so if i take out this
24:39 - stuff here this uh this among us right
24:42 - here you see the portal comes up
24:44 - once i go in this code should run you
24:47 - see it run really fast and hide it so
24:49 - you don't actually see it
24:50 - okay all right so we'll go on and do
24:54 - the next part of the next weapon
24:57 - okay so let's stop this let's go to the
24:59 - hand which is the infinite corner
25:02 - so what we want to do is we're gonna say
25:05 - green flag is clicked
25:09 - okay so what we want to say is high
25:15 - and then we will want to throw in a
25:16 - forever loop
25:18 - here and similar to the other one we
25:20 - want to make sure that it goes to the
25:22 - cyan
25:25 - okay go to cyan and we also want to
25:28 - point in the direction that the cyan is
25:30 - pointing right
25:31 - so similar to that one go to sensing
25:35 - grab this guy here and you select the
25:37 - back one first
25:39 - cyan and then we want to say direction
25:43 - okay so the glove will point to the left
25:46 - or the right depending
25:47 - where the cyan guy is standing okay
25:51 - so what we want to do is we want to have
25:54 - another if condition here is a little
25:56 - bit different
25:56 - so what we want the glove to be let's
25:59 - say let me open cyan here
26:01 - and open the glove here so we want to
26:05 - make the the hand kind of like like this
26:09 - in front of uh you know this guy a
26:11 - little bit in the front
26:12 - on the top you know top top right or top
26:16 - left depending what is that right
26:18 - so that you know it it looks a little
26:20 - bit better
26:21 - so what we want to do is
26:25 - we have if an else condition
26:28 - so we need to do the sensing again here
26:33 - and select cyan
26:36 - and we're going to check the direction
26:38 - okay
26:40 - direction so
26:43 - now where you can use the operator
26:46 - we're going to use the greater than so
26:49 - greater than zero
26:52 - so when it's greater than zero meaning
26:54 - it's actually pointing to the right
26:56 - so the direction is like less than zero
26:58 - you see this is
27:00 - let's say we go here this is pointing to
27:03 - the right
27:04 - right any any number is positive it's
27:06 - pointing to the right right you see
27:08 - any number that's negative it's actually
27:10 - pointing to the left you can see right
27:12 - so you can see the hand kind of switch
27:14 - let me put the hand over here maybe i
27:16 - don't know it may be easier to see
27:18 - so you see positive pointing to the
27:20 - right
27:22 - negative pointing to the left so we're
27:23 - trying to see where it's actually
27:25 - pointing
27:26 - and then we're going to make the hand
27:28 - going up accordingly okay
27:31 - okay and you want to set it at this uh
27:34 - this one here so that doesn't rotate all
27:36 - around okay
27:38 - so we're gonna put it back at 90. so if
27:41 - it's the direction
27:42 - is greater than zero meaning pointing to
27:45 - the right
27:46 - side okay okay
27:49 - what you want to do is say motion
27:53 - set x
27:57 - and we want to use the operator
28:00 - use a plus so what we want to do is
28:03 - we're going to find out where cyan is
28:05 - standing
28:06 - in the x position so select cyan
28:09 - x position put this in here
28:12 - and then you say plus i mean you have to
28:14 - test it for me i already tested so i
28:16 - know
28:17 - so i say plus 45 and do something
28:20 - similar here
28:21 - and this one is where to do a minus
28:26 - plus i always say use this
28:30 - the x position let's say if cyan is you
28:33 - know is uh standing on the right
28:35 - i mean facing to the right we want the
28:38 - glove to
28:38 - you know show up like right here so if
28:41 - he's actually facing if science facing
28:43 - to the left let's say
28:44 - facing to the left this side
28:47 - then we want the glove to be on this
28:49 - side okay got it
28:51 - so hopefully you understand that okay so
28:54 - that's why i have to check here so i
28:56 - know where it's gonna show
28:58 - okay now we are going to minimize this a
29:01 - little bit put this over here on the
29:02 - side
29:03 - so we have the code for number three
29:06 - so similar to what we did for number two
29:09 - and one right
29:11 - um why am i not able to find my code
29:15 - okay here's the callback so when i say
29:19 - three so this is the number third plot
29:21 - power the infinite garnet so we're gonna
29:24 - try to call that and also same thing
29:27 - right we have to make sure that is
29:28 - not in progress you know the uh
29:31 - no one is talking so make sure that we
29:34 - want to do that
29:35 - so that you know we don't want the
29:37 - sprite to kill off the other guy before
29:39 - you have a chance to talk
29:40 - okay so this one
29:43 - you say equal
29:47 - and over here
29:50 - so dialogue with dialogue variable
29:56 - okay and you put down yes so
29:59 - not yes then we want to make sure that
30:02 - we can go to the front layer
30:04 - so that it will show up in front of
30:06 - everything else
30:08 - okay and then we want to show
30:11 - because we have high in the beginning
30:13 - right so we're gonna show
30:15 - and then broadcast our message
30:22 - so what we're going to broadcast is snap
30:25 - like a finger snap so that
30:28 - that nose will do a finger snap right to
30:30 - make everything disappear
30:32 - so that works well because uh scratch
30:34 - will have something like ghost effect
30:36 - we can make things disappear okay
30:39 - we can put this one and then we are
30:42 - going to
30:43 - hide it okay so now we have done the
30:47 - gauntlet code but we still go back to
30:49 - the anonymous right
30:50 - to fix it okay so now we have
30:54 - got hit by laser right the club now
30:56 - we're gonna do the among us
30:58 - uh just pull this event here
31:01 - and change it to snap
31:04 - okay and what we want to do is we're
31:07 - going to repeat 10 times
31:10 - and then i'm going to try to use this
31:13 - ghost effect west coast effect
31:17 - okay so change ghost effect
31:22 - by 10 and then we want to
31:25 - do a little weight so 0.1
31:29 - second so a little bit of weight to 10
31:32 - times
31:33 - and then we're gonna play the sound
31:38 - until done and we want to broadcast the
31:41 - message
31:42 - same thing okay so now let's let's try
31:45 - it out
31:46 - so see how it works so now number three
31:50 - for thanos who actually doesn't care
31:52 - actually way snappy
31:53 - looking on the left side snapping it the
31:56 - right side doesn't matter
31:57 - so let's say i'm facing to the left side
31:59 - if i use number three the gun will be
32:02 - somewhere
32:02 - here so as you can see you can't make
32:05 - the other guy disappear
32:07 - right and then what has the complete
32:09 - message you can go in
32:11 - same thing i mean if you think you've
32:13 - gone that's a little bit
32:14 - too close you can adjust it let's see do
32:17 - it again
32:18 - so it's right here and if you want to
32:20 - move them a little bit further
32:21 - then what you do is you go to the
32:23 - garment and change this position like
32:26 - 45-50
32:28 - so now we're done with gauntlet now
32:30 - stage three
32:31 - same thing right we don't have anything
32:33 - yet but we do have
32:35 - uh created the power for the
32:38 - laser and the infinity gauntlet right so
32:42 - in stage three
32:43 - we can go back over here so what we need
32:45 - to do we have
32:46 - like stage one stage two right so we
32:48 - need to do something for stage three
32:50 - to show it right okay so you can just
32:54 - copy this
32:56 - duplicate let me move this down a little
32:59 - bit
32:59 - i'll adjust it later so i get more space
33:03 - so now we have one two and then we'll do
33:06 - number three
33:07 - so number three you can kind of put
33:09 - whatever you want
33:10 - i have some coordinate already down but
33:12 - what you can do is just kind of open the
33:15 - this guy and just try and drag him
33:17 - around where you want to put them right
33:18 - and then you can just grab the motion
33:20 - and just put it okay
33:22 - so let's say we want to put him right
33:24 - here or whatever doesn't matter
33:26 - right then you know you can
33:29 - you know uh just drag this position like
33:32 - this
33:32 - or whatever right so i think we all had
33:35 - a hundred so we can't keep it a hundred
33:37 - so let's say we want negative 105 get a
33:40 - good number
33:41 - and then negative 100 right
33:45 - and then what we want to do is uh we're
33:47 - gonna face it to the
33:49 - let's say he's gonna face the other way
33:51 - he didn't know that
33:52 - something's happening to him okay let's
33:54 - say he's gonna face the other way
33:56 - so if i hit this back drop three you can
33:58 - see he's actually facing this way
34:00 - right and then make sure you clear the
34:04 - graphic effects of that you know
34:06 - whatever ability you did to him it will
34:08 - clears it up
34:10 - and also cyan number three you also need
34:12 - to do that
34:13 - as well i think we'll probably move this
34:16 - guy
34:18 - let's see how i want to do this
34:21 - i'm going to move this over here
34:25 - so i'm going to put this here because
34:27 - this will not change
34:31 - right so we have this this will not
34:34 - change mostly
34:35 - so we're gonna stack this up here so we
34:38 - have
34:38 - one over here and two over here so this
34:42 - is where
34:43 - two and three can open let's say you
34:46 - wanna cyan face this way or this way it
34:48 - doesn't matter
34:50 - right so either way is fine so what you
34:54 - want to do is a backdrop three
34:56 - you're going to say duplicate right so
35:00 - say back drop number three
35:01 - go to the front layer you know let's say
35:04 - you want to implement this position
35:06 - you can right so
35:09 - or you can put it in some other position
35:10 - down there so let's say you want to put
35:12 - them at this position
35:14 - and then switch to custom one and show
35:17 - all you let's say you want to
35:18 - turn around doesn't matter
35:21 - then you have to say the the direction
35:24 - so
35:25 - if you want him to turn around this is
35:27 - one into the right if you want to turn
35:28 - around then you need to do
35:30 - negative so you double click on this you
35:32 - can see that is
35:33 - turning around okay so either way so
35:36 - let's say i didn't have this
35:38 - whatever he is coming in doesn't matter
35:40 - so let's try it again
35:43 - okay so we have this guy
35:46 - here so we're gonna use the club
35:49 - [Applause]
35:52 - we are able to go in
35:56 - then we see this one let's say we use
35:58 - number three
35:59 - [Applause]
36:01 - this guy disappeared the portal open up
36:04 - we go in number three stage number three
36:08 - let's say we use the
36:10 - let's say we use the gun we shoot this
36:11 - side see it doesn't help rather than do
36:14 - it so that's why we have that
36:15 - check uh that got hit right so we have
36:18 - to have that check so it touched the
36:19 - edge doesn't matter
36:21 - i only even touch this sprite so you
36:23 - might go back
36:24 - so when i say touch the sprite then
36:28 - effect then this the photo will show up
36:31 - again we'll go in
36:34 - so as you can see we go in this is stage
36:36 - four where we've got a little computer
36:37 - in the box here
36:39 - so we don't have anything yet for stage
36:41 - four and also we hided the
36:43 - power ability breaker so the empire
36:47 - so when we say we'll get the backdrop
36:49 - number four and hide it so you get more
36:52 - room to see things right i think for the
36:54 - first three stage we want to show you
36:56 - know what the ability the
36:58 - among us character can do after that we
37:01 - don't have it
37:02 - so this is where we're going to start
37:04 - for now i think that's a pretty long
37:06 - video already
37:07 - so we got the gauntlets and then
37:11 - the hand and other stuff done and then
37:13 - moving to stage four
37:15 - so we'll walk on this next time for
37:18 - the stage stage four and other
37:21 - power ups so whatever power-ups we have
37:25 - here so we're done with these three
37:26 - first three
37:27 - we're gonna work on these one next okay
37:30 - all right
37:31 - all right thank you guys uh please like
37:33 - share and subscribe to our channel
37:36 - and comment in the comments below what
37:38 - uh
37:39 - about uh if you have any questions about
37:41 - the video
37:42 - or just love letting us know that you
37:44 - know we'll do a good job or something
37:46 - that would be greatly appreciated
37:47 - all right see you guys next time bye
