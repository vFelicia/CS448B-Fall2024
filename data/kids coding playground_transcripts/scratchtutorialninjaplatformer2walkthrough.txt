00:00 - hello and welcome back guys to the kids
00:02 - coding playground today we'll be doing a
00:04 - ninja platformer so here we have our
00:06 - ninja platformer 2 so this is going to
00:09 - be a walk through of the game
00:11 - so about two years ago my dad made a
00:13 - tutorial on the ninja platformer one and
00:15 - it was kind of buggy so here we have the
00:18 - second one so we've been working on this
00:20 - for a while and we made it improved it
00:22 - so now it's not as buggy anymore
00:24 - and we'll be probably launching a
00:26 - tutorial for it soon but in the meantime
00:28 - here we have our walkthrough for the
00:31 - game and if you would like to try the
00:32 - game uh yourself then you can
00:36 - click on the link in the description and
00:37 - we'll have the game there
00:39 - so basically just use arrow keys to move
00:41 - around and one two and three to use the
00:43 - sword kunai and glide so let's play the
00:44 - game
00:46 - so we have to break the box
00:48 - to get the gem to get into the portal so
00:50 - you know the portal
00:51 - so you can use the sword or kudai so we
00:53 - just play two we can kill the
00:55 - medusa
00:57 - then we destroy this we get a
00:59 - gem and we can just go
01:01 - into the portal
01:03 - just kill the medusa
01:06 - we can kill the
01:07 - destroy the box
01:09 - and then we get into here
01:10 - so here it's telling us to glide so we
01:12 - can glide up into here so we can destroy
01:14 - the flower thing so we can get to the
01:16 - portal
01:18 - so we can kill the medusa and then we
01:20 - get the portal
01:21 - so here we can destroy this look up the
01:24 - portal is going to spawn on top so you
01:25 - can glide up there
01:27 - and gliding is necessary sometimes
01:29 - so you can jump up glide
01:32 - to get up there slide using down arrow
01:34 - key this line destroy the
01:37 - box i mean the barrel
01:38 - slide back and then we're going to use
01:40 - the glide to get up to the top we're
01:43 - going to wait until the middle passes oh
01:45 - and as you can see we got hit so we died
01:47 - and we're going to fly up again and then
01:49 - we're going to go
01:50 - to 9 so we can take out the medusa to
01:52 - get to the portal
01:54 - next let's glide up here to destroy this
01:57 - barrel
01:58 - slide into
02:00 - and jump over the spikes
02:03 - destroy that and glide it to the top
02:06 - and then that's it that's pretty much
02:08 - the game destroy this
02:10 - and then go to the final portal and yeah
02:12 - that's pretty much it
02:14 - for our ninja platformer two this will
02:16 - be a new series probably coming out soon
02:19 - um it's much better much more improved
02:21 - than the first one
