00:44 - to make frank move it to that position
00:46 - and jump down and smash a pumpkin
00:48 - once once player gets 30 points and the
00:51 - player wins the game you can change the
00:53 - point to
00:53 - win higher but for demo we kept at 30
00:57 - points
00:59 - smash the pumpkins game we'll be
01:01 - learning these following concepts in
01:02 - scratch
01:03 - variables loops broadcast and weight
01:06 - cost some sprite
01:07 - mouse positions x and y and custom block
01:13 - shout out question of the week so we had
01:16 - a
01:17 - community post we'll be posting next
01:19 - week too so
01:21 - we have a few people that were one of
01:24 - the first persons to
01:25 - show us so ahman abhishek single
01:28 - said it was 34 is the correct answer and
01:30 - that is correct
01:32 - and let's try new things with deversh
01:35 - said it's 34 and that's also
01:37 - correct amita gosh uh told us that the
01:40 - correct answer is 35
01:42 - 35 is also correct you can also use 35
01:44 - 35 is also a correct answer
01:46 - so is 34 so they're both correct answers
01:50 - for the unknown
01:53 - so anyways great job on that guys
01:56 - i'm pretty sure all of you guys got that
01:58 - correct and um
02:00 - so if you got uh if you guys wanna you
02:03 - can you guys can comment in the comment
02:04 - section below or you can also comment in
02:06 - our new community posts and you might
02:08 - have a chance of
02:09 - having a shout out so yeah
02:13 - so please like share subscribe and
02:17 - smash the like button like frank is
02:19 - smashing a pumpkin basically
02:22 - so i will be demoing this game so let's
02:25 - full screen
02:28 - and you can see a place on music i just
02:30 - turned down the music there's three
02:32 - jack-o-lanterns
02:33 - and um the backdrop is continuously
02:36 - changing
02:36 - color there's a score on top
02:40 - so i'm gonna click right here and frank
02:42 - comes down and he smashes the pumpkin
02:45 - they're randomized colors and they give
02:46 - you random score so
02:48 - let's break some pumpkins
02:53 - so you can break two at once which is
02:55 - pretty cool
02:56 - in my opinion so yeah so this is a
02:59 - pretty fun game in my opinion so
03:05 - and we won you win yay
03:09 - so you can get your own pumpkin from
03:12 - online or you can download ours in the
03:13 - google drive links in the description
03:16 - so yeah so we have a bunch of
03:19 - costumes for you now we started the
03:22 - project
03:23 - so yeah you have to make a project of
03:26 - course
03:27 - and you have to untitled 31 you
03:30 - that's not a good name so you're gonna
03:32 - name it smash
03:34 - the pumpkins
03:40 - so we will be working on the backdrop
03:42 - first
03:43 - so the backdrop is the easiest so we'll
03:45 - finish this
03:46 - first so i do have some things in my
03:49 - backpack and i will get to that
03:50 - so i think i use forest or woods
03:57 - so it's creepy we can delete the scratch
03:59 - cat
04:00 - that's not useful and so the backdrop
04:04 - when the green flag is clicked
04:08 - it will go forever
04:11 - and play sound a sound that you want so
04:14 - i used a movie
04:15 - too so
04:16 - [Music]
04:21 - so mine was a little bit different so as
04:23 - you can see
04:24 - movie 2 is a little bit quicker than
04:26 - mine so i made a slow board one
04:28 - so i in my opinion i think that sounds
04:30 - better but you can
04:32 - make uh your movie too or any sound you
04:36 - want
04:37 - so let's just play movie two until done
04:41 - green flag is clicked we'll clear all
04:44 - graphic effects
04:45 - because um we're going to make the woods
04:47 - change a little bit color
04:48 - so when i when forever it will
04:51 - change color effect by one
04:56 - so let's see how it looks like
05:02 - so it looks really cool it's like slowly
05:05 - changing color
05:08 - like it's like halloween like really
05:11 - creepy
05:11 - so i we will be working on the frank
05:14 - next
05:15 - so frank is actually in the sprite live
05:19 - library so you can go to frank
05:25 - right here
05:28 - he's a little bit too big so i will make
05:31 - him
05:32 - size 50 or maybe 75
05:36 - that's too small
05:37 - [Music]
05:40 - 75 but so
05:43 - when the green flag is clicked i will
05:47 - set score
05:48 - to zero so i have to make a variable
05:51 - called score
06:00 - it'll go to a position so i have
06:03 - coordinates so we can just move it
06:06 - around here but
06:07 - i will type it up so negative 150
06:11 - and 25 you don't have to copy exactly my
06:14 - coordinates but
06:15 - if you want to you can and point in
06:17 - direction
06:18 - nine remember you can pause whenever you
06:20 - need it so
06:22 - that's great if you need the pause so
06:26 - it'll switch costume to frank a so this
06:29 - is the regular costume
06:31 - frank b we don't really need frank b you
06:33 - can delete it if you want that's
06:34 - optional but
06:36 - and we need frank c in d
06:40 - so switch costume to frank a set
06:43 - rotation style left right so it will
06:47 - not be um turned around
06:50 - so we already have that i think no we
06:52 - don't so let's just click on there too
06:54 - we already have this but you know just
06:57 - for extra protection
06:59 - just in case it doesn't work so let's go
07:02 - forever
07:04 - and you need a if then statement if then
07:07 - the mouse is down
07:09 - because the mouse is clicked
07:12 - basically uh
07:16 - it will glide 0.1 seconds you can make
07:19 - it glide like 10 seconds if you want but
07:23 - but it's just quick so glide 0.1 seconds
07:27 - to mouse x and now it's y so let's just
07:30 - put these two
07:31 - so go to where your mouse is and then
07:33 - they'll broadcast
07:34 - smash
07:39 - and wait i always get that wrong so
07:42 - broadcast smash
07:44 - and wait
07:50 - so we need a broadcast smash and wait
07:52 - because
07:54 - when it smashes down let me finish the
07:56 - animation
07:58 - so you cannot when it's still in this
08:01 - animation you can't just click there and
08:03 - you cannot spam click so that's
08:04 - basically what it does
08:06 - so we also have to do some other things
08:13 - now we're going to do some custom blocks
08:15 - so make a block
08:17 - smash
08:21 - so define smash you know glide
08:26 - 0.3 seconds to
08:31 - mouse x
08:38 - and for the y you need a plus symbol
08:42 - i'll show you just in a minute
08:46 - so i don't have the pumpkin right now so
08:49 - i have it in my backpack so let's just
08:50 - put it
08:51 - right here pumpkin doesn't have any code
08:54 - yet
08:55 - but we will put code for it so and
08:58 - mouse y and you need a plus symbol
09:03 - so you need a
09:07 - you need a um you need so let's write 50
09:11 - in here
09:11 - first and then you need the y position
09:14 - so the backdrop of stage the tricky
09:16 - block that you cannot change the first
09:18 - one you got to change the second one
09:20 - first and then you can change it
09:24 - to the y position of pumpkin
09:26 - [Music]
09:28 - so i'll show you why we need that the
09:30 - plus 50 so when you duplicate this
09:33 - i'm gonna take out i'm gonna duplicate
09:35 - this one first
09:36 - so it says 136 negative 136
09:39 - and it's way too low but when you do
09:42 - this
09:44 - of negative 86 it'll be more higher
09:47 - because if it was negative 136 would be
09:49 - like around down here
09:52 - but it's like around here uh
09:55 - i can't really drag that one but if you
09:58 - um
09:59 - do negative 86 it's around there so
10:02 - uh yeah um that's great
10:07 - so
10:11 - and then when i receive smash you're not
10:14 - done with this block of code you'll
10:16 - i'll continue with that so when i
10:18 - receive smash
10:20 - then smash and then i'll broadcast a new
10:24 - [Music]
10:30 - message
10:32 - smash
10:37 - it was supposed to be broadcast smash
10:40 - and wait
10:40 - so we're gonna take this one out
10:44 - smash the pumpkin i meant smash
10:47 - the pumpkin
11:02 - smash the pumpkin
11:05 - and also uh when i receive smash the
11:08 - pumpkin
11:10 - it will um
11:16 - whatever you smash the pumpkin it will
11:19 - wait 0.2
11:20 - seconds
11:24 - so make a frank move this is basically
11:26 - making it it'll switch costing to frank
11:29 - c
11:32 - [Music]
11:34 - so i'll show you the costumes in a
11:35 - minute and wait
11:37 - 0.2 seconds
11:42 - and we'll switch costume to frank d
11:44 - [Music]
11:47 - we'll also wait 0.2 seconds again so we
11:49 - can just duplicate this
11:53 - and it will broadcast start again so
11:57 - broadcasting wait start again
12:10 - and then in the costumes frank a
12:13 - frank c frank d
12:17 - and so
12:21 - um so we also have some other code to do
12:24 - so when i receive start again
12:28 - it will switch costume to frank
12:33 - a now go to
12:37 - negative 150 to 25 so it'll rebound and
12:42 - once you have like here it'll just go
12:44 - back here
12:47 - and you need a then statement
12:51 - if then the score
12:55 - is over 30
13:00 - then broadcast
13:05 - you win just regular broadcast no wait
13:08 - broadcast
13:09 - new message you win so the rest should
13:12 - be really easy because
13:14 - the um pumpkins are just all all the
13:16 - same just a little bit different code
13:21 - so you're almost done so when i receive
13:24 - you win then stop other scripts
13:28 - in the sprite
13:30 - [Music]
13:32 - so stop everything basically in this
13:35 - spread
13:36 - so let's test it jump here
13:40 - costumes go back to the brother we
13:42 - haven't finished the pumpkin yet
13:43 - so we just have to make one pumpkin and
13:45 - just we just have to duplicate it and
13:47 - change things up
13:48 - so we will teach you how to draw your
13:50 - own pumpkin so
13:52 - let's go in pumpkin one costumes
13:57 - so basically it's it's just a circle
14:00 - you have to just reshape it so let's
14:02 - just paint it
14:04 - so a circle it's the outline thickness
14:07 - of three
14:08 - and it's orange in the inside and it's
14:11 - just a big
14:12 - circle you just need some reshape tools
14:15 - and
14:16 - you reshape it to look more like a
14:17 - pumpkin so let's
14:19 - do that right now
14:23 - as you can see it kind of looks like a
14:25 - pumpkin i guess and we just need some
14:27 - lines and
14:28 - we can just draw the triangle nose the
14:31 - triangle eyes the triangle
14:32 - mouth so you just need some lines
14:38 - uh outline is three fill is white
14:41 - so you can make a black if you want i'm
14:43 - not sure if the insides of a
14:45 - pumpkin eye is like white or black but
14:48 - we use white here so
14:49 - um uh so fill
14:53 - completely white oh what we can just
14:57 - duplicate that
14:58 - um that one so
15:01 - just duplicate it ctrl c ctrl v
15:04 - and put the other eye and the nose is
15:06 - almost the same
15:07 - but just um a little smaller
15:12 - [Music]
15:17 - and also we need to do the mouth
15:27 - so i'm just trolling the lines right now
15:39 - so i'm gonna learn more lines uh
15:44 - i don't know what to say right now
15:47 - oh yeah and we're done with the mouth so
15:49 - we can just color that white
15:54 - saturation color and also we have to
15:57 - make the top
15:57 - so it's just a circle but that's green
16:01 - and then you just need to reshape it
16:02 - just a little bit
16:06 - so as you can see it's outlined and we
16:09 - have to put it in the back because
16:10 - in the front it looks a little bit worse
16:13 - so put it in the back
16:14 - and you just have to reshape it or you
16:16 - don't have to reshape it just turn it up
16:18 - so we delete this costume and we also
16:21 - have to make the second
16:22 - costume it's just a bunch of broken
16:24 - circles
16:25 - and a smashed pumpkin
16:27 - [Music]
16:31 - basically you just have to draw little
16:33 - circles put those
16:35 - the decorations and just um
16:38 - and and just put the stem and
16:42 - draw and reshape them so i'm gonna draw
16:43 - them in the same costume so then i don't
16:45 - have to delete it twice
16:48 - so
16:51 - we just duplicate the eye that we got
16:54 - and put it like on one of the pieces
16:56 - like it's the eye piece that you just
16:58 - smashed off
17:00 - and we can just duplicate this one and
17:02 - duplicate the orange thing
17:03 - and um make it like reshaped a little
17:06 - bit too
17:09 - so this looks like a smashed pumpkin and
17:11 - you can also draw like little lines like
17:14 - a mouth
17:18 - so
17:20 - [Music]
17:23 - you can put the mouth
17:26 - basically
17:29 - [Music]
17:30 - and we can also make a nose p a nose
17:32 - piece and another eye piece because
17:35 - um he has two eyes and a nose so
17:41 - saturation
17:45 - so you probably get the point so um we
17:48 - can delete this costume now
17:50 - and let's get cody so let's go to
17:52 - pumpkin
17:54 - so when the green flag is clicked
18:01 - it will clear graphic effects
18:10 - so first we actually have to do a my
18:13 - block actually
18:14 - sorry about that and it's called set up
18:20 - define setup and it'll switch costume
18:23 - to costume what
18:27 - i'll change color effect by pick random
18:34 - if i pick random one
18:37 - to 300 you can make one to like a
18:40 - thousand if you want
18:41 - but uh i i picked 300.
18:45 - and it'll go to a position so we this is
18:48 - the
18:48 - recording that we have so uh so later we
18:52 - will get to this and
18:53 - do something about it and we'll tell you
18:55 - so and i'll show
19:00 - and so let's continue off of this green
19:03 - flag
19:03 - so when the green flag is clicked it
19:05 - will clear all graphic effects and
19:11 - so reset the color and it'll set size to
19:13 - 50
19:15 - because it's a little bit big but we
19:17 - already have it at 50 so
19:18 - it doesn't really matter and then define
19:22 - setup so it will call the setup
19:27 - i mean not fine call the setup here and
19:30 - this will define it and then it will go
19:32 - forever
19:36 - and if then statement if then it's
19:39 - touching
19:40 - frank then it'll break
19:43 - so touching frank and broadcast
19:46 - broken pumpkin one
19:53 - we have three pumpkins so it will be
19:55 - different so
19:56 - gotta make a new one broken
20:00 - okay so it's broadcasting weight
20:06 - so broken pumpkin
20:11 - what and then
20:15 - when i receive broken pumpkin one
20:20 - then i'll change score by a pick random
20:23 - score
20:24 - so change score by
20:29 - one to five pick random
20:37 - and i'll switch costume to number two
20:41 - but it's broken and i'll wait one second
20:44 - [Music]
20:46 - hide
20:49 - and when i receive start again
20:56 - then i'll wait one second and just set
20:58 - up again
20:59 - or call set up again and
21:02 - um and when i receive you win
21:05 - [Music]
21:11 - then it will switch costume to costume
21:14 - one
21:18 - and stop other scripts in the sprint
21:26 - so basically this is the code we just
21:28 - have to duplicate this
21:32 - so i'll show all the code for this so if
21:35 - you have missed anything feel free to
21:37 - pause or just wait five seconds
21:41 - and then frank if you don't have this
21:45 - code
21:45 - pause whenever you need it and so let's
21:49 - test it out
21:50 - save now so
21:53 - bam bam bam bam it's only one pumpkin
21:56 - right now
21:57 - background changing color music is
22:00 - playing
22:01 - or go wherever you want so the pumpkins
22:03 - will be somewhere around here
22:05 - so um you cannot spam it as you can see
22:08 - i'm trying to click as hard as i can
22:10 - and i'm not spamming it so i can't spam
22:13 - because of the broadcast smash and wait
22:16 - so we'll be also duplicating this
22:20 - but just changing up a little bit code
22:22 - so
22:23 - uh i'll duplicate pumpkin two
22:26 - instead it's broken pumpkin two
22:30 - so we also have to go to x ten because
22:32 - the but we have to make the same as
22:34 - negative 136.
22:36 - if it's for me it's negative 136. you
22:38 - gotta make it the same as pumpkin one
22:40 - for the y and then
22:45 - this is going to be broken pumpkin
22:53 - again two
22:56 - and instead of receiving burgundy one
22:58 - broken
22:59 - pumpkin two and i think that's it
23:02 - so we also have to do pumpkin three so
23:06 - so instead we have to change this to 175
23:10 - x and instead of broken pumpkin one or
23:15 - broken pumpkin two it's of course broken
23:17 - pumpkin
23:19 - three and we also have to change this to
23:22 - broken
23:23 - pumpkin three
23:26 - [Music]
23:29 - so we will add the winning so i have it
23:32 - in my backpack right here it's already
23:34 - centered so
23:36 - you win it's right one so we are almost
23:39 - done
23:40 - inches away so when the green flag is
23:42 - clicked
23:44 - it will hide
23:47 - and when i receive you win
23:53 - then go to zero zero x
23:56 - zero y zero so it's in the middle and
24:00 - we'll go to the front layer so
24:01 - we have that right here and
24:05 - show and also stop
24:09 - everything let's test it
24:18 - [Music]
24:19 - so as you can see that gave me random
24:21 - score and
24:22 - i'm trying to break these pumpkins
24:24 - they're changing this
24:25 - works fine right and the backdrop is
24:28 - changing all these colors
24:30 - and uh the music is playing so
24:34 - it's happy halloween guys i'm just gonna
24:36 - eat this game
24:38 - and you win
