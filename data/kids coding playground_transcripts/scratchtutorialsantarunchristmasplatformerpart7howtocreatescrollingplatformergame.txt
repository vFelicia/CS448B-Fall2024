00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - hello scratcher
00:09 - welcome back to our kids calling
00:11 - playground so today we are doing the
00:13 - santa run part seven
00:17 - i think we probably have a couple more
00:19 - parts to go before we finish
00:21 - the enemy is kind of hard so today we're
00:23 - gonna plan to work on the spike
00:25 - and then the uh maybe the um
00:29 - the next level okay with the igloo
00:32 - so um we're gonna do that
00:35 - so for now let's pick up the igloo
00:38 - sprite
00:39 - from my backdrop i think you guys have
00:42 - this already
00:43 - in your i might have uploaded if not
00:45 - i'll check later
00:46 - so uh this is pretty simple you have
00:49 - that i just got added some
00:50 - ice block put it in here in the igloo
00:53 - okay
00:54 - i believe you guys have that if not i'll
00:57 - update later
00:58 - to the drive to boot right so um
01:01 - okay let's get started so last time we
01:03 - did the uh
01:04 - the sound so this is all for the sound
01:08 - make sure you get the correct uh list
01:11 - okay the soundless
01:13 - if it's one then we play the sound after
01:15 - we play the sound we'll make it back to
01:17 - zero
01:17 - okay so that way you know you will not
01:19 - play this down multiple time
01:22 - uh same thing in the other one
01:25 - and then last time we also work on the
01:28 - background scrolling
01:29 - so uh this is the code for that so you
01:32 - miss that
01:33 - you can add it in okay uh so
01:36 - today we're gonna work on the include to
01:38 - after you hit the igloo the
01:40 - center will jump up and then we can move
01:42 - on to the next level
01:43 - so when we move on to the next level we
01:45 - need to call the uh
01:46 - level two here okay so now we're gonna
01:48 - do the spike
01:49 - first okay okay let's move on to the
01:53 - spike
01:54 - so the spike is uh really similar to um
01:58 - you know other other thing that we had
02:00 - like the virtual ground you know
02:02 - uh what we can do is uh we can copy some
02:05 - of the code from
02:06 - from the virtual ground or what not and
02:08 - then we're gonna
02:10 - change it okay so for now let's grab
02:12 - this
02:13 - grab the reset grab the setup
02:17 - [Music]
02:18 - grab the movement
02:22 - grab the clone
02:26 - and position
02:30 - okay i hope we have all of that let's
02:33 - just kind of space it out a bit
02:37 - okay move ground
02:40 - setup reset
02:43 - and then start okay so we are going to
02:47 - change a bit for the spike
02:49 - okay in the beginning we want to
02:51 - actually hide it
02:53 - okay let's drop all that uh we actually
02:56 - don't need to set
02:57 - any position because it's gonna be move
02:59 - around with the spike
03:01 - so uh placing the cone myself we don't
03:04 - need this
03:04 - okay delete that because we're actually
03:07 - putting at the wherever the position is
03:09 - we're not moving
03:10 - 480 like like the other one we're not
03:13 - going to use one we're going to use
03:14 - number here
03:16 - um so what we're gonna do
03:19 - is okay so this one will be a little bit
03:24 - different we will not put the x here
03:26 - okay what we're going to do is we're
03:29 - going to say
03:30 - clear clone myself
03:34 - and then we can put the show here
03:37 - okay and then um
03:41 - when i create that when i create a clone
03:43 - myself so what we're going to do
03:45 - is we're going to move them to the
03:47 - position
03:50 - when i start as a clone okay
03:54 - so um i'm going to move this to this x
03:57 - and y we have set it up here right the x
03:59 - and y
04:00 - we're going to change all this later
04:01 - okay don't worry about that so for now
04:03 - let's just continue with this one
04:06 - um what we can do is
04:10 - we're going to use this forever loop
04:15 - and then we are going to get a if
04:17 - condition
04:18 - here
04:21 - okay and then we are saying
04:26 - sensing with
04:30 - touching the main character okay
04:33 - basically this character here
04:35 - and then we'll use another control here
04:41 - inside this if i'm gonna check the
04:43 - animated type
04:44 - so what happened is uh when you
04:48 - um this animated type is like when it's
04:51 - like
04:52 - dying or something like that we don't
04:53 - want it to die again right so what we're
04:55 - going to
04:56 - check for zero so zero meaning uh
04:59 - the uh center is still alive nothing had
05:02 - happened to him
05:03 - he's well and good okay
05:06 - and then we are going to use the another
05:09 - if statement here
05:12 - okay here we are going to check
05:15 - uh you remember like when the center
05:17 - died right um the sound
05:20 - i recorded myself uh here ouch in
05:24 - like whatever you like so that's my
05:26 - sound recorded
05:27 - so we're gonna play that sound so the
05:29 - ouch is the
05:30 - second one right so what we're going to
05:33 - do is we'll go back here
05:36 - and then we say um let's get the
05:38 - operator here
05:41 - uh go to the uh the list
05:47 - now we make sure you select the sound
05:49 - one okay
05:50 - number two so basically if it's item
05:53 - number two is equal to zero
05:57 - then we'll replace it
05:59 - [Music]
06:03 - okay replace item number two
06:06 - with one so that way it will it will
06:09 - play
06:09 - okay so when let's say easy this one
06:12 - when it's one then it will play and then
06:14 - we'll set it back to zero
06:15 - so when we wanna play we wanna make sure
06:17 - we set it to one
06:19 - so we when the spike hits the
06:22 - center we want to play the sound right
06:24 - also we want to
06:25 - set something here called hit
06:31 - so this is right here one is touching it
06:35 - okay okay sorry
06:38 - about that um this is actually inside
06:41 - here
06:42 - when it's actually uh animated type is
06:44 - zero so we don't wanna
06:45 - keep on broadcasting when they touch the
06:48 - character
06:49 - only if it's not dead we want to
06:51 - broadcast one time
06:54 - i mean set this one time so that way you
06:56 - know it will
06:58 - know that it's get hit and then we'll
06:59 - deduct one life on it
07:01 - okay so put it inside the um
07:04 - this condition here the animation type
07:06 - equal to zero
07:07 - okay so i'll explain
07:10 - i'll explain how we actually use this
07:13 - head so this hit is actually go to here
07:16 - you see this right then
07:19 - somewhere here
07:26 - so the hit is actually here in the
07:28 - animated sprite
07:30 - here so when it gets hit we'll make make
07:32 - it dead and then we'll do this uh
07:34 - that animation okay all right so it's
07:37 - right here
07:38 - okay now let's go back to the this one
07:41 - here
07:43 - so we want to make sure that when it's
07:46 - uh
07:47 - when it's reset we're gonna delete all
07:49 - the clone
07:51 - when it's set up we're gonna change this
07:54 - out a little bit
07:55 - okay so exactly the back layer will make
07:58 - it go to the front layer
08:00 - okay so we want the spike to show up
08:02 - okay
08:03 - uh what i'm going to do is i'm going to
08:06 - make it
08:06 - point in direction 90 and also make sure
08:09 - your spike is uh
08:12 - so so we should use this one um
08:15 - this not this one because we're gonna
08:17 - flip them upside down
08:19 - so uh that's why you wanna use put the
08:21 - spike on this one all around okay
08:26 - so um when you play this
08:29 - we are going to put the clone at
08:32 - i have some coordinate already done but
08:35 - i'll show you why
08:36 - what you can do okay uh negative
08:43 - negative 95
08:46 - okay so so as you can see um
08:50 - later i'll run there and then you can
08:52 - see it but uh not yet this is not ready
08:54 - yet
08:54 - so um we have to fix something else
08:57 - let's see if everything is good we have
09:00 - the g
09:00 - scrolling done this is should be good
09:05 - the position one um
09:09 - clone that that's fine uh the clone one
09:13 - that looks
09:13 - fine let's throw this away
09:17 - and then the position one
09:21 - that looks like it's fine and
09:25 - yeah that looks fine now let's just try
09:27 - it out so let's save it
09:31 - okay so let's see we have any uh yep
09:34 - there's a that's the spike is here
09:40 - okay so as you can see this spike is
09:43 - here so uh what you can do is
09:45 - um you want to know the direction right
09:48 - you can put it anywhere i mean you can
09:50 - put it anywhere
09:51 - for me i put in the background but it
09:53 - doesn't matter
09:54 - uh you can put it like in the main
09:56 - character but main character and all
09:57 - this is too many things there
09:59 - so we don't want to put it there so what
10:01 - you can do is this
10:05 - when the m key is pressed basically the
10:08 - mouse or whatever
10:09 - i'm in position so we're gonna say let
10:12 - me see if i have those variable
10:14 - um yeah i have a mouse position so we're
10:16 - going to set this
10:19 - so set global
10:23 - mouth position okay i'm going to use
10:26 - some join here
10:30 - and then we're going to use another
10:31 - joint
10:32 - [Music]
10:35 - and then we are going to use a plus sign
10:38 - as a plus sign
10:44 - okay uh we're gonna use the mouse button
10:47 - i think it's in sensing mouse
10:50 - x and then we're gonna say plus
10:56 - the scroll x okay
10:59 - put that into the first join
11:02 - now we can put a comma here and a space
11:07 - and then we can take this duplicate
11:10 - we're gonna use mouse
11:11 - y uh this one we can right click and say
11:15 - scroll why or you can just delete it and
11:19 - drag one here
11:20 - okay go back to sensing so
11:23 - almost y then we'll put it here
11:28 - so you can see so it's joining this
11:30 - comma
11:31 - and then this put that here
11:34 - and then you can call this thing called
11:38 - show variable
11:42 - mouse position okay all right so let's
11:45 - just check it out
11:46 - so let's run it so let's say i want to
11:49 - put a um
11:50 - put the spike here you can click click
11:53 - the m
11:53 - key you see this is 40 80 whatever
11:56 - negative 80.
11:58 - so if you put here you can put one
12:02 - like let's say duplicate this 40
12:06 - negative 95 whatever so because i'm
12:08 - using 95 right so
12:10 - it will be correct so you see so if you
12:13 - if you have it at negative 80 or
12:15 - whatever it might be too high you can
12:17 - just adjust that so let's run this you
12:19 - see every 8 is too high because
12:22 - even though i push the m key here right
12:25 - so you see i push the m key here because
12:27 - you have to put in the middle right so
12:28 - you see this is too high
12:30 - so yeah you know it should be somewhere
12:32 - here so i have negative 95 so
12:35 - you can just adjust it okay adjust it
12:37 - any way you want
12:39 - okay so i have it like this then i have
12:41 - two
12:42 - right so you see i have two
12:45 - [Music]
12:46 - okay so that's how you put multiple of
12:49 - these uh
12:50 - little uh red spikes so
12:53 - let's go back to my coat i still have a
12:57 - little bit more to do
12:58 - so um i have some um some of the spike
13:02 - let's say i wanted to uh
13:04 - flip him upside down i'll delete this i
13:05 - don't need the first one
13:07 - uh so if i want to flip it upside down
13:10 - you can change this direction
13:12 - right uh to negative 90.
13:16 - okay and then we're gonna create some
13:19 - chrome here actually
13:21 - uh i'm gonna create a rows of spike
13:24 - i already have coordinates for it so if
13:26 - you don't have it you can have to move
13:28 - it to that location and put it
13:30 - so for me you know i have it as 184
13:35 - negative 26
13:40 - 1902
13:44 - negative 26 i should have duplicate
13:48 - from this one so i have less typing but
13:50 - anyway
13:51 - let's just finish that uh
13:55 - this is one nine nine five
13:59 - and two zero seven zero
14:02 - okay so this is the row of spike where
14:06 - center can slide through so i turn it
14:08 - upside down
14:10 - and then you wanna turn it back up then
14:12 - you have to say
14:13 - point direction 90. i'll do one more
14:17 - clone i think i have one more spike at
14:18 - the end and my original game
14:21 - i'll put one more here uh two
14:24 - two four five zero and then
14:28 - that's negative 95. okay so that's my
14:32 - spike so let's run that real quick
14:36 - so you can see you have the
14:40 - center here and then you have the row of
14:42 - spikes coming up
14:44 - see there you go so i have to slide
14:47 - through
14:48 - if i don't slide through and get stuck
14:50 - hit that and i'm gonna die
14:51 - so see so this is the last one so this
14:54 - is that row of spike and i flip it back
14:56 - upside down i'm gonna flip my right side
14:59 - up and then i put this last one
15:00 - so you can click the mouse here you see
15:02 - it's 240
15:04 - 50 you see that 249.95 so
15:07 - somewhere like that okay so that's how
15:10 - it
15:10 - is so for the spike
15:13 - okay so what we're going to do is we're
15:15 - going to add this include the in that
15:17 - the center jump on it goes to the next
15:19 - level
15:20 - so right now i don't have any code so
15:21 - just grab the code from here
15:23 - let's move it from the spike
15:26 - one the reset to
15:30 - set up three
15:33 - so this one
15:36 - four five
15:40 - six and seven okay
15:44 - i think we have all the coal the clones
15:47 - down here
15:49 - movement here you can place them any way
15:51 - you like
15:52 - but i'm trying to put them the same as
15:55 - the other one
15:56 - so kind of easy to see
15:59 - okay all right so we have the igloo
16:03 - so the include i'm trying to put at the
16:05 - end so we actually don't need all this
16:08 - too many things here so let's throw that
16:11 - away oops we'll leave one of the clone
16:16 - okay let's go from the top first make
16:18 - sure that is correct so we want to high
16:20 - in the beginning
16:23 - the position plays the clone position
16:27 - that is the same so show
16:30 - okay the other one the position
16:34 - that should be the same okay things
16:37 - change there
16:39 - the clone here is we have to that is not
16:42 - gonna die
16:42 - right so when i touch the main character
16:45 - what we want to do
16:46 - is we want to podcast
16:51 - broadcast events
16:54 - saying new message
16:59 - next level okay
17:02 - and then what we want to do is we also
17:05 - want to stop this
17:06 - uh script so we don't want to go forever
17:10 - okay stop the script
17:14 - and we can trash all this
17:18 - okay so we have the scrolling i think
17:20 - the scrolling is fine the x and y
17:23 - is scrolling very good uh so this one we
17:26 - want to put it at
17:29 - i have it cornered down but if you don't
17:31 - you have to go to the end
17:32 - and try to get it so you remember we
17:35 - were like
17:35 - really close like two thousand five
17:37 - hundred i mean four hundred fifty so
17:39 - somewhere down we go three thousand
17:41 - three hundred so we're gonna put it at
17:44 - negative sixty
17:47 - okay all right so now let's check it out
17:50 - so um oh this will still not work yet
17:52 - because the next level we haven't coded
17:54 - yet
17:55 - so let's call that first okay so let's
17:58 - go back to
17:58 - our main character okay
18:02 - let's call it here
18:05 - when i receive a next level
18:09 - okay uh what i want to do is i'm going
18:12 - to stop everything else
18:17 - stop other script in the sprite
18:21 - okay i want to stop everything
18:26 - we'll broadcast a message
18:28 - [Music]
18:30 - now we're broadcasting wait sorry
18:35 - new message called
18:38 - victory okay whatever you like so that
18:42 - means
18:42 - he got to the end and then we're gonna
18:44 - broadcast a new message
18:47 - call stop new level
18:50 - okay that's already there okay so we're
18:52 - gonna do this victory dance and then
18:54 - we'll podcast a new level
18:56 - and then this is a next level broadcast
18:58 - when you touch that igloo
18:59 - okay so you glue will touch and call
19:01 - that
19:02 - okay all right okay so now let's go back
19:06 - to the center so we need to fix the uh
19:10 - because we broadcast victory right we
19:11 - want to make him dance a little bit
19:14 - so um center here uh when i receive
19:20 - uh victory so let's zoom in a little bit
19:25 - uh what we want to do we want to stop
19:27 - out of script in the sprite as well
19:30 - okay and then we're going to change this
19:34 - level
19:35 - so we're from level 1 we're going to
19:36 - change it to level two
19:38 - change level by one okay
19:42 - and then what i'm going to do is i'm
19:44 - gonna switch the cost to
19:50 - uh jump okay i'm gonna switch the jump
19:52 - custom
19:54 - and then i say uh repeat
19:58 - 15 times
20:01 - and then i will say change y
20:04 - by five
20:07 - okay and then look
20:10 - next costume
20:14 - uh and then uh switch it back to the
20:17 - first costume actually
20:20 - oops sorry i don't mean him to jump up
20:23 - so now we're going to change it back to
20:25 - negative 5
20:28 - okay and then after that we want to stop
20:31 - the spoon
20:37 - stop this grip okay so when i get to the
20:41 - igloo it'll jump up
20:43 - i just repeat 15 times i think that's i
20:45 - have 15 costume of jump costume or
20:47 - something
20:48 - let's just take a look so let's look at
20:51 - jump you see
20:52 - i have a jump one two
20:54 - [Music]
20:55 - jump yeah 15 you see even 16.
20:59 - so yeah so doesn't matter so i actually
21:02 - have 16 but anyway
21:04 - so i repeated 15 you can repeat 16 if
21:07 - you like
21:08 - doesn't matter uh okay yeah i repeat 15
21:12 - because we already switched it to the
21:13 - first costume so second
21:15 - let's go into the next costume right so
21:17 - that's why it's 15. okay
21:18 - got it so 15 is correct uh because we
21:21 - have 16 custom and we already switch it
21:23 - to the first one
21:25 - so now that this will go to the next
21:27 - custom right so what you had to do is uh
21:29 - for the next level you have to make your
21:31 - clone if not
21:32 - there was nothing for the centers to
21:34 - stand on right he'll fall
21:36 - okay so let's go to the ground i will do
21:39 - real quick
21:41 - um same thing here we'll do
21:45 - duplicate we'll say two
21:49 - and we are going to use the uh switch to
21:52 - costume
21:53 - number two one and we will place
21:58 - the clone
22:01 - at zero zero
