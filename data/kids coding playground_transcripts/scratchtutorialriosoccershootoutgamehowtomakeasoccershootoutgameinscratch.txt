00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kitchen on
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:09 - another video in scratch and today we
00:11 - will be making a game called
00:15 - rio soccer shootout and let's see what
00:18 - this game is all about so let's play it
00:20 - there's a whistle sign in the beginning
00:22 - bullseye's moving everywhere this keeper
00:24 - is here guarding the goal very tough and
00:26 - you click space oh yeah and you have 10
00:29 - balls over here
00:30 - and you score zero so
00:33 - that's a goal
00:34 - so it has a chance to leap up and get
00:37 - your ball so let's see
00:39 - [Applause]
00:41 - uh
00:42 - i missed okay
00:46 - all right so that's three
00:48 - [Applause]
00:52 - i'm trying to win here
00:58 - so it looks like i won here and if you
01:00 - run out of balls you lose
01:02 - yeah and there's a little thing in the
01:04 - beginning
01:06 - you have to get five points to win and
01:07 - wherever the target is that's where the
01:09 - ball is going to be so
01:14 - so i started my new project and of
01:16 - course we delete this scratch
01:18 - uh uh sprite so we have the sprite
01:22 - we have the bullseye
01:24 - we you can come by my project and export
01:26 - the sprites we have the ball
01:29 - we have or you can draw on your own we
01:30 - have the keeper
01:32 - we have
01:33 - the
01:34 - backdrop
01:36 - we have the goal post
01:39 - the net
01:41 - the waves there's a lot of stuff in here
01:44 - and there's the cloud
01:46 - and there's the score whatever to win so
01:50 - let's do this so first we have to start
01:52 - off the bullseye
01:55 - so we have the
01:56 - when the green flag is clicked
02:00 - it will set size to a hundred percent so
02:04 - it's going to be pretty big
02:05 - in the show
02:08 - and after that it will um
02:10 - go to this certain position
02:17 - so so um we have our bull's-eye so we
02:21 - just wanted to start around here so
02:24 - because we want the bullseye to start
02:25 - around there and go around so
02:28 - go to this position
02:30 - and then it will go forever
02:34 - and glide to this position
02:40 - and
02:41 - glide
02:43 - one second to this position
02:46 - and then it'll glide to
02:49 - to
02:50 - this position
02:53 - which is
02:55 - this and then it'll collide to this
02:58 - position so we're getting a bunch of
03:00 - coordinates down here
03:02 - and then it'll collide to
03:05 - this position
03:10 - and then it'll glide to
03:12 - oopsies this position
03:19 - and then it will glide
03:22 - back up
03:27 - so yeah
03:29 - so i'm going to put 0.5 on here so
03:34 - we use the same coordinates so negative
03:36 - 113
03:38 - and
03:38 - uh positive 82.
03:41 - so yeah
03:44 - and now let's see look it's gliding
03:50 - seems right and we'll go back up so now
03:52 - we have to do another script so when the
03:55 - green flag is clicked
03:57 - it'll clear the graphic effects because
03:59 - it will constantly change color so you
04:01 - want to clear in the beginning and then
04:03 - uh
04:04 - we have to put forever
04:07 - let's make a new variable uh
04:09 - to make x
04:14 - and then we have to make
04:16 - y
04:20 - and then now we have to make set x
04:23 - to x position up here
04:26 - so it will follow
04:29 - and then
04:30 - set
04:32 - y
04:36 - to
04:37 - y position
04:42 - the reason for this is it'll keep track
04:45 - of the place where you click space and
04:46 - then you'll shoot the soccer ball so
04:48 - that's for later use and now i would
04:50 - change color effect
04:54 - by 20 doesn't really matter but 20 why
04:56 - not and then let's go to the ball we do
04:59 - have some last script to code in the
05:00 - bulls eye but first we do have to do the
05:03 - ball first unfortunately so let's do
05:05 - this so when the green flag is clicked
05:10 - it'll set ball to 10. so you have 10
05:13 - balls to shoot so let's make
05:18 - set ball to 10.
05:22 - we set our ball to 10. so
05:26 - and now we have to set score which is
05:27 - another sprite i mean variable set score
05:32 - to zero
05:34 - and it'll go to the front layer
05:36 - because the ball is always in front
05:40 - set size to 50
05:44 - so after that we have go to x
05:49 - uh
05:51 - we have to find a position so zero
05:53 - negative 80
05:55 - and then it'll place down the whistle so
05:58 - oh we already have the whistle so that's
06:00 - really nice
06:03 - whistle until time so
06:05 - these uh sounds are actually from the
06:08 - ball sprite so you guys can export the
06:10 - sprite from my project and i'm
06:12 - gumball098 so just go to my project and
06:16 - export it and you also also can download
06:18 - it from the google drive but you have to
06:20 - use your own google account to do that
06:21 - so
06:22 - so okay so let's move on
06:25 - so when the space key is pressed
06:28 - if then
06:31 - and
06:34 - if then the ball is greater than zero
06:39 - so the ball is greater than zero
06:44 - oh and
06:45 - not
06:46 - so you need a knot
06:50 - uh
06:51 - and not equal
06:54 - score fives
07:00 - and if you still have balls and
07:04 - uh you
07:06 - don't have
07:08 - um
07:09 - more less yeah you don't have
07:12 - you don't have five points yet you can
07:14 - continue playing and um
07:16 - so you can continue shooting the goals
07:18 - so
07:19 - let's get broadcast
07:24 - shoot and wait so we have to actually
07:25 - make a new message here
07:28 - shoot and wait
07:33 - and uh now when i receive shoot
07:40 - oh change ball by minus one because you
07:42 - lost the ball from shooting
07:45 - and
07:46 - it will glide 0.5 seconds to x and y so
07:49 - that's why we track down the coordinates
07:51 - for bullseye because the ball has to go
07:53 - to the position where you shot it from
07:55 - so you need glide 0.5 seconds to
08:00 - x and y
08:06 - and now you need an if then statement
08:09 - so if
08:10 - then you need a and statement if then
08:16 - it's touching the net so you need
08:18 - touching net
08:21 - and
08:22 - not touching keeper that means you get a
08:24 - goal so not touching
08:31 - touching
08:34 - then broadcast goal and wait so that's a
08:37 - new broadcast message we will be using
08:38 - that later
08:43 - broadcast goal
08:45 - and weight and you also need an if then
08:48 - statement
08:49 - if then it's touching the keeper which
08:51 - you don't get the point for
08:55 - then it will broadcast miss and wait
09:04 - so now we're done with that uh we still
09:06 - have a little bit more code to do so
09:09 - let's finish this off so you want to
09:11 - give some effect to the thing so when
09:13 - when i broadcast when i receive shoot
09:15 - it'll repeat 12 times
09:18 - it'll get smaller and smaller so it
09:20 - looks like you kicked it away so that
09:22 - will
09:23 - add effect so
09:24 - change
09:26 - size
09:27 - by -2
09:31 - and now when i
09:33 - when i receive shoot then it will play
09:37 - sound kick off
09:38 - until done
09:40 - so because you kick the ball
09:42 - so if you want to put this into one
09:44 - script you could actually put this
09:46 - inside here but you have to use the
09:49 - start sound block
09:51 - instead of
09:52 - the
09:54 - you want to put it up here
09:56 - uh uh you want to put start sound kick
09:57 - off up here you don't want to do play
09:59 - sound until done you can put it into one
10:01 - uh
10:02 - script if you want and now you have to
10:03 - go back to the bullseye to finish off
10:05 - the shoot
10:06 - so when i receive
10:10 - shoot
10:12 - it'll hide
10:15 - and because you are thing you are
10:18 - kicking the ball so it will just hide so
10:20 - then you can see where it is so
10:22 - hide wait two seconds and then it will
10:25 - show again
10:27 - and now we're done with all of those
10:29 - scripts over there we have to go to the
10:30 - keeper
10:32 - so
10:33 - so we're actually not done with the ball
10:35 - yet so we have to continue the ball
10:37 - there's a little bit more scripts over
10:38 - here so
10:39 - uh when i receive gold
10:42 - it will wait one second
10:45 - and it will do an if then statement if
10:48 - then the score is equal to 5
10:56 - then it will
10:57 - broadcast win which you win if you
11:00 - broadcast win and wait
11:04 - so one
11:08 - and wait and then after that you need an
11:10 - if then statement
11:13 - if then the you need to and so i'll
11:16 - explain this when i'm done so
11:19 - so i'm going to explain this when i'm
11:20 - done so
11:21 - if that equals zero
11:25 - if the ball
11:27 - equals zero
11:29 - and
11:31 - not
11:34 - score equals five
11:37 - you still lose because uh you you ran
11:40 - out of balls and
11:42 - uh you
11:44 - did not complete the quest of getting
11:46 - five points so
11:48 - you still lose though broadcast a new
11:50 - message
11:52 - and wait
11:55 - lose
11:56 - lost
11:59 - now we have lost and then this is just a
12:01 - few scripts so when i receive goal i'll
12:03 - play sound goal until done
12:06 - because you won
12:08 - you got the goal
12:09 - and then you
12:10 - when i receive
12:13 - miss
12:14 - it's boo
12:17 - all right so now we have to do this so
12:20 - when i receive goal it will change score
12:23 - by one
12:28 - because you got a goal so now you're
12:30 - gonna get one more score it'll say
12:34 - goal
12:38 - for one second
12:39 - and
12:41 - uh
12:42 - you have to wait one second
12:45 - and it'll set size back to 50 so it'll
12:48 - go back to normal size so then you can
12:49 - kick it off again
12:53 - and now it will go to the position where
12:55 - it was earlier so go to x
12:58 - 0
12:59 - y
13:00 - negative 80. so we have that
13:04 - and now we have to get missed so when i
13:07 - receive
13:10 - miss
13:13 - oh wait one second
13:15 - and it will if then statement
13:19 - if the ball equals zero
13:22 - so if you ran out of balls
13:26 - you still lose so where's ball
13:29 - uh broadcast lost
13:32 - and wait
13:36 - and now
13:37 - you're done with that script we have to
13:38 - do when i receive miss
13:44 - um
13:45 - you have to say miss
13:47 - for one second so say
13:52 - one second
13:53 - and it will wait one second
13:57 - and it will do the same as this because
13:59 - it will wait once i can set the size
14:01 - back to 50 and go to the place where it
14:03 - was originally so this is a lot of code
14:06 - so if you need to take a moment to pause
14:09 - i know it's really small
14:12 - so now the code is organized you can
14:15 - feel free to pause and here's all our
14:17 - code so i'm gonna give you a few seconds
14:23 - and
14:24 - we have shoot we have space bar we have
14:27 - the green flag
14:29 - and more shoot over here
14:31 - so feel free to pause goal
14:35 - all throughout there
14:37 - and then
14:38 - miss
14:40 - all over there
14:41 - so now let's test out
14:43 - our
14:44 - ball so our bull's eye is working
14:47 - perfectly it looks like knuckle
14:50 - now we have to code the keeper so it
14:53 - works
14:54 - uh hello so now we have to code the
14:56 - keeper so let's go to the keeper
14:59 - and when the green flag is clicked
15:04 - i have to also have to hide the
15:06 - y
15:07 - so when the oh yes i have to rename this
15:09 - to rio
15:11 - soccer
15:13 - shoot
15:15 - and now when the green flag is clicked
15:17 - it will set the size to 45
15:23 - and it'll switch costume to keeper one
15:28 - go to x
15:29 - i think i already have the position for
15:31 - him yet
15:32 - and forever
15:35 - it will wait 0.5 seconds
15:41 - and next costume
15:45 - and now
15:46 - see our costumes we have one two one two
15:49 - so it looks like he's ready to carve
15:51 - now we have when i receive shoot
15:56 - we have to have glide
15:58 - 0.5 seconds
16:03 - to a pick random place so we're gonna
16:05 - pick random
16:09 - negative 90
16:12 - to positive 90.
16:15 - so as you can see the
16:16 - x for this keeper from negative 90 see
16:20 - negative 98 to positive 90
16:24 - and there's also the y so pick random
16:29 - from
16:30 - 20
16:32 - to 70 so
16:34 - maybe from here 20
16:37 - that's yeah 20 around 20 and then to 70
16:40 - yeah so that's
16:42 - our code over here and then wait two
16:44 - seconds
16:47 - and then it'll go to
16:49 - back to that position
16:56 - yep
16:58 - all right and this is the code so
17:00 - feel free to pause
17:02 - so let's try this out real quick so he's
17:04 - in his position
17:05 - we have that
17:06 - miss
17:07 - uh
17:09 - [Applause]
17:16 - so it's just a pick random wherever
17:19 - and it doesn't look like he's too smart
17:21 - so i want to add something called
17:23 - perfect block so it doesn't look like
17:24 - he's too smart so i'm gonna make perfect
17:26 - block so when i receive shoot
17:30 - it will set perfect block
17:33 - a new variable
17:36 - perfect
17:38 - block
17:42 - and
17:44 - it will set perfect block to pick random
17:48 - one to three and if you want it to be
17:50 - harder like really hard you can do one
17:52 - to two so it's a really high chance
17:54 - you'll get your ball but i'm doing one
17:56 - to three so it's more easier for me and
17:59 - then i'm going to use it if then else
18:01 - statement
18:03 - uh per if perfect block equals one
18:08 - perfect block equals one
18:10 - and it will glide 0.5 seconds
18:15 - to
18:20 - seconds to x and y
18:22 - but
18:23 - remember from the bullseye we have the x
18:25 - and y we've marked down the coordinates
18:27 - well if it equals one so it's going to
18:29 - pick a random number and then if equals
18:31 - one it'll go to that coordinate and
18:32 - it'll catch your ball so we have that
18:34 - and then i'm just gonna drag in this
18:36 - script right here
18:38 - yeah um else it will go somewhere random
18:42 - and then it'll wait two seconds and go
18:44 - back there so now we are done with the
18:47 - keeper
18:48 - uh
18:50 - let's organize our variables a little
18:51 - bit so ball
18:54 - score
18:55 - so you see perfect block
18:57 - let's see it's one so he will get the
19:00 - ball but what if it's three it's a goal
19:03 - so let's see
19:04 - and it's one again so
19:07 - three again so
19:08 - it's perfect block right there
19:11 - hide it real quick
19:16 - and now we have to work on the goal post
19:19 - which has barely any code just when the
19:21 - green block is clicked just in case it
19:24 - will go to this position
19:26 - just in case if it moves or whatever and
19:29 - our net
19:30 - that has
19:32 - exactly the same code just
19:36 - you know just in case
19:38 - and now our wave which has some code so
19:41 - unless we're gonna wave so it's just
19:43 - gonna add some effects so the green flag
19:45 - is clicked it will go to x zero zero
19:50 - y zero and then it'll go forever
19:55 - it'll repeat three times
19:59 - and wait 0.2 seconds
20:03 - so it'll go up and down and up and down
20:05 - and up and down and it'll change y
20:10 - by
20:11 - -10
20:13 - and then i'll repeat another three
20:17 - let's just duplicate that and just make
20:18 - some tweaks to it put it under do not
20:20 - put it in wait 0.2 seconds instead of
20:23 - change y by negative 10 change y by 10
20:25 - so it's like what down up and down and
20:27 - up and down
20:30 - so as you can see look at the waves look
20:31 - at the waves
20:32 - and now let's look at the clouds which
20:34 - is just some extra
20:36 - you know
20:38 - look so
20:39 - when the green flag is clicked
20:42 - it'll go to this position i think i have
20:44 - the position yet and it'll go forever
20:48 - he'll go forever um
20:52 - well let's just make this even uh
20:55 - repeat
20:56 - oh
20:57 - repeat two times
21:00 - and it will wait 0.4 seconds
21:05 - it will change y by minus 1 so go up and
21:07 - down and up and down just like the waves
21:09 - but just in the sky so change y by
21:13 - -1
21:14 - and then you just have to duplicate this
21:18 - put it under
21:19 - and then change y by one
21:22 - so we have our game and our banner is
21:24 - the last thing to code on our list so
21:27 - let's see what we have to do this year
21:29 - so when the green flag is clicked we
21:31 - have our three costumes you can either
21:33 - go to my thing my project and export the
21:35 - sprites or you can either write your own
21:38 - i think it's pretty easy to write on
21:39 - your own you just need some uh text and
21:41 - just write it so when the green flag is
21:44 - clicked
21:46 - so three costumes are the start score
21:48 - five to win are one and the lost
21:52 - and when the green fog is clicked um
21:55 - it'll go to
21:56 - x 0 y negative 40. i'll go to the front
21:59 - layer so be in front of everything and
22:01 - it will switch costume to start so it's
22:03 - in the beginning
22:05 - so switch costume to start
22:10 - and then it will show
22:15 - and then it'll wait 0.5 seconds
22:19 - and then it will hide
22:22 - and after all of that
22:24 - when i receive
22:28 - one
22:29 - that no go to
22:34 - uh same position and
22:36 - switch costume to one
22:41 - and it'll show
22:44 - and then it'll stop
22:46 - so
22:48 - it's the end of our project
22:50 - if you win and now we have to do the
22:52 - lose so just duplicate when i receive
22:55 - lost it'll go to this position switch
22:58 - costume to lost instead of one show and
23:00 - stuff so let's test out our game over
23:04 - here so we have our 10 balls our bulls
23:06 - eye is moving our goals keeper is
23:08 - dancing our waves are moving our clouds
23:10 - are slightly moving our score
23:14 - and we missed let's see what we get
23:17 - so he got basically two ones in a row
23:19 - and i got maybe a two or three so
23:23 - let's see
23:26 - i think i'm gonna lose this one though
23:28 - [Applause]
23:31 - it's really hard actually to do this
23:35 - okay that's one more ball please
