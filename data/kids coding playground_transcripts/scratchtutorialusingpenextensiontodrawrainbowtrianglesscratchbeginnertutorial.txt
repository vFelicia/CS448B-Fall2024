00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's keith's coming
00:08 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video in scratch and today we'll
00:12 - be making a simple tutorial for
00:14 - beginners and um so first thing you do
00:16 - is delete the sprite because we do not
00:18 - need this for um
00:20 - this specific tutorial and we start by
00:23 - making a sprite
00:25 - you make it red
00:29 - and then outline no outline
00:32 - and then we make a circle
00:39 - and
00:40 - it's a little bit too big right now i'm
00:41 - gonna make it a little bit smaller
00:45 - let's go like that
00:48 - so okay so now we're finished with our
00:52 - dot number one
00:54 - so then we got our code here
00:57 - and when the green flag is clicked
01:03 - we will point in direction
01:08 - uh
01:09 - pick random it'll be a pick random
01:12 - from negative 180 so
01:16 - to positive 180 so it can be all over
01:19 - the place
01:20 - and then we go forever
01:23 - it will move 10 steps
01:27 - and if it's on the edge it will bounce
01:28 - so if it gets on that edge it will just
01:30 - go
01:31 - bounce and plus we need a pen sprite i
01:34 - mean uh let's just duplicate these dots
01:36 - first so we duplicate this dot turn this
01:39 - into dot two and dot three so now we
01:42 - have three dots and these are all the
01:44 - dots um and we're finished with the code
01:46 - for dot one the two and dot three
01:48 - because all three of them are the exact
01:50 - same code and now we're gonna make our
01:53 - fourth yacht so
01:56 - let's name that
01:58 - drawing dot
02:02 - and um
02:04 - when the green flag is clicked not the
02:06 - same code uh you need put to click this
02:09 - little extra block
02:11 - section
02:12 - and then you see all these um
02:15 - little extra blocks things so you click
02:17 - on the pen because that's the one that
02:19 - we need so erase all in the beginning
02:21 - because you don't want any when you
02:22 - click on the green flag already and
02:24 - you'll want to set pen size
02:30 - to
02:32 - eight
02:34 - after when you do that you want to go
02:36 - forever
02:39 - and pen up
02:43 - go to dot one so you'll draw
02:48 - so
02:49 - it's pen up right now so it's not
02:51 - drawing you go to dot one so you do go
02:55 - to
02:56 - dot number one so go to the first dot
02:58 - and then this is when it starts drawing
03:01 - so and then it'll go pen down
03:04 - so this is when it starts drawing
03:06 - and then it'll go all throughout it'll
03:09 - go to
03:12 - it'll go to dot 2
03:16 - and then dot
03:19 - three
03:22 - and then
03:23 - back to dot one
03:26 - so
03:27 - you go pen up go to dot one
03:30 - and then pen down and we'll go to the
03:33 - fir second dot the third dot and then
03:35 - back to the first dot so it will be
03:36 - drawing
03:37 - a triangle
03:39 - and then
03:41 - you want to make it multi-colored so you
03:43 - want to change the pen color by 10 so it
03:47 - will be changing
03:50 - color
03:52 - and then we need a green flag so when
03:54 - the green flag is clicked it will go
03:55 - forever
03:58 - it will wait 10 seconds
04:03 - and then it'll erase all so every 10
04:05 - seconds uh the cycle restarts
04:08 - it'll erase
04:10 - and then you it restarts
04:12 - so
04:13 - feel free to pause and i'll be giving
04:14 - you a few seconds to check down this
04:17 - code
04:18 - to make sure it is correct so feel free
04:21 - to pause always
04:22 - and
04:23 - uh the other code
04:26 - we're not finished yet this so feel free
04:29 - to pause at this point
04:31 - and our backdrop we need a new backdrop
04:34 - which is called stars
04:38 - and well you could use any other
04:39 - backdrop but this one looks kind of
04:41 - galaxy like so i just used it
04:43 - and we have our um music
04:47 - so
04:48 - when the green flag is clicked
04:50 - set the volume to 25
04:53 - so you can hear over me
04:55 - and then it will go forever
04:58 - you know play sound
05:00 - you remember you can use any music you
05:02 - want and there's a lot to explore a lot
05:04 - of
05:05 - you can
05:06 - listen to
05:07 - so the one i use is play dance snare
05:10 - beat
05:12 - and we have that and i'll play that
05:16 - until done
05:18 - so
05:20 - let's try this game
05:22 - as you can see it is making the triangle
05:25 - and it is making it and every 10 seconds
05:28 - will reset you can hear the music
05:30 - and
05:31 - uh you see the background and it will
05:33 - restart
05:35 - so let's rename this project to
05:39 - rainbow
05:42 - triangle
