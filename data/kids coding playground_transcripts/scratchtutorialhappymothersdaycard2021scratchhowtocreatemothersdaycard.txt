02:55 - made one of his projects and it's called
02:57 - cells use that full screen at your risk
02:59 - so it's a really good project
03:01 - so as you can see let's look at this so
03:05 - uh you can click on this
03:09 - and there's a bunch of cell stuff like a
03:11 - lot of learning stuff you can learn here
03:13 - it's really fun to learn
03:14 - and you can also zoom out you can zoom
03:17 - in
03:18 - you can zoom in you can zoom out you can
03:20 - zoom in
03:21 - stuff like that and there's also random
03:24 - stuff which you can learn about mitosis
03:26 - and other things that
03:30 - might be coming up in upcoming tests for
03:32 - you guys
03:33 - so as you can see uh i'm just going to
03:36 - go back
03:37 - and start this again and there's that
03:39 - animal cell
03:41 - and there's the all the things of the
03:44 - animal cell
03:45 - so yeah you can zoom in zoom out
03:48 - so so really cool project guys you guys
03:51 - should check it out
03:52 - so one four three four one five please
03:55 - um look at his projects uh and
03:59 - he even has a tank game arena assault
04:01 - game but no one was playing at that time
04:03 - so i couldn't
04:04 - demo that one so anyways um
04:07 - see you when i get back to the project
04:09 - so first things first i gotta change the
04:11 - name
04:12 - to this project to mother's day card
04:14 - because
04:15 - mother's day
04:20 - so yeah we have that done so
04:24 - um first uh if you did not know a
04:26 - backpack you can watch our video
04:28 - in our channel and we also have a bunch
04:30 - of things in our backpack so
04:31 - i'm gonna be dragging these things from
04:33 - my backpack into there but i'll also
04:35 - attempt
04:35 - trying to draw these things so
04:39 - uh also you can also download this from
04:41 - my project i'm gonna delete this right
04:42 - real quick
04:43 - uh so you also you can download all
04:45 - these things from my project or looking
04:46 - on google drive
04:47 - so yeah so first i'm gonna try to paint
04:50 - this
04:51 - it might look a little bit worse because
04:52 - my dad drew the original one
04:55 - and i'm drawing this one so i'm gonna
04:59 - first make the card
05:02 - which is just a simple rectangle
05:05 - um you can do any color you want
05:10 - and yeah you can also change the colors
05:13 - so from this color you can just make a
05:16 - bunch of
05:17 - a variety of colors like orange
05:20 - why not you can make
05:24 - yellow
05:29 - yeah you make blue it doesn't matter
05:31 - what you mean it doesn't matter
05:33 - but you can always make different types
05:35 - of cards
05:36 - because different color is always best
05:39 - so yeah
05:40 - now we're going to work on the flower
05:44 - nevermind since the heart is first i'll
05:45 - work on the hearts this time so
05:47 - first you have to do the heart so
05:49 - there's the tricky part duplicate and
05:52 - then you can add the costumes into it
05:54 - so just get one of these so you can
05:56 - center out the hearts in which way you
05:57 - want
05:58 - so this is the good part so you put the
06:00 - hearts
06:01 - the tricky part
06:05 - as you can see you put the heart you can
06:08 - use the pointer
06:10 - do that ctrl c ctrl v you know the deal
06:13 - and then you put that you make this
06:15 - small
06:17 - put one over there you put that to
06:19 - center where you want your hearts
06:21 - because if you put it in another place
06:22 - it might have looked a little bit
06:24 - different
06:25 - so you need to keep this um card over
06:27 - here so
06:28 - yeah just select that whole thing group
06:31 - it and put it on the bottom
06:32 - so as you can see now the hearts are
06:35 - centered um
06:36 - at least i think their centers and you
06:37 - can also flip them over to make
06:40 - a nice heart card so yeah
06:45 - we have the hearts so you can delete the
06:48 - card now and add on the hearts on your
06:50 - original card
06:53 - so now we're going to work on the flower
06:55 - so i have two types of flowers the rose
06:57 - and the
06:58 - tulip in the sun i don't need i think
07:01 - that's a corn flower i don't know
07:04 - so i don't i don't yeah so
07:09 - so i'm going to trash this sprite
07:10 - because we already have one and trash
07:11 - that as well
07:12 - so now we're going to work on the flour
07:14 - so
07:16 - so now i'm gonna paint it
07:19 - so this is i really like the color
07:23 - context like after after you make those
07:26 - colors
07:26 - colored flowers i like that process so
07:29 - first i'm going to make the thickness of
07:30 - the line 10.
07:34 - so you put that over there and then um
07:38 - you have to make the tulip yeah the
07:40 - tulips the bundle of tubes so you make
07:42 - it five
07:44 - so you can drag that like that so the
07:46 - tulips
07:51 - and as you can see you can put those in
07:55 - the middle
07:55 - and you can also draw the tulip itself
07:59 - and that you can use red
08:03 - or yeah red for now and then we can
08:05 - color it later so
08:07 - first you have to use the outline no
08:09 - outline
08:10 - and then you have to do make a circle it
08:12 - might not look like a tulip at first
08:14 - but when you reshape it it'll look a lot
08:17 - different so as you can see i'm dragging
08:20 - everywhere making the two up smaller
08:22 - bigger
08:22 - wider so yeah as you can see
08:26 - that's the two loop and then you can
08:28 - copy paste this so
08:29 - you move it this way and then copy paste
08:31 - it
08:34 - ctrl c ctrl v
08:37 - and then you can drag it the other way
08:39 - so as you can see i made tulips so you
08:40 - can also color them so i'm gonna do one
08:42 - costume for you guys to see
08:44 - uh a yellow tulip
08:47 - so oh see it's really easy i really like
08:51 - this part because you can make different
08:53 - shades of colors and
08:54 - it looks pretty cool in the end because
08:56 - i made a baby blue and a
08:57 - blue and it kind of looked pretty good
08:59 - in my opinion so
09:01 - now we're going to work on the oxyay
09:04 - daisy
09:05 - the daisy or the corn flour i don't know
09:07 - what it's called but
09:08 - still it's a flower so now we're going
09:12 - to work on the daisy i'm just going to
09:13 - call it the daisy
09:14 - so first you make the daisies middle
09:16 - which is yellow
09:18 - but first you keep the the outline so
09:22 - from the tulip so because that's the uh
09:25 - 10 thickness i'm going to draw another
09:27 - line and make it a little bit higher
09:29 - so as you can see shift so make a
09:32 - straight line
09:34 - because this is a little bit hotter and
09:36 - you can make the leaves
09:37 - and the petals so i'm gonna do the
09:40 - leaves first
09:40 - i'm not sure if i'm gonna do the better
09:42 - i might than my dad or worse
09:45 - but i'm gonna go no outline and then go
09:50 - for the leaves
09:54 - so the leaves sorry i actually dragged
09:56 - to blue
09:57 - so now leaves are always green right no
10:00 - they can be red in
10:01 - other colors like on maple trees and
10:03 - stuff so yeah
10:05 - uh so this leaf
10:09 - reshape pull it out a little bit
10:13 - so it looks like an egg right now like a
10:15 - green egg like a life egg or something
10:17 - from like a dragon game
10:18 - so yeah you just flip over the egg
10:22 - or the leaf now and put it on control
10:24 - see control v
10:26 - and put a second one additionally on the
10:28 - top
10:29 - or on the side you can even it out
10:32 - it's better if you put it uneven because
10:34 - of the
10:36 - you always you know always uh there's
10:39 - always like
10:40 - unevenness in the leaves of flowers like
10:43 - it can go anywhere and also i added it
10:46 - on the tulips
10:47 - because they also have leaves i'm pretty
10:48 - sure and yeah
10:51 - so i'm gonna make the petals but first
10:55 - yeah the petals so i'm trying to reshape
10:58 - it
11:02 - so shift reshape i also have to make the
11:05 - middle of the daisy
11:07 - so as you can see that's a pretty fine
11:09 - pedal in my opinion
11:12 - yeah uh so looks like a sunflower seed
11:15 - actually
11:16 - not that good yeah looks like corn
11:18 - purple corn yeah purple corn
11:20 - yeah it's actually not even that good so
11:22 - yeah you can make it smaller
11:25 - do that flip it and then you can also
11:28 - make the middle of the thing
11:30 - the middle of the daisy a different
11:33 - color just duplicate it
11:35 - and then ctrl c ctrl v i'm adding the
11:38 - corn on the petals guys
11:40 - corn on the stem
11:44 - so yeah we're adding the petals slowly
11:47 - maturely
11:49 - and yeah we'll make it sooner or later
11:52 - and we'll be able to get to the code
11:54 - because it's been 11 minutes and 48
11:56 - seconds
11:57 - so yeah and i can also make the middle
12:00 - after one more petal on the top
12:04 - yeah this doesn't look as good as the
12:05 - last one looks like some
12:08 - purple corn on the stem with a
12:11 - middle so i'm going to make a middle
12:12 - which is just a yellow
12:14 - middle
12:20 - and then add that on so shift so you can
12:23 - make
12:24 - a pretty nice circle that's even
12:27 - everything so as you can see that is my
12:29 - flower
12:30 - compared to the last one
12:34 - yeah okay so this is what i'm this is
12:38 - all you need and you can just also
12:39 - duplicate the costume to make the color
12:41 - context
12:42 - so you can oh yeah you can make the swap
12:45 - really easy
12:46 - so the swap you can make it two
12:49 - different colors
12:50 - like you can make be creative like you
12:52 - can make
12:53 - a cyan with a
12:58 - light blue almost i like that blue and
13:01 - then you do
13:02 - you can do this and look you're making
13:04 - pretty good
13:06 - pencils see yeah i i like these petals
13:09 - in my opinion because of the
13:11 - color and i just really like
13:14 - it how it is because different color
13:17 - flowers have different petals so i'm
13:19 - just going to delete this sprite
13:21 - for now and i'm in forever and then now
13:24 - i'm going to
13:24 - work on making the buttons so i'm going
13:26 - to make all the buttons
13:28 - i did do a color on it to make it more
13:30 - lively
13:31 - so i use button 3 which is just this
13:34 - button
13:34 - nothing special about it i'm gonna put
13:36 - it over here
13:40 - delete this and i'll use this one
13:43 - because why not
13:44 - and i'm gonna make the flower color
13:47 - so which is just um i did a color
13:50 - color context thing i'm not sure if it's
13:54 - even called colored contacts i just
13:55 - decided to call it that i'll just call
13:57 - it that for now and so i made a
13:59 - dark like a dark maroon on one side and
14:01 - then a
14:02 - light almost red pink
14:05 - i mean light red almost pink
14:09 - so yeah and i'm gonna film this one too
14:13 - so that's what i did for this one and
14:15 - i'm gonna put on the text
14:16 - i use handwriting because handwriting is
14:18 - honestly my favorite and then i'm gonna
14:21 - change the color
14:24 - is handwriting and
14:27 - this must say flower color
14:32 - so now we can shrink it and everything
14:34 - so
14:35 - it will fit in the button and it'll not
14:37 - get off of the button i'll make a little
14:39 - larger
14:40 - yeah this seems good yeah so flower
14:44 - color
14:45 - and you also have to center the button
14:49 - so i'm gonna drag this out
14:53 - and i'm gonna group these two together
14:56 - and drag them to the center and get this
15:00 - thing
15:00 - and drag it into the center oh
15:04 - so go to the front and drag it into the
15:07 - center and there you go
15:09 - flower color and now i gotta work on
15:13 - the other ones so just duplicate and
15:15 - just
15:16 - tweak it a little bit so on this one i
15:19 - used a blue and a white
15:22 - it was just a decision i made i don't
15:24 - know why
15:25 - and i did this and i made this i did a
15:29 - blue like i think almost like a grape
15:32 - blue so i honestly pretty like that one
15:35 - and then there's a white
15:38 - i felt like using a white on this one
15:40 - because
15:44 - so i'ma change it for both of them it
15:47 - looks a little bit
15:49 - unseeable but that's fine
15:56 - and that and then i'm gonna move
16:00 - this when i last did it it didn't look
16:02 - that
16:03 - unseeable but that's fine that's
16:04 - probably because oh yeah i'm just gonna
16:06 - change this to card color
16:11 - oh so because card has less numbers
16:14 - i mean letters in this in the name it
16:17 - will
16:18 - kind of fit and you can kind of see the
16:20 - r so
16:21 - that's card color and then i'll move
16:23 - this under here
16:25 - and now i'm going to make
16:28 - um message so
16:32 - who doesn't like a message to your mom
16:34 - so yeah
16:35 - uh so two mom message
16:40 - and then i made a green color
16:44 - for this thing uh a green
16:49 - like a dark green
16:53 - with a white but i can change it to
16:57 - maybe a magenta because oh i like this
17:01 - one pink rose this one looks nice
17:03 - or this one this one looks pretty nice
17:05 - as well so i'm gonna
17:08 - snazz this up yeah it looks like a
17:11 - flower
17:11 - because this is like the stem and then
17:13 - this is the
17:14 - petals so i honestly like this color so
17:18 - yeah we have it message and let's put
17:21 - this on
17:22 - oh yeah i forgot to change the backdrop
17:23 - to a different color
17:25 - because the backdrop is supposed to be a
17:28 - baby blue and
17:30 - this video is all about colors
17:33 - you're learning about colors guys and so
17:36 - it's just a
17:37 - like a baby blue and just draw a
17:40 - rectangle
17:42 - and there you go so colors colors colors
17:47 - and now uh we have to do
17:51 - the code for all the buttons which is
17:54 - button three is
17:55 - actually this one i should rename this
17:57 - the button one and then this is button
18:00 - two
18:01 - yeah that that works why is it say
18:03 - button four it doesn't matter let's just
18:04 - rename
18:05 - button three so button one is flower
18:07 - button two
18:08 - is card button three is message okay so
18:11 - now we're gonna code in
18:12 - button one so button one is flower color
18:18 - so when the green flag is clicked
18:23 - it will go to x
18:28 - what i have coordinates but i'm not
18:29 - going to use them because
18:31 - this looks great it's it's around the
18:33 - same position anyways
18:35 - and then when this sprite is clicked
18:39 - it will broadcast next flower
18:42 - color
18:47 - it says not that much code but
18:50 - the color really enhances the project so
18:53 - now we're going to work on this one
18:56 - so this is the card color so this and
18:59 - then i just made it go to here
19:01 - why not and then when this sprite is
19:04 - clicked
19:07 - it will broadcast next card
19:10 - color
19:17 - core what is a core anyways so next cod
19:20 - color
19:21 - and now we're going to work on button
19:24 - three which is message
19:26 - i really like this one better than the
19:28 - other message i made so this one
19:30 - when the green flag is clicked it will
19:32 - set the message to mom so you gotta make
19:34 - a new
19:36 - become variable message
19:40 - so yeah and now a while this is really
19:44 - zoomed out i'm going to show you guys
19:46 - up close message to mom
19:55 - and now you gotta go to a position i
19:59 - already have at this position so why not
20:02 - and i'm gonna drag this message over
20:05 - here
20:08 - so when this sprite is clicked
20:16 - maybe up here yeah that one that's a
20:18 - great position
20:19 - so i'm gonna have that right there and
20:21 - then
20:22 - so i'm gonna change this real quick
20:26 - so it says to mom now so
20:29 - you gotta double click that to make that
20:31 - change so he did not know that
20:34 - i learned that yeah so when this writes
20:37 - clicked
20:37 - i'll ask you what is
20:41 - what do you what what would you like to
20:43 - write because
20:45 - what i i have a
20:49 - caps lock on what would
20:52 - you like to write
20:56 - and i'll ask you that as a question
20:58 - because yeah
21:00 - you know set message to
21:03 - join so you need to join um
21:07 - so it'll go to and you
