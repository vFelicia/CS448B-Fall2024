00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding CLR today we'll be finishing
00:11 - up the um coin matching game so from
00:14 - last week we did the um check button the
00:17 - new
00:19 - button um the robot
00:22 - setup and the back drop so that's all we
00:25 - have for today today we'll be working on
00:27 - the arrows and add some more code to the
00:29 - Rob but so let's go to the first Arrow
00:34 - the down one for the one cent so for the
00:37 - down one I'm going to get a one flag
00:40 - clicked green flag is clicked zoom in
00:43 - well let's
00:46 - hide and then when the backdrop switches
00:48 - to backdrop
00:51 - too then we want to show because the
00:54 - first backdrop is the um the
00:57 - instructions backdrop and then the
00:59 - second one is the actual dis back drop
01:02 - and then after that we want to do when
01:04 - this Sprite is being clicked then let's
01:07 - get an if then statement if if selected
01:12 - one selected one is greater
01:15 - than selected one is greater than
01:18 - zero cuz this is going back that means
01:21 - minus one so if selected one is greater
01:24 - than zero that means anything greater
01:26 - than zero then we want to change the
01:29 - selected one byga 1 selected one by
01:33 - negative 1 so this Arrow all the left
01:36 - arrows are making it minus one and all
01:38 - the right arrow are making it go up by
01:41 - one all right so for the up arrow is
01:44 - pretty much the same thing but we're
01:47 - just going to um and the only reason we
01:49 - put the zero right here is to prevent it
01:51 - from being a negative number so um let's
01:55 - drag and drop all of this code into the
01:57 - up key we just have to change it a
02:00 - little
02:03 - bit like that okay so um we have all
02:06 - this code so for this one we're just
02:08 - going to take all this out just take all
02:10 - of that out and change selected one Nega
02:14 - by neg one selected 1 by one instead of
02:17 - negative 1
02:19 - okay so for the down five it's pretty
02:22 - much the same thing as well going to
02:24 - drag and drop the same code from down
02:26 - one into down
02:28 - five
02:31 - down five pretty much the same thing
02:33 - except we have to change the variables
02:35 - since I've selected one it'll be
02:37 - selected
02:38 - five uh because this is the um five cent
02:42 - down button and then we're going to
02:44 - change this to selected five as well so
02:47 - that's the code for this down for the up
02:50 - it's literally the same thing as this
02:52 - one except for the variable we just have
02:55 - to change some variables so just keep on
02:57 - repeating this until you're all done
03:00 - with all of them so up we're going to
03:03 - have to do select five and change it by
03:06 - one so up you're going to have to do
03:10 - that and then for the down one I'm just
03:13 - going to drag and drop all of this into
03:16 - the down 10 instead we're going to do
03:19 - the new other variable select 10 instead
03:22 - of Select five so just keep on repeating
03:25 - this select
03:27 - 10 and this should be select 10 as well
03:31 - so now we have all of that let's go to
03:33 - the up one so let's drag and drop
03:36 - this
03:38 - this and this
03:41 - okay and you can actually skip this part
03:44 - if uh you want you can just pause the
03:46 - video and just do it yourself so
03:49 - selected 10 change that by one and then
03:53 - finally we have the last down button so
03:55 - let's drag and drop this into the
03:58 - down
04:02 - down down button so instead right here
04:05 - we're going to change this to um 25 um I
04:09 - mean selected
04:11 - 25 and this should be selected 25 as
04:15 - well so that's for the down and then for
04:18 - the up we're going to get this
04:21 - code instead we're going to have to
04:24 - change the
04:26 - variable this variable should be
04:30 - selected 25 okay now let's try it out so
04:34 - now when you click the up and down as
04:38 - you can see when it's uh zero you cannot
04:40 - keep on going
04:42 - down goes up as you can
04:47 - [Music]
04:50 - see as you can see it's working so now
04:54 - the arrows are working out and I also
04:57 - want to show the target when it switches
04:59 - to this backdrop so so right here show
05:03 - the target variable I forgot to do that
05:05 - in the last video but in this video
05:08 - Let's just show it show the
05:10 - Target in the beginning when you click
05:13 - space the target shows up so now let's
05:15 - work on the rest of the code for the
05:18 - Retro robot so we're going to make a
05:19 - custom block for the Retro robot so
05:22 - let's make a custom block we're going to
05:24 - name it
05:27 - calculate calculate so this to calculate
05:30 - um the least amount of steps or least
05:33 - amount of coins it
05:35 - takes to get the value so in the
05:39 - beginning we're going to set all the
05:41 - calculate uh variables to zero so we're
05:45 - going to set uh so calculate one
05:49 - calculate
05:50 - 5 Calculate 10 and calculate 25 all to
05:55 - zero and then we're going to set the
05:57 - remainder to like Target
06:00 - the remainder to the Target which is
06:03 - pick random one to 100 and then we're
06:06 - going to we're going to start from the
06:08 - biggest number the 25 because we want to
06:10 - find the least amount of coins so we're
06:12 - going to start from the 25 cent repeat
06:16 - until repeat until the remainder is less
06:19 - than
06:21 - 25 repeat until the remainder is less
06:24 - than 25 the variable
06:27 - remainder and then we'll uh if this is
06:30 - true then we will set the
06:33 - remainder set the remainder to remainder
06:37 - minus
06:39 - 25 so it
06:43 - subtract let me duplicate this remainder
06:45 - minus
06:47 - 25 and then we want to change the
06:49 - calculate 25 by one because you have one
06:52 - more so you want to change the
06:54 - calculated
06:56 - 25 by one all right so now now we just
06:59 - duplicate
07:00 - this and now we just have to change this
07:03 - to 10 change this to
07:06 - 10 and instead of calculate 25 we're
07:09 - going to do Calculate 10 and change by
07:12 - one like that all right let's duplicate
07:17 - this put this under
07:19 - here this remainder is less than five so
07:25 - now we have do five change this to five
07:28 - as well instead of Calculate 10 we're
07:30 - going to calculate
07:33 - five and then finally we have down here
07:36 - we want to set the calculated one to the
07:39 - remainder the value of whatever the
07:41 - remainder
07:43 - is all right so this is the calculate
07:46 - custom block code okay now let's
07:51 - continue so remember earlier I uh
07:54 - broadcasted the message um check check
07:58 - answer well now this is where the check
08:01 - answer comes into play so we're going to
08:03 - try to find the least amount of steps
08:05 - you can do this in so we're going to do
08:07 - when I receive check
08:09 - answer we're going to calculate on this
08:12 - custom block right
08:14 - here and then we're going to get an if L
08:16 - statement okay so
08:18 - if if the selected one is equal to
08:22 - selected calculated one so this is just
08:25 - to find the least amount of steps this
08:27 - is a really long statement right here so
08:30 - we're going to need three ands I think
08:33 - yeah so let's get three
08:35 - ands um and then so we're going to get
08:37 - an equal right here equal going to put
08:40 - it equal right
08:42 - here equal right
08:44 - here and an equal right here a really
08:47 - long statement so if the selected one so
08:52 - whatever the selected is is equal to the
08:55 - amount of calculated one so the amount
08:59 - you selected is equal to the calculated
09:01 - one and selected five is equal to
09:04 - calculated
09:06 - five and then you have selected
09:10 - 10 yeah this is pretty long selected 10
09:13 - is equal to calculated
09:15 - 10 and selected 25 is equal to select uh
09:20 - calculate 25 then that means we have to
09:23 - get it say that's correct cuz that's the
09:26 - least number of steps say that that is
09:33 - correct
09:36 - correct that is
09:38 - correct and then let's say if it's not
09:42 - the least amount of steps we're going to
09:43 - get another F statement put that inside
09:45 - the else area so this is the code for
09:48 - the top just show it for a little bit if
09:51 - else inside the else area so if the
09:55 - target is
09:57 - equal all so we're going to need three
10:00 - addition
10:01 - signs let's put that right
10:05 - here wait
10:08 - um we're going to need
10:12 - this this oops sorry addition not
10:17 - subtraction uh like that and like that
10:20 - so three addition signs so if the
10:23 - selected one is multiplied by
10:26 - one so this is like if you get it
10:29 - correct but it's not the least amount of
10:31 - steps it will do this selected five
10:34 - multiplied by
10:36 - five selected
10:38 - 10 is multiplied by
10:41 - 10 uh I think we need even
10:46 - more we
10:49 - need actually we need one more addition
10:52 - sign so get an addition sign put this
10:54 - selected one um
10:57 - plus uh this
11:00 - selected
11:01 - one
11:03 - multiply oh sorry this should be
11:05 - multiply I'm doing this wrong sorry
11:07 - about that multiply so we're going to
11:10 - get this selected
11:12 - one multiplied by
11:16 - one
11:18 - plus selected five multiplied by five
11:21 - this should be multiplication not
11:23 - addition select five multiplied by
11:27 - five this is a really long one as well
11:31 - and then we need another
11:33 - addition
11:35 - uh selected 10 multiply by
11:41 - 10
11:43 - multiply selected 10 multip by 10 and
11:47 - then we need a selected
11:49 - 25 multipli by 25 so we're going to get
11:52 - addition sign one last one pop that in
11:56 - the
11:57 - front and drag drag this over here
12:00 - selected 25 multiplied by
12:05 - 25 selected 25 multiplied by
12:09 - 25 like that put that in the
12:13 - front and if that's equal to the target
12:17 - number then we will say that is correct
12:20 - but that is not the least amount of
12:23 - steps that is
12:27 - correct but it is not the least amount
12:32 - of
12:34 - coins like that and if it's just
12:37 - completely wrong then we will just
12:40 - say that is
12:45 - incorrect all right so I think we're
12:47 - done now let's test it out all right
12:49 - let's try it out let's click the play
12:51 - Space Bar new 81 so let's do three of
12:55 - these
12:57 - 75 and then we do one of these 80 and
12:59 - then one of these check that is at least
13:02 - amount of steps so that is correct let's
13:04 - put a new one let's say if we do it
13:06 - slower so let's do like six of these and
13:09 - then two of these it'll say that is
13:11 - correct but that is not the least amount
13:13 - of coins so as you can see it's working
13:15 - and when you just get it completely
13:17 - wrong it just says that is incorrect so
13:20 - I'm going to do one more
13:21 - 86 let's see three of these one of these
13:26 - and one of these that is correct
13:30 - so as you can see it is working
13:32 - now so yeah that's pretty much it for
13:35 - the coin game so thank you guys for
13:38 - watching don't forget to like share and
13:41 - subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
13:43 - next video
13:45 - [Music]
13:54 - bye
