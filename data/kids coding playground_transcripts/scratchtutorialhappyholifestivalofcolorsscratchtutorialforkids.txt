00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kid scrolling
00:09 - playground here and today we're back for
00:10 - another video in scratch and today we'll
00:12 - be making a holy game
00:15 - and um a lot of people a lot of
00:18 - celebrate this holiday so we decided to
00:20 - make a holy game because a lot of people
00:23 - just played do this holiday um this
00:26 - might this video might be a little bit
00:27 - late when it gets released but it's
00:29 - still a pretty cool game so when we
00:31 - start it under some music
00:35 - so we start it
00:37 - and then there's some music in the
00:38 - background uh ben is holding a bag and
00:42 - you use the arrow keys to move up and
00:43 - down you can't go left and right
00:45 - and you throw bags
00:47 - at
00:48 - others so then they'll change color
00:52 - and when you get to 100 color
00:54 - each person does 10
00:56 - color they will um hit you if they hit
01:00 - you 10 times that means um your colors
01:01 - will go up by 10 and if you get to 100
01:04 - that means you got colored and now you
01:06 - have to go home because you're very uh
01:08 - colorful so
01:10 - yeah we have to do we did that and if
01:12 - you throw colors at
01:14 - the people that are trying to color you
01:16 - you can um slow them down
01:19 - and then they will have to go home too
01:21 - because they are colored as well so
01:24 - you can see i'm throwing bags
01:28 - of color
01:30 - on
01:31 - these characters sometimes you throw two
01:33 - bags sometimes one bag sometimes three
01:37 - um
01:39 - each character has um
01:42 - a different amount of
01:45 - speed and
01:47 - uh health which is how long we survived
01:50 - from the back
01:52 - so
01:54 - [Music]
01:57 - you can throw multiple bags at once
02:00 - and they split two and it's a random
02:02 - position so it can go like from here
02:05 - let's get
02:06 - started
02:08 - so now let's get started so of course we
02:10 - delete the scratch cat and now we get
02:13 - our bed
02:15 - ben
02:16 - uh up here and
02:19 - if you don't want any of these costumes
02:20 - you want him throwing a bag you do not
02:23 - want him doing that or that or that so
02:25 - the first one is the regular idol
02:27 - position you duplicate that click on the
02:30 - arm
02:30 - flip it vertical it might look a little
02:32 - bit wonky right now but all you have to
02:34 - do is make it go a little bit more up
02:36 - and then you got a throwing position
02:38 - and you just keep on duplicating that
02:40 - and slowly rotating it until it looks
02:44 - like it's moving properly so as i'm
02:47 - doing right now
02:49 - but right now um i have some yeah and
02:52 - then you just move the arm off
02:54 - so right now i have my character inside
02:56 - my backpack so let's put it in our band
02:58 - because it's all the throwing ones
03:00 - this shows one
03:02 - there should be seven costumes in the
03:03 - end the idol position
03:05 - the throw one throw two throw three
03:08 - throw four throw five and throw six
03:10 - where he throws it and there's no more
03:11 - back
03:13 - so we have to import our bag too and
03:15 - actually um i drew this bag
03:18 - so
03:20 - we need two costumes a bigger one and a
03:22 - smaller one because this is the one that
03:24 - he should be holding and this is the one
03:26 - that he throws out so this one the lines
03:29 - are
03:30 - a bit thicker these are seven lines and
03:33 - these are three
03:35 - so
03:36 - so you just have to make the line
03:38 - smaller and uh make the overall sprite
03:41 - smaller so all you have to do is do that
03:42 - ctrl c
03:44 - go to your bend and if supposing you
03:47 - don't have this bag yet you put your bag
03:49 - maybe you want to make it a little bit
03:51 - smaller
03:52 - and you put it on his arm that's what
03:54 - you do for every single costume like
03:56 - this one like this one like you can
03:58 - control v right here put it up there
04:00 - so
04:02 - you want to copy the costume from before
04:04 - so you don't have to resize your still
04:06 - time see you have this
04:08 - bag
04:10 - you copy the same bag because if you get
04:13 - from the color bag again that means it
04:14 - will be um
04:17 - bigger
04:18 - and you want it to be the same size as
04:20 - before so you just copy and paste it to
04:22 - the next costume as so ctrl c
04:26 - and then
04:27 - uh ctrl v so it's the same size and you
04:30 - put it up there so that's good and now
04:32 - uh we have our color back in we also
04:35 - need our character which you can just
04:36 - get from here there's
04:38 - a bunch that you can pick from there's
04:40 - actually character one and character two
04:42 - so there's a bunch of characters but
04:43 - we're gonna use character one for now
04:45 - and
04:46 - we need
04:47 - you
04:50 - got
04:52 - colored
04:53 - so we have these three as well
04:57 - so you can go to our how to make amazing
04:59 - text video from our um channel
05:03 - and that
05:04 - was one of our newer videos so just go
05:06 - there and then
05:08 - as you can see this is how you do it so
05:10 - it's actually two layers of text
05:13 - so the first layer is just regular and
05:16 - the second layer is more bolded
05:19 - and it's darker so if you want to learn
05:22 - how to do that um
05:24 - just go to our how to make amazing text
05:27 - and you just drag it out and
05:29 - put it back in
05:31 - so that's for our text and we just
05:33 - changed a different color
05:35 - so you see you can do that
05:37 - change to whatever color you want
05:39 - and yeah you put it back in and
05:42 - have a forgot and you
05:45 - so
05:45 - now
05:46 - we
05:47 - yeah
05:49 - so we go oh yeah let's rename this real
05:51 - quick holy
05:55 - and now we go our ben
05:57 - when the green flag is clicked
06:00 - that means it will clear our graphic
06:02 - effects because in the when we get hit
06:04 - by the characters that means you'll
06:07 - change color because
06:08 - you got color
06:10 - and clear graphic effects in the
06:12 - beginning as always
06:15 - um switch costume to ben a
06:17 - let me change this real quick back to
06:19 - the big bag right here because that's
06:21 - what he throws
06:22 - um
06:23 - cleographic effects switch costume to
06:26 - ben a because that's his idol position
06:29 - the one with his hand down
06:31 - and then you'll go to x yeah i already
06:34 - have the position because i uploaded it
06:36 - from the thing so it goes somewhere
06:38 - around here
06:41 - it'll set colors to zero
06:44 - which are basically his lives
06:49 - so set colors to
06:51 - zero
06:53 - and go it will go forever
06:57 - and then if
06:59 - [Music]
07:00 - then so yeah we have our street let's
07:03 - get our street in real quick
07:07 - yeah so um
07:08 - if i'm not mistaken it's called neural
07:11 - yep
07:12 - and we delete this
07:13 - so
07:14 - for reference this is where our you want
07:16 - your ben to be so
07:19 - i'm probably over here because you don't
07:21 - want him flying up here because there's
07:23 - no way he could fly you're probably
07:25 - running from the sidewalk and down to
07:28 - the bottom of the road so
07:30 - so uh we have our and
07:34 - so if the up arrow key is pressed
07:40 - and the y position
07:43 - is less than 50
07:47 - the y position is less than 50 so it
07:50 - cannot pass a certain
07:52 - position
07:54 - and after that we need to change y by
07:56 - 10.
07:59 - and then we duplicate that it's almost
08:01 - the same concept
08:03 - now it's down arrow
08:06 - and y position
08:08 - is greater than negative 100 so let's do
08:13 - greater than
08:15 - negative 100
08:17 - so we have our y position
08:22 - negative 100 so it's over here somewhere
08:24 - so you don't want to go too low you
08:26 - don't want him to go under the ground
08:27 - because there's no way he would go under
08:29 - the road without like a drill or
08:31 - something no way you could just drill
08:33 - with his own hands so and after that
08:36 - instead of changing y by 10 it changed y
08:38 - by minus 10 negative 10 and then if then
08:43 - the space key is pressed
08:46 - then it will broadcast throw back and
08:48 - wait
08:56 - and after that we have one more script
08:58 - of code we actually have two more but
08:59 - we'll get to the other one later because
09:02 - it's from the bag so when i receive
09:04 - throw bag it'll switch costume to ben a
09:07 - which is his idol position
09:09 - oh repeat six times because he has six
09:12 - moving costumes as you can see right
09:13 - here one two three four five six
09:17 - and uh repeat six times
09:21 - next costume since this is um
09:24 - a lot of costumes you don't have to put
09:25 - a small weight
09:27 - and then wait 0.1 seconds right under
09:29 - here
09:31 - and switch costume back to then a
09:36 - so okay so i'm gonna zoom out feel free
09:39 - to pause so uh you can get all the code
09:42 - down just in case if you haven't got it
09:45 - so
09:46 - as you can see yep he is throwing the
09:48 - bag
09:50 - and yeah we can move him
09:52 - and he can't move that high there and he
09:54 - can't move that low into the air on the
09:56 - ground so yeah
09:58 - working
10:00 - so let's set the size to 100 i have no
10:02 - idea how this got to 125 but yeah 100 so
10:05 - yeah
10:07 - so his feet aren't in the ground because
10:08 - they were on the ground because he was
10:09 - 125 so we just decided to change it
10:12 - so yeah
10:14 - now it's time to work on the back
10:17 - when the
10:18 - green flag is clicked
10:21 - it will hide
10:26 - it will hide
10:30 - and
10:30 - then when i receive throwback
10:34 - it'll wait until
10:39 - not
10:39 - [Music]
10:40 - not okay
10:42 - and key spaces press because you do not
10:44 - want to let hold the thing hold the
10:46 - space again it throws bags and there's
10:48 - no way you can lose
10:50 - so we need to add this simple script of
10:52 - code
10:54 - and then it'll create
10:55 - clone of myself
11:00 - so actually i have to make the back of
11:01 - 20 i have no idea how i got to 35 i
11:03 - actually have no idea
11:05 - and we do that
11:06 - and when i start as a clone
11:10 - it will set the color
11:14 - effect to pick random one to three
11:16 - hundred
11:22 - it'll go to x
11:25 - x position so this is you use the tricky
11:27 - part block we have to move the second
11:30 - one first so it will go to the x
11:33 - position of bend and it will go to the y
11:36 - position of bend
11:38 - and now it will show
11:42 - it'll point in direction so this is just
11:44 - random aim so he goes blah blah blah and
11:47 - go here to here so you have you can't
11:49 - it's not 100 chance you'll hit the
11:51 - person you're trying to target
11:53 - so
11:55 - so uh let's see
11:58 - as you can see the bag is
12:00 - actually gonna be on him so
12:03 - as you can see it's it's behind him yeah
12:05 - so the bag is actually on him you do not
12:07 - want that to happen so if you click
12:09 - space you want it to be up here because
12:10 - that's where his hand is
12:12 - so
12:13 - so you do not want that to be in the
12:14 - middle right so um you want to add the x
12:18 - position you want to add
12:21 - 25 so it's
12:24 - somewhere over here maybe
12:26 - over here gonna be over here so then the
12:29 - hand is up there in the y position
12:32 - you also want to add
12:36 - 75
12:40 - and then it'll show like we already did
12:42 - that so it'll point in direction um
12:44 - [Music]
12:46 - you know pick random like what i
12:48 - described earlier pick random 60 to 120
12:53 - so
12:55 - the aim is different
12:58 - and
12:59 - the direction you have to click all
13:01 - around i already did that so you see
13:03 - this is 60
13:05 - to
13:06 - 120 yeah right here
13:09 - so this is the range you can hit people
13:11 - from
13:12 - and
13:14 - uh
13:15 - yeah so 60 to 120 so it will repeat
13:18 - until
13:21 - touch it
13:23 - or
13:25 - repeat until touching character one
13:28 - because it will go into the character
13:30 - which will make it change color
13:33 - or it's touching the edge
13:38 - it'll move 15 steps to get to that goal
13:44 - and i'll delete this clone in the end
13:47 - so yeah we are done with the bag
13:51 - so yeah let's
13:53 - let's let you see all the code
13:55 - i think we can zoom in
13:57 - feel free to pause right now so you can
13:59 - get all the code
14:01 - so yeah
14:03 - so let's see
14:04 - see the bag is going but right now the
14:07 - character is in the middle so the bag is
14:09 - stopping there
14:10 - yeah so
14:12 - yeah the bag is going
14:13 - so now we have to work on the character
14:17 - character still has some decent code
14:20 - so um
14:22 - so the character you actually have to
14:23 - make it rotate left right the direction
14:26 - so it doesn't flip over when it's going
14:28 - on the other side so we need when a
14:30 - green flag is clicked
14:34 - so we also have to change the direction
14:36 - negative 90.
14:39 - so it's facing that way and then
14:41 - the green flag is clicked
14:43 - it will hide
14:47 - it'll set character hp sub room okay
14:50 - this is very important please do not
14:51 - skip this part
14:54 - so character hp did i spell character
14:56 - correctly yeah i think it smells correct
14:57 - correctly and then you click for this
14:59 - sprite only do not skip the step
15:02 - most of the mistakes come right here so
15:04 - please do not skip this step the
15:05 - character hp
15:07 - you know set character hp to pick random
15:09 - three to five so it can
15:11 - the character will can disappear in
15:13 - three hits from the bag or five hits
15:15 - from the back or four hits because three
15:17 - to five you know set size to 75 percent
15:20 - well i mean it's 100 right now so i'm
15:22 - gonna set the size of 75.
15:26 - and then i'll go forever
15:30 - no create a clone of myself
15:34 - and i'll wait a pic random second until
15:37 - a new one spawns
15:39 - so
15:40 - wait
15:42 - pick random one to 1.5 seconds for
15:45 - another person to spawn
15:48 - and uh since we have the clone we're
15:51 - gonna do some clone work here so when i
15:53 - start as a clone
15:56 - you'll switch costume
15:59 - to care to pick random or so uh there
16:02 - are 13 costumes for the character i'll
16:04 - show you in a minute so 1 to 13 so it
16:06 - can be number one character all the way
16:09 - to 13 because there's 13 characters that
16:11 - are here so
16:13 - switch costume to pick random 1 to 13.
16:16 - and i'll show
16:20 - and i'll set speed so this is also uh
16:23 - for this right only so please do not
16:25 - skip this part
16:27 - and it'll set speed
16:30 - so each character will have a different
16:31 - amount of speed to pick random
16:35 - negative three
16:37 - so it's actually pretty slow to negative
16:39 - seven which is
16:41 - very quick
16:42 - so it'll go to x
16:46 - 200 so it's back here so the character
16:49 - will spawn over here
16:51 - because you do not want it spawning
16:52 - right here next to ben
16:54 - and
16:55 - uh we need to pick random
16:58 - for the y negative 60 so it can be from
17:02 - probably here
17:04 - a little lower
17:07 - negative 80 my bad
17:09 - and to positive 80 so it can be
17:13 - so it won't be flying like ben if so he
17:16 - doesn't fly either so
17:20 - and then it will repeat until
17:23 - you need an or statement
17:26 - repeat until the x position
17:30 - or
17:31 - so we need that
17:33 - is
17:34 - less than negative 220.
17:38 - so
17:40 - x position up here
17:43 - is less than negative 220
17:47 - or touching ben
17:49 - because um
17:51 - if you do edge if it's touching the edge
17:53 - that means
17:55 - the characters spawn right here that
17:56 - means they'll be touching the edge and
17:58 - they'll
17:59 - be constantly disappearing and they
18:01 - can't move so there's no point of this
18:03 - game so add this descriptive code or
18:05 - touching ben
18:09 - it will change x
18:11 - by speed and that's how quick they're
18:13 - going right so over here so change x
18:16 - by speed
18:19 - and then it'll delete this clone
18:22 - in the end of all that
18:24 - and then there's another one i start as
18:26 - a clone so when i start as a clone
18:28 - you'll go forever
18:31 - so if then it's
18:33 - touching the color bag
18:39 - then it will change color effect by 25
18:42 - because they've been hit
18:44 - by
18:45 - a color a color back so they'll change
18:47 - color
18:48 - and then change character hp
18:52 - by -1 so because they'll start losing
18:55 - their hp
18:56 - slowly
18:57 - and then you need an if then else
19:00 - statement
19:01 - right not
19:03 - right inside of it
19:06 - and
19:08 - if and then
19:10 - if the speed
19:12 - is less than negative one which means
19:14 - that they won't be able to move anymore
19:18 - so negative one is the slowest possible
19:20 - speed of a character so if the speed is
19:23 - gr less than negative one which is like
19:25 - negative seven which is quick that means
19:27 - it will change speed by 0.5 so it'll
19:31 - actually make
19:33 - the
19:34 - character slower
19:37 - and else you'll set speed to
19:40 - uh negative
19:41 - set speed to negative one because that's
19:43 - the slowest it can go
19:46 - and you want them to move right so yeah
19:49 - so when i start as a clone
19:54 - you'll go forever
19:57 - and
19:58 - if
19:59 - then
19:59 - [Music]
20:01 - if then you need a or semen
20:04 - if the character hp is equal to zero
20:12 - so when it loses all its hp
20:14 - or it's less than zero if it's been hit
20:17 - by multiple bags
20:21 - then it will delete this clone
20:24 - because they had
20:26 - uh
20:28 - gotten colored
20:31 - okay um and now i'm going to show all
20:33 - the code
20:34 - so feel free to pause here
20:38 - let's drag that down a little bit
20:41 - so we're going that yeah and yeah feel
20:44 - free to pause right here so you can see
20:46 - all the code so let's see if this works
20:49 - let's actually hide this first so then i
20:51 - can you guys can see something so um
20:54 - and the variables too so let's go to
20:56 - characters
20:59 - no colors you know
21:03 - okay and now let's go so you see they're
21:05 - moving okay we're changing their color
21:08 - and they will disappear they have
21:10 - different amounts of hp as you can see
21:12 - this woman right here has
21:14 - five hp
21:15 - this one has three
21:17 - and the colors aren't changing yet
21:19 - because we're not finished with the code
21:22 - but yeah it's function
21:24 - it's functioning
21:26 - so now since the characters are moving
21:28 - we go back to ben and when the green
21:30 - flag is clicked
21:33 - forever
21:36 - if then
21:39 - it's touching
21:42 - character one because if they get hit by
21:44 - the character let me go change colors by
21:46 - 10
21:49 - which means you got colored a little bit
21:50 - so
21:52 - yeah
21:52 - and then it'll set the color
21:56 - so it'll have a slight change we'll set
21:58 - the color effect
22:00 - to pick random ones 300 so there's a
22:02 - bunch of colors you can become for
22:05 - just
22:06 - 0.1 seconds so
22:08 - 0.1 seconds right here
22:12 - it'll clear the graphic effects again
22:16 - and now
22:18 - under that we put an if then statement
22:21 - right under that if then the colors you
22:24 - need a or
22:26 - is equal to
22:29 - the colors is equal to 100 which means
22:33 - you now have to go home because you have
22:36 - been fully colored
22:38 - uh or
22:39 - colors is greater than 100
22:46 - then it will set the color effect
22:51 - to pick
22:52 - random one to 300
22:56 - in our broadcast you got colored
23:02 - so you
23:04 - you
23:05 - got
23:06 - color
23:09 - and it'll stop other scripts in this
23:10 - sprite so you can't move ben anymore
23:13 - once you get color
23:15 - so stop other scripts in the sprite and
23:17 - after you stop all the scripts on the
23:19 - sprite you also have to stop this script
23:21 - because if you don't stop this script i
23:24 - mean that means
23:26 - uh you'll be still changing color you'll
23:28 - be still broadcasting this thing so you
23:30 - want to stop this script as well
23:32 - so now we are done with fully done with
23:35 - ben
23:36 - so i hope you guys can see this
23:38 - i'm gonna zoom out a little bit so yeah
23:41 - feel free to pause right here get all
23:42 - the code done
23:44 - and now we are on you
23:46 - which is a sprite u
23:48 - so when the green flag is clicked
23:51 - you can i just drag the position
23:53 - somewhere and then uh you'll go to this
23:55 - position it will hide
23:58 - and then when i receive
24:01 - you got colored
24:05 - then it will show
24:09 - and
24:10 - that's basically it for all the other
24:12 - ones but you just have to change the
24:13 - position so they're not in all on one
24:15 - position
24:17 - so let's move that in there
24:18 - why is that zooming out
24:22 - zoom in
24:23 - and then it'll go to here instead of
24:25 - going there it'll go to here so yeah
24:28 - just get some positions done you know
24:31 - drag it around see where you can put the
24:32 - positions
24:35 - so
24:37 - now let's go to
24:38 - whatever go to this
24:40 - yeah and now we have you got colored
24:43 - and
24:46 - and on the last one colored you have to
24:49 - add extra code
24:50 - to stop everything so it will wait two
24:52 - seconds
24:54 - and then it will stop everything
24:57 - so we have one more scripting character
24:59 - so let's go back to character so right
25:01 - now we have four scripts but we are
25:03 - supposed to have five so we're gonna
25:05 - move over a little bit so when i receive
25:08 - you got colored
25:10 - then it will stop other scripts in this
25:12 - sprite
25:15 - where's that
25:17 - and then it will
25:19 - delete this clone because there'll be no
25:21 - more spawning once you get color
25:24 - yeah so feel free to pause right
25:26 - here and now we're gonna add the music
25:29 - for our final touch
25:32 - and if i'm not mistaken
25:35 - the music is dance energetic so let's
25:39 - see
25:43 - energetic
25:44 - you have this one
25:46 - and
25:48 - when the green flag is clicked
25:52 - zoom in when the green flag is it will
25:55 - set volume to 50 so you can kind of hear
25:58 - me and then
25:59 - oh it's optional and then it'll go
26:02 - forever
