00:09 - hello
00:09 - welcome back to kids coding playground
00:13 - today we'll be working on the continue
00:15 - working on this
00:17 - ninja platformer game where we will be
00:20 - working on the ninja
00:21 - attacking with the sword and also
00:23 - throwing the small knife out
00:26 - and now if we have enough time we'll
00:28 - work on the ninja gliding down as well
00:31 - um okay so before i begin please like
00:34 - share subscribe to our channel and uh
00:37 - share our channel with your friends and
00:40 - tell them
00:41 - about our channel that'll be really
00:42 - great
00:44 - thanks for your support okay all right
00:47 - let's uh before we stop the coding let's
00:50 - review what we have so far so if you
00:53 - guys
00:53 - have missed anything just kind of look
00:55 - through here and
00:57 - make sure that you didn't miss anything
00:58 - and you can just check your code
01:01 - okay so let's go to variable we have
01:03 - these variable
01:04 - here uh we have some of the my block
01:09 - here right and these are some of the
01:11 - code
01:12 - on the ninja okay so we'll go on the top
01:15 - start again run control simulate the
01:18 - gravity
01:20 - then we have on this side the start when
01:23 - green black is click
01:25 - okay so if you miss anything please
01:28 - just kind of pause the video and add
01:30 - that and on the bottom we have the
01:33 - jump control for the ninja
01:36 - okay all right okay let's go to platform
01:40 - platform we don't have too many code
01:42 - just uh
01:43 - setting up the level okay the sign i
01:46 - don't think we're gonna go
01:48 - the crate no code yet the water some
01:51 - monocle and the hitbox
01:54 - way monaco okay most of the codes on the
01:58 - ninja
01:59 - so today we'll work on the ninja
02:01 - attacking
02:02 - with the sword so how do we do that um
02:05 - what we can do is um similar to this
02:08 - ninja right
02:09 - you can duplicate him or you can create
02:12 - a new sprite it doesn't matter
02:15 - okay so we are going to create a ninja
02:17 - for
02:18 - attacking so how do we do that so the
02:21 - best way to do
02:22 - is you can create a new sprite okay
02:25 - so um we'll say we cannot really copy
02:28 - from him um
02:29 - right now because they have a lot of
02:30 - code so where to clean it up delete the
02:32 - costume
02:33 - so what we can do is a new sprite
02:37 - okay and we can say upload
02:41 - uh what we do is we go to our png
02:45 - another tile we'll go back to the ninja
02:47 - right
02:49 - this is our ninja okay so we will take
02:53 - the attack
02:54 - so we'll take the attack so from zero to
02:57 - nine
02:58 - just say open so you see you have a big
03:02 - ninja right here right so we'll for
03:04 - first cost two multi-layered we don't
03:05 - need them
03:07 - i will rename all this to uh just the a
03:10 - so attack zero so a1
03:15 - a0 a1 a2
03:19 - a3 i mean
03:22 - you can you don't if you don't want to
03:24 - change it you can but uh then you have
03:26 - to match the name
03:27 - but i just can use it for only one
03:31 - it's just a letter and a number for me
03:36 - okay so delete that
03:42 - should be very quick we only have nine
03:45 - so i think we're almost done
03:49 - and number nine accidentally click on
03:52 - the
03:53 - paint sprite i'll trash this okay so we
03:56 - have nine
03:57 - costume for the ninja here uh what we're
04:00 - going to do is we're making the same
04:02 - size of this guy is 25
04:03 - so we're going to make him 25.
04:08 - okay all right
04:11 - okay so how do we do the ninja
04:14 - so to do the ninja we have to have some
04:16 - of the coal from the
04:17 - other spray as well because what
04:20 - happened
04:21 - when the ninja jumps and all we wanted
04:24 - him to follow him
04:25 - and this one also followed that one and
04:27 - now if he fall back down had to use the
04:30 - gravity so we have to take the gravity
04:32 - code
04:34 - so that's really important take this
04:36 - drag this
04:37 - kind of drop it into the ninja
04:41 - okay so now the ninja has the gravity
04:44 - code
04:46 - uh what we can do is we're gonna lay him
04:47 - up on the second one uh you can rename
04:50 - him to
04:51 - ninja attack
04:55 - so that's what his sword uh what we can
04:58 - do is we don't need this to
04:59 - drop because um the first ninja already
05:02 - has the code
05:04 - but we want to check make sure that the
05:07 - you know this ninja um does fall
05:10 - into the background the green little
05:12 - stop so we'll just check that
05:14 - so we'll change this if and else we'll
05:16 - change it just the if
05:18 - we'll take this out let me zoom in a
05:21 - little bit
05:23 - and we'll take this co out here then
05:25 - we'll delete this piece
05:26 - and we'll connect it here snap it back
05:29 - on
05:29 - so we have the gravity and we have the
05:32 - touching green platform
05:34 - okay same thing we had um so we need the
05:37 - uh
05:38 - when green flag is clicked we need to uh
05:41 - have a forever loop and calling this um
05:44 - this custom sprite a custom block so
05:47 - that you know when it's falling down
05:48 - with a check
05:49 - if it's touching the ground if it is
05:51 - then you know we'll stop the fall
05:53 - make sure it gets stay there okay that
05:56 - is done
05:56 - the way now we will work on
06:00 - another green flat click here
06:03 - so this time when the green flag is
06:05 - clicked i'll move this over here so this
06:07 - is for this code
06:09 - maybe i'll put them on top pull this a
06:10 - little bit lower
06:13 - okay so this is the um code here so what
06:16 - we want to do is we want to hide this
06:18 - ninja
06:19 - so you will not see him only if he
06:21 - attacks then this ninja shows up
06:24 - so we'll hide him and then we'll have to
06:27 - have a forever loop
06:32 - and what we want to do is make this
06:34 - ninja
06:35 - always follow this ninja so that
06:37 - wherever he does the move
06:39 - you know we can hide him and then show
06:40 - him okay
06:42 - here's a go-to here select that and say
06:46 - go to ninja so this guy's gonna follow
06:48 - him
06:49 - and we also need um
06:53 - point in direction so
06:56 - point in direction you see this drag
06:59 - that over here
07:00 - and then you go to sensing and whether
07:03 - pick up this block here
07:05 - put it here you have to select the back
07:07 - one first so you have to select
07:09 - ninja first then here you can say
07:11 - direction
07:12 - so it's going to point to the direction
07:14 - of the ninja
07:16 - okay all right we'll put this over here
07:19 - and then what we can do is we can go
07:21 - back to our main ninja guy
07:25 - so we're gonna add some code to call
07:27 - this other ninja here
07:30 - okay so the code we need is um when
07:33 - green flap is clicked
07:34 - we'll have another green flag here
07:37 - let me zoom in a little bit
07:40 - okay we are going to take a forever loop
07:46 - and what we can do is uh we're gonna use
07:48 - some if condition check
07:51 - here and we're gonna use sensing
07:54 - uh you're gonna sense the key that is
07:56 - pressed so let's use
07:58 - one two three so the first
08:01 - one first attack will be one which is
08:04 - the uh
08:05 - the slash with the sword
08:08 - so when the player hits this what we
08:11 - want to do is uh
08:13 - we are going to hide this uh main ninja
08:15 - guy
08:17 - then we gonna broadcast a message here
08:21 - so that we can send that message back to
08:24 - the other ninja
08:25 - so say broadcast message
08:28 - and you can say new message
08:33 - and you can say attack one
08:36 - okay this is number one so i'm gonna
08:39 - show you guys
08:40 - what's the difference between broadcast
08:41 - and broadcast weight
08:43 - so if you're actually doing like a
08:45 - regular game most of the time just use
08:47 - broadcast right
08:48 - you will not really care about broadcast
08:50 - weight but if you're doing a more
08:51 - complex game
08:53 - broadcast boy is very important i'll
08:55 - show you why it will have some problem
08:57 - if we're just using broadcast
08:59 - but what i can do is just show it right
09:01 - now with broadcast
09:02 - and then we can go back and change this
09:05 - to broadcast way
09:06 - so we have broadcast one so basically
09:09 - when the ninja
09:11 - broadcast attack one we want to show up
09:13 - this ninja
09:14 - so let's go here say when i receive
09:16 - attack one
09:18 - and we also have to check if the player
09:20 - is actually dying or not so make sure
09:21 - he's not dying when he's doing this move
09:24 - uh we have to get this uh condition
09:27 - check same like what we did
09:28 - for the other one right we checked dying
09:30 - before he can run the jump
09:32 - so same thing here so what a check
09:36 - buying is no okay
09:40 - and for this part we will actually um
09:45 - add the code for that now i will say
09:48 - show so it's not dying and pushing the
09:52 - tag will show
09:53 - and what we can do is we can use a
09:55 - repeat 10 time
09:56 - because we have actually 10 costume if
09:58 - you see 0 to
10:00 - 9 that's 10 custom right so that's why i
10:03 - repeat 10 times
10:04 - so repeat 10 time next costume so we
10:08 - only want to repeat only 10 times
10:10 - with the next costume and that will stop
10:14 - okay and then what we can do after that
10:16 - we'll hide it
10:19 - and what we can do is we're gonna
10:21 - broadcast again
10:22 - uh we're gonna this time we're gonna say
10:24 - broadcast
10:26 - show so this one actually doesn't matter
10:28 - with the boycott you don't have to
10:29 - actually have a weight
10:31 - you can say four cash show
10:34 - one okay so this will actually
10:38 - tells the ninja to show himself and this
10:41 - is hiding himself so after he finished
10:42 - do the attack move
10:44 - uh who will hide himself and they'll
10:46 - tell this the main ninja
10:47 - show so the main ninja here will go back
10:51 - to the main ninja here
10:54 - we will say show okay when i receive
10:58 - show one so what i want to do i want to
11:02 - go
11:03 - to so i want to go to
11:06 - the ninja attack which is the ninja that
11:10 - we
11:10 - here right i want to make sure these
11:12 - guys go back to here
11:14 - and then i will show this ninja
11:18 - okay so let's test the game out real
11:21 - quick
11:23 - or save it while we give a name to the
11:25 - our project
11:31 - okay okay all right okay so when i start
11:35 - this game
11:36 - uh you can see let me just hide some of
11:38 - these variables we don't do it neither
11:40 - we got it working already
11:42 - okay we'll just show only the level it
11:45 - says level one
11:46 - so uh you can see when i hit one
11:49 - you see that ninja kind of attack with
11:52 - the sword
11:54 - so why is it going to the back you see
11:55 - this is going to the back there might be
11:57 - some problem right
11:58 - you see so we want to make sure that
12:00 - this guy is always in the front leg just
12:02 - like the ninja
12:03 - okay we'll have to go back let's go back
12:06 - here
12:08 - okay let's drag this go to front leg
12:11 - just snap it over here
12:13 - okay now let's try it again so let's go
12:16 - up here
12:20 - okay he's still okay okay these rocks
12:23 - are in the front
12:24 - i think interesting
12:29 - okay i figure out what the problem is uh
12:32 - with my ninja
12:33 - going kind of go to the back when it
12:35 - does the
12:36 - using the slash with the sword so the
12:39 - problem is
12:40 - um the platform here we have a go to
12:42 - front layer
12:44 - so um what what we want to do is after
12:46 - going to the front leg we're going to
12:48 - push him back all the way to the back
12:50 - since we're a different sprite here uh
12:52 - you know one two three four
12:55 - five six kind of thing so you cannot
12:57 - push it in the
12:58 - back uh make sure that it doesn't block
13:00 - any of these sprite
13:02 - um what we can do is first we make some
13:04 - to go to the front left and we'll push
13:06 - him
13:06 - layer back what i'm going to do is um
13:10 - going here i'm going to drag this out
13:13 - go back i'm going to say go back
13:17 - 10 layer so i'll make sure that it goes
13:19 - to the back even if we add other custom
13:22 - later on
13:23 - so well i added this block here so that
13:26 - will help
13:27 - fix the issue of the ninja okay let's
13:29 - test it out one more time
13:32 - so let's use the slash as you can see
13:35 - it kind of move the because of the uh
13:38 - difference costume we kind of move um
13:42 - a little bit down i think not much i can
13:45 - do
13:47 - since you know scratch here they don't
13:49 - actually have those uh collision uh
13:51 - box that you could actually do only on
13:53 - the ninja's foot
13:54 - um it's a little bit harder unlike like
13:57 - game maker studio two or something
13:59 - you know that you can have more control
14:01 - of your sprite and how that work i think
14:03 - even these sprites are not really from
14:04 - scratch
14:05 - and this platform some more for like
14:08 - gamma studio or something you can put
14:10 - like
14:11 - you know like a collision box around
14:14 - different things so
14:15 - anyway we do whatever we can with this
14:18 - it's just a simple
14:19 - uh platformer game we're trying to do
14:22 - just showing you how
14:23 - you could do it okay all right so
14:26 - we'll go back to the ninja uh also uh
14:29 - there's one bug with this game
14:32 - we can fix so let's say you are doing
14:35 - this attack
14:36 - right and you're moving at the same time
14:38 - you see how the ninja falls off
14:40 - so you can fix that i mean what i did is
14:44 - i create a new variable
14:46 - called action in progress basically
14:48 - something is
14:50 - in progress to action and we want to
14:53 - make sure that the ninja doesn't do
14:55 - any of the attack move because while
14:57 - we're switching this
14:59 - it could fall them off to the to the
15:01 - ground so what we can do is here
15:04 - we'll create after we create this we'll
15:06 - put this in
15:07 - and we'll set the action to end we know
15:10 - no action is happening in the beginning
15:14 - and then in here
15:17 - we can set this on top here set the
15:20 - action to y when it's actually attacking
15:22 - and we have to reset it also we want to
15:26 - change this condition here
15:29 - using the n join here so um
15:33 - it's not dyne and
15:37 - the action is and
15:41 - the action in progress
15:45 - is no so no action in progress then
15:47 - we'll we'll try to do this
15:49 - and then in the code here where they
15:51 - change it out
15:52 - for the um let's see for the jump
15:56 - okay we're going to change this out here
15:58 - instead of dying
16:00 - equal no we have to add an end joint
16:02 - basically this is the end joint
16:05 - so let me just kind of drag and you can
16:08 - see
16:09 - so basically just grab one at the end
16:11 - from here of the operator
16:13 - this end and then we just kind of put
16:15 - this inside here
16:18 - and then we'll move this back in here so
16:20 - we'll delete this
16:22 - so that will fix the jump and we'll have
16:25 - to fix the
16:26 - run nozzle so the run nodes have similar
16:29 - code here
16:29 - we already did that i prepared it so
16:33 - okay okay now we have this
16:36 - in place now let's start again
16:39 - so uh while we're attacking
16:43 - let me save it
16:47 - okay um let's go back away let's remove
16:50 - this actually i think it's going to
16:52 - cause some problem
16:53 - for us just this
16:57 - let's try it again
17:00 - so as you can see we kind of slash it
17:03 - doesn't kind of fall but it won't fall
17:04 - off now
17:05 - and there's still a little bug with this
17:07 - slash you see sometimes it could go
17:10 - under here uh but
17:13 - cannot do too much with this right now
17:15 - uh as long as you're not
17:17 - because of the loop here this costume
17:20 - change
17:20 - and if you're jumping sometimes this
17:23 - loop is not done this thing will not
17:25 - be able to check to make sure you stand
17:27 - on top of this
17:29 - and since our platform have multiple
17:31 - color this is really bad
17:32 - uh for platformer game uh you know
17:36 - you have to check color you know
17:37 - different color and then
17:39 - just uh when the sprite is big it's not
17:41 - a square so it's really hard for
17:43 - getting all the color right uh anyway
17:46 - next time we'll make a new game
17:48 - upload platform just a square box i
17:50 - think it will work much much better
17:52 - um so whatever we have currently let's
17:55 - just finish this
17:56 - okay so we got the ninja attack uh
18:00 - working now right you can push one
18:03 - so you can see switch the custom for the
18:06 - ninja
18:07 - so only thing is if you're doing attack
18:10 - up
18:11 - in the air it would have some problem
18:13 - like this
18:15 - and the hitbox is also not a problem
18:18 - that kind of push him away
18:20 - so i mean i mean if you want you can
18:23 - just take this hitbox
18:24 - off but i think that will you know
18:27 - because that will
18:28 - make him go in as long as you're jumping
18:31 - and
18:31 - uh if you're not hitting the the attack
18:34 - button while you're like near the ground
18:36 - then you're fine
18:37 - uh like if you just up here like that is
18:40 - fine but if you're like
18:41 - near the ground and then you're trying
18:43 - to hit it then it kind of
18:45 - get into the hitbox and the hitbox kind
18:47 - of push him away
18:48 - not really we can do anything because
18:50 - you have too many costumes change maybe
18:52 - you can delete some of the costume it
18:53 - might help
18:55 - you know with the code so that it
18:56 - doesn't have too many costumes to
18:58 - loop through uh anyway um this
19:01 - um we do have a little problem but uh
19:04 - anyway
19:05 - so we got this attack working so um
19:08 - what we're going to do next is doing the
19:10 - knife uh you can throw the knife out
19:12 - okay so we'll stop here and then we'll
19:14 - create another video for the knife so
19:16 - that you know
19:17 - you want to see the knife you don't want
19:19 - to see through all the
19:21 - attack one okay all right we'll stop
19:24 - here
19:24 - thank you thank you for watching bye
