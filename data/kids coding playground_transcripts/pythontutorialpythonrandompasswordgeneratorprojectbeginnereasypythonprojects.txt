00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys it's kids
00:08 - codingplayground here and today we'll be
00:09 - doing another python tutorial we'll be
00:12 - doing a video on how to make a password
00:14 - generator so
00:15 - going now from now on we're going to be
00:17 - using pycharm instead of sublime because
00:20 - pycharm is an id and you can like it can
00:23 - debug easier like if you ever to make a
00:25 - mistake it would find the mistake
00:27 - and inside sublime you cannot find it
00:29 - would be harder to debug
00:32 - so yeah so
00:33 - from last time remember when i
00:35 - misspelled a word and it wouldn't work
00:37 - well in pycharm it would auto complete
00:40 - the word and then so it's pretty much
00:42 - impossible to make a mistake in your
00:44 - spelling and we'll be making more
00:46 - scratch tutorials we just decided to do
00:48 - some python tutorials because we haven't
00:50 - done them in a long time
00:52 - and we'll be doing something for 10 000
00:54 - subscribers soon so
00:56 - thank you guys for all your support on
00:57 - subscribing to your channel so without
00:59 - further ado let's start on the video so
01:01 - open up your pie charm by double
01:03 - clicking on the app and then we're going
01:04 - to create a new project
01:06 - we're going to start off by renaming the
01:07 - project to random
01:09 - password
01:11 - generator
01:12 - it's a random password generator we're
01:14 - going to create the project
01:16 - so it's going to create
01:18 - the environment
01:20 - just wait a little bit
01:23 - okay so now it's
01:24 - done okay so
01:26 - so now we're inside our pycharm so to
01:29 - like get the scripts and stuff so we can
01:31 - type we're going to
01:33 - uh expand this
01:35 - and then we're going to right click on
01:36 - here
01:38 - we're going to click the new and then
01:39 - we're gonna do python file so
01:42 - right click on the random password
01:43 - generator thing and then to get the
01:45 - python file and we're gonna rename this
01:48 - python file we're gonna name it random
01:50 - password generator
01:52 - uh random pass or generator
01:56 - and then python file click ok and then
01:59 - now we can type in all the scripts
02:01 - and it's right here
02:03 - so this is basically the project uh the
02:06 - folder
02:07 - and then this is the file inside the
02:09 - folder so this is like the random
02:11 - password generator you don't have to
02:12 - name it the same thing but i just have
02:14 - the same name it doesn't matter
02:16 - okay so now let's start getting into the
02:18 - code
02:19 - so first we're going to import two
02:20 - libraries so import
02:23 - so import see it already auto completes
02:25 - for you
02:26 - import random
02:28 - and then we'll go down one line and
02:30 - import
02:32 - string
02:33 - so as you can see it's kind of grayed
02:34 - out right now is because we haven't used
02:37 - these libraries yet so once we use them
02:39 - it will not be grayed out so don't worry
02:41 - about that
02:42 - okay and then next we are going to be
02:44 - defining uh
02:46 - the length uh the function we're going
02:48 - to name it random password
02:50 - so we're going to define random
02:53 - underscore password
02:55 - define random underscore password length
02:58 - and then we're going to do the input
03:00 - so i'm going to show you exactly what
03:01 - this means after so put colon so this is
03:04 - like a
03:05 - like a function and then you put
03:07 - anything down here so we're going to
03:09 - define four variables so the first one
03:11 - is going to be lowers so these are all
03:12 - the lowercase letters so i will show you
03:15 - exactly what this code means after i
03:16 - finish typing this part so we're going
03:19 - to put string
03:21 - string oops we spelled it string dot
03:24 - ascii
03:26 - ascii and then as you can see it already
03:29 - um
03:30 - auto completes for you so i want lower
03:32 - case so you just go down and then it'll
03:33 - auto complete
03:35 - and the next one i'm gonna do uppers
03:36 - upper case so operas will be equal to
03:40 - string dot ascii
03:42 - and then uppercase you see autocomplete
03:44 - again and then numbers will do nums
03:48 - is equal to
03:49 - string
03:50 - dot digits see auto complete and then
03:53 - finally we have the symbols
03:56 - is equal to
03:58 - the string
03:59 - dot punctuation
04:01 - so okay so i'm gonna print all these and
04:03 - show you what each of them mean
04:06 - so basically the first one lowers is
04:08 - printing out all the lowercase letters
04:10 - from a to z
04:12 - and uppers is printing out all the
04:14 - uppercase letters and from a to z and
04:16 - then the numbers are all the numbers
04:19 - and then the symbols are basically all
04:21 - the punctuation marks all the different
04:22 - symbols okay so we still have to be
04:24 - inside here so
04:26 - i'm just going to go down to lines and
04:28 - then i'm going to print
04:30 - and then we can instead of just calling
04:32 - this entire thing we can just call
04:34 - the variable so we're just going to copy
04:36 - paste it into here so print the lower
04:38 - pieces
04:39 - print
04:40 - uppers and then we're going to print
04:43 - uh
04:45 - prints the nums
04:48 - and finally we're going to print
04:50 - the symbols
04:52 - okay so to run a project remember you
04:54 - click the run and then
04:58 - all right also my bad we forgot to call
05:00 - the function it's like you have to call
05:02 - the function like in scratch you know
05:03 - how you have the custom blocks you have
05:04 - to call the function okay so like since
05:07 - we have to like call the function so
05:09 - down here we're going to call the
05:10 - function
05:11 - so we're going to do the random
05:13 - underscore password we have it right
05:15 - there and then inside here we're just
05:17 - going to put 10 for now so that's how
05:19 - long the length of the password will be
05:22 - so
05:22 - we're going to just ctrl s
05:25 - save and then run
05:31 - run
05:35 - so we're just going to run it right here
05:37 - and then as you can see it prints out
05:39 - everything so abcd
05:41 - all the letters from lowercase all the
05:44 - uppercase letters all the numbers and
05:46 - all the possible symbols so that's
05:49 - exactly what we need so that's
05:51 - that's basically what all this means so
05:54 - i'm just gonna comment all this out
05:56 - um because
05:58 - we do not need this anymore
06:01 - so
06:08 - and
06:16 - okay so
06:17 - instead of putting a hashtag in each one
06:20 - or a pound symbol you can actually do
06:22 - this
06:23 - so we're just going to do
06:25 - let's highlight all this
06:28 - all you all you have to do is just ctrl
06:29 - slash and you can uncomment and comment
06:32 - stuff
06:33 - so that's pretty much it
06:34 - oops nicely deleted
06:36 - so that's how you comment in uncommon
06:38 - stuff that's just a shortcut
06:41 - okay so after that
06:43 - we want to let's delete this part
06:45 - and then after that we want to
06:47 - go back in here so use we need to be
06:50 - inside the
06:51 - function so we have to use a tab
06:53 - so we're going to do use
06:56 - oops caps lock use
06:58 - all
07:00 - underscore characters
07:02 - so this is like combining everything to
07:04 - make a password we're going to make it
07:06 - equal to lowers
07:09 - and then we're going to plus the uppers
07:12 - and then plus the numbers
07:15 - and then also plus the symbols so we're
07:18 - going to add all of them
07:20 - and then under that we're going to print
07:24 - use all characters so we're going to
07:26 - print the variable use
07:27 - all
07:28 - characters okay
07:32 - okay so now we have to call the function
07:34 - again
07:34 - i might have deleted it so let's
07:38 - call the function um
07:40 - we're gonna do
07:41 - we're gonna do the
07:43 - random underscore password and then
07:46 - we're going to do the
07:47 - plan inside we're going to do the 10 for
07:49 - now okay
07:50 - so i'll run the thing for you so run
07:55 - okay so inside the run
07:58 - as you can see it puts them all into a
08:01 - single row
08:02 - all the different characters into single
08:04 - row
08:05 - so
08:06 - that's what this part does you add all
08:08 - the lowercase all the uppercase all the
08:10 - numbers and all the symbols together and
08:12 - you print them all in one
08:14 - line okay
08:16 - so that's what we have to do there
08:17 - okay so next we're going to make a
08:19 - temporary variable so we're going to do
08:21 - i'm going to name temp and then make it
08:23 - equal
08:24 - to random dot
08:27 - sample so this is basically you're
08:29 - combining all the different characters
08:31 - you're going to pick random characters
08:32 - from the lowercase letters uppercase
08:34 - letters numbers and symbols going to
08:36 - make it all together to make a random
08:38 - password so inside here we're going to
08:40 - put parentheses use all characters
08:43 - autocomplete comma
08:45 - and then we're going to do length
08:47 - underscore inputs
08:49 - like that
08:51 - and then next we're going to print
08:54 - temp
08:56 - okay so
08:57 - there we have it let's
09:00 - run the project so let's click the run
09:02 - button
09:03 - so we're gonna run
09:05 - the password generator so you can see
09:07 - it's in an array now so it picks some
09:09 - random letters w three
09:12 - uh
09:13 - comma
09:14 - i'm not a comma y t i and so we don't
09:18 - want it like that right so we're gonna
09:20 - put a script down here so it won't have
09:23 - like this it doesn't look good and you
09:24 - can't really see what the password is
09:26 - so we can run it again so and it'll give
09:29 - us a different array this time so as you
09:31 - can see the array is totally different
09:34 - so it will just keep on generating
09:35 - random passwords but we don't want it in
09:37 - this format so we're going to
09:39 - add some code so it won't be like that
09:41 - so
09:44 - we're here
09:45 - we're going to do
09:46 - we're so basically just going to join
09:48 - the array for characters into a string
09:50 - so we're going to make a variable mean
09:52 - password
09:53 - password is equal
09:55 - so basically this is like the join
09:57 - function from uh
09:59 - scratch
10:01 - so here we have password so like i said
10:04 - this is basically like the join function
10:06 - so
10:07 - here we have the commas and then we're
10:09 - gonna do dot join
10:12 - and then we're gonna get the temporary
10:13 - variable into here so temporary is gonna
10:15 - be like combining everything so we have
10:18 - the password
10:20 - and
10:21 - equals to this this is like the join
10:23 - function
10:24 - and then down
10:26 - we're gonna go down one more
10:28 - and then we're gonna return password
10:33 - okay so
10:35 - okay so i just put these just to show
10:37 - you guys how it works so now we can just
10:39 - comment them out
10:41 - and then
10:42 - next we are going to be doing
10:44 - like the returning the password and then
10:47 - printing the return password so we're
10:50 - going to go down
10:51 - two lines
10:52 - and then we're going to
10:54 - write return password so let's move this
10:57 - one a few lines down actually
10:59 - and so return
11:03 - password
11:04 - underscore password
11:07 - is equal to
11:09 - random
11:13 - random password
11:18 - just random password
11:20 - underscore password here autofinish
11:23 - and then inside the parentheses we're
11:25 - just going to put 10 for now but later
11:26 - we'll be doing another variable and
11:28 - we'll substitute in there so we do we'll
11:30 - just put 10 for there for now
11:32 - and then
11:33 - under there we'll do print
11:35 - and then we'll do the
11:37 - return password
11:41 - okay there we go
11:43 - and this thing we do not need it anymore
11:46 - because we have it right here
11:48 - so the return password is basically the
11:50 - random password and just prints that so
11:52 - that's the variable make it to equal to
11:54 - that one and then you print it
11:56 - okay so now let's run it
12:00 - so you see we have our
12:02 - password right here
12:03 - it has 10 characters so you see we have
12:06 - 10 right here
12:07 - what we want to do is make it to the
12:09 - player or the user can put how much ever
12:13 - uh how much
12:15 - characters they want in their passwords
12:16 - so instead of 10 right here we're gonna
12:19 - above here we're going to make a new
12:20 - variable
12:21 - so we're going to make it
12:22 - length is equal to
12:26 - and then we're going to do the int
12:29 - input
12:31 - and then we're going to put another
12:33 - parenthesis and then inside here we're
12:35 - going to put a message
12:36 - welcome to password generator how did
12:40 - that
12:41 - generate
12:42 - and then
12:44 - please
12:46 - you guys can put whatever you want here
12:48 - please enter
12:50 - a
12:52 - length
12:56 - of space
13:01 - or
13:02 - a password
13:08 - what we're going to do instead of
13:10 - putting the period we're going to put
13:11 - like a little
13:12 - uh less than symbol so we're going to
13:15 - show or greater than symbol so then we
13:17 - can show them where to type like a
13:18 - little arrow so it's going to be like
13:20 - that
13:22 - so there you go we have
13:24 - that
13:27 - we can add a space in between here to
13:29 - make it look better
13:31 - and so that's pretty much it for this
13:33 - project
13:34 - um
13:36 - and right here instead of 10 we're going
13:38 - to have to substitute the length in here
13:40 - so however the long the person wants to
13:43 - put it it will be
13:45 - in here so length okay so that's pretty
13:48 - much it for the project so let's
13:51 - run the project
13:55 - so as you can see it says welcome to
13:57 - password generator please enter a length
13:59 - for the password
14:00 - so
14:01 - let's say i'll put like three
14:03 - okay
14:07 - three enter and then it'll put a three
14:10 - character password
14:12 - yeah so that's pretty much it
14:14 - and what if i want a
14:17 - 12 character password
14:20 - then it has as well as character
14:22 - password right there so
14:24 - let's say you don't want to use make
14:26 - your own password you can just use the
14:27 - script so that's pretty much it for this
14:29 - tutorial
14:31 - yeah so password generator thank you
14:33 - guys for watching don't forget to like
14:35 - share and subscribe
14:37 - and don't forget to ring the
14:38 - notification bell as well and i'll see
