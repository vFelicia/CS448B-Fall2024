01:04 - and then we'll just name it let's name
01:07 - it

01:43 - basically
01:45 - have the Bulbasaur over here when the
01:47 - green flag is clicked
01:51 - um we will switch costume to the first
01:53 - Bulbasaur
01:55 - and then

02:04 - it's just his head shaking like an idol
02:07 - animation so this can make your game a
02:09 - lot better and like a lot more uh fluent

02:24 - you see he's making his head shake a ram
02:26 - so some gifts
02:28 - um it needs you some gifts they have
02:30 - less costumes so you have to add a
02:32 - little weight in the um before here like
02:34 - a weight 0.1 seconds uh weight zero
02:38 - point uh two seconds around the time so
02:40 - if there's less costumes you want you
02:42 - might want to use some weight uh but if
02:44 - there's more costumes you don't really
02:45 - need the light because there's a lot of
02:47 - costumes and it'll just go really
02:49 - quickly
