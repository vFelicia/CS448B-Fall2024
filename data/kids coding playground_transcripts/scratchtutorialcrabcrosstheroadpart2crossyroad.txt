00:01 - [Music]
00:08 - hello and welcome back guys to the kids
00:11 - calling playground channel so today we
00:14 - will continue with the crab cross the
00:17 - roll game we'll be editing the some
00:22 - custom sprite and also making some
00:25 - changes to the background so before we
00:28 - get started please like share and
00:30 - subscribe to our channel and let us know
00:34 - in the comment what do you guys like to
00:36 - see more okay so let's jump right in so
00:40 - where we have left off last time once we
00:43 - finished it the roll with the stripe in
00:48 - the middle and then a little white line
00:50 - in between so and then we have the grass
00:53 - done what we can do next is we can put
00:57 - some flowers here on this side flowers
00:59 - on this die and then we'll put a crab in
01:01 - the middle what you can do is you can go
01:05 - to like Google and I'll search for a
01:08 - flower patch PNG cartoon or something
01:11 - and looking for like a PNG art once you
01:14 - find the one that your life like wins
01:16 - and so any of them you can download it
01:19 - and then you can just import it if you'd
01:23 - find one that is not PNG for instance
01:26 - that you want to use it then you
01:28 - actually have to erase the background
01:33 - that I think I talked about last time
01:37 - how you would do it you have to use the
01:38 - scratch
01:39 - tuqwan ojeda - unfortunately they don't
01:42 - have the magic one anymore
01:44 - on three what you can do is when you go
01:48 - to a scratch if you scroll all the way
01:51 - down to the bottom here this thing
01:54 - called download click on download here
01:56 - if you scroll down and then you will see
01:59 - the older version editor you can load
02:02 - this one scratch 2.0 offline editor with
02:05 - this one you have the magic one to
02:08 - remove the background which is this this
02:10 - editor 2.0 editor so using this you can
02:14 - you cannot make the make the
02:18 - you raise the background for the year
02:21 - for the sprite so I can show you that
02:24 - one time that's for example we go to
02:27 - this flower patch right let's say we
02:30 - want to use this flower we can see this
02:33 - image right flower called flower so as
02:40 - you can see this is a JP he is not a PNG
02:43 - image so it might not have a transparent
02:46 - so we might need to erase it so what you
02:49 - can tell if you if you go here let's say
02:53 - you have the cat here and then you
02:54 - upload this flower as you can see the
03:00 - flowers blocking the cat
03:01 - you can't you see it doesn't see through
03:04 - you see half of the cat so what you need
03:06 - to do is you need to go to costume you
03:09 - use this magic one and then you can just
03:12 - highlight this so it will try to get
03:18 - order or the flower so I mean you cannot
03:23 - have to go in a little bit know what
03:25 - zoom in maybe sometime to get the
03:28 - perfect figure
03:35 - oops
03:36 - so that was wrong so get the wrong and
03:43 - you can just kind of yeah do the undo so
03:55 - as you can see I mean it's not as stir
04:01 - still some some some spot oops
04:07 - so I mean there's still some spot that
04:10 - you might have to clean up after
04:11 - afterward so as you can see the flower
04:20 - still you see you still see some white
04:22 - spot here right so you might have to go
04:24 - in and just use the eraser to
04:27 - can I erase this piece out you know the
04:32 - kind you might have to zoom in a little
04:34 - bit if you want to better better you
04:37 - know I'll control the sprite as you can
04:39 - see once I erased it I can see the cat
04:41 - somewhat you can still see some songs
04:44 - some white spot so I will recommend if
04:47 - you could find the like a PNG file to
04:50 - use that way you don't have to mess with
04:54 - the yeah
04:56 - Jenna editing the edit the sprite but if
04:59 - you want to you can some of the sometime
05:03 - you cannot find PNG and some does
05:05 - require you to make some changes to edit
05:10 - the sprite like when we're working on
05:12 - this game later on with a car the police
05:14 - car and the old truck they only have a
05:18 - PNG planet they don't have PNG they have
05:20 - only the you know the jpg so you do
05:24 - actually need to do some changes to to
05:27 - arrange the our line and all that so you
05:31 - can use this magic one tool here to help
05:33 - you okay so let me get back to it let's
05:40 - say you found one PNG file and you say
05:43 - that what you can do is you can go back
05:45 - to your code oops go back to the KO here
05:50 - you can go to background select
05:54 - background here and what you can do is
05:56 - Ian upload a backdrop so let's say I use
06:04 - this flower I download a while go
06:07 - so when you see you download this flower
06:09 - is some time and it put it into a bitmap
06:13 - where you can do click on this to
06:15 - convert a vector and then you choose
06:18 - this arrow here select this picture
06:21 - control C or right click copy and you
06:26 - can say control V here so as you can see
06:29 - I put this flower here right so you can
06:33 - kind
06:33 - make it smaller you can adjust a flower
06:37 - any way you like you
06:39 - move it up move it down so I just want
06:42 - to move it around here so I can do a
06:46 - copy again and I made another flower
06:51 - around here so you can just adjust it
06:54 - that way you know it kind of look like
07:00 - it's even on both side so we have the
07:03 - two flower patch here on the side or you
07:06 - can put the crap in the middle so this
07:10 - part we are done with the flower now so
07:15 - our background was I believe it's done
07:18 - unless you know you wanna change
07:21 - something else you can what we can do is
07:24 - we can start coding now we'll go back to
07:29 - the code for a backdrop what we can do
07:32 - is um pull this one in
07:34 - so when green flag is clicked that means
07:39 - when you click on this green flag this
07:41 - code will execute you can select a sound
07:45 - we can also select a volume like if you
07:48 - don't want the sound to play too loud in
07:50 - the back you can just give it like 50%
07:52 - and you can say forever then we need to
07:58 - add a sound let's say you can choose one
08:01 - how will you go
08:02 - choose a loop so these are the loop
08:04 - sound that you can kind of look together
08:07 - and it looks this sounds good so let's
08:12 - say we use this
08:16 - sound quite just hover over the label so
08:20 - let's say we use this we can choose this
08:23 - and we'll go back to the code and you go
08:26 - to cell and you can drag this in so
08:31 - let's play until done softer this sounds
08:33 - completely done what happened is go and
08:35 - then we'll play again and then it'll
08:37 - keep on playing the same sound over and
08:39 - over again so if I now let's just change
08:44 - this project name say crab cross bro
08:50 - I'll make it to since however I have one
08:53 - regular one if I now play this you can
08:58 - hear music in the back so you can hear a
09:02 - little bit music in the pattern right we
09:04 - put a volume kind of 50% and I also
09:08 - change my alright so far we have this
09:17 - walking alright we have the volume we
09:20 - added the sound and all then we have to
09:24 - go on to the next next sets of code ok
09:31 - now we have to agree after another
09:34 - variable what this new variable we are
09:38 - going to make is going to help us to
09:41 - control the game a little bit better now
09:44 - explain why this variable it's called
09:47 - stop action so basically this variable
09:50 - will help us to let's say if the crap is
09:53 - going across the street it got hit by
09:55 - one of the car we want to stop the you
09:59 - know the podcast of the the car hitting
10:02 - the crap and deduct a live one so
10:05 - basically we don't want the theity the
10:10 - car hit the crap like the Navajo I come
10:12 - and hit again right before he took all
10:15 - the crap moved back and we don't wonder
10:18 - the life that decrease more than one
10:20 - maybe like two or three time rate the
10:22 - car could have hit the the crap knees in
10:25 - the middle of the lane maybe that's too
10:26 - car coming
10:27 - so that's why we want to use this valve
10:29 - variable to help us to control that so I
10:33 - will show you in a bit so we can hide
10:36 - this a variable by clicking this
10:37 - checkbox so this this variable goes away
10:40 - if you want for debugging purposes you
10:43 - do want to change have it on so that way
10:46 - you can see what's going on what is
10:47 - getting set to okay we have the created
10:51 - this new variable what we can do is we
10:54 - can trash this cat here we are going to
10:58 - get the crap okay and we have the crap
11:04 - so we have crap a and crap P so they
11:08 - look pretty much alike what we are going
11:11 - to do is we are going to add something
11:13 - to the crap I was at the craps pricing
11:17 - like if he get hit by a car
11:19 - you know he splashes a I guess blood or
11:23 - something if it's crab I think that blue
11:25 - blood so let's just add so add a splash
11:28 - so what you can do is go for here same
11:31 - thing and in Google color for splash PNG
11:35 - scroll down find the one that you want
11:38 - like this is the one I got is a blue one
11:41 - alright downloaded earlier so what we
11:44 - can do is go over here you can say
11:48 - upload a promo costume and you can say
11:54 - blue splash splat okay alright so click
12:00 - on this vector again so as you can see
12:04 - it's really big what you want to do is
12:08 - you want to shrink it
12:09 - okay shake it shrink it some more
12:15 - I mean until you are you're comfortable
12:20 - where it should be so the crap is let me
12:25 - sell the crab looks like okay so what
12:27 - we're going to do is you can just click
12:29 - on this copy ctrl C
12:33 - and control-v so you're putting a splash
12:36 - on the crap so that means he got hit by
12:39 - a car right so we can trash this now so
12:43 - we have only one thing so what we're
12:46 - going to do is we aren't gonna make this
12:48 - crapola as small actually this is a
12:51 - little too big so now let's go back to
12:55 - the coal what you can do is first with
12:59 - drag this in so this is one green flag
13:03 - is clicked we can go to look set the
13:07 - size 40 and we have to initialize our
13:13 - variable so we can say set live to let's
13:17 - say in five set score resetting this all
13:23 - to zero and then we can have one more
13:30 - set the stop action to no so we're not
13:34 - stopping the action so once we actually
13:37 - get hit by the car then we say stop
13:40 - actions why so that can stop the action
13:43 - the what what is trying to perform and
13:46 - we also want to set the the crab's
13:50 - costume one so in the beginning we
13:53 - always want to have custom one so the
13:56 - crab looks something like this and we
14:00 - want to go into a certain position you
14:03 - know you can't move it around you can
14:05 - see this right so let's let me put it
14:09 - like around maybe live 165 see how it
14:13 - goes I didn't use that - last time I
14:16 - think that works best so 165 is around
14:19 - here somewhere at the zero position this
14:22 - is like Center next we'll go get the a
14:28 - forever loop here so what we are going
14:32 - to do is we are going to add the kick
14:35 - sprite
14:40 - okay we are gonna put a kick somewhere
14:43 - on the top but for right now let's just
14:45 - leave him so big we'll change it to a
14:47 - little bit smaller what the what this
14:50 - crap will do is it will have this
14:52 - statement here okay if touching it's
14:59 - obvious if the crap touch the cake
15:01 - well what cast a message so we can do
15:05 - more things with it later on
15:07 - so we'll say a cast message say new
15:15 - message cake softer you get the cake you
15:23 - just podcast get cake so we are going to
15:25 - use that later on to do some something
15:27 - with that for now let's work on the crap
15:31 - we want the crap to be able to move left
15:33 - and right we also need to set this up as
15:38 - well so in south winds key space key is
15:41 - pressed you say when hub arrows is
15:44 - pressed
15:45 - what we want to do is go here and we are
15:52 - putting an if condition here and we are
15:57 - going to check if the stop action that
16:02 - we just saw right because after you get
16:04 - hit by the car we should not be letting
16:06 - the crap to keep on going up or down we
16:09 - want to stop that so we are going to use
16:12 - this condition here not condition
16:18 - basically it's not that variable so the
16:21 - stop action it's not equal to Y then we
16:26 - will allow them to move so we can say
16:29 - change change X nice change X&Y sorry
16:35 - change Y by let's say 20 and we want to
16:42 - put a little weight in feet we
16:43 - don't want the user to hold down the up
16:46 - and down arrow key and just fly through
16:48 - the history right you don't want that
16:51 - so what point zero eight something like
16:58 - that really fraction of a second so they
17:01 - can still move pretty quick around the
17:03 - map but just not like completely you
17:07 - know push down the key and go all the
17:09 - way to the to the end and also we don't
17:12 - want them to to go all the way to the
17:14 - top what we're going to do is we're
17:16 - gonna say bounce on edge so that you
17:19 - know player won't be able hide up here
17:20 - somewhere off the screen so now we will
17:24 - duplicate this so we got the up a route
17:31 - on we are going to work on their you
17:34 - know damn well say arrow similar thing
17:39 - so why instead of a plus point you can
17:43 - do minus twenty similar thing and bounce
17:47 - same thing so now we will walk on the
17:51 - right and left arrow so this is right so
17:56 - for right we'll have to use the X so we
18:00 - cannot use that toe we are going to say
18:03 - change oops why am i grabbing exit why
18:07 - can't change X was X okay so we are
18:14 - going to say change X this is right so
18:17 - be positive change X and we will say on
18:22 - edge bounce we don't need to put away
18:25 - because if they're moving left and right
18:27 - that's fine we'll let them go a little
18:30 - faster and we can put this for left
18:36 - button and we say minus 20 so now we
18:44 - have the basic movement of the crap so
18:47 - let's play this and just check it out so
18:50 - the probe is you guess
18:52 - push the up arrow or run this hole with
18:55 - the down arrow arrow so basically what
19:01 - we had is the crap is able to move off
19:04 - the street and get the cake right there
19:08 - don't call right now okay
19:11 - so we'll stop this we have the basic of
19:15 - the co for the crab so far so if you
19:18 - guys miss anything let's just pause the
19:21 - video here and take a look at the ko
19:23 - make sure you have everything here like
19:24 - this okay alright so next we are going
19:31 - to walk on the car
19:34 - and we are going to broadcast if the car
19:38 - she hit the you know hit the hit the the
19:42 - crap what we can do is we can bring one
19:46 - Carver's and we can work on the other
19:49 - car later okay we'll bring this green
19:52 - car we can place them any way you like
19:55 - we can place them around this here or
19:57 - here anywhere so what we can do is we
20:01 - start with the here and again okay so
20:07 - and then we are going to set the car
20:10 - over smaller you can set the size here
20:14 - to 75 or you can set the size here as
20:18 - well I like to do in Akko that way you
20:21 - know it's you know the won't check it
20:23 - will always walk maybe even anybody
20:25 - changing just to test something I run
20:27 - into always what we can and what we can
20:31 - do is look at the motion as you can see
20:34 - when you adjust this you'll see a
20:36 - different value right where the x and y
20:41 - is when you can do is let's say I want
20:44 - to put this car round there's this
20:47 - location maybe further so we'll probably
20:50 - come out like this when you can do is
20:54 - you can just drag this I said go to
20:57 - negative I mean doesn't matter negative
21:01 - 40 and 12 right so
21:05 - cause here and then we have to go in and
21:10 - get a forever loop so we want to make
21:12 - this call keep on going no tort this way
21:16 - so as you can see the cost pointing this
21:18 - way so you want him to go forward you
21:21 - have to use the Move depending on what
21:27 - side of the sprites facing you might
21:29 - have to use a positive move or negative
21:31 - move but for this for instance this one
21:34 - is facing to the right the sprites are
21:35 - facing to the right we haven't change
21:37 - any of the orientation so just use the
21:40 - positive number so this I put seven that
21:44 - means the you know every every every
21:48 - time this loop run no move seven step
21:50 - forward so if you want the crowd to go
21:53 - faster the other change is the high
21:55 - number like 10 15 right if you want go
21:59 - slower you use a smaller number all
22:02 - right
22:02 - and also one two you can also make him
22:06 - point in the direction as well so make
22:09 - sure that okay he's always going that
22:11 - side or you can put it in the front here
22:14 - that's also fine I mean now car is
22:16 - always going that side anyway okay and
22:20 - then what you can do is you have to us
22:24 - check if the car gets to the end you
22:28 - want to move them back today so if
22:30 - there's a car get all the way to the end
22:32 - here and disappear you want to move them
22:34 - back just hide them and moving back here
22:36 - so what you have to do is you have to
22:38 - check the position so you will say the
22:43 - exposition of this of this of this car
22:49 - right because we're checking an
22:51 - exposition so you get the operator here
22:56 - you'll see if the exposition is greater
22:59 - than you know you can move your car you
23:02 - can tell go back to motion you'll see it
23:04 - right like 200 or whatever I walk what
23:08 - to 30 because that's like probably at
23:10 - the end right now this is 209
23:13 - to 30 maybe all away like this right
23:15 - there's 255 right this depends on what
23:18 - you wanted even 255 right 250 is fun
23:21 - also doesn't matter so like if the car
23:25 - move all the way to the end
23:27 - what we go into with a highlight right
23:29 - we just said hi so we'll hide it and we
23:33 - can set the eights back to whatever the
23:35 - eggs we had here so what we can do is a
23:38 - set X back to negative 240 so since
23:43 - we're doing 250 let's just change
23:45 - everything to 250 it will be easier oops
23:51 - so let's do 258 250 and 250 all right
23:57 - and then what we want to do after that
24:00 - we'll want to show so want to show the
24:02 - toy again I think I think zoom out a
24:05 - little bit colors getting along and we
24:09 - are going to check I've it touched a
24:12 - crap so we'll need this condition here
24:16 - sorry
24:16 - the if condition put it here so this is
24:22 - the moving part right so now we have the
24:25 - after this Co is finished running it
24:27 - will run this code so now we will check
24:29 - if this if the if the crap got hit okay
24:34 - so we won't it there's a condition will
24:39 - pioneer and join also so we'll have to
24:42 - check that stop button so remember that
24:45 - stop action we don't want the car to run
24:47 - him over twice and he lost to life so we
24:50 - need to enjoy so not just just not just
24:53 - one so what we say is this will say
24:57 - touching crap so the car is touching
25:01 - crap and you remember we use the not
25:05 - operator right so throw this that in
25:07 - here say not and we call the stop action
25:12 - oops we've got one more so when it's not
25:18 - equal to Y meaning up
25:25 - the the crappy not get hit then whoa
25:29 - what casts a message saying to crap that
25:34 - hit so podcast drop clicked on the
25:38 - drop-down click got a new message and
25:40 - say hit crab so the car hit the crap so
25:50 - let's run this and see how it looks so
25:53 - as you can see the cars running left to
25:56 - right then gets it and he'll come back
25:59 - and it's not going again right okay
26:03 - alright so we can see the car moving now
26:06 - we will have to go back to the crap what
26:11 - we can do is in the crap here okay
26:15 - alright so what we can do is I will stop
26:18 - right here the one that make the video
26:20 - too long we'll stop with another video
26:23 - and we'll complete the crap and the car
