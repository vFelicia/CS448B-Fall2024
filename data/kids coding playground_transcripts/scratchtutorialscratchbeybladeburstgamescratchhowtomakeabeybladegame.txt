00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:10 - playground and today we're back for
00:12 - another video on scratch
00:14 - so in this video we will be talking
00:17 - making a beyblade burst game and yes
00:20 - this was uh
00:21 - commented by one of our
00:24 - uh subscribers so
00:27 - yeah let's just jump right into it so
00:29 - there's a player one which is
00:31 - you and then there's a i which is
00:34 - the yellow beyblade and you're the
00:37 - uh pink labeling and then so if you
00:41 - click it the background making these
00:43 - colors to make the game more interesting
00:45 - and um you can uh as you can see ai
00:49 - does damage and he'll attack you once in
00:52 - a while and then you will lose your
00:54 - hp up there and then you can also attack
00:57 - ai
01:00 - and then you can do some damage
01:04 - so i'm gonna let him
01:15 - [Music]
01:21 - uh you win so you won and if aai kills
01:24 - you you lose
01:25 - but uh ai is a little dumb and always
01:28 - moves around and so you make it so then
01:32 - it moves around it doesn't always hit
01:34 - you so
01:35 - ai does more damage so it does
01:40 - eight i think eight to five damage or so
01:42 - so and then the regular beyblade does
01:44 - like one damage
01:45 - five to one so yeah sometimes they'll
01:48 - hit you and sometimes it won't to make
01:50 - it more random
01:52 - so
02:00 - uh so i we have a shout out
02:05 - and it's
02:09 - he said or she said can you make
02:12 - a beyblade game please and then we
02:14 - replied
02:15 - so yeah uh so this is your beyblade game
02:18 - i know that comment was like three weeks
02:20 - ago but we finally checked some comments
02:21 - later
02:22 - and then some dude named d world
02:26 - decided to um
02:29 - wanted us to shout out so she is uh so
02:32 - you can check out her uh scratch
02:36 - and then yeah these are all our shout
02:39 - outs for today
02:41 - so we're gonna um get everything
02:45 - prepared so let's get everything done
02:48 - there's
02:48 - a backdrop for some reason i used the
02:51 - light blue
02:52 - no one knows why um i don't know why
02:55 - either
02:56 - so there we go we don't even need this
02:58 - brush scratch cat
02:59 - goodbye and um let's center this
03:05 - in the center yeah so and then we need
03:07 - this
03:08 - the outline so it's like this
03:13 - so i click shift and then you move it in
03:15 - the middle
03:16 - and then you get the two lines
03:20 - right through it oh okay oopsies i gotta
03:23 - hold the ships
03:27 - it is in uh proportion because i didn't
03:30 - move in the middle yet
03:31 - but look i can put this
03:36 - right in the middle
03:40 - there we go it's really hard to see the
03:44 - line
03:45 - there we go we finished our beyblade
03:48 - stadium
03:48 - i don't play beyblade so this is what i
03:51 - watched a youtube video and it looked
03:53 - like this looks like
03:54 - the stadium so anyways let's continue
03:57 - so we have to put our backpack things
04:01 - so you can download from our google
04:02 - drive links in the description so
04:04 - we have the you lose you win sprite
04:07 - the beyblade what the ai and the player
04:11 - so if you do not know how to do this you
04:13 - can go to my project that i share
04:15 - and export it so you can get the sprites
04:19 - under for your own
04:22 - so export yeah that button so yeah
04:24 - anyways i'm gonna
04:25 - get started on coding player
04:28 - so let's code player so
04:32 - in the beginning when the green flag is
04:34 - clicked
04:38 - it will set player one
04:46 - to a hundred so you have 100 hp
04:49 - and i'll go to
04:52 - player one negative 160 i do have
04:56 - coordinates i just want to do this so
04:58 - then
04:58 - they're on the opposite sides of the
05:00 - stadium so yeah just better
05:02 - and then go forever turn 15 degrees so
05:06 - it's always spinning
05:07 - always spinning so yeah
05:10 - and then when the green flag is clicked
05:15 - it'll go forever
05:18 - and if then
05:22 - if then the mouse is down
05:26 - which means that if it's clicked now
05:29 - down where's that button
05:32 - there it is so if then mouse down
05:36 - then glide 0.1 seconds to mouse pointer
05:40 - so glide to your mouse once you click
05:47 - and now we need a if then statement
05:51 - and put it in here
05:54 - and if touching
05:59 - a i then
06:03 - broadcast bounce and wait so yeah
06:09 - bouncing bounce
06:12 - so we have that finished and now
06:15 - when i receive bounce
06:22 - i'll start this sound called hit i
06:24 - downloaded this you can download this
06:26 - from us too so yeah
06:28 - uh it'll start sound hit
06:32 - move negative 30 steps so it'll bounce
06:36 - back like go like
06:38 - like if you hit it that means it would
06:40 - go like
06:41 - bam and no if this hits this it'll go up
06:45 - so yeah that's basically what it is and
06:47 - we have
06:48 - a weight point one second
06:52 - oopsie and then
06:56 - we'll move negative another
06:59 - negative 30 steps
07:06 - so let's see yes
07:14 - oopsies
07:18 - yeah see look it's working so it bounced
07:20 - in a random position
07:21 - because yeah you know that's how it is
07:24 - so yeah
07:25 - now we're gonna work still work on
07:29 - now we're gonna work on a i
07:32 - so the ai has a
07:36 - decent amount of code so first we're
07:38 - gonna
07:39 - for the ai we're gonna go when the green
07:42 - flag is clicked
07:43 - i'll set the variable ai so we're going
07:45 - to make a variable ai
07:50 - to 100 of course oh it's to zoom down
07:53 - zoom and
07:56 - go to 0.75
08:03 - and now we have to go forever and i'll
08:06 - turn you know
08:07 - like any other beyblade well i don't
08:09 - play beyblades
08:10 - so sometimes it turns yeah you know
08:12 - we'll turn like the other one
08:14 - and now when i receive bounce
08:18 - the first we have to do this because
08:19 - it's a great flag so when the green hog
08:21 - is clicked
08:22 - i'll go forever wait
08:25 - pick random amount of seconds so i'm
08:27 - gonna get this real quick
08:30 - wait pick random one to two seconds and
08:32 - it will go like bang and start attacking
08:34 - them
08:35 - so you need to if then else statement
08:37 - here
08:39 - if then else if then else the
08:44 - pick random is
08:47 - equal to
08:51 - one okay random
08:58 - pick random from one to two
09:02 - and it will glide 0.1 seconds to a
09:05 - random position so sometimes it'll
09:07 - attack it
09:08 - sometimes it will like a real beyblade
09:11 - in real life
09:12 - so yeah glide 0.1
09:16 - seconds to a random position and
09:19 - you need an else
09:24 - and then you put the else in 0.0 seconds
09:27 - to the player this time
09:29 - and now we have broadcast to bounce
09:34 - a new message called
09:37 - bounce 2 so that's that's what the ai
09:40 - does to damage to the player
09:44 - and the player attacks it with bounce
09:47 - so now we have to add this so when the
09:50 - when when i receive bounce it'll move
09:54 - back
09:54 - 30 steps
09:59 - it will wait 0.01 seconds so that's the
10:03 - fraction of
10:04 - a hundred
10:08 - and it will move go back
10:11 - negative thirty steps
10:15 - where is that yeah okay i'll just
10:17 - duplicate this
10:20 - it will also change ai hp
10:23 - by pick random
10:26 - negative five to one so the beyblade can
10:29 - do
10:30 - up to five damage or up or down to one
10:33 - damage
10:35 - in this now we have to do
10:38 - bounce two
10:41 - then it will move negative 20 steps okay
10:45 - i'll just get this
10:50 - uh so since this is the same as this one
10:54 - i'm just gonna do this i mean nega
10:57 - minus 30 is the same thing as -20
11:00 - basically
11:00 - and now the player we're going back to
11:02 - the player
11:07 - bounce two my original project had
11:11 - 0.01 but i'm just going to change this
11:14 - to 0.1 and this to 0.1
11:18 - because i feel like the weight is better
11:19 - like that and when i receive bounce 2
11:24 - same thing basically it'll start sound
11:27 - hit
11:28 - it will wait 0.1 seconds and it will set
11:35 - player one so change player one
11:40 - sorry and it will change player one
11:44 - by pick random negative eight to
11:47 - negative
11:48 - four so the ai is slightly stronger than
11:52 - the um
11:56 - you deal more damage than the player
11:58 - itself and now it's
12:00 - time for the you lose and you win sprite
12:02 - so
12:03 - you win um so when the green flag is
12:06 - clicked
12:07 - so this is how you make it you lose you
12:09 - wins right because some people don't
12:11 - know
12:11 - so first you have to paint a costume got
12:14 - the
12:14 - text you go switch it to handwriting if
12:17 - you want to and you can write whatever
12:19 - you want
12:20 - why you can write you win and there you
12:23 - can place it in the middle and make it
12:27 - gigantic that's how you make a you win
12:31 - you lose sprite and just center it so
12:33 - that's how
12:34 - you do it and so i'm now i'm going to
12:36 - start coding the you and you lose sprite
12:38 - so when the green flag is clicked it
12:41 - will go to x
12:42 - 0 y 0 in the middle directly
12:46 - and then it will hide
12:49 - wait one second it'll go forever
12:56 - so you gotta wait one second because um
12:59 - it's a little delay
13:01 - for like if you want to set for
13:03 - everything to set up the hp
13:05 - and everything so that's why you need to
13:06 - wait one second so that's really
13:08 - important so please do not miss this
13:09 - part
13:10 - so i'll go forever and i'll go or
13:16 - if it's tight if player hp
13:19 - is equal to
13:22 - or less than
13:26 - zero i mean zero is greater than
13:29 - the player hp player one
13:34 - i really like this game it's pretty fun
13:37 - and then
13:37 - it'll show and switch costume to costume
13:42 - too
13:44 - no stop all
13:49 - right there and now we gotta duplicate
13:52 - that
13:53 - and just tweak it a little bit
13:57 - you know put it under the then loop you
13:59 - know how to do this by now probably
14:01 - and you need the ai
14:04 - and then ai and then it shows which
14:08 - yeah yeah you get the point and then now
14:11 - for the final touch the backdrop
14:12 - changing color
14:13 - and all that jazz which makes the
14:16 - enhances the project
14:19 - so when the the green flag is clapped
14:21 - clicked
14:22 - it'll set the volume to 25 percent
14:26 - well you can make it a hundred percent
14:27 - but i did 25
14:29 - because i wanted you guys to hear my
14:31 - voice during the demo
14:33 - so it'll go forever and i'll play a
14:35 - sound called trap beat
14:42 - so trap beat and now
14:45 - when the green flag is clicked it will
14:47 - clear all graphic effects
14:52 - and then it'll start changing color the
14:54 - board will start changing color
14:56 - because it's a magical board and then
14:59 - it'll change color effect by
15:00 - one so it will slowly change color
15:06 - let's do this
15:12 - oh yeah
15:29 - [Music]
15:36 - i lost as you can see
15:40 - i made a mistake so this i
15:44 - i noticed that this is costume one so if
15:46 - you win
15:47 - it's costume one if you lose costume two
15:50 - and both of them were costume too so
15:52 - that's what so i just
15:54 - changed it and yeah
15:58 - so now time for the real demo
16:07 - [Music]
16:20 - a lot of massive damage but
16:22 - [Music]
16:23 - since the ai is
16:37 - sorry but i got it backwards and if the
16:39 - player hp is zero
16:41 - then of course it's gonna say you lose
16:45 - and if the ai's health is zero then of
16:47 - course it's gonna say
16:48 - you win so now it's time for the
16:52 - real demo
16:58 - so yeah
17:03 - [Music]
17:11 - [Applause]
17:12 - [Music]
17:16 - win see okay great
17:20 - and if the ai kills you that means you
17:22 - lose so i'm going to show you that
17:25 - so i just changed his hp to 10 and i'll
17:27 - show you
17:30 - and then the ai will kill you
17:33 - so it says you lose so that's basically
17:36 - the concept of the game
17:37 - and um yeah
17:40 - [Music]
17:42 - so please like share subscribe
17:47 - and comment in the comment section below
17:49 - i mean like
17:50 - basically what else you want because we
17:52 - can make those games
17:53 - uh as you say so anyways see you guys
17:57 - next time
18:03 - [Music]
