00:05 - thank you
00:07 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:09 - playground today we'll be making a snow
00:11 - effects project in scratch so in a lot
00:14 - of our past tutorials we have uh games
00:16 - where we use the snow effects like our
00:18 - Christmas platformer uh snow effect will
00:21 - probably make your game look a lot
00:22 - better and cleaner
00:23 - and you can use it for your Christmas
00:25 - themed projects so let's get right into
00:27 - it
00:28 - okay so first thing what you want to do
00:30 - is create a new Sprite paint
00:34 - and then we're going to
00:36 - use the fill no outline we're going to
00:39 - use white fill no outline I'm gonna hold
00:41 - down shift so we're going to zoom in
00:43 - hold down shift so you can get a perfect
00:45 - circle
00:46 - uh we're gonna try to make this 11 by
00:48 - 11.
00:49 - okay so here you have our uh snow so we
00:52 - can we can rename the Sprite just now
00:55 - I'm sorry
00:57 - so and then for the code for the snow
01:00 - we're going to start off with a white
01:01 - refly clicks
01:03 - we're gonna set the ghost effects
01:06 - we're going to set the ghost effects
01:10 - set ghost effects and to 100 so we're
01:14 - going to make it hide in the beginning
01:16 - and then we're going to go to
01:19 - this position we're going to go to zero
01:22 - uh y220 so it's going to be somewhere up
01:24 - here
01:25 - so then we let us know to start like up
01:27 - here and we've got a forever Loop
01:28 - forever
01:30 - uh and then we make a variable for the
01:32 - Sprite only so we're going to make a
01:33 - variable
01:35 - uh for the Sprite only we're going to
01:38 - name it uh wind
01:40 - and notice how I put in lowercase
01:42 - because for the spray only we're going
01:45 - to set the variable wind
01:47 - to pick random negative one to one so
01:49 - what this wind thing is this does is to
01:51 - make the snow kind of sway around like
01:54 - it shifts around
01:55 - like in real life how there's wind it
01:57 - makes the snow move around in the air
01:59 - so we can hide the verb and then we're
02:02 - going to get a create a clone of myself
02:05 - come over here
02:06 - and then we're going to put a weight a
02:08 - little delay before we uh spawn in the
02:11 - Clones I'm gonna wait pick random
02:14 - let's do 0.05
02:17 - 0.005 to 0.01 seconds
02:21 - so like it won't look like there's too
02:22 - much snow but it's just enough
02:25 - and we can just add a black backdrop so
02:27 - you can see this no better so
02:29 - actually just paint a backdrop let's
02:31 - just get the black
02:34 - black color it's going to draw a box
02:39 - cut Dropbox all right good enough
02:42 - so now you can actually see the uh snow
02:46 - okay
02:47 - so next what we want to do is when we
02:50 - start as a clone
02:51 - when I start as a clone we're going to
02:53 - set the size
02:54 - so we're going to make some snowflakes a
02:56 - little bigger some smooth like smaller
02:57 - so we're gonna
02:59 - just kind of pick random so we're going
03:00 - to set the size I'm sorry not this one
03:03 - said
03:05 - size percent right here sorry I didn't
03:07 - see that uh we're gonna do pick random
03:09 - 60 to 100 so some circuits are bigger
03:12 - than others
03:13 - and then we're gonna get a go-to so
03:15 - we're gonna go to
03:16 - we're gonna go to x negative random 240
03:20 - negative 240 to 240 so the snow will
03:23 - spawn from this corner to this quarter
03:24 - and we're going to keep the Y at 220.
03:27 - okay next we want to get a repeat so
03:30 - we're going to hit repeat four times
03:32 - and then we're gonna change this ghost
03:34 - effect by negative 20. so it's just to
03:37 - make it more clear so we're going to
03:39 - change
03:40 - ghost effects by negative 20.
03:44 - and then next we're going to repeat so
03:45 - I'll show you in a second why we need
03:47 - this repeat two right here so we're
03:50 - going to put a repeat two change y by
03:52 - negative 5.
03:55 - since the actually making it come down
03:57 - and I'm going to change the X by the
03:59 - wind so change X
04:02 - by the wind
04:04 - and then we're going to get a repeat
04:06 - until
04:07 - so repeat until
04:10 - touching Edge
04:13 - touching Edge
04:15 - and then we're going to change the Y we
04:17 - just duplicate this part
04:19 - and then repeat 10 times and repeat
04:23 - repeat 10 times we're gonna
04:26 - change the ghost effect by 10.
04:28 - so this is going to make it slowly Fade
04:30 - Out as it goes down so we're going to
04:32 - change the ghost effect when it touches
04:33 - the edge it's going to make it slowly
04:34 - Fade Out
04:36 - change the ghost effect
04:38 - by 10.
04:40 - and then we're going to delete the Clone
04:41 - with that
04:43 - okay so now when we run it
04:47 - you have a snow effect
04:49 - so why do we need this repeat I'll show
04:51 - you what happens when you don't have it
04:53 - because the snow is already touching the
04:55 - edge we have to put this or else this
04:57 - happens all the snow is just
04:59 - disappearing up there because there is
05:02 - no it's already touching the edge so we
05:04 - just want to put this repeat two times
05:05 - just to get it off the edge before we
05:07 - start off this part
05:10 - so when you put this back in
05:12 - you can see
05:14 - as you can see the snow comes down and
05:15 - disappears and touches the bottom
05:17 - or the edge
05:19 - and one last thing if you want to make
05:21 - it uh disappear when it touches another
05:23 - Sprite we can do four
05:26 - so we're going to do either touching the
05:28 - edge or touching the cap so this could
05:30 - be useful in your projects where you
05:32 - want to touch another Sprite and
05:34 - disappear
05:35 - so we run it as you can see there's no
05:37 - disappears when it touches the cat
05:41 - all right so that's it for today's
05:43 - tutorial
05:44 - on the snow effects thank you guys for
05:46 - watching don't forget to like share and
05:48 - subscribe ring the notification Bell and
05:50 - I'll see you guys in the next video
