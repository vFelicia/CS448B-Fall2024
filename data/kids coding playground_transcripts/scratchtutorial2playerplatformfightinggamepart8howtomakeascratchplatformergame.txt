00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to the
00:08 - eighth and final part for the two player
00:11 - fighting game
00:12 - so we are finally finished with the game
00:15 - we just have to add
00:16 - some minor tweaks to it so today
00:19 - uh there's a bug in the game so when you
00:22 - killed the player
00:23 - and you press the up or w key it would
00:26 - uh
00:26 - jump it would like go to a jump costume
00:29 - so
00:30 - we added this if then statement so if
00:32 - the player one is
00:34 - dead is equal to n then we put this in
00:37 - here
00:38 - i did it for player one already but i'll
00:40 - demonstrate it in player two later
00:42 - i'll just drag through the code for a
00:44 - little bit so let me explain a little
00:46 - bit more about this
00:47 - so basically this means when the player
00:50 - is not dead
00:51 - they know allow it to jump but if it is
00:54 - dead then it'll become the tombstone
00:56 - so i'm going to drag through the code
01:00 - so you guys look through if you haven't
01:03 - copied some of it down
01:18 - so this is the um remember this is the
01:21 - collision of the bullet this is the
01:24 - attack
01:26 - this is the starting again this is the
01:30 - uh allow it to fall
01:33 - this is to run
01:37 - running control and then we have
01:40 - the
01:45 - we have the p1 is dead so that's pretty
01:48 - much all the code for the player one
01:51 - player two is similar so
01:54 - i'm going to drag through this is if it
01:56 - got hit
01:57 - the attacking attacking
02:02 - attacking
02:06 - uh this is the starting game start again
02:09 - if you want more information you can
02:11 - check out my scratch account it's in the
02:14 - about section of our channel if you want
02:18 - more info
02:19 - about us so that's
02:22 - it for the player 2. so i forgot to add
02:26 - this for the platforms in the previous
02:28 - video that's why
02:29 - the background is blue blue sky my name
02:31 - is the graveyard background
02:33 - so don't forget to add this so this one
02:36 - flag click do you just want to set the x
02:37 - and y position of it
02:39 - go to the front layer go backwards 10
02:42 - layers so go behind the buttons
02:44 - and switch custom to custom one which is
02:47 - the
02:47 - regular backdrop so if you have not
02:51 - added it
02:52 - please add this so your game will
02:54 - function correctly
02:57 - and then next you have the magic gem
03:03 - gem is pretty much the same thing
03:06 - from the last video the begin button
03:11 - so remember we have to set all our
03:14 - variables in the beginning
03:15 - i don't think i set the player 2 in the
03:17 - last video i just realized that so
03:20 - you want to set both their hp's right
03:21 - here back to 100
03:25 - and next you want to go to the character
03:27 - 1 is what we had
03:29 - and remember to add the start game you
03:31 - want hide
03:34 - same thing for this one start gaming
03:36 - hide
03:38 - same thing pretty much the same thing
03:43 - p1hp bar
03:52 - this is what we had
03:56 - this is the p2 health bar
04:00 - p2 health
04:03 - the bullet
04:06 - the kunai these are the projectiles
04:12 - the background button the desert
04:14 - background button
04:16 - the graveyard select button and the
04:19 - force field
04:22 - so that's all we had from last video so
04:26 - i'm going to add that um statement so
04:28 - when it's dead it cannot jump
04:31 - so i'll go i'm gonna show you guys how
04:34 - it worked
04:35 - so i'm just gonna select this
04:42 - and let me just kill this girl
04:46 - [Applause]
04:50 - so as you can see when i kill it and you
04:52 - jump it will end up like in a jumping
04:55 - position we do not want that
04:57 - so we gotta add the if then statement
05:00 - as you can see from here and then jump
05:03 - control
05:05 - right here we're gonna add an if-then
05:06 - statement
05:08 - so if
05:13 - the p1 dead p2 dead
05:16 - this is player 2. so if the p2
05:20 - dead player 2 dead
05:23 - then is equal to n which is no
05:26 - then it'll allow it to jump else it will
05:29 - not
05:30 - so next i'll show you guys so i'm gonna
05:33 - run it again
05:34 - to show you guys how it worked
05:37 - so i'm gonna kill the adventure girl
05:41 - real quick
05:41 - [Music]
05:46 - now when you jump
05:48 - [Music]
05:49 - now when you jump is not switching the
05:51 - costume
05:53 - so it's working so now let's work so
05:55 - today we'll be working on
05:57 - a um a winning and losing screen so
06:01 - we also want to add this for player one
06:05 - let's go to here the p1 dead
06:09 - we want to broadcast we want to wait two
06:12 - seconds
06:13 - so the winner can celebrate a little bit
06:16 - before switching the costume and we can
06:18 - broadcast a message called
06:20 - p player one player win
06:25 - player win so we do player win
06:29 - and we can add another when i receive
06:32 - start screen we want to hide
06:36 - hide so we want to do the exact same
06:40 - thing for player two
06:42 - player two we do the same thing just
06:45 - go here wait two seconds
06:51 - let them celebrate a little bit then we
06:54 - can broadcast
06:55 - the message the p
06:58 - player when we're here player
07:02 - win i'm going to receive start screen
07:07 - now next we want to hide so basically
07:10 - this player win
07:11 - broadcast we're going to make let them
07:13 - start over at the beginning screen again
07:16 - so they don't have to keep on clicking
07:18 - the green flag over and over again
07:20 - because that's annoying we just want to
07:22 - make it easier for them
07:25 - so we're gonna i have this
07:28 - player win thing
07:31 - so if you haven't done it just make two
07:34 - costumes
07:35 - i just wrote player one wins duplicated
07:38 - it
07:38 - made player two wins made it just a
07:40 - different color that's all you have to
07:42 - do
07:43 - so first we're going to get one flat
07:44 - clicked and zoom in
07:47 - uh we wanted to go to zero zero
07:52 - and then we wanted to hide in the
07:53 - beginning
07:57 - when i receive start screen
08:01 - start screen then we want to hide
08:08 - when it receives the player win
08:11 - when i receive player win we can go to
08:14 - the front layer
08:17 - so show in front of everything and get
08:20 - an if else statement so
08:21 - if p2 is dead
08:25 - is equal to yes so that means if the
08:28 - player two
08:29 - is dead if the player two is dead
08:33 - then we can switch costume to costume
08:34 - one notifying that
08:36 - the player one has one as you can see
08:39 - player
08:40 - one wins is the first costume and else
08:43 - we can switch costume to the second one
08:45 - which is the player two wins
08:48 - we can get a show
08:51 - under here so let a show wait three
08:54 - seconds
08:55 - just give it a little pause and then we
08:58 - broadcast start screen again so it'll go
09:00 - back
09:00 - to the start screen so start screen
09:05 - right here oops start
09:08 - okay so that's it for the player winning
09:12 - and for the four buttons like these
09:15 - four character select buttons we're also
09:18 - going to add something
09:19 - we're going to add if when i receive the
09:22 - start screen
09:24 - when i receive start screen then we can
09:27 - switch costume to costume one
09:29 - so once the game resets again we'll
09:32 - switch it
09:33 - reset it back to the first costume
09:36 - and then we can show
09:39 - so we can just
09:45 - it's basically running this
09:48 - starting again so
09:51 - we can just drag and drop this into the
09:53 - four buttons
09:56 - it'll be the same thing for all of the
09:58 - characters
10:00 - so let me just move it out
10:06 - and we're done with the four buttons so
10:10 - for the four hp
10:11 - bars these four things we want to
10:14 - get when i receive start screen
10:18 - start screen you want to hide
10:23 - basically the one fly clicked but just
10:26 - get the start screen to make it hide
10:28 - and then we just drag and drop it into
10:30 - the four health bars
10:33 - and the hp
10:37 - let me just check if we have it so we
10:39 - have over here
10:40 - we have it for here we have over here
10:46 - yeah we have it for here
10:50 - so we have it all done and i think i
10:52 - forgot to add one flag hide right here
10:54 - so let me just hide it
10:58 - so so i just got my brother here so we
11:01 - can
