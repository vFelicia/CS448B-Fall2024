00:17 - named 1.2
00:19 - so you guys can watch that because
00:20 - that's our first post today the second
00:22 - post today
00:23 - um so if you didn't know we saw our
00:26 - first day of spring
00:27 - and i think the fill the punxsutawney
00:30 - phil
00:31 - whatever the heck he's called the
00:33 - groundhog dude
00:34 - said that it would be six more weeks of
00:36 - winter well it's like it's
00:37 - it's like the heat of summer now so i
00:39 - mean like
00:40 - if if you live here it's so hot so
00:44 - phil is wrong it's a wonderful day let's
00:47 - have a barbecue okay so
00:48 - this is my project that i made it's a
00:50 - spring cooking game
00:52 - animation because people ask for a
00:54 - cooking spring whatever
00:56 - um game animation so
00:59 - we decided to make this so it's a
01:01 - wonderful day
01:03 - i agree let's light the fire chat other
01:06 - cat
01:08 - a bucket here a little grill hold some
01:10 - fire sounds
01:12 - and a fire we actually drew this fire
01:14 - and then we put the skewer
01:16 - on with the different foods a little it
01:19 - is done
01:20 - let's eat yeah i'm hungry
01:23 - so they're eating the food right now and
01:25 - then yeah let me put out the fire so he
01:27 - kicks the bucket and it flips over and
01:29 - it dumps the fire
01:31 - let's go home so then they go home so
01:34 - it's a simple
01:36 - uh animation that you can make so we're
01:39 - not going to teach this animation it's
01:40 - just a showcase
01:41 - and we will show you the code and we'll
01:43 - provide all the sprites
01:45 - so um we can also draw your own sprites
01:48 - so we'll be teaching you how to draw
01:49 - your own sprites so stick in for like
01:51 - the next 10 minutes or so
01:52 - so um here we go we have
01:56 - uh we have all this stuff so
02:00 - so um i'm gonna draw the vlogs for you
02:03 - i'm not a good artist
02:04 - so i'm gonna try doing this so
02:07 - i'm gonna get this color real quick so
02:09 - yeah so this is how you draw logs
02:13 - so paint you need outline
02:17 - outline no outline and then this thing
02:21 - the first one should look like this
02:28 - so it should be as big as that i mean
02:30 - like it's off the screen right now so
02:32 - you can
02:32 - position it better i don't know so you
02:35 - can also draw another one
02:37 - and tilt it so make a long and skinny
02:40 - soap because wood is always different
02:41 - so you can make it like thick thicker or
02:46 - smaller so like this
02:49 - you can flip it silk a skinny one
02:52 - you can make a skinny one i think this
02:55 - one should be more
02:56 - bigger
02:59 - i think this one should be more bigger
03:02 - uh yeah
03:05 - this should be fine so in that is that
03:07 - and then we can also make another one
03:09 - so we can make a a thicker one so
03:13 - this we can
03:17 - uh you can control c
03:21 - ctrl v so i can make the other one
03:24 - thicker but i decided to make this one
03:25 - more less because it's it looks like the
03:29 - smaller logs are on top
03:31 - and then the bigger log is on the bottom
03:33 - so this is basically how the fighter log
03:35 - should look like
03:36 - but i'm gonna use this costume so you
03:38 - guys can copy off of that
03:40 - and then i'm gonna show you how to draw
03:42 - a skewer next
03:45 - actually first the grill because the
03:46 - grill is the easier one
03:48 - yeah yeah so do that so um
03:52 - paint so first you have to start out
03:54 - with the little cubes
03:56 - so not the cubes
03:59 - this so draw the
04:03 - other two things so there's two little
04:06 - things on the side of the grill
04:08 - and you also need the thing so
04:11 - so i'm gonna make one like this tall
04:14 - and then i'm gonna put the other one all
04:17 - the way on the other side so it's ctrl c
04:18 - ctrl v
04:19 - and i'm gonna put it all the way
04:23 - here here i think i should put it there
04:27 - yeah
04:27 - so um i'll position it later so don't
04:30 - worry about that
04:31 - outline the thickness should be six so
04:35 - uh let's do six and then make
04:38 - a long line all the way
04:42 - across oh no all the way across
04:46 - here and then okay and then
04:49 - a second line then we get too close i
04:52 - think i'm ready too close
04:54 - so a second line
04:59 - oh my god i made it too close
05:04 - but i think that's fine i can make
05:06 - multiple lines to make it
05:07 - not like it's that close
05:11 - so
05:14 - so you have to hold the shift key while
05:16 - you're doing
05:17 - oopsies it's always too close i because
05:21 - the one that was over here is really
05:23 - close lines and i want to make it really
05:25 - close so it looks like the same
05:27 - so it should be around here yeah so
05:29 - three of these
05:30 - this looks great in my opinion i don't
05:32 - know but okay so
05:34 - you guys can follow along or you can
05:35 - copy this one i thought those two
05:39 - yeah so i just made it a little bit
05:41 - close
05:42 - so yeah i'm going to pull that one
05:47 - farther and then i'm going to pull this
05:48 - one to make it look like the same as
05:51 - the other one that i have so yeah great
05:54 - um great so look it looks
05:57 - it looks like grill now so and next
06:00 - we're gonna work on the skewer
06:02 - just we need to make a plain old stick
06:06 - here
06:07 - thickness is it's loading
06:11 - thickness is 10 so i'm gonna make this
06:13 - ten
06:14 - and then i'm gonna make it
06:21 - i'm gonna make it oopsies
06:29 - i'm gonna make it really like
06:32 - this did i make it i can't even see it
06:36 - i think it's hiding yeah it's hiding so
06:38 - i think it should be
06:39 - longer i'm not sure so yeah we can make
06:42 - this
06:43 - longer just a little bit yeah that
06:45 - should be the right size
06:48 - so i'm gonna show it here
06:51 - that's a little bit too long uh like a
06:55 - little bit shorter
06:57 - it's fine in your project you can make
06:58 - it smaller so i'm gonna
07:01 - make some uh uh
07:06 - um the whatever
07:09 - the fruits the veggies whatever they're
07:12 - called
07:12 - these things i think they're
07:16 - vegetables they're peppers pretty sure
07:18 - they're peppers
07:19 - grilling peppers so um yeah
07:22 - peppers we can also use a circle because
07:25 - circle
07:26 - looks quite well so you can just make it
07:30 - reshape it make it big and make it small
07:32 - doesn't matter
07:33 - so you can make it different sizes and
07:36 - shapes
07:37 - you can make an onion so we made an
07:39 - onion on one of them you can make a
07:41 - fish or even put a fish on one of them
07:44 - so it's
07:45 - different things you can make a lot of
07:47 - different creations it's your creativity
07:50 - because it always looks great so i'm
07:53 - gonna
07:54 - make onion ring next because onion rings
07:57 - are great so
08:03 - i could make onion rings
08:07 - you can see whatever this color is it's
08:09 - actually a circle so outline is now
08:12 - this and then i can make a circle
08:15 - no fill yeah great and then make the
08:18 - onion ring see
08:20 - great onion ring look on earring so yeah
08:24 - so it's just a skewer filled with
08:28 - meat i don't know what meat it could be
08:30 - any meat if you're a vegetarian that's
08:32 - fine
08:33 - you can put it all veggies because
08:35 - everybody likes vegetables
08:37 - so great we can make it a different
08:39 - color like red
08:40 - like that's a red pepper guys so
08:44 - so it's a red pepper guys great uh we
08:47 - can also put one more
08:49 - i'm gonna put one more
08:54 - i i think it's the
08:58 - so it can be meat if you like meat um
09:01 - yeah uh so i can put another piece of
09:04 - meat here
09:06 - i don't know i'm not a good artist so
09:09 - make it like
09:10 - this i don't know
09:16 - it looks like a pepper kinda so uh
09:19 - yeah i can add a little top to that
09:22 - all vegan skewer guys pepper
09:25 - pepper pepper pepper onion great
09:28 - all vegan so this is how you make the
09:30 - roasted version
09:32 - so you just have to duplicate it and
09:33 - change the color so
09:35 - i'm gonna start out with
09:39 - the green one i'm gonna change this to a
09:43 - darker green because it's you know
09:45 - whenever you roast something it gets
09:47 - darker if you didn't know that
09:48 - probably already did but i'm gonna make
09:51 - this one
09:52 - a more darker red almost like a brown
09:56 - so you can make it me if you want to on
09:58 - your game and then i can make this
10:03 - i'll make the brightness lower this oh
10:05 - my god it's almost black
10:07 - like this color great um and i can make
10:10 - this a darker red
10:15 - and this yellow almost like a maroon can
10:19 - be
10:20 - less golden so probably like that yeah
10:24 - great
10:24 - look it's a roasted skewer from raw to
10:27 - roasted
10:28 - so yeah or you can use this one look at
10:32 - this
10:33 - greatness so look meat
10:36 - there's meat peppers onions meat
10:39 - pepper meat and this is the roasted
10:42 - version oh yeah and you can also add the
10:43 - fish because
10:44 - cat two the brown one and the gray one
10:48 - the green one has a fish on it so you
10:51 - can add a fish
10:52 - and this is how you get a fish under
10:53 - thing so i'm gonna skewer too
10:56 - delete that costume first i'm gonna go
10:57 - back to the skewer
10:59 - oh never mind that's the regular costume
11:01 - so yeah
11:02 - this one you make the fish you just have
11:05 - to upload a costume and group it and put
11:07 - it into there so that's how you make it
11:09 - no no no it's a search costume so choose
11:11 - a costume
11:14 - fish because you know cats always love
11:17 - to eat fish
11:18 - i'm pretty sure these are all tropical
11:20 - fish i think this one might be edible
11:22 - not sure i don't i'm not a fish
11:23 - expert so yeah so fish you can
11:27 - just group this ctrl c
11:31 - and then i'll put it like over here ctrl
11:34 - v
11:35 - and then you can delete this costume
11:37 - afterwards
11:39 - and then you can just align it on one of
11:41 - those things so
11:43 - i i gotta group it first so
11:48 - group it group and then you can add it
11:51 - anywhere you want you can add it on the
11:53 - bottom you can add on top
11:54 - you can add a big fish you gotta
11:58 - flip horizontal you can make it flip the
12:01 - other way so you can even make it really
12:04 - big
12:04 - like you caught a big tuna or something
12:06 - i don't know to change the color of the
12:08 - fish you gotta ungroup it and break it
12:10 - up so
12:11 - ungroup and then you gotta get on one of
12:14 - those little scales
12:15 - and little dots and scales so that's for
12:18 - the whole one
12:19 - you can make a brown color because you
12:21 - just fried a fish so
12:22 - um yeah this is that and we can make the
12:26 - meat like a darker color a darker
12:29 - yellow like yeah nice not coloring the
12:32 - whole thing because it's
12:34 - ungrouped so nice um make it a darker
12:39 - or yellow it's like almost a brown color
12:43 - more like a plant type color
12:47 - not really so yeah i like a jade color i
12:50 - don't know
12:50 - so and then um you can make the eye
12:53 - even more darker but that's fine and you
12:56 - can change the color of the spots
12:58 - but that's fine you can do it if you
13:00 - want to but we ungrouped it again so now
13:02 - it's one spot by one spot
13:04 - so so this one and this one looks very
13:07 - similar so you can just
13:09 - oh i haven't grouped it so
13:12 - so yeah and then we can just group it
13:15 - back
13:18 - together group
13:20 - so and then you can add it onto your
13:22 - skewer if you want to
13:23 - but this is the raw skewer so you can
13:25 - put on your cooked skewer so that's
13:27 - basically how you do the fish
13:28 - and then now we're going to teach you
13:30 - how to do the fire
13:31 - so the fire is quite hard
13:36 - so yeah um my dad drew all these
13:40 - a fire costume we spent a lot of effort
13:42 - drawing all this stuff
13:43 - reshaping squares and adding all these
13:47 - little particle effects
13:48 - it took forever believe me and then uh
13:52 - so
13:52 - do you know why so please like share
13:55 - subscribe
13:56 - right now please just do it and
13:59 - what while you subscribe your subscribe
14:02 - is gonna be blazing hot and it's gonna
14:03 - boost our channel
14:05 - thank you for your subscribe thank you
14:07 - so
14:08 - you can make this fire so i'm gonna try
14:11 - to make this fire so
14:13 - i mean like not a good artist
14:16 - so i might just fail the fire looks
14:19 - very hard to do so you just have to
14:22 - start out with a circle
14:23 - looks so bland but you just have to
14:26 - reshape it into life
14:27 - so um yeah maybe change some edges
14:31 - make some ridges i don't know make it
14:34 - like a fire type of shape
14:36 - takes forever we might make one or two
14:40 - costumes or three
14:41 - for you to see so looks more like a
14:43 - dinosaur
14:44 - print like when you step like one of
14:46 - those t-rexes that are
14:48 - stumped down and they make the little
14:50 - print in the mud
14:51 - right now but we have to add all the
14:53 - fire effects
14:54 - and it will look glorious so right now
14:58 - i'm reshaping all the fire and
15:01 - making it a paw print i don't know what
15:03 - this is right now
15:04 - um looks way different cause it looks
15:08 - so i'm not a good artist so yeah
15:11 - this looks like uh
15:15 - a dog like a dog can
15:19 - but the ring finger is kind of messed up
15:22 - and the pinkies are in the pinky and the
15:24 - middle fingers so short
15:26 - so yeah looks like a volcano now so but
15:29 - you now you have to copy paste it ctrl
15:33 - c ctrl v you make another set of it
15:36 - and then you make it smaller and make it
15:38 - inside
15:40 - and now you have to change the color
15:42 - just a little bit and reshape it so then
15:44 - it'll fit inside the fire
15:45 - so great then we can change the color
15:48 - this um
15:49 - blazing hot thing the inside of the fire
15:53 - if you ever seen a fighter
15:54 - like in those cartoons and stuff they
15:56 - always have the red layer
15:58 - the orange layer outside and they have
16:00 - like the lighter orange layer and then
16:02 - they have the yellow layer so
16:04 - that's basically what we're doing right
16:05 - now so yeah
16:08 - um yeah
16:11 - looks this one looks way better so we
16:14 - can make a
16:15 - third one which we have to i guess so
16:18 - so um this fire is looking kind of
16:21 - screwed so
16:22 - um we can add a third layer but we're
16:25 - not gonna do that you can add some
16:26 - little particle effects
16:28 - like just some you know
16:31 - i don't know uh
16:34 - red little lava effects coming out like
16:38 - in minecraft if you ever played
16:39 - minecraft you probably have
16:41 - i mean like minecraft like the lava pits
16:44 - they always have like lava jumping out
16:46 - so that's basically what we're doing and
16:49 - then you can also make some
16:50 - gas as well which is because fire
16:54 - emits deadly gas so
16:58 - yeah we can make some gas make a gray
17:00 - color
17:02 - so gray draw some little
17:05 - i don't know a gas particles so around
17:09 - the fire
17:10 - and then you should make them go up and
17:11 - then new gas particles come out so
17:14 - we also have this in the google drive if
17:15 - you don't want to make your fire
17:17 - and it ends up looking like a butterfly
17:19 - or something then you can download it
17:21 - feel free to download it
17:22 - and if you don't understand watch our
17:24 - entire download google drive
17:26 - um video uh yeah you can do that it's on
17:29 - our channel so
17:30 - yeah um we could yeah so this is
17:34 - basically our animation you can code
17:36 - whatever you want but first let me show
17:37 - you the code to our animation
17:39 - so i'm starting out the butterfly
17:40 - because butterfly is just useless
17:43 - just flies there doing nothing so this
17:45 - is a butterfly
17:46 - feel free to pause because we're almost
17:48 - at the 20 minute mark so we gotta speed
17:51 - this up
17:51 - grill nah this is no code basically
17:56 - fire logs nope this is barely any code
17:58 - as well
17:59 - skewer so first i'm going to start out
18:01 - with the regular cat
18:06 - i i can't even zoom in i gotta
18:09 - i i could drag this thing down here so
18:12 - you can see it all right yeah yeah so
18:14 - this is for a regular cat
18:18 - so you could do this and and
18:21 - and you can make them talk back and
18:23 - forth like it's like a real conversation
18:26 - and then you can go to cat2 this is
18:28 - basically all the code
18:30 - feel free to pause remember and um yeah
18:34 - this is pretty good i mean like they're
18:35 - having like a conversation yeah i'm
18:37 - hungry yeah let me put out the fire and
18:39 - stuff
18:40 - so skewer this is where the skewer
18:44 - jumps onto the grill and starts burning
18:47 - itself so
18:48 - yeah nice you feel free to pause and
18:51 - then skewer two um
18:56 - codes everywhere so this looks great as
18:59 - well
18:59 - and then we got skewer two and then
19:02 - yeah and then take out oh wait i forgot
19:05 - to name this
19:06 - take out if you use the first uh
19:09 - costume a takeout it looks really like a
19:12 - bucket
19:12 - so you take out a it looks so much like
19:15 - a bucket if you do not know
19:16 - chinese food yeah i was like that always
19:19 - looks like a bucket uh outside so
19:21 - great um all this stuff fire gone fire
19:25 - put out
19:25 - all this stuff and then you can also do
19:27 - the backdrop add some music
19:29 - and then we have the fire tackling
19:32 - i did i didn't demo the fire code yet so
19:36 - here's the fire code and then there
19:40 - fighter sand oh so i just
19:44 - i think i think i actually got this from
19:46 - a real life fighter that i made
19:48 - a like a while ago and i just recorded
19:51 - like the fire
19:52 - just cackling and then at the camp so i
19:54 - just took some sound from that so
19:56 - yeah that's what i did so yeah
19:59 - that's about it guys and you guys
20:02 - remember to make your own story or you
20:03 - can just copy our story i don't know
20:06 - you can if you want to but remember you
20:08 - can be creative
