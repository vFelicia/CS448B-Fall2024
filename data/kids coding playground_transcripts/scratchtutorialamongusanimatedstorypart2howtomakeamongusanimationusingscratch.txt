00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to the kids
00:10 - cooling playground channel
00:11 - so today we'll be working continue
00:13 - working on the mangas animated story
00:16 - this is part two so we'll go inside here
00:21 - all right so uh where we left off last
00:24 - time was uh we created the uh
00:26 - the among us the cyan character you can
00:30 - move them around
00:31 - and we have some code for the red um
00:35 - among us costume here so he will be
00:38 - on the first level and then we have the
00:41 - backdrop
00:42 - there's some call in the background we
00:43 - play the music uh for now i am going to
00:46 - remove this
00:47 - for now so that you know we're not
00:49 - having too many
00:50 - uh sound when we're testing the code so
00:53 - uh and then we also have this
00:55 - is our main um story
00:59 - where we started the episode one so this
01:01 - uh
01:02 - start the broadcast of episode one then
01:04 - it goes the background background will
01:06 - change the
01:07 - backdrop to one then it'll start the
01:10 - code for
01:11 - the cyan sprite and also the
01:15 - red sprite here
01:18 - all right so we'll continue working on
01:20 - this so what we want to do i think in
01:22 - the first
01:23 - when the video when i was showing we
01:24 - have actually have something that shows
01:26 - a weapon right how they do the weapon
01:28 - uh what kind of move uh like one two
01:30 - three four
01:31 - five six seven or something like that
01:33 - that is the last one here the power
01:35 - ability
01:36 - so what we want to do is this um
01:40 - so this should be pretty easy since we
01:42 - have all the sprites already done
01:44 - so if you guys do not have it please
01:46 - load all the sprite in
01:47 - and for the backdrop you can just uh
01:50 - load them up one by one
01:52 - so backdrop one two three four
01:55 - five six and so on and until you get to
01:58 - the last two backdrop
02:00 - okay so just load them in this order
02:02 - okay
02:03 - um all right so once you
02:07 - load them up um
02:09 - [Music]
02:10 - so now we'll go back over here okay when
02:13 - the green flap is clicked
02:15 - uh what we're going to do is we're going
02:16 - to hide it so that it doesn't show up in
02:18 - the beginning
02:20 - and we're going to make it go to some
02:21 - position it doesn't matter i guess
02:23 - whatever position we have here is fine
02:25 - if it doesn't work then you can actually
02:27 - show so it kind of look like this i
02:29 - think this is fine
02:30 - if not if you want to put on here you
02:32 - can but i'm putting in my
02:34 - in here okay all right and then what i'm
02:38 - going to do
02:39 - is just like how we did the other sprite
02:42 - right we have one backdrop one is
02:45 - uh change or show this
02:49 - and we'll duplicate this we'll change
02:51 - this to
02:52 - backdrop four so we'll show that for the
02:55 - first two three stage and then we'll
02:56 - hide it
02:57 - i think after that people know how to
02:59 - play so we can hide the
03:01 - sprite so when we start this game again
03:05 - so we'll have the among us in the middle
03:07 - story here
03:08 - after that it shows this move here all
03:11 - right
03:11 - so what we're going to do next is we'll
03:13 - work on this move
03:15 - so we'll start with the club
03:19 - okay so select your club
03:23 - uh what we're going to do is always
03:24 - start with a screenflex click
03:27 - so what we're going to do we'll hide in
03:29 - the beginning
03:32 - okay so hide that and then what we're
03:35 - going to do is we're going to use this
03:36 - forever loop here
03:39 - and then here we say go to
03:42 - so always go to cyan and then we want to
03:45 - point in the direction of cyan so
03:47 - that way you know if the sign is
03:48 - pointing to the left the club will come
03:50 - here
03:51 - if the sign pointed to the right the
03:52 - club will come on the right side
03:54 - okay so you go to sensing block
03:58 - here take that select the back one first
04:02 - then select the um direction
04:05 - okay all right so now the club will
04:07 - always follow the cyan character
04:10 - um what we need to do next is um we're
04:13 - gonna
04:14 - assign it to uh number one
04:17 - since this is number one right for the
04:19 - club
04:20 - and then we are going to have
04:24 - a condition here so what we want to do
04:25 - is we don't want the
04:27 - the user to be able to hit the club or
04:30 - use any of the
04:31 - ability when you know something is
04:34 - talking or
04:35 - at certain stage you know we don't want
04:36 - to do that so what we're going to do is
04:38 - we're going to use this
04:40 - event else here what i'm going to do is
04:43 - i'll put this over here
04:45 - i'll put this over here well hopefully
04:49 - you guys can see both
04:51 - uh and then you take this you take
04:53 - something called not
04:54 - put that here then you take the equal
05:00 - here you say variable
05:05 - dialog in progress say yes
05:09 - so basically you're saying oh you can
05:11 - say no so basically saying
05:13 - if it's the dialogue it's not yes so any
05:15 - other thing other than yes
05:18 - if it's not yes then you can do this so
05:20 - you can say
05:21 - okay here you say go to front layer so
05:24 - it will come in front of the sprite ears
05:28 - always somewhere like this
05:29 - over here okay and then say
05:32 - show and then we'll broadcast the event
05:41 - and then new message say club
05:44 - so we'll use the club and then we'll say
05:47 - wait one second and then we will
05:52 - high okay
05:55 - so what we want to do is we're going to
05:57 - test this out
05:58 - so let me look at the cyan so we have to
06:01 - set to know right in the beginning
06:03 - okay let's just try it for now
06:07 - so when we push one
06:10 - you can see the club comes out so if it
06:13 - is on the left side will come out and
06:14 - left if it's on the right come on the
06:16 - right okay so the club is still not
06:18 - hitting him we'll fix that
06:22 - okay let me change this to like faster
06:25 - in that four seconds
06:26 - one because we want to test this right
06:28 - so we want to go
06:29 - fast okay all right
06:32 - so we'll go to our among us the red
06:35 - sprite here
06:36 - so what we want to do is we'll probably
06:39 - do the all the
06:40 - backdrop change and position we'll do on
06:42 - top or on the bottom we'll do the uh
06:45 - you know the the animation you know like
06:48 - if we get hit what happened
06:50 - so what we can do is this drag this over
06:52 - here
06:53 - [Music]
06:56 - so so whenever we see
07:00 - club okay
07:04 - so we have to have a wait until
07:06 - [Music]
07:13 - and then you say touching
07:16 - so we'll select club here should be
07:20 - alphabet
07:21 - order oh it's not because i have capital
07:24 - okay capital no case is different so
07:27 - yeah anyway okay so you say touching
07:31 - club
07:32 - now what we're going to do is we're
07:34 - going to do a repeat loop here
07:37 - uh you can do how many time you want
07:39 - we're just going to
07:40 - do a swirl effect of 25 25 times
07:45 - and then there's some effect here let's
07:48 - see
07:48 - what's the swirl
07:50 - [Music]
07:53 - so here effect by 25
07:57 - and then play the recording sound so
07:59 - this sound my kid made
08:01 - you know like like that
08:05 - so just uh sound then we kind of change
08:07 - it to a robot always you can make your
08:09 - own
08:10 - okay or you can use that doesn't matter
08:14 - and we call this sound
08:16 - [Music]
08:20 - so after that i wanna broadcast a
08:23 - message
08:25 - so what you want to do is you can
08:27 - broadcast a message
08:29 - so when you finish the stage there it
08:31 - will open the door and go on the next
08:32 - stage and all
08:34 - so
08:34 - [Music]
08:37 - simple as a message new message
08:42 - and you're gonna say you know mission
08:44 - complete
08:46 - so basically they took one of the crew
08:48 - member out they get this message
08:50 - mission complete okay
08:53 - so what we need to do is we're going to
08:55 - go to the door so i think the first
08:56 - stage we have a door
08:58 - so let's go to the door so we're going
09:01 - to come back to this mission complete
09:03 - um later so we're going to put that in
09:06 - the portal
09:07 - so actually okay let me just go to the
09:08 - portal let's finish that part first so
09:10 - maybe
09:11 - it will be better okay so we'll go to
09:13 - the portal first
09:15 - so this is basically the portal like the
09:16 - door you can go in
09:19 - um so you go to here
09:23 - grab the start so when green flag is
09:27 - clicked
09:29 - you're gonna set some variable here
09:32 - [Music]
09:33 - so what we want to do is um one allow
09:36 - open doors you know so when the green
09:38 - pack is start they don't want
09:39 - to allow the open door so you want to go
09:41 - through the whole scenario when it's
09:43 - finished before we
09:44 - allow them to open door or portal or
09:46 - whatever right
09:47 - so we'll set that
09:50 - and then what we can do is um
09:54 - say go to back layer for now
09:58 - and then high
09:59 - [Music]
10:02 - and then we are going to call this
10:05 - forever loop here
10:08 - and we are going to say next costume so
10:10 - basically
10:12 - what happened here is this portal has
10:14 - like different costume
10:16 - so we kind of like so you see it's kind
10:19 - of turn and turn it keep on turning
10:21 - so i have this let's say i
10:24 - i want to show the portal
10:27 - as if i click on this right
10:31 - so you see it's high but if i show it
10:34 - you can see it's turning right the
10:35 - portal is turning turning turning
10:37 - so that's what it's doing here okay
10:40 - all right okay next so the
10:44 - mission complete so what we want to do
10:47 - is this
10:48 - i'm going to say
10:52 - when i receive kind of
10:55 - zoom out a little bit because there's a
10:57 - little more code here mission complete
11:00 - that's when you take out the crew
11:03 - what you're going to do is you are going
11:06 - to
11:07 - let's just grab it here you're going to
11:09 - allow them to open the door say yes
11:13 - and uh for the first stage with it we
11:15 - didn't have the portal so
11:17 - we don't want to show the port on the
11:18 - first stage but
11:20 - so we have the door we don't want to
11:22 - show the portal we have the portal we
11:23 - don't want to show the door
11:24 - so what you can do is this
11:28 - i'll get this if condition here
11:31 - okay i'm gonna get some oil joint so how
11:34 - old join works is
11:35 - if you are let's say some condition here
11:38 - in some condition here
11:39 - if either of the conditions true then
11:42 - this will run
11:43 - okay that's what it means okay so either
11:45 - this is okay or this is okay
11:48 - so what we're going to do and grab
11:49 - another oil joint here
11:51 - so there's three okay three blocks
11:56 - so what we're going to do we want to
11:57 - check the backdrop
12:00 - number here
12:03 - using this and we're going to have to
12:06 - use some operator here
12:10 - say equal
12:13 - so backdrop number equal to one so which
12:16 - is the
12:16 - first one first costume of our
12:20 - portal here this backdrop number one
12:23 - so we don't want to show the portal at
12:25 - this stage we want to show the door
12:26 - right so what we're going to do is this
12:29 - go back to our portal
12:32 - backdrop number one backdrop number
12:36 - seven so this is depending on which one
12:38 - you want to show
12:39 - so for me i'm doing one seven and eight
12:43 - so we will not have the portal at one
12:45 - seven and eight
12:47 - so we're gonna put it in here and put
12:49 - this over here oops
12:54 - okay i'm gonna zoom out a little bit
12:56 - more so what we want to say is
12:58 - not so it is not
13:03 - one seven and eight
13:06 - then we are going to show this uh portal
13:09 - otherwise we want to show it
13:11 - when the mission is complete okay
13:14 - so what we're going to do is we're going
13:15 - to create a door for this one so go back
13:17 - to the door
13:18 - sprite
13:22 - when green flag is clicked
13:25 - we'll say hi
13:29 - and same thing here when we switch to
13:31 - backdrop one
13:34 - what we want to do is i'm gonna switch
13:37 - the costume
13:40 - [Music]
13:42 - to close so basically
13:46 - you can't switch it to this closed door
13:47 - costume here
13:49 - on backdrop one
13:52 - then we say go to the back layer so that
13:55 - would
13:55 - uncut or behind the sprite
13:58 - and then we'll do show
14:02 - okay so now let's save it let's run it
14:06 - again
14:07 - [Music]
14:08 - so you can see the doors appear in the
14:11 - back
14:11 - okay okay so we have to
14:15 - destroy the crew going to the door right
14:18 - so what we're going to do next
14:22 - okay so now let's go back to a cyan here
14:28 - so on the cyan what we're going to do is
14:32 - we're going to call the
14:32 - up key
14:37 - over here
14:41 - so an up arrow is pressed
14:45 - let's move it over here a little bit you
14:47 - can see it better
14:50 - so what we want to do is check if the uh
14:53 - if they if it's allowed to open the door
14:56 - okay
14:58 - so we say if
14:59 - [Music]
15:02 - and we're going to use the end condition
15:04 - here so any condition meaning you have
15:07 - to have both condition
15:08 - to be true in order to perform this
15:12 - action okay so let's say 1 is equal to 1
15:16 - and 2 is equal to 2 and over
15:18 - equal to true then you do something i
15:20 - mean that might
15:21 - not be a good example but anyway if
15:24 - let's say one
15:25 - variable is equal to something and
15:26 - another variable is equal to something
15:28 - and if both
15:29 - true then you do something in here in
15:31 - the middle
15:32 - okay all right so we're going to check
15:34 - the first variable
15:39 - so you say oops
15:45 - okay you go here you say allow open door
15:49 - to open door it goes to yes
15:53 - so let's allow the open doors equal to
15:55 - yes and
15:55 - [Music]
16:00 - it is touching doors so basically only
16:02 - if you
16:03 - allow the open door and this the sprite
16:04 - is actually touching the door
16:06 - and the up key is pressed then we're
16:08 - allowed to open the door right
16:10 - okay so what you can do is this
16:14 - so use the broadcast and wait broadcast
16:17 - a message
16:18 - open door okay
16:22 - and then you will wait for one second
16:25 - [Music]
16:27 - and then we are going to hide it
16:31 - [Music]
16:33 - and we are going to
16:36 - say broadcast away again
16:43 - and say closed door
16:49 - okay so basically we are going to open
16:51 - the door
16:52 - wait for one second we're going to hide
16:54 - the cyan sprite and then we'll broadcast
16:56 - the closed door
16:58 - okay
17:03 - so what we're going to do is we're going
17:04 - to go back to the door
17:06 - here okay
17:10 - and then we're going to say when i
17:12 - receive
17:15 - open door so
17:18 - wait for one second and then we want to
17:20 - switch to costume
17:23 - to open so same thing for the closed
17:26 - door
17:29 - so this is opposite so we wait for one
17:32 - second
17:33 - and then we'll close it
17:36 - okay and you can put another one seven
17:38 - here wave you like
17:44 - okay
17:46 - okay now let's go back to the cyan here
17:49 - we'll finish up this up arrow for the
17:51 - portal as well
17:55 - okay all right so depending on different
17:59 - stage
18:01 - we you know we broadcast like okay the
18:04 - episode in and it goes to the next stage
18:06 - so
18:06 - for me i'm doing number eight uh
18:09 - backtrack number eight is when the
18:11 - episode two end so
18:15 - it depends for you different different
18:17 - sprite i mean different
18:19 - story you might have differently so for
18:21 - us we're doing that
18:22 - so you can just follow along so here
18:25 - we're gonna
18:26 - take this if condition put here
18:30 - and we are going to take this operator
18:36 - and same thing we're going to check the
18:39 - [Music]
18:40 - vector
18:42 - [Music]
18:43 - so the background number is equal to
18:45 - eight
18:46 - now broadcast event
18:51 - new message
18:57 - so this is episode 2 end
18:59 - [Music]
19:00 - and then we want to also broadcast a new
19:02 - message actually
19:04 - again here after this
19:08 - this is called next stage so this is how
19:11 - we can move from one stage to the next
19:13 - stage okay
19:15 - and use next stage and wait so that
19:17 - they'll do something and change the
19:19 - scene they'll come back
19:20 - okay
19:23 - okay so we need another if condition
19:25 - here here we will work on the portal
19:29 - so here we say if touching
19:34 - [Music]
19:36 - portal
19:41 - hmm what's my portal right here okay if
19:44 - touching portal
19:45 - will say wait
19:48 - for one second and then we'll hide the
19:50 - sprite as well
19:53 - okay and then we'll broadcast the
19:56 - message and wait same thing here
20:00 - select next stage okay
20:04 - and then here we want to set the
20:06 - variable again
20:08 - saying allow the open door say no
20:12 - so basically after you open the door you
20:14 - go the next stage we don't want them to
20:16 - allow the open door again
20:17 - okay maybe a certain stage we can set
20:20 - this variable again so the user can open
20:22 - the door
20:23 - right now let's go back to the
20:28 - door here
20:31 - i know that we're going back and forth
20:33 - just pay attention because it's kind of
20:35 - a little bit difficult if you don't pay
20:37 - attention so it's kind of back and forth
20:39 - with the code here
20:43 - so here we want to say
20:48 - if i receive a next stage
20:52 - i want to hide it because when you move
20:55 - from one stage to the next stage you
20:57 - want to hide the
20:58 - door also we're going to duplicate this
21:01 - here we'll select backdrop seven so i'm
21:04 - on backdrop seven i'm using door again
21:07 - so i'll show so i have the door and then
21:09 - close and then
21:10 - back layer sam is here and then backdrop
21:14 - a i also have a door
21:16 - so for my costume
21:20 - so same thing here okay
21:23 - and then we'll add one more
21:26 - when the star i mean it might be needed
21:29 - might not be needed
21:30 - um on this one no i'll show you this
21:34 - so just take this in um just in case
21:38 - because sometime when you switch from
21:40 - one one of them to another so
21:42 - you might show the door so they want to
21:43 - show the door at these stalls
21:45 - when they actually kick the um the the
21:48 - other grey uh sprite out
21:52 - of the airship you know when it's
21:53 - spinning around that's the store
21:55 - background we want to hide the door as
21:57 - well okay so this is
21:59 - the door code looks like so far
22:03 - so you miss anything please kind of get
22:06 - that down
22:09 - okay so we have the um here right
22:12 - we have the um next stage where we're
22:15 - gonna call this up here
22:16 - we'll worry about this one later so the
22:18 - door you guys got it right the door is
22:20 - over here
22:21 - regarding open door and closed door and
22:24 - uh we'll work on this one the next stage
22:26 - so next day you're gonna go back to the
22:29 - backdrop here when we say
22:34 - receive next stage so what we want to do
22:38 - is
22:40 - so we're gonna have an if statement here
22:46 - so in the first four stage we actually
22:49 - don't have any dialogue
22:50 - so what i'm just going to do is gonna
22:52 - check the backdrop
22:54 - you know if it's got greater than four
22:56 - will put the
22:57 - dialog in progress so that you cannot
22:59 - attack
23:00 - okay all right so what we're going to do
23:03 - go back to the backdrop here
23:08 - and we are going to use operator greater
23:10 - than
23:12 - so if the backdrop number is greater
23:15 - than four
23:17 - meaning you know you have five six seven
23:20 - that's greater than four so this is one
23:22 - two three four so after this stage the
23:24 - computer
23:25 - um you know you get the
23:28 - next stage so it's greater than four
23:30 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna
23:31 - default to set
23:34 - the variable
23:37 - dialog in progress to yes just in case
23:40 - so that we don't want the
23:42 - user who controlling the cyan to create
23:45 - um do any ability so we want to stop
23:49 - that
23:50 - then what we want to do also we want to
23:52 - say
23:53 - next backdrop so what happens is in the
23:56 - beginning
23:57 - we'll run the first backdrop then after
24:00 - you complete this
24:01 - you go into stage or run the second
24:03 - black drop so let's just test out the
24:06 - club
24:06 - [Music]
24:08 - so we did this mission is complete
24:12 - we push the up key so you can go in and
24:15 - then close the door
24:17 - and what happened is change to the next
24:18 - spectra but we have to
24:20 - make sure we clear the sprite here and
24:23 - then change a different color and all
24:25 - that right
24:26 - so let's go on and work on that
24:29 - okay so we have to go back to the red
24:32 - among us here
24:33 - [Music]
24:35 - so what we're going to do here is
24:38 - um the event that we have right next
24:40 - stage
24:42 - so take that say next stage
24:46 - here what we want to do is one clear the
24:48 - graphics effect
24:52 - and then we want to switch to the next
24:58 - costume
25:01 - okay so what we're going to do is
25:04 - we'll call the next costume
25:09 - and then we're going to set the custom
25:12 - variable
25:14 - for this among a sprite so that we can
25:17 - switch
25:18 - you know between the dead and not that
25:20 - if they actually get smashed by the
25:21 - whole can later
25:23 - so what we're going to do is take this
25:25 - go back to here
25:27 - get the custom name okay so let's select
25:30 - the name
25:32 - okay and then we say hi for now
25:39 - okay so this is for the next stage and
25:42 - then we're gonna call for backdrop
25:44 - number
25:45 - two
25:45 - [Music]
25:49 - so you can put them in a different
25:50 - position for me i just
25:52 - added like negative fifty so basically
25:55 - you know move one station next you can
25:56 - put
25:57 - the spring this side this side however
25:59 - you want
26:01 - in this one i have 90.
26:05 - okay clear graphic effect and show and
26:08 - let's just try it out
26:11 - okay so you can see the uh
26:14 - among us we're trying to go into the
26:16 - door you see it doesn't allow you
26:18 - okay so we'll destroy this guy first
26:23 - then we will go into the door so as you
26:26 - can see
26:27 - after we go to the door you see there's
26:29 - a different
26:30 - sprite this is the next costume
26:33 - of the red one so we start with the red
26:35 - now we have the pink
26:38 - and then also our variable
26:42 - right let's see current among us is pink
26:45 - so you can see this is pink so
26:47 - we smash them with the hand you can
26:49 - switch it to pink dead or something
26:51 - so that's why we need to keep track of
26:53 - what colors the among us
26:56 - spray is okay so as you can see we have
27:00 - coated the club
27:01 - where we destroy the among us costume i
27:04 - mean the sprite
27:05 - and then it goes to the next stage and
27:07 - you can see that the
27:09 - backdrop it came to the next stage right
27:13 - so this is what it is so far so let me
27:15 - just go over
27:16 - um show you guys the code again so if
27:19 - you miss anything just kind of
27:22 - pause it and then kind of copy down the
27:24 - code
27:28 - so let's just take a look at this
27:34 - okay so this is the code for the cyan
27:37 - sprite
27:40 - and this is the code for the
27:44 - among us red sprite we start with red
27:49 - and this is the code for the door
27:51 - [Music]
27:54 - this is the code for the backdrop so far
27:57 - you know we're gonna have more code here
28:02 - and then we have a code here for
28:06 - this one where we're switching the
28:07 - backdrop is showing this this box here
28:10 - the ability
28:12 - and we have some code here for the
28:13 - starting the animation
28:16 - episode one okay so this is what we have
28:19 - so far
28:20 - so for this you can actually go from the
28:22 - first stage to the second stage
28:25 - so if you guys like you can try to do
28:28 - some yourself
28:29 - by going moving from the second stage to
28:31 - third stage
28:33 - if not we'll continue working on this
28:35 - you can follow us along
28:37 - so uh right now we're gonna stop here
