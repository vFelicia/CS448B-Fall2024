00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:10 - kids go to playground today we have
00:12 - another guest another member to the
00:14 - YouTube channel so he will be
00:17 - introducing you guys to this game
00:19 - you'll also be teaching you guys how to
00:21 - make this game called chain reaction so
00:27 - today we're going to be making this
00:29 - chain reaction game where there will be
00:32 - balls going around the screen and you
00:34 - have a dot which will try and collide
00:36 - with the other dots so today we'll be
00:41 - learning how to use a broadcast message
00:44 - run without screen refresh custom block
00:48 - and using the random operator and
00:52 - touching a if touching a color so now
00:58 - when we demo the game so as you can see
01:11 - there are dots going around and you
01:14 - place one and it shows their score at
01:19 - the end and the all-time high score so
01:22 - as you can see there are dot and it
01:26 - shows your score because you have two
01:29 - dots collide ok so now let's make a new
01:38 - project and name it chain reaction
01:51 - and delete scratch cat and choose paints
01:57 - a new stripe and select this and let's
02:04 - make it a grey color light gray so here
02:08 - and make it and set the pen size to 36
02:17 - and make a dot in the middle so this
02:21 - should give you a dot size of about
02:23 - eighteen by eighteen and let's Center
02:27 - this okay and let's name this starting
02:35 - dog now when flight when the green flag
02:44 - is clicked let's broadcast to start the
02:47 - game so start game and now when Reece
02:58 - when we receive start game let's make a
03:03 - new variable and call it dots left dot
03:11 - this will be counting the dots when the
03:14 - dots on the screen the your gray dots on
03:19 - the screen reaches zero then you'll lose
03:22 - and it will show your score
03:24 - so first let's set dots left to zero
03:28 - let's make another variable called
03:30 - player dot down and let's set player dot
03:40 - down to no since you haven't placed your
03:43 - dot down no and then we want it our dots
03:50 - to show clear it's graphic effects and
03:58 - set size to 50%
04:03 - and now let's repeat until player dot
04:07 - down is equal to yes equal to yes so we
04:23 - want it to go to the mouse pointer so go
04:28 - to mouse pointer so now if we try it
04:36 - when we start player dot down should be
04:38 - no boss left is zero and it's going to
04:41 - your mouse pointer okay so now if the
04:48 - mouse is down
04:50 - so if Mouse down then we're going to set
05:01 - player dot down to yes
05:09 - so that'll terminate this loop it's not
05:12 - going to the mouse pointer anymore and
05:15 - let's broadcast start counting so this
05:20 - will start counting your score and
05:22 - saying if there's no more dots on the
05:25 - screen so it will also see if you lose
05:27 - or not start counting and let's change
05:36 - dots left point one so now if we see if
05:42 - this works it's moving around the screen
05:45 - player dot down is no if you click the
05:51 - loop isn't working you're not going to
05:54 - the mouse pointer anymore player dot
05:56 - down is yes now we want it to get larger
06:03 - so grab a repeat block repeat forty
06:10 - change size so change size
06:17 - by 90/90 divided by size divided by ten
06:39 - and then we're going to wait one second
06:44 - and then we're going to repeat ten
06:52 - change size by ninety divided by size by
06:57 - negative fifty change dots left so
07:05 - change dots left by negative one and
07:10 - then we're going to hide so now if we
07:17 - try it it's following your mouse when
07:20 - you click it gets larger it waits and it
07:24 - gets smaller perfect now that this code
07:29 - works let's start making the other dots
07:31 - that go around the screen so let's make
07:33 - another sprite and name it other dots
07:38 - other dots and let's make them a lot of
07:46 - different colors so so now I've made a
07:50 - lot of other dots and they are different
07:55 - colors and the last one should be the
07:58 - same color as yours this dot so to
08:03 - duplicate it drag this into the other
08:06 - sprite so now we also want them to be
08:12 - about the same size so you see this one
08:15 - all of them are eighteen by eighteen and
08:18 - this one is also 18 by 18 so now let's
08:23 - go into the code and when I receive
08:27 - start game
08:35 - so now let's create a new block called
08:39 - create clone and make sure to check run
08:49 - without screen refresh or else this will
08:52 - not work so first we want it to go to a
08:58 - random position and point in a random
09:03 - direction so point in Direction pick
09:10 - random negative 360 to 360 and now we're
09:18 - going to repeat until touching the edge
09:22 - repeat until touching edge move one step
09:35 - one and turn 180 degrees 180 and then
09:46 - move five steps now we're going to
09:52 - create a clone so create clone of myself
09:58 - and then switch the costume so switch
10:05 - costume to pick random one to seven pick
10:18 - random one to seven and now when I start
10:26 - as clone we want to show and then when I
10:33 - receive start game we want it to clone
10:38 - so forever
10:39 - let's wait 0.16
10:44 - and then we'll clone so now if we try it
10:52 - there should be dots appearing around
10:55 - the screen as you can see if you click
10:59 - this dot expands and then it goes down
11:03 - again good so now we want it to travel
11:10 - across the screen so when I start as
11:12 - clone repeat until touching edge move
11:24 - five steps and then lastly we want to
11:32 - delete this clone so now you see that
11:38 - the dots are moving around maybe a
11:42 - little bit slower three steps there oh
11:48 - yeah and also set the size to 50% and
11:58 - now that there's the same size as the
12:02 - mouse dot and now if you click it should
12:07 - work that's it for this video make sure
