00:27 - be using our virtualbox here uh to show
00:29 - you guys how we're gonna do it
00:32 - so we searched up downloading python and
00:34 - then we just have to click on
00:36 - one of these websites and you can just
00:38 - download it from there
00:39 - so now um sorry if we can't show you
00:41 - guys everything it's because the virtual
00:43 - box can't really cooperate with our
00:46 - camtasia recorder like every time you
00:48 - record the mouse doesn't go into the
00:50 - virtual box but anyways just click on
00:52 - the first link when you search up

01:16 - so all you have to do is just search on
01:18 - pycharm or google and then we're gonna
01:20 - install the one with jetbrains.com
01:22 - and pycharm the first one just click on
