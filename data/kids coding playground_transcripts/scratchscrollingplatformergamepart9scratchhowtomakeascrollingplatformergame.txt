00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys
00:08 - to the final part for the scrolling
00:11 - platformer
00:12 - so today instead of wasting time on um
00:16 - scrolling around and showing you guys
00:17 - the code
00:18 - if you feel like you missed anything you
00:21 - may check out my scratch account
00:22 - and uh you can look at the code i will
00:25 - share that i already
00:26 - i will share this project when i'm done
00:28 - i i already have a shared project for
00:30 - the scrolling platformer
00:31 - so you can just check that out so before
00:34 - uh we get onto anything new we have to
00:37 - fix some bugs
00:38 - so i noticed that um before you click
00:42 - the play button
00:44 - um the timer is already running so as
00:46 - you can see
00:47 - i play it i'll just wait like five
00:50 - seconds
00:51 - i click play it's already running
00:54 - see as you can see the timer is already
00:56 - at like eight seconds even though i just
00:58 - clicked the play button
00:59 - so to fix that um in the beginning at
01:02 - start game we want to set the timer to
01:04 - zero
01:05 - and then reset the timer set timer
01:09 - to zero and
01:12 - reset timer
01:15 - so where's reset oh there it is okay
01:18 - and instead of just um doing
01:21 - a bunch of random variable setting right
01:24 - here we'll
01:25 - hide all the variables inside the you
01:27 - win sprite
01:29 - let's uh hide the variable timer here
01:33 - i wanted to hide the variable timer in
01:35 - beginning
01:37 - and as you can see when you play it now
01:40 - you want to wait for five seconds
01:45 - timer just started running as you can
01:47 - see so now we fix that bug
01:49 - we can move on to something new so
01:53 - we were thinking of making bounce pads
01:56 - so we have a bounce pad where if you
01:58 - like touch it you'll jump really high
02:01 - so let me just drag the bounce pad from
02:04 - my uh
02:05 - backpack so i already have like all this
02:08 - code in it so
02:09 - um remember you have to use the m the m
02:12 - thing to find out where you want to put
02:13 - the um
02:15 - trampoline so you can just play a level
02:18 - uh find where you want to put stream
02:20 - clean maybe like right here
02:24 - [Music]
02:28 - so um we this this is all the same code
02:32 - from like the saw
02:34 - so as you can see i have all the same
02:37 - code from the saw except just the
02:38 - different positions
02:39 - we'll just need to add some extra code
02:41 - to this so for the tick
02:43 - let's get an if then statement if
02:47 - it's touching the player
02:51 - then we can broadcast a message
02:54 - player where's the player broadcast a
02:57 - message
02:59 - called bounce
03:02 - bounce
03:05 - make a cap bounce
03:09 - and then for bounce when i receive
03:11 - bounce
03:12 - on the trampoline
03:15 - then we can repeat 16 times i'm doing
03:17 - repeat 16 times
03:19 - um since i have eight costumes i just
03:22 - want to do a
03:23 - 16 so it repeats the whole loop twice
03:26 - of the trampoline costumes so um
03:30 - it may be different for you so when i
03:33 - receive bounce repeat 16 times
03:35 - next costume wait 0.1 seconds
03:42 - and right under that we want to add a
03:44 - switch costume back to the costume one
03:46 - because sometimes um instead it's
03:50 - when you're on the bounce pad it might
03:51 - it might end in another costume
03:54 - so we wanted to always switch back to
03:56 - the first costume by default
03:59 - so now we have the bounce pad i'm gonna
04:01 - play the game oh actually no we can't
04:02 - play the game yet
04:03 - we still have to add uh some bounce pad
04:06 - code for the
04:07 - player which is fairly simple when i
04:10 - receive
04:11 - bounce then you want to set
04:14 - the sy to 30
04:18 - sy to 30 so it's higher than the regular
04:21 - jump height
04:22 - the regular jump height is only 16 is 30
04:25 - and then we want to change player y
04:29 - by the sy which is 30
04:33 - by the sy so now i will play it
04:41 - i already have i already have the bounce
04:42 - press position but if you want to do it
04:45 - then
04:45 - press m remember
04:57 - [Music]
05:01 - so now we can work on the rock head so
05:04 - i have the rock head right here so same
05:07 - with the saw all this code is similar to
05:09 - the saw
05:11 - except for this part um in this part
05:14 - so we have all that same stuff and i
05:17 - just
05:17 - did the m thing use the m and
05:20 - place where i want the clones i only put
05:23 - the rock head on level three and level
05:25 - five but you can put it anywhere
05:27 - you want so what the rock head is
05:29 - supposed to do is it's supposed to
05:31 - um crush supposed to like move down
05:34 - and crush the player that if it gets too
05:36 - close to it
05:38 - so first you want to go to the player so
05:41 - let's go to the um
05:42 - play game when i receive play game we
05:45 - need to make a new variable
05:48 - you can name it oh yeah all caps
05:51 - activate
05:54 - rock trap activate rock trap
05:58 - set it for all sprites remember all the
06:01 - capital laboratories
06:02 - are for all sprites only and then we'll
06:05 - need to add another
06:06 - one also all caps because it's for all
06:09 - uh all sprites called deck deaths
06:12 - so this is supposed to count how many
06:14 - deaths you've taken
06:16 - in the game so in the beginning and top
06:19 - we want to set the rock strap
06:21 - activate rock truck to no so what it's
06:24 - supposed to do is
06:25 - um when it's when it's getting near the
06:28 - rock drop the rock trap will come down
06:30 - else it will not come down so only
06:33 - activates when you're
06:34 - near it and then down here
06:37 - in here so in the else area you want to
06:40 - add
06:41 - set rock trap to no if it's
06:44 - a win then player win else you want to
06:47 - set the rock trap
06:48 - activate rock shot to n
06:52 - and then we can change the deaths by one
06:54 - when you die
06:55 - as you can see deaths by one
06:59 - and then down here in the tick custom
07:02 - block
07:02 - the tick script i'm going to add an if
07:05 - then statement
07:06 - if the rock trap is equal to n
07:10 - activate rock trap is equal to n
07:14 - activate raw trap
07:19 - then we wanna if
07:23 - the level so what i did right here is
07:27 - if it gets near it then it will activate
07:31 - elsa will not so if the level is equal
07:34 - to three i only put them on two levels
07:36 - remember so if the level is equal to
07:38 - three
07:40 - and the player x position is
07:44 - greater than the 590.
07:47 - so i used the m thing to find out where
07:49 - the rock trap was
07:50 - then i moved it back a little bit so
07:53 - to tell when it activates
07:57 - so just use the m thing to um
08:00 - find where you want to put the rock head
08:01 - just move it to the left
08:03 - a little bit so i just so the rock trap
08:07 - initially was 660
08:10 - at the x position so instead i put at
08:13 - 590 it will activate the rock trap
08:16 - and if this is true then we will
08:20 - set the activate rock trap to y which
08:23 - means yes
08:26 - and i'm just gonna duplicate this for
08:29 - level five
08:33 - instead of 590 i did 170 so i
08:36 - again i did the mouse thing press the n
08:40 - button and um i got that
08:46 - um so i just position it like that and
08:49 - then
08:49 - set activate rock shot to y if the x is
08:52 - greater than 170.
08:55 - so now let's uh
08:58 - finally we have to add one last part of
09:01 - code for the player win
09:03 - we need to uh set the rock trap
09:06 - activate rock trap to end right here
09:10 - if the player won
09:14 - and now let's play it
09:20 - i can set the level
09:21 - [Music]
09:29 - so um instead of setting a level up here
09:33 - i want to set it in the background
09:38 - so i'm going to set it in the background
09:40 - real quick so instead i'm going to take
09:42 - this out
09:44 - [Music]
09:48 - and
09:50 - so set it up here set
09:54 - level so i'm gonna set it to three for
09:57 - now so i can show you the rock trap
09:59 - just play it again get these fruits
10:04 - oh yeah and never mind we already did
10:08 - the clone because i forgot
10:09 - that um um
10:12 - i already had the code so as you can see
10:15 - when you get near it
10:20 - oh yeah and i forgot one last bit of
10:22 - code
10:24 - [Music]
10:26 - so for the rockhead i forgot to make it
10:28 - uh come down
10:30 - so when i start as a clone so you want
10:32 - to get it when i start as a clone
10:35 - when i start as a clone forever
10:39 - you want a next costume so for this
10:42 - rockhead i actually had costumes for it
10:44 - if you couldn't tell oops sorry
10:47 - it like i guess blinks looks like it's
10:50 - blinking
10:52 - like that um so next costume we want to
10:55 - wait one second
10:58 - and if the activate rock trap is equal
11:01 - to yes
11:02 - or y if activate
11:05 - rock zoom in rock trap is
11:08 - equal to y
11:12 - activate rock strap
11:16 - then we want to change the y
11:19 - change the y by negative 90.
11:24 - so go down by 90 and then we can wait
11:27 - like a pick random two to
11:28 - five seconds for it to come down or go
11:31 - up again
11:34 - wait two to five seconds you can do and
11:36 - pick random but i did two to five
11:38 - so it's a bit easier so it's not too
11:40 - hard
11:42 - then we can change the y
11:46 - by 90 again so it'll go back up
11:49 - so now if we try it it should work
11:55 - so i started at level three
11:58 - see so before you get to the rock trap
12:01 - as you can see it's not activating
12:03 - only activates when you get near it so
12:05 - let's get here
12:08 - as you can see when you get near it it
12:10 - starts activating but when you're not
12:12 - near it then it will not activate
12:16 - and one last thing i want to set that
12:18 - fruit right there
12:19 - to the better place because it's hard to
12:22 - get the fruit
12:23 - because it's up here and the rock trap
12:25 - is coming down
12:26 - in the rock trap one last thing it only
12:29 - activates
12:30 - once when you get near it and then after
12:32 - that it'll start activating
12:35 - so we did that only activates once per
12:37 - level
12:38 - so for the fruit and the um and one of
12:42 - the
12:42 - uh and one of the places we want to
12:45 - change it as you can see
12:47 - when i play it um
12:51 - this fruit
12:54 - is hard to get as you can see right here
12:58 - so i'm just gonna move it down here
13:00 - press n
13:02 - let's see what is that six i'll just
13:04 - round it 675
13:06 - and the y position is 10. so let's go to
13:08 - the fruits
13:11 - the fourth one i think
13:14 - 675
13:18 - and then we can set it to 10.
13:22 - so now let's play it see if it's easier
13:24 - to get the fruit
13:29 - and yes it is much easier to get it now
13:31 - when you get near it
13:32 - [Music]
13:35 - but now you can get it easier
13:38 - [Music]
13:40 - so i actually added some more levels in
13:42 - my
13:43 - new one and my new new game
13:49 - so let's work on the finally let's go to
13:51 - the thumbnail
13:54 - let's add some code for that when i
13:56 - receive start game
13:57 - we'll show our variables here receive
14:00 - start game
14:04 - start game then we want to show our
14:07 - variables
14:07 - show variable level
14:12 - show level level show variable timer and
14:14 - show variable sets
14:17 - timer and show variable depths
14:22 - okay okay and then
14:26 - for here we also since we have an extra
14:28 - variable we also want to hide the
14:30 - variable
14:30 - deaths up here and next
14:33 - we want to go back to the u.n and hide
14:36 - the variable deaths
14:38 - as well right here i hide the variable
14:40 - death
14:41 - so deaths right here so yeah that's
14:45 - pretty much the game
14:48 - set it to one i'm going to play the
14:49 - whole thing one time
14:52 - just to show you guys i'm going to
14:55 - select the green skin
14:59 - [Music]
15:01 - oh yeah and we have to set the deaths in
15:03 - the beginning to zero
15:04 - when flat flight do you want to set the
15:06 - deaths
15:08 - to zero
15:12 - let's make it bigger so now i'll show
15:15 - you the whole game
15:17 - oops so
15:21 - so i'm only actually going to play a
15:23 - little bit of it because we're low on
15:24 - time
15:25 - i'm just going to play and show you the
15:27 - trampoline and rockhead
15:29 - area so the trampoline
15:32 - [Music]
15:34 - [Applause]
15:35 - pretty cool
15:49 - [Music]
15:53 - three with the frog head
16:03 - so we have another chair playing right
16:05 - here as you can see
16:07 - the rocket comes down waits took random
16:12 - and yeah
16:13 - [Music]
16:15 - so that's it
16:17 - [Music]
16:19 - oh yeah and it's not dying yet because
16:21 - we have not added the code
16:22 - so the death part is the same as the saw
16:25 - so i can actually just copy it that part
16:27 - this part
16:29 - duplicate that to the rock head put that
16:33 - down here thing as a saw
16:37 - so i will set the level to level three
16:39 - to show you guys it can die now
16:43 - level three play
16:46 - so i'm gonna go to the rocket
16:53 - [Music]
17:03 - seeing that when you touch the rocket
17:04 - you'll die
17:07 - so that's it for today's video the last
17:10 - episode for the
17:11 - scrolling platformer i hope you guys
17:13 - like learning how to make this
17:15 - game and don't forget to like
17:18 - share and subscribe and i'll see you
17:21 - guys in the next video
