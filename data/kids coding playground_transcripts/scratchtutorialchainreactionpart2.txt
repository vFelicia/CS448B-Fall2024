00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello everyone and welcome back to kids
00:10 - coding playgrounds
00:12 - today we'll be continuing our chain
00:14 - reaction game
00:16 - so so far here is what we have we have
00:19 - the cloning
00:20 - and the spawning of the
00:23 - dots and we have them moving across the
00:26 - screen
00:27 - and uh we have the
00:30 - starting dot so that it gets larger when
00:33 - you click
00:35 - so right now we have
00:39 - this
00:42 - okay so first we're
00:45 - going to go to other dots
00:49 - and so let's go into the other dot
00:54 - and when i receive start game
01:04 - forever
01:08 - if the game stop
01:13 - so let's make a new variable called game
01:18 - stop
01:24 - and if gamestop is equal to yes
01:32 - yes
01:35 - then we'll stop all other scripts
01:41 - so other descriptions
01:45 - in the sprite
01:48 - so now let's get a when i start as clone
01:52 - and repeat until it's touching the edge
02:00 - let's um if
02:06 - dots left
02:10 - is less than one
02:16 - then we'll delete this clone
02:23 - and if player dot down
02:27 - is equal to yes
02:37 - and then and
02:45 - and then let's get when i receive start
02:48 - counting
02:51 - forever
02:56 - if dots left
03:00 - so just duplicate this
03:03 - and then inside set gamestop to yes
03:13 - now in the repeat until touching edge
03:18 - if it's touching
03:23 - the color of the starting dot
03:27 - so let's press the green flag and then
03:30 - select the eyedropper and now you should
03:34 - select
03:34 - the color if
03:37 - the touching color this
03:40 - and the player dot down is yes
03:46 - so player.down is yes
03:52 - so if
03:58 - then let's upload a new sound
04:02 - and search crunch
04:10 - and let's start the sound crunch
04:17 - and switch the costume
04:21 - to the last one which
04:24 - should be the gray one
04:29 - now let's change dots left by one
04:36 - and let's make a new variable called
04:40 - score
04:42 - and also change score by one
04:49 - score now
04:53 - let's go into the starting dot and
04:57 - drag this part in
05:00 - here so now we should have copied it
05:03 - into here
05:04 - and drag it below
05:08 - into the if condition
05:11 - now right here let's set the score to
05:14 - zero
05:16 - and let's set gamestop
05:20 - to no
05:25 - and also set the size to 50 percent
05:34 - and let's hide
05:39 - so as you can see dots going around
05:43 - right here and if you click
05:48 - yours should get larger
05:51 - and then everything disappears
05:54 - when there are no more no more dots
05:59 - so let's try it again and if the dots
06:02 - touch your dot
06:18 - your score goes up
06:24 - okay it's good so now at the end
06:28 - it should display your score so let's
06:31 - change this to a large readout
06:35 - and drag it down here and let's
06:39 - hide the other ones
06:42 - so
06:46 - now let's make a new spray and let's
06:48 - call it score
06:52 - score and then
06:56 - let's just have it name
07:00 - them one and then
07:05 - it should be one
07:09 - and then let's center this
07:18 - now let's duplicate this and then change
07:22 - this to two
07:24 - and do this all the way to nine
07:27 - and then change this to zero
07:31 - so right now i'm making a new costume
07:35 - and naming it zero
07:38 - and typing zero
07:43 - good so now let's go into the code
07:46 - and let's make a new variable for this
07:49 - sprite only
07:51 - and name it clone
07:56 - so when the green flag is clicked
08:02 - let's set clone to zero
08:06 - and let's repeat 10
08:10 - change clone by one
08:14 - and then creating a clone
08:21 - so then after that we hide
08:27 - and then when i start as clone
08:32 - forever
08:38 - if else if the game stop
08:42 - equals no
08:46 - gamestop equals no
08:50 - then let's set the size
08:54 - to 100 and then
08:58 - let's go to x
09:04 - clone number
09:08 - clone times
09:14 - let's see 20.
09:24 - minus 150
09:35 - and then y is negative 160.
09:43 - and now if the length of
09:46 - score if
09:52 - if else
09:55 - the length of score
10:04 - is less than
10:09 - clone number clone
10:14 - then let's hide
10:19 - so hide
10:25 - else then let's show
10:29 - and then let's switch costume to
10:33 - letter
10:39 - clone of score
10:44 - so let's hide all the variables
10:50 - and as you can see it works
10:54 - oh change this to plus
10:58 - 150
11:12 - so as you can see the score right there
11:16 - and maybe we could sit set it a little
11:18 - bit larger
11:19 - 200 percent yes and now if you place the
11:23 - dot down
11:27 - the sound plays and your score goes up
11:33 - and now you have that so
11:38 - when you lose so i'll just set
11:44 - the dots left to zero
11:48 - so you've lost now and
11:52 - let's set the size now
11:57 - to 400 percent
12:07 - let's go to x
12:10 - clone times 55
12:14 - and let's go minus
12:22 - 55
12:27 - y 0 and
12:31 - it should show your score right here so
12:34 - if they're
12:35 - too far apart then you can just lower
12:38 - this
12:39 - 40
12:42 - 40. okay
12:47 - now let's duplicate this and then let's
12:50 - name it high score
12:55 - and now let's make a cloud variable
12:58 - and name it high score
13:07 - so let's drag high score
13:10 - in the to replace score
13:14 - and drag this into the if
13:18 - and let's replace this with hide
13:23 - and let's also go to 20
13:28 - minus
13:32 - 55.
13:43 - and y negative 155
13:48 - and let's make another backdrop
13:52 - and we'll have it saying that the high
13:55 - score
13:56 - is that high
14:00 - score
14:05 - so now that we start we should
14:10 - when i receive start game
14:14 - forever if else
14:21 - gamestop
14:25 - is yes
14:28 - then we'll switch the backdrop
14:31 - to the second one
14:34 - then else then we'll switch the backdrop
14:37 - to the
14:38 - first one so okay change this to
14:42 - yes so now
14:45 - it should work and if we lose
14:52 - the score and i high score should show
14:55 - and now
14:56 - when i when the game stop
14:59 - is no so
15:04 - when
15:07 - forever if
15:13 - the game stop
15:22 - um equals
15:25 - yes
15:30 - and
15:34 - the score is more than the high score
15:48 - then let's set the high score
15:52 - to the score
15:55 - okay so let's hide high score
15:59 - and should work now
16:02 - so if you place it in the corner
16:07 - and the high score is zero and now if we
16:11 - get a higher score than zero the high
16:14 - score should be set
16:16 - to that score so
16:19 - now it works
16:24 - okay i'm just going to stop it
16:28 - and see the score is now 55
16:31 - and the high score is now 55
16:35 - so make sure to love

16:42 - channel
16:43 - and hit the bell thanks for watching
16:46 - and yeah
