00:00 - thank you
00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys to part two of the
00:09 - farm clicker and we will be finishing up
00:12 - our coding for this project
00:16 - so now we're actually going to code the
00:19 - dogs and it's about the same with the
00:22 - hens it's almost the same but we have to
00:25 - change some stuff so we're going to drag
00:27 - this to the dogs
00:30 - some of that
00:32 - all of that
00:34 - and we're actually going to go to the
00:36 - dogs pick up all this code
00:38 - and let's start with this one so instead
00:41 - when the green flag is clicked and
00:43 - instead of going to the same position as
00:45 - a hand you have to go to y15 so there's
00:48 - a difference and then instead of going
00:50 - making hens owned you can make a
00:52 - variable called Dog Zone
00:57 - so dog's own to zero of course you start
00:59 - with no dogs
01:00 - and then when the Sprite is clicked
01:03 - uh instead of
01:07 - or 50 it is actually going to be so
01:11 - instead of 50 it's actually going to be
01:12 - 350 because dogs are 350 and we're going
01:16 - to put 350 for that one and then the
01:18 - maximum cap for dogs is going to be 100
01:20 - you can vary that of course and then
01:23 - it'll change money by minus 350 and then
01:27 - it will change instead of head Zone Dog
01:29 - Zone y1 and then instead of broadcasting
01:32 - uh bot and it'll be bought dog
01:36 - and then we have same with this one
01:39 - and then instead of receiving bot hen
01:41 - you'll actually bought dog and then
01:43 - forever it'll change money by so
01:46 - actually I put some uh differences in
01:49 - Dot
01:50 - we're gonna actually have a
01:53 - multiplication sign
01:55 - over here and we're gonna go dogs owned
02:00 - change money by dog's owned times
02:03 - pick random one two five so it'll give
02:07 - you one to five every one second so we
02:11 - have some differences there
02:13 - and instead of hand zoned of course I
02:17 - forgot to change this it's actually
02:18 - going to be dogs um
02:20 - sorry if I did not notice that
02:23 - and yeah I think we're good
02:25 - so I'm going to show you how the dogs
02:27 - work so and so I'm gonna change my money
02:30 - by 350 so it has the money in the
02:33 - beginning
02:35 - and now we're actually going to buy a
02:37 - dog and you see it's working it's giving
02:39 - me a random amount of money every
02:41 - second from one to five so now we have
02:45 - that finished we're gonna move on to the
02:48 - horse which is relatively similar to the
02:50 - dogs so we just have to move everything
02:52 - to the horse
02:54 - and basically give it its own stuff
02:56 - again
02:57 - so let's work on this horse
03:04 - so we're gonna have all of that so in
03:06 - the grid file I click uh have that
03:08 - instead of
03:10 - dog zoned of course it's gonna be horses
03:12 - oh
03:15 - and change this to horses owned geez
03:18 - horses owned to zero
03:20 - oh yeah I can't forget you have to right
03:21 - click on the I mean double click
03:23 - I'm messing that up and then move it
03:25 - over here
03:28 - and we're actually gonna change this to
03:30 - set horses to own and then when this
03:32 - Sprite clicked if money equals 550
03:36 - because horses are 550 or money is
03:38 - greater than 550.
03:40 - and instead of dogs owned it's going to
03:43 - be a horse's own
03:45 - and it's the max cap for this one 75
03:47 - then it'll start selling glug and then
03:50 - it'll change money by minus 550.
03:54 - then it'll change
03:55 - um of course horses owned by one
04:00 - and then instead of but the bot dog it's
04:02 - somebody bought horse
04:06 - and now we have that finished it'll go
04:09 - to here and then we're gonna go bot
04:11 - horse forever
04:12 - instead we're going to use something
04:14 - else and now we're actually going to put
04:16 - a multiplication sign
04:18 - uh change
04:20 - money by horses owned
04:25 - times
04:27 - 35.
04:29 - so yeah and now I think we have finished
04:32 - the horse
04:34 - and now we're actually going to move on
04:36 - to the llama
04:38 - and we're gonna drag all of that to the
04:41 - llama
04:43 - and
04:45 - we're gonna go to the lava and code it
04:47 - from there
04:52 - so we're gonna go to the llama
04:55 - then let's increase the size a bit so
04:58 - instead of uh using horses owned of
05:01 - course if you use llama so
05:03 - and then we're going to change Ultrazone
05:05 - to llama Zone to zero and then when this
05:07 - Sprite clicked if the money is equal to
05:09 - 1 200 where the money is less than 1 200
05:13 - I mean greater than two one thousand two
05:15 - hundred and then uh the maximum cap for
05:18 - this one's actually going to be
05:20 - um
05:21 - of 50 and we're going to change this to
05:23 - llama's own is less than 50 and let's
05:26 - start selling plug and then change money
05:28 - by minus one thousand two hundred and
05:32 - change
05:33 - uh llamas owned by one
05:37 - so broadcasting bought horse it's gonna
05:39 - be bought llama
05:41 - and instead it'll be broadcast and it's
05:45 - the same for the rest of them and then
05:46 - we move on to here and then you can
05:48 - adjust accordingly on the money of
05:50 - course and then instead we're actually
05:52 - going to change this to llamas owned
05:55 - so instead of giving you 35 It's Gonna
05:57 - Give You sixty dollars of course you can
05:59 - adjust this and it's gonna be every two
06:01 - seconds
06:03 - I noticed that llamas actually don't
06:05 - have value so we're actually going to
06:06 - change this to 80 not 60. of course you
06:09 - can change that accordingly and we're
06:10 - gonna change this to bot llama up here
06:12 - so I think this is the Llama code right
06:16 - here so feel free to pause
06:20 - and now we're going to work on the world
06:21 - record actually we're going to save the
06:23 - world record for the second part well
06:25 - this is going to be the second part so
06:27 - we will do the world record last so
06:31 - we're actually going to move on to the
06:32 - hoe
06:35 - so we're actually gonna see the costumes
06:38 - and this is the hoe before you buy it
06:40 - and you can see how much uh multiplier
06:44 - it gives you and the cost and this is
06:46 - the equipped version and it'll say
06:49 - multiplier and have the green ones so
06:51 - you've equipped it and then for this one
06:53 - you have this is when you're not
06:55 - equipped it but you bought it so let's
06:58 - work on the hook
07:00 - we're gonna start with the green flag
07:03 - when the green flag is clicked
07:06 - it will set
07:08 - hobot
07:11 - well of course we have to make a new
07:13 - variable which is a lot of these
07:15 - variables robot
07:17 - two zero to n actually because we have
07:21 - not bought the hoe and then it'll go to
07:24 - the front layer
07:26 - for you there you go and then switch
07:29 - costume
07:31 - to Ho which is the original one because
07:34 - you haven't bought it yet and yeah
07:37 - and then it'll go to
07:40 - X so we already have this position down
07:43 - here a little reserved spot and then
07:46 - we're gonna actually have when this
07:48 - Sprite clicked it's gonna be you need a
07:52 - if then else I think we're actually
07:55 - going to take the code from before I
07:57 - think that's really similar
07:59 - I'm just going to compare them
08:02 - so yeah let's just move this over here
08:06 - oh that's a little big so when this
08:09 - Sprite clicked if money it oh yeah first
08:13 - let's check if you even bought it so
08:16 - we're actually gonna
08:19 - take this and if hope bought
08:24 - equals
08:26 - hobot
08:29 - equals
08:31 - n
08:32 - then
08:34 - it will so if you haven't bought the
08:36 - whole yet then it will
08:39 - I think it's not lesson so it will
08:43 - you need if then else right here if then
08:46 - else you need a or
08:49 - so you need the money that equals 250
08:56 - .
08:58 - so we're actually going to change if the
09:00 - money equals 250
09:03 - or we're going to duplicate this
09:06 - wait actually we don't
09:07 - you actually need this one so or the
09:10 - money
09:12 - is a greater
09:14 - than 250.
09:19 - and then that means we'll have this and
09:22 - then it will set hobot to Y because now
09:24 - you bought the hoe
09:27 - and now it will
09:29 - start sound glug
09:33 - well we can just pop it really doesn't
09:35 - matter the signal to signify you bought
09:37 - the thing
09:38 - and now it will change money
09:42 - so change
09:44 - money
09:46 - by minus 250.
09:48 - oops 250. because that's how much it
09:51 - will deduct and then now we'll set CPS
09:53 - to two so for every click you'll click
09:56 - on the little chicken they'll give you
09:57 - two
09:58 - and then I'll switch costume
10:01 - to hoe EQ
10:03 - because it's the equipped green one
10:05 - and then it'll broadcast
10:08 - equipped hoe
10:15 - equiptoe and then else it will broadcast
10:18 - you do not have enough money to buy this
10:22 - and then under this else it will set CPS
10:26 - to two
10:28 - and then switch costume
10:32 - to hoichyu
10:34 - and also
10:36 - broadcast
10:40 - equipped up that's correct
10:43 - so we're actually going to come back to
10:45 - this one later and we're actually going
10:47 - to drag this to the rest of them because
10:48 - these buttons are real similar to each
10:50 - other
10:55 - let's work on the wheelbarrow now
10:58 - so the wheelbarrow
11:01 - uh when the green flag is clicked so we
11:03 - actually have some more code for each of
11:05 - the buttons afterwards so we'll be going
11:07 - back to those later
11:09 - and we'll make a new wheelbarrow I mean
11:11 - new variable called wheelbarrow
11:14 - bot to confirm if you bought it or not
11:17 - and then it'll set wheelbarrow bot to
11:20 - end because you have not bought it yet
11:23 - and it'll go to the front layer and do
11:25 - all that good stuff
11:27 - and then when this Sprite is clicked if
11:30 - wheelbarrow bought
11:32 - equals n
11:33 - and then if money equals 600 because you
11:37 - need 600 to buy the wheelbarrow
11:39 - or money is greater than 600 then it
11:42 - will set wheelbarrow bought to y
11:45 - now you have button the wheelbarrow and
11:48 - it'll start sound pop and then change
11:49 - money by minus 607 minus 250 and then
11:52 - set CPS to 10 so you get 10 per click
11:54 - now so that's a pretty good deal and
11:56 - then switch costume to wheelbarrow EQ
12:00 - and now it will also broadcast a new
12:03 - variable oopsies brought this new
12:05 - variable called equipped wheelbarrow
12:08 - [Music]
12:12 - pretty hard for word to spell and then
12:15 - you don't have enough money to buy this
12:17 - over here and then set CPS to 10 and
12:21 - then switch costume to a hoe and instead
12:24 - of hoe wheelbarrow EQ and then broadcast
12:28 - equipped wheelbarrow over here
12:32 - now we're going to do the tractor so the
12:34 - code is quite similar I think you
12:37 - already know what's going to happen
12:39 - so
12:42 - let's go to the Tractor
12:45 - and then if though when the green flags
12:47 - clicked it'll be tractor bot instead so
12:51 - make a new variable tractor I always
12:54 - make mess up on the spelling tractor bot
12:57 - and then no I should be tractor bot to
12:59 - end
13:00 - and instead of negative
13:03 - we're actually going to change the X to
13:05 - 13 and the Y to negative 150. I actually
13:09 - don't even think I changed this one yet
13:11 - I'm sorry
13:13 - but go back to the wheelbarrow and then
13:15 - instead of negative 190 because that's
13:16 - supposed to be the
13:18 - um negative 89.
13:21 - so we have negative I mean positive 13
13:23 - and negative 150 right here and then
13:26 - when this Sprite clicked
13:29 - instead of wheelbarrow bot I think you
13:31 - know what's going to happen it's gonna
13:32 - be tractor bot
13:35 - into equals N Money equals two thousand
13:38 - five hundred
13:40 - 500
13:42 - and then 2 500.
13:45 - as well as set tractor bot to y
13:51 - tractor EQ in a broadcast equipped
13:56 - tractor
13:59 - and then you don't have enough money to
14:01 - buy this and then it will set CPS to 100
14:04 - now
14:06 - tractor EQ and then
14:09 - equip tractor I think that's the code
14:11 - for that oh and sorry this is not 2500
14:16 - negative 2500 because you're taking away
14:18 - money
14:19 - and yes we also have to change the CPS
14:21 - to 100 sorry if I did not notice that
14:24 - and now we will move on back to the hull
14:27 - and we're actually gonna go
14:32 - when I receive
14:34 - equipped wheelbarrow because you cannot
14:36 - equip two tools at once you need if then
14:39 - else
14:40 - if then else if then else a hoe so you
14:45 - need this one
14:46 - a equals
14:50 - and
14:52 - and need a whole bot
14:55 - equals n
14:57 - then it will
15:00 - switch costume to hoe
15:04 - else it'll switch costume to Hope oh
15:07 - basically
15:10 - um changing it back if you don't have
15:12 - the hoe and if you have the wheelbarrow
15:17 - and same with the tractor
15:21 - equipped tractor
15:23 - and then
15:25 - uh if Hobart equals n
15:28 - that's which I'll assume to home and
15:32 - then I'll switch costume to her own
15:34 - cool now we're going to move this to the
15:36 - wheelbarrow and the tractor so
15:39 - move this to the wheelbarrow
15:41 - and move this one to the wheelbarrow too
15:45 - and I think you know what's gonna happen
15:48 - so when I receive
15:51 - instead of equipped wheelbarrow this
15:53 - one's going to be the opposite so
15:54 - equipped hoe this one's going to be
15:56 - equipped tractor so this one's gonna
15:58 - stay like that instead of hobot is going
16:00 - to be wheelbarrow bot same with this one
16:05 - um we'll have to switch cost into
16:07 - wheelbarrow and this winter wheelbarrow
16:09 - owned
16:10 - and this one's a tractor and same with
16:13 - this one
16:16 - and now we're gonna do it for the
16:17 - tractor not last but not least
16:22 - right here
16:24 - and then I think you know what's about
16:26 - to happen
16:27 - so equipped oh this one's gonna stay and
16:29 - it said zombie tractor bot equals n
16:31 - switch costume two tractor and this
16:34 - one's gonna be tractor owned
16:36 - and then this is going to be equipped
16:38 - wheelbarrow
16:40 - and then if it is tractor bot
16:45 - then it's going to be n and switch
16:49 - costume do tractor and then switch
16:51 - costume to tractor own so these are
16:54 - basically all the combinations that you
16:56 - can get
16:57 - our last thing to do is the world record
17:00 - and the music so we're actually gonna
17:04 - right click on this move it to the
17:08 - llamas owned
17:09 - I mean not right click I always messes
17:11 - up double click on this one I think this
17:14 - is horse's own right so this is going to
17:16 - be horse's own double click and then put
17:19 - it right over here
17:21 - and then for this one we're actually
17:23 - going to hide a hobot
17:27 - um wheelbarrow bot and tractor bot
17:33 - I just started the game and I'm sorry I
17:34 - forgot to change the position for the
17:37 - horse and llama that is very stupid of
17:39 - me so we're actually gonna change the
17:42 - horse position to negative 50.
17:46 - offer Y and then for the llamas it's
17:50 - actually going to be
17:52 - negative 110 and we should have
17:55 - everything positioned greatly
17:58 - and yeah we have everything like that
18:01 - cool now let's work on the world record
18:09 - so this one's quite confusing
18:11 - so we're gonna put a little quick demo
18:13 - for what we have right now so
18:15 - you see when the green flags click when
18:17 - you get all of that we're gonna give
18:18 - ourselves a little bit money so I can
18:20 - show you the tools so now we're gonna
18:22 - give ourselves some money so we're gonna
18:24 - go here let's just give ourselves like
18:26 - ten thousand dollars so
18:29 - a thousand dollars
18:31 - so we started this game let's give
18:33 - ourselves ten thousand dollars and now
18:35 - we're gonna buy the tools you see it
18:37 - says we have her equipped and let's buy
18:40 - the wheelbarrow in the home
18:41 - it'll give me two this one and we'll
18:43 - give you 10 and then this one will give
18:45 - you 100. so it does seem to be working
18:48 - that's cool so now we're gonna move into
18:50 - world record it's really similar to the
18:53 - money so let's do that
18:56 - we're actually going to go to the money
18:58 - and
18:59 - drag all these to the world record
19:03 - there are going to be some differences
19:04 - so
19:06 - be aware of that
19:09 - and now we have that all of this over
19:11 - here
19:13 - let's work on the world record
19:16 - so when the green flag is clicked it'll
19:18 - set hide there's no money included so
19:21 - you delete that little chunk over there
19:22 - and then when I receive start game
19:27 - when I see start game it'll actually
19:29 - instead wait one second
19:32 - and then hide
19:35 - before you go to
19:37 - x190 y150 so this is going to be a
19:40 - little bit higher than the
19:43 - or other one and then it will set number
19:45 - to zero
19:48 - and then instead of money number clone
19:50 - it's going to be wrn
19:53 - clone
19:56 - and we're going to change this to wrn
19:59 - clone zero and then forever it'll wait
20:02 - until this is going to be wrn clone is
20:05 - less than length of so we need to make a
20:07 - variable a cloud one so click on this
20:10 - one
20:11 - and we're gonna name it world
20:14 - record
20:17 - so now we're gonna put it like that
20:21 - and now we have our world record
20:23 - variable
20:25 - and over here we're instead of length of
20:27 - money it's going to be length of world
20:31 - record
20:33 - you know change number by one and change
20:37 - world record clone
20:40 - instead of by one instead of the other
20:42 - one and then it'll create color myself
20:45 - and change X by negative 20. then when
20:48 - we move on to here when I start as a
20:50 - clone it'll show and forever if number
20:54 - is greater than length of world record
20:56 - with the cloud variable it'll hide else
20:59 - it'll switch costs a show
21:02 - and also first switch costume to letter
21:07 - length of world record instead
21:11 - minus number minus
21:14 - one
21:17 - uh of world record
21:21 - and you have to add one piece of
21:23 - additional code over here so when the
21:26 - green flag is clicked
21:28 - forever
21:31 - you need a if then statement
21:34 - if then
21:37 - the money is
21:40 - greater than
21:43 - world record so if you beat the world
21:45 - record
21:46 - then it will set
21:49 - world record to money
21:54 - and now that's basically what we have
21:56 - here all right so I'm gonna do some
21:58 - little testing over here so we're
22:00 - actually going to change
22:03 - the
22:05 - world record by
22:08 - uh let's just actually let's just go set
22:11 - world record
22:12 - to 25 so that's going to be the world
22:16 - record
22:20 - so let's set it to 25.
22:22 - 25 right here so now the world record is
22:25 - 25 let's see if it works or not so let's
22:28 - just click until 25. it will not take
22:30 - that long and then if I get 26 that's
22:32 - the new world record
22:34 - that's basically how the world record
22:35 - function works
22:39 - so I forgot actually to change this part
22:41 - so go back to the tools and then
22:44 - um you might have already noticed this
22:45 - but I'm sorry but I did not change this
22:47 - to the correspondent tool and we're
22:50 - actually going to change this one to a
22:51 - tractor and this one to wheelbarrow so
22:54 - for information so I think should work
22:56 - now and yeah we have our tools up and
22:59 - going like that
23:00 - so cool
23:02 - and we're actually going to hide our wrn
23:05 - clone in our world record because it
23:08 - already already says over here so now
23:11 - we basically have it done except for the
23:13 - music so we're gonna go to over here and
23:16 - then when the green flag is clicked
23:20 - uh we'll go switch costume to farm
23:24 - switch back up to farm my bed and then
23:26 - forever
23:28 - it will play this song because it's
23:30 - really good until done and
23:34 - of course you can use any song you want
23:36 - and if you haven't noticed we have
23:38 - actually added this extra WR
23:41 - AP uh text next to the farm uh to
23:44 - indicate the world record up here so
23:47 - that's basically how we have it here
23:49 - so I think I'm finished here and let's
23:52 - try the game
23:54 - and let's see if I can hear the music
23:58 - so you see we do have music
24:01 - I'm gonna turn it up a little bit and
24:03 - then um we have our chicken if you click
24:04 - it it gives us score you can see the
24:07 - little visual effects plus the glow
24:09 - effect that we did earlier as well as
24:11 - the chicken turning and
24:14 - um we can see the chicks raining down
24:18 - uh I think the tens are gonna actually
24:20 - work here
24:22 - I'm gonna buy a hand
24:23 - and it looks like it works it'll
24:26 - probably work for all the other ones too
24:28 - so I'm gonna do some grinding off camera
24:30 - so I did some grinding off camera and I
24:33 - got our
24:34 - uh the stuff and it seems to be working
24:37 - fine and it looks like we're about done
24:40 - here and
24:42 - um I'll have this I'll have the Sprite
24:45 - one shared so you guys can download it
24:47 - from that one as well so you guys can
24:50 - make your own remix that downloaded one
24:52 - that one with the Sprites and you guys
24:55 - can use that for your own game
24:58 - and
24:59 - if you haven't seen on the demo I also
25:01 - have these Mega troops on this side but
25:03 - I'm not doing it a part of this tutorial
25:05 - because it's just the same thing with
25:07 - this one but I just changed the
