00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids on
00:08 - playground here and today we're back
00:09 - from another video in scratch and today
00:11 - we'll be making a 2022 new year's game
00:13 - so
00:14 - let's see how this goes so
00:17 - click on the firecracker you make it
00:19 - move so here it's moving and you have to
00:23 - touch the match to light it
00:26 - and then you throw the firecracker
00:28 - anywhere you want
00:30 - by clicking
00:32 - and if you do it five times something
00:34 - special will come up so
00:36 - let's do that five times
00:49 - see as you can see it says happy
00:52 - new
00:53 - year
00:55 - 2022 so
00:57 - here we have and that's the special
01:00 - thing that comes up so today we'll be
01:02 - coding
01:04 - this on scratch so let's go
01:07 - okay before i begin please like share
01:09 - subscribe because
01:11 - it turns out most of our viewers are not
01:14 - subscribed so please subscribe and do us
01:16 - a favor so let's the first thing we
01:18 - should do is rename our project to happy
01:21 - new year
01:24 - 2022
01:26 - and of course we never need the cat and
01:28 - our backdrop
01:31 - will always be our night city
01:37 - and our i have everything in the
01:39 - backpack so just come to my project and
01:42 - export the sprites
01:44 - if you
01:45 - uh just come in and export the sprites
01:48 - that you might want to we actually drew
01:50 - these all by ourselves so
01:52 - you see we have our match
01:55 - for our firecracker
01:57 - we have our happy
02:02 - and then we have our new
02:04 - and then we have our year
02:07 - and then we have our 2022 so um
02:10 - to make this you just have to uh get the
02:13 - h just get like the h and then choose a
02:16 - costume go to the letters and then get
02:18 - an a
02:19 - and ctrl c
02:21 - and then ctrl v and then add it to the
02:23 - place you want and after that delete the
02:25 - costume so just do that for to make
02:28 - happy
02:30 - new
02:31 - year and 2022 it might take a while but
02:34 - you can always come to my project on
02:36 - gumball098 and export the pro sprites
02:39 - from there so yeah we have that
02:42 - and um yeah so
02:46 - so i'm going to draw the sparkle sprite
02:48 - so best for our firecrackers so let's
02:50 - just draw that right now just a very
02:52 - small
02:56 - green dot so let's just zoom in a little
02:58 - bit
03:02 - yeah hold down shift and we have our
03:04 - sparkle
03:09 - i think we need that to be a little
03:11 - bigger
03:16 - that should be decent size i'm pretty
03:19 - sure okay yeah i think that should be
03:20 - fine and now let's work on the code so
03:23 - match has no code actually so we have a
03:26 - little head start over there and now we
03:28 - go straight to the firecracker
03:30 - so let's do the firecracker so let's go
03:34 - so when the green flag is clicked
03:41 - we will
03:44 - so i'm going to show you how i drew the
03:46 - match so
03:47 - let's look at let's take a quick look if
03:50 - you do want to draw your own match so
03:51 - let's see so
03:54 - so the fire is this orange thing and the
03:57 - outline is a darker orange and you just
04:00 - use the reshape tool to reshape the
04:02 - edges to make some sort of fire shape
04:05 - and that's the same applies for the
04:08 - uh
04:09 - the inside fire like the inner part the
04:12 - second layer and we have our
04:15 - match thing it's burnt so it's the black
04:18 - thing and
04:19 - this we can ungroup this real quick
04:22 - so and we have one
04:24 - uh brown
04:26 - piece of wood and one lighter brown
04:29 - piece of wood so that's for our match
04:32 - right so if you do want to draw that on
04:33 - your own here is a quick little small
04:36 - kind of tutorial to show you
04:39 - so and i'm also going to rename my
04:40 - sparkle sprite
04:45 - yeah i'm gonna move that over here
04:47 - so let's go back to the firecracker and
04:49 - let's
04:50 - show you how to draw both sprites so for
04:53 - the regular one all we have to do is
04:57 - uh
05:00 - take this
05:01 - orange sort of rectangle and reshape the
05:03 - outside and the edges out and we have
05:06 - this
05:07 - uh yellowish type of circle that we put
05:09 - over there
05:11 - and
05:12 - we have
05:13 - the
05:14 - part on the top with the little lighter
05:16 - part
05:19 - okay and
05:21 - that's for our first sprite and our
05:23 - second sprite is this one and let's it's
05:26 - just the same one duplicate this one if
05:29 - you do want to draw this and
05:30 - uh just kind of use lines to
05:35 - shape the edges like a line line line
05:37 - line line line and just shape the edges
05:40 - and then fill it in and that's how you
05:41 - make your
05:43 - sprite so we are done here off you might
05:46 - know how to make the sparkles but if you
05:48 - don't just come to my project and export
05:50 - it so let's go back to firecracker
05:54 - so when the green flag is clicked we
05:56 - make a new variable called counter
06:01 - placement
06:02 - counter
06:04 - the second thing we're gonna put since
06:06 - we just made our variable counter is set
06:09 - counter to zero because you have to make
06:12 - it five or more so we have that over
06:15 - there and now we'll set the size to a
06:17 - hundred
06:19 - and um
06:20 - it will go to
06:23 - the position marked
06:25 - and
06:26 - a point in direction 90.
06:30 - so yeah okay we also have to switch the
06:31 - custom plus we want all right and now
06:33 - i'll point direction 90 and delete this
06:36 - clone
06:39 - so now
06:40 - yeah and when i start as a no when this
06:43 - sprite is clicked it'll make a clone of
06:44 - itself because you click on the sprite
06:46 - and it'll make a clone so let's create a
06:48 - clone of myself
06:51 - and now when i start as a clone
06:56 - it will repeat until touching match
06:58 - because it will keep on following your
07:00 - mouse so repeat untouched until touching
07:03 - the match
07:06 - and it will go to mouse pointer because
07:08 - it'll follow your mouse pointer until it
07:10 - touches the match
07:15 - and it'll wait until now it's down so
07:16 - that's when you uh fire so no no that's
07:20 - when you click on the firecracker my bad
07:22 - and it will wait until now it's down
07:25 - let me put that under
07:31 - and now we will repeat ten times
07:36 - uh change size by minus five that just
07:39 - gives effect to make it smaller and
07:40 - smaller and smaller so change size by
07:43 - minus five
07:45 - and
07:46 - then we have if then statement
07:51 - if then statement and then you put an or
07:54 - so it's five or more so
07:57 - we put five
07:59 - the counter is greater to or equal to
08:02 - so
08:03 - the counter
08:05 - has to be e greater than five
08:09 - or equal
08:15 - uh and it'll broadcast happy new year so
08:17 - we still have some code to do here but
08:19 - it's very short so let's just finish
08:21 - this up real quick broadcast
08:24 - happy new
08:27 - year
08:30 - and now let's finish up the code so when
08:33 - i start as a clone
08:34 - it will go to the front layer so it's in
08:37 - front of the happy new year the match
08:39 - all that good stuff
08:41 - and it will show
08:45 - and set size to 100
08:51 - and now it will point in direction 45 so
08:54 - it's a little bit tilted to give some
08:57 - kind of effect so 45
09:00 - and now it will repeat until
09:04 - it's touching the match
09:09 - you know follow your mouse pointer so
09:13 - so go to mouse player
09:18 - let's just move that a little bit
09:20 - and go to mouse pointer and then switch
09:22 - costume to costume 2. so switch costume
09:25 - to costume 2.
09:30 - and now it will start sound poising so
09:32 - let's get oh it's already here
09:35 - oh that's probably because i put in the
09:36 - backpack but that's fine so it should be
09:38 - inside the sound thing so start sound
09:40 - toysing
09:44 - and it will wait until now it's down
09:55 - and now it will set
09:56 - a new variable
09:58 - x
09:59 - because it has to follow your mouse so
10:01 - set x
10:04 - set
10:06 - and y yeah but yeah so y
10:09 - and so set x
10:12 - to mouse x so that's just one of these
10:16 - and
10:16 - then duplicate that set y
10:20 - to mouse y so it will follow your mouse
10:23 - and now it will glide
10:26 - 0.5 seconds to where you have clicked to
10:28 - shoot
10:30 - oh
10:30 - yeah not this one sorry uh glide
10:33 - 0.5 seconds
10:35 - to mouse pointer
10:38 - and now it would change counter by one
10:44 - because you shot one firework so it
10:45 - would change the counter and when it
10:46 - gets to five it'll
10:48 - do the amazing happy new year thing so
10:51 - so change counter by one and then hide
10:55 - and then it
10:58 - will broadcast
11:06 - so yeah let's see if it works
11:08 - so let's see if it works
11:11 - it works but we just don't have the
11:12 - sparkle effect yet so let's zoom out so
11:14 - then you can see out the code feel free
11:16 - to pause here
11:23 - so feel free to pause and suck in all
11:25 - this code so just in case if you did uh
11:28 - if you missed some
11:29 - so now let's go to the sparkles and work
11:32 - on the sparkles
11:33 - so when the green flag is clicked it
11:35 - will
11:36 - erase all so by the way if you do not
11:38 - know there's this button called ad
11:40 - extension
11:42 - there's music pen video sensing all of
11:44 - these and we just click pen and we
11:46 - already have it here because it was from
11:48 - a backpack so it will erase all
11:51 - because in the beginning you always have
11:52 - to erase all the graphic effects that
11:54 - you
11:55 - made earlier and then it will hide
11:59 - and it'll wait one second
12:03 - and it will go to the front layer
12:06 - and after that i'll repeat 200 times to
12:09 - give effect
12:12 - and it will create a clone of myself so
12:14 - just make a bunch of effects
12:16 - uh some little
12:18 - sparkles some that's just very cool for
12:20 - some effect
12:21 - and now when i receive bang
12:25 - it will start the sound gong
12:28 - which we don't have yet so let's just
12:29 - get that
12:33 - yep this is a gong
12:35 - and it'll start on gong
12:37 - and you'll repeat 100 times
12:40 - for
12:41 - effect
12:43 - and it'll change color effect by two so
12:45 - just
12:46 - some
12:48 - effect added to
12:50 - the sparkles so
12:53 - and then when i receive bang
12:58 - it will set color so this is also for
13:01 - effects so there's a lot of effects that
13:03 - we could use to make this improve so set
13:06 - color effect to
13:08 - pick random
13:11 - negative 100 to positive 100 so there's
13:13 - a
13:14 - bunch of colors that
13:16 - the scratch
13:17 - the
13:18 - the thing
13:20 - makes
13:21 - there's a lot of colors to pick from so
13:23 - now let's when i receive bang
13:26 - it will
13:29 - it will set speed
13:32 - we have to make a new variable speed
13:34 - as always
13:36 - so it'll set speed
13:39 - to
13:41 - pick random 0.1
13:47 - to three to give more effect
13:50 - and it'll set ghost effect to zero so
13:52 - this is just a bunch of
13:55 - effects we could use and set ghost
13:56 - effect to zero
13:58 - and it will change color effect by 25.
14:03 - and now it will set the pen color so
14:05 - this is just a bunch of
14:07 - set the pen color
14:11 - to a pick random of 50 to 500 so there's
14:14 - a bunch of colors that
14:16 - we could pick from here
14:19 - 50 to 500
14:23 - and now pen up
14:28 - and it will go to
14:31 - x
14:33 - and then you put an x inside the x and
14:36 - you'll go to y
14:37 - y that's where you i'll put your mouse
14:39 - and you explode the thing so that's
14:41 - exactly where the sparkles are going to
14:43 - be
14:44 - so now um we'll put pen down
14:48 - to draw it yes
14:51 - pin down
14:53 - and now we will point in direction
14:58 - uh point in direction
15:01 - pick in a point in direction
15:04 - negative 180 pick random so pick random
15:07 - negative 180
15:10 - to positive 180 so there's
15:13 - different directions
15:14 - and
15:16 - it'll explode in different directions
15:18 - with this
15:19 - piece of code
15:20 - so and now
15:22 - it will show
15:26 - and it will reset the timer
15:34 - and now it will
15:36 - repeat 30 times
15:43 - move speed steps
15:50 - speed steps
15:51 - and
15:53 - so it's a random amount of steps it will
15:55 - move so we just put 0.1 to 3 so it'll
15:58 - move speed steps so it'll be just random
16:01 - and we have our change y
16:07 - by
16:10 - zero
16:13 - minus
16:15 - timer
16:21 - and now it will repeat another 30 so
16:26 - let's get that repeat another 30.
16:31 - set speed
16:36 - to
16:38 - speed
16:39 - time so you have a times reported times
16:41 - here and then put
16:43 - set
16:44 - speed to
16:46 - speed
16:49 - times 0.9
16:55 - so
16:56 - since you throw the firework and it goes
16:59 - fast fast and then slow it's because you
17:02 - have to the times just by 0.9 because
17:05 - anything times a decimal will make it
17:08 - smaller so that'll be a smaller value so
17:11 - it will go slower so go fast and then
17:14 - it'll go slow so that's the point of
17:16 - this piece
17:18 - and then it'll move speed steps we
17:20 - already have that over here
17:24 - move speed steps and i'll change ghost
17:27 - effect
17:31 - put that inside there
17:32 - chain ghost effect uh
17:35 - so it just fades away for extra effect
17:37 - so it will just fade away and i'll pick
17:40 - random one two
17:42 - three
17:43 - and it'll hide and it'll erase all
17:46 - it'll just repeat after that so
17:49 - hide and erase all
17:52 - so that's our code so let's make sure we
17:56 - got all this code and i know that's a
17:57 - really big script so i'm just going to
18:00 - try to make sure so feel free to pause
18:03 - and see if you got everything done
18:07 - so yeah
18:08 - so uh
18:09 - and we just tested out the game it was
18:12 - all wrong so we had to do something and
18:14 - we just found out that the speed is only
18:16 - for this sprite only so
18:19 - it's only for the sparkles so i'm going
18:22 - to rename this
18:25 - speed 2 so we know which one's speed and
18:27 - which one's the real speed so
18:30 - let's make a new variable called speed
18:32 - and for this sprite only not for all
18:35 - sprites this is a private variable so
18:37 - for this right only
18:39 - and then
18:40 - so the reason for this is that if you
18:43 - throw a firecracker and
18:45 - all the sparkles will move differently
18:47 - so let's replace all the speeds with
18:50 - speed twos with speed so speed
18:54 - uh do we have any more
18:57 - speed to instead put speed in
19:03 - so let's replace this
19:06 - with speed
19:07 - and set this to speed
19:10 - and then one more and there we go so now
19:15 - i think the
19:18 - the sparkles will move correctly so
19:20 - we got all the speeds and now i'm going
19:22 - to delete speed 2
19:26 - so now it's gone and
19:29 - let's do this so
19:30 - okay so let's try this
19:34 - so you have the thing you throw
19:38 - so
19:39 - uh we just i just found out that my dot
19:42 - is just a little bit too big for the
19:44 - other one so that's why it's making it
19:48 - so i'm just gonna shrink this a little
19:49 - bit
19:51 - hopefully i think that's big enough
19:53 - so let's just try one more time
19:57 - okay so
19:59 - yeah let's try it
20:03 - yeah it's still a little bit too big
20:05 - delicious
20:08 - yeah there we go hopefully this is big
20:10 - enough now
20:15 - so now let's move on to the happy
20:18 - new
20:19 - and year 2022
20:21 - so this is really easy code so let's
20:24 - just finish this wrap this up real quick
20:26 - so when the green flag is clicked
20:28 - he'll hide
20:31 - and clear graphic effects
20:34 - and it will point in direction 90
20:40 - and it will go to x
20:42 - so it will be all the way back 400
20:46 - why uh 139
20:49 - doesn't really matter and when i receive
20:55 - happy new year
20:57 - then i will show
21:02 - and it will glide one second
21:06 - to
21:08 - negative 102 y this is already the right
21:10 - coordinates because it'll just glide
21:12 - like whoo
21:13 - and then it will broadcast move new
21:16 - which will move the
21:18 - new sprite
21:19 - then yeah the new sprite so let's just
21:21 - click right move new
21:24 - and then it will go forever
21:27 - and change color effect by 1.
21:32 - just perfect
21:33 - and now we move to new
21:37 - so on new when the green flag is clicked
21:40 - it will clear graphic effects
21:45 - will hide
21:48 - it'll point in direction 90
21:52 - it'll go to
21:53 - x400
21:56 - why
21:58 - yeah 142 that's fine and
22:01 - when i receive
22:03 - move new
22:06 - it will wait one second
22:10 - and it will show
22:14 - and it will glide one second
22:18 - to the position it's already at because
22:21 - that's where we want the new to be and
22:22 - i'll broadcast move here and this will
22:25 - trigger
22:26 - year so broadcast
22:29 - move
22:32 - here
22:35 - and then it will go forever
22:37 - and change color effect by one
22:43 - now let's move to year
22:45 - so we have to go to here now so
22:50 - when the green flag is clicked it will
22:52 - clear graphic effects
22:55 - it will hide
23:00 - and it will
23:02 - go to x 400 so it's all the way in the
23:06 - back
23:07 - why 72 ish it's fine and
23:11 - i'm gonna go to
23:13 - back to here and just try to
23:15 - do that and just change it up real quick
23:17 - so when i receive move year
23:20 - then it will wait one second show glide
23:22 - one second to a different position so
23:25 - let's just drag in the position
23:27 - is gliding to now where's the light
23:30 - there we go and no broadcast instead of
23:32 - move year
23:34 - you'll have to broadcast
23:36 - move 2022
23:40 - and we have to go to 2022 now and i'm
23:43 - just going to drag this across because i
23:45 - think we just need to do some tweaking
23:47 - and that'll be all good so let's go to
23:49 - 2022
23:50 - and clear graphic effects hide and
