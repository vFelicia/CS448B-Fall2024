00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys it's kids coding
00:09 - playground here
00:10 - and today we're back for another video
00:12 - called the save water game
00:14 - today we will be working on the save
00:15 - water game one of our viewer requests
00:18 - to make this kind of game related to
00:20 - social cause
00:21 - the point of this game is that each
00:23 - player will control its own bucket
00:25 - to catch the water from the dripping
00:28 - pipes
00:30 - save water game we'll be learning these
00:31 - following concepts in scratch
00:34 - variables loops broadcast message
00:36 - sensing collision
00:37 - and controlling sprite with arrow keys
00:40 - so i'm just going to go to my
00:42 - so um i just went to my scratch project
00:46 - and this is how it looks like so i use
00:48 - the takeout
00:49 - sprite so let's just click the green
00:52 - flag
00:53 - my brother's here to play with me right
00:55 - here
00:56 - so i'm gonna be the orange one on the
00:59 - right i'll be the blue one
01:01 - so the point of the game is to move side
01:03 - by side
01:04 - and to catch the water you have to hold
01:07 - the
01:08 - you have to press the uh down arrow key
01:10 - or the s key
01:11 - so as you can see it plays some music
01:13 - and as you can see you can't catch the
01:14 - water you don't
01:15 - if you don't crouch so you gotta crouch
01:18 - and then you can collect the water
01:20 - and you can you can only move if you
01:22 - don't crouch
01:23 - so that's basically a game
01:26 - first 100 points yeah and
01:30 - i'm gonna try to get 100 and each
01:33 - each uh uh what's that called the
01:36 - each raindrop is 100 points ten ten
01:39 - points
01:41 - [Music]
01:48 - i'm trying to
01:54 - one more okay so i got 100 it says
01:57 - player two wins as you can see
01:59 - so we're gonna jump right into this
02:02 - project
02:03 - so before i start
02:07 - please like share subscribe and comments
02:10 - in the comment section below to
02:12 - show me what uh else projects you want
02:15 - for
02:16 - us to make so i'm gonna make some
02:19 - variables
02:20 - so as you as you can see and when i
02:22 - demoed it you had to crouch using the
02:24 - down arrow key
02:26 - to for for or the down arrow key or s
02:29 - so you got to make a variable called
02:31 - crouch
02:33 - one you can make it crouch one and then
02:35 - the second one is crouch two because
02:37 - it's for the other one
02:41 - other player crouch
02:46 - and then you also have to make the
02:48 - player score
02:54 - for the first player and player score 2
02:57 - for the second player
03:00 - i'm just gonna hide these two variables
03:02 - right here
03:05 - and we're gonna i already have some
03:09 - sprites in the backpack for me
03:12 - so i'm gonna just change the name of
03:16 - this
03:17 - and instead of using numbers you capital
03:20 - p
03:20 - capital p and the player score
03:24 - yeah this already has s
03:28 - and i'm also going to make that capital
03:30 - s and i'm also going to do it with the
03:32 - other one so you can see it better
03:41 - so there you go and i'm gonna start on
03:43 - the code so i already have the sprites
03:45 - for me the regular takeout
03:48 - and the orange takeout
03:53 - and also the water drop
03:57 - the water drop the pipe
04:00 - so you can obviously draw these on your
04:03 - own
04:04 - and when you win sprite
04:09 - so obviously if you're going to use the
04:11 - regular takeout
04:12 - you got gotta delete um b and c
04:16 - take out you only need d and a take up
04:20 - so yeah for the other one is the same i
04:23 - just changed the color
04:25 - because you can tell if the first player
04:28 - in the second player
04:30 - so i'm going to teach you how to draw
04:31 - the water drop
04:35 - so it's like a egg type of shape
04:38 - that's the wrong button uh paint
04:42 - and so you just need a regular circle
04:44 - that's a cyan color
04:46 - or a blue color you can just reshape it
04:50 - to make it look more like a water drop
04:53 - as you can see that's a little bit too
04:54 - small but
04:56 - that's fine so we can just delete this
04:58 - one
05:00 - and get straight into the code we'll
05:02 - also have to draw the pipe
05:03 - i can also teach you how to draw the
05:05 - pipe it's pretty simple
05:08 - you just have to draw a rectangle a few
05:10 - lines through and then draw another
05:12 - rectangle so it's actually pretty simple
05:14 - so anyways um i'm just going to start on
05:17 - the code
05:18 - so i'm going to delete the cat and then
05:20 - use a player one
05:22 - so you have to if green slide click
05:25 - because that's this green flag right
05:26 - here so
05:27 - everyone knows that um zoom in a little
05:29 - bit
05:32 - uh set crouch to end so uh so when you
05:35 - start the game it will not
05:36 - crouch it's crouch one because i'm
05:40 - working with player one
05:42 - and it'll go to a certain position so
05:45 - let's say right here
05:49 - and it'll switch costume to take out d
05:51 - so this t
05:52 - take out d is this costume where it's
05:54 - running so
05:55 - it'll when it spawns it'll be a take out
05:58 - d
05:59 - just which costume to take out
06:02 - d forever because
06:06 - you need a forever loop for if it's
06:08 - gonna
06:09 - to go up down all these simple things
06:11 - not up down
06:12 - side left right so an if then statement
06:17 - if key arrows
06:21 - key a press because that's the
06:24 - left key the left one for wasd
06:28 - that then set crouch to end because you
06:31 - don't want it to crouch
06:33 - so set crouch one to end while it's
06:36 - moving you cannot corrupt
06:38 - so you'll switch costume to take out d
06:42 - because that's like the regular costume
06:43 - when it's running
06:45 - um point in direction negative 90 of
06:47 - course you have to have this or also
06:49 - flip over so you got to click
06:51 - on this button right here and
06:54 - um you gotta
06:57 - put in direction negative 90 what i just
06:59 - said
07:00 - point in direction negative 90
07:09 - and move 10 steps so it'll move
07:13 - and you can just duplicate this
07:17 - and do d
07:20 - instead
07:25 - it'll switch costume take out d but
07:27 - point in direction 90 instead
07:30 - because it's pointing the right and then
07:35 - a d and the s is for crouch so you gotta
07:38 - duplicate this
07:39 - again but then just change this to
07:42 - crouch moment so it's actually
07:45 - s i see if i get an s right there and
07:49 - it'll set crouch to y so then it will
07:52 - crouch and
07:56 - i'll switch costume to take out a i'm
07:58 - gonna put this
07:59 - right in front of doesn't really matter
08:02 - but yeah you can just do it if you want
08:03 - to you can put it in front of there it
08:04 - doesn't matter
08:05 - and then you don't need this point and
08:07 - direction thing so
08:09 - also need a for winning
08:12 - if then statement
08:16 - you need an or because if it's more than
08:19 - 100 points
08:21 - or equal to 100 points it'll win
08:24 - so it's equals if the
08:27 - player scored equals 100 so player one
08:30 - score says the
08:31 - first one that equals 100 then
08:35 - then you'll win but and and also if you
08:38 - get that one when player score one
08:42 - wins you win two so
08:45 - i'm just gonna stop that play one score
08:48 - equals
08:49 - a hundred they'll broadcast
08:52 - player one wins
08:56 - so it'll tell the um
09:00 - the the winning message to come out
09:06 - and yeah
09:10 - so i'm also gonna work on the second
09:12 - player
09:14 - so i'm gonna work on player two and
09:17 - it's basically the same thing as player
09:19 - one almost the same thing
09:22 - i'm just going to drag this over
09:28 - and i'm sure this one has it yes it's
09:31 - right here
09:32 - just the whole code instead you got to
09:34 - change the go to position
09:36 - and instead you need crouch 2 because
09:38 - that's for the second player
09:40 - so you need a go-to position instead you
09:42 - got to use the other one
09:44 - this one right here wherever it's
09:45 - standing the switch costume to take out
09:47 - d forever if a is the left arrow
09:53 - it's the left arrow and
09:56 - d is the right arrow
10:00 - instead you need crouch two and crouch
10:03 - 2 for this one
10:08 - and s instead you have to use down arrow
10:13 - and then change crouch 2 instead to y
10:16 - so if player 2 score
10:22 - equals 100 or it's over 100
10:26 - and broadcast player 2 wins
10:32 - says a new message
10:38 - and if i receive
10:42 - player one wins then it'll stop
10:45 - other scripts in this sprite
10:51 - and duplicate that
10:57 - and then if player 2 wins and stop other
11:00 - scripts in this fight
11:02 - we also need it for the other player
11:05 - so let's just drag this over
11:12 - and we're gonna work on the water so the
11:14 - water
11:17 - when the green flag is clicked it will
11:20 - hide in the beginning
11:25 - um forever
11:28 - i'll go forever oh wait and i'll pick
11:31 - random seconds actually
11:32 - that's really interesting so that's you
11:34 - can use that if you want to
11:36 - so you can wait one to pick random to
11:39 - two seconds
11:41 - and then you can broadcast a new message
11:44 - called drop
11:48 - and wait because it has has to have a
11:50 - little weight
11:54 - draw and then when i receive
11:58 - drop i'm just going to duplicate three
12:01 - pipes
12:02 - as you saw in my demo i had three pipes
12:06 - so i'm just gonna move
12:09 - the pipes
12:12 - let's just move it right here
12:15 - this one right here how about here yeah
12:19 - and then go back to water
12:23 - let's move this up let's move the player
12:25 - one score here
12:27 - player two score here and when i receive
12:31 - drop it will show
12:34 - because that's when it drops down and it
12:37 - will go
12:38 - to it'll go to
12:41 - a random pipe basically so
12:44 - it won't be random position and you got
12:46 - to join the pipes together
12:47 - so it's actually go to join
12:52 - pipe and pick random
12:56 - one two three so pick random pipe one
12:59 - two three there's three pipes here
13:04 - and you gotta repeat until so keep on
13:07 - going
13:09 - until it's touching the edge of the
13:11 - screen
13:13 - and it will change y by
13:16 - negative 10.
13:29 - and change y by negative ten
13:33 - negative 5 so it's going down
13:37 - and then you need if then loop
13:41 - right here if then
13:45 - and by end if then it's touching player
13:49 - one
13:51 - player one and in crouch equals y
13:56 - so so only it will only collect if it's
13:59 - crouching
14:00 - that's basically what it means if crouch
14:02 - one is
14:03 - equals to y that means it will collect
14:05 - the drop
14:07 - it will change player score
14:12 - player score one by ten
14:16 - and oh hot because you cuz player one
14:20 - collected it and we just duplicate
14:24 - almost the same thing it's almost the
14:25 - same thing just duplicate that
14:28 - and put it right there right under it
14:32 - not inside of it or else that would not
14:34 - work right outside of it
14:36 - but not an outside of the repeat loop
14:39 - so instead it's touching player two
14:43 - and instead it's crouch 2
14:48 - and it will change player score 2
14:51 - by 10 instead you know hide
14:55 - and know hi again
14:58 - after all the loops so
15:02 - we also have to we also got the player
15:05 - so we're also going to do the you win
15:08 - so when the green flag is clicked
15:12 - i'm going to add the backdrop in the
15:14 - medicine music later
15:16 - it'll set um player score
15:22 - i'll set player score to zero so
15:26 - player one score to zero and duplicate
15:30 - and then player score two to zero
15:34 - and then it'll hide in the beginning all
15:36 - the score will be reset
15:38 - and then when i receive player one wins
15:43 - oh switch costume to costume one
15:49 - so that's the first costume i have to
15:51 - cop soon right here so says play one
15:53 - wins
15:54 - player two wins so switch costume to the
15:56 - costume one
15:57 - go show
16:01 - and stop all duplicate the same thing
16:05 - almost the same thing he said it's
16:07 - player 2 wins
16:10 - um and switch costume to costume 2
16:13 - instead
16:14 - and you also need the background music
16:17 - and also
16:19 - the background music so
16:23 - i'm going to work on the background
16:24 - music so when the green flag is clicked
16:27 - it'll go forever and play a sound
16:35 - but i used eggs i'm not
16:39 - sure why they called it eggs but i
16:42 - placed on eggs until done and i'm gonna
16:46 - also get a backdrop
16:48 - i use like a water type of theme
16:52 - type of thing i use water and rocks i
16:55 - think that's what it's called
16:57 - so i'm gonna duplicate the water so
16:59 - there's gonna be two at the same time
17:01 - so water two instead so here we go
17:04 - it's gonna be way quicker i'm gonna
17:05 - download the game right here
17:08 - so as you can see um
17:18 - so we're getting points
17:21 - [Music]
17:22 - so as you can see it says player two
17:24 - wins so
17:26 - that's basically the game so please like
17:28 - share
17:29 - subscribe and comment in the comment
17:30 - section below for what else projects you
