00:03 - [Music]
00:07 - thank you
00:09 - hello guys welcome back to kiss calling
00:12 - playground Channel today we'll be
00:13 - working on our final tutorial of the
00:16 - Bubble Tea in Mexico game we hope you
00:18 - have learned something new from this
00:20 - tutorial series and I'm excited to see
00:22 - the final result if you have enjoyed our
00:25 - video please consider subscribing to our
00:27 - Channel give us a thumbs up and leave a
00:29 - comment below you support means a lot to
00:32 - us and we appreciate it greatly thanks
00:35 - for being part of our coding community
00:38 - all right so without further Ado let's
00:40 - go into our uh last tutorial so here's
00:45 - what we have left off from last time so
00:47 - we have some code for the chat so if you
00:50 - wonder
00:51 - um miss anything please pause and uh
00:54 - just copy the code down all right so
00:56 - I'll quickly go over each of the Sprite
01:00 - so with the cat
01:01 - this is the customer
01:04 - this is the tapioca scoop
01:07 - tapioca pearl
01:09 - cup
01:11 - the teapot
01:13 - teacup
01:15 - so the teacup is a little bit longer so
01:18 - I think at the very end we have to put
01:21 - the straw on so this is where we're
01:23 - gonna start and then we have the tea
01:26 - the syrup bottle
01:28 - the syrup
01:30 - and that's about it so we're gonna be
01:33 - holding on the straw and the icon and
01:35 - the ring and then put the backdrop you
01:37 - guys already know we have the sound for
01:39 - the brain okay all right so let's get on
01:43 - to our Cove
01:45 - okay so we go to the straw so you
01:48 - remember the the tea cup where I put the
01:51 - straw and that's where we left off so
01:53 - we're gonna stop here
01:58 - okay so when green flag is clicked
02:02 - okay here we'll switch to costume number
02:05 - one
02:07 - so custom number one is the straw that's
02:09 - coming down like this uh with the sharp
02:12 - edge I mean sharp pointer yeah sharp tip
02:16 - I guess and then we're gonna say hi
02:20 - and then when we get
02:23 - the message
02:25 - put the straw on this is where we're
02:28 - going to switch the custom one also
02:32 - uh just to reset the thing when we go
02:36 - from one customer to another
02:38 - and we're gonna put it at this location
02:41 - I think I had it earlier zero
02:44 - and negative 25.
02:48 - and then since we have high We'll add
02:51 - show
02:53 - and then we have a little repeat Loop
02:56 - here
02:57 - so we're gonna say repeat until
03:00 - touching the teacup
03:03 - so that's why the straws come down and
03:05 - then pop through the little plastic
03:07 - thing for the straw
03:10 - so let's say change to y
03:15 - minus five so that will come down
03:19 - okay and then we're gonna put the pop
03:22 - sound
03:24 - foreign
03:28 - times
03:31 - and then we use the next costume
03:36 - and then we'll do a little bit of weight
03:41 - okay so and then the final costume of
03:44 - the seven Loop we should be at the
03:48 - costume number a which is the last one
03:50 - so we start at one and then two three
03:52 - four five six seven so
03:55 - after that we're gonna say broadcast a
03:59 - message
04:03 - so new message say give
04:09 - to
04:09 - customer so this will keep the drink to
04:13 - the customer so when we do the give
04:15 - train to the customer what we're going
04:18 - to do is we're going to have to make the
04:19 - straw follow the cup and also make the
04:22 - cup lie to the straw so I'm gonna say
04:25 - when I received
04:28 - gift between the customer I can't have a
04:30 - forever Loop
04:32 - here and then in this whatever Loop
04:35 - we'll use the X and Y position
04:39 - and then whether you use this tricky
04:41 - Block in the sensing here so here you
04:44 - have to select the uh teacup
04:47 - and then you can select the X position
04:50 - then you select the teacup again we'll
04:53 - select the Y position and we're not
04:54 - gonna exactly the same position because
04:57 - we want the little straw to be a bit
04:59 - higher so we can we can use the operator
05:02 - add
05:04 - so we're gonna add 10 to that
05:07 - and this is the position so basically
05:10 - we're gonna call when they when they
05:13 - give cut to the customer will make the
05:15 - straw follow the cup while the cup is
05:18 - gliding to the customer
05:20 - Okay so
05:22 - after that uh we're gonna have to go
05:24 - back to the cup
05:26 - [Music]
05:28 - so tea cup will will actually give when
05:31 - we receive give to customer we're gonna
05:33 - send the cup back to the customer so
05:36 - we're gonna say when we receive
05:39 - give the cup give children to customer
05:42 - we're gonna collide
05:45 - one second I have the uh the 40 and zero
05:49 - so basically you can just move the cup
05:52 - kind of wherever you want like somewhere
05:54 - right here like you see that is 55 right
05:57 - so I put 40 and zero so somewhere like
06:00 - along this line here
06:04 - right so someone here like that so when
06:07 - it goes from here it goes here okay and
06:10 - then we will do
06:12 - um change the customer counter by one so
06:17 - this is what we're going to use like to
06:18 - count how many customer we have left
06:20 - then we also can use it to change the
06:23 - icon
06:24 - and then next we'll say
06:26 - wait one second
06:29 - and then we're gonna broadcast a new
06:31 - message
06:32 - called
06:35 - customer
06:37 - walk away
06:40 - so after the customer get the teeth and
06:43 - walk away we have to hide is strong
06:46 - okay and hide the cup as well so we have
06:49 - to we have this also so this is hiding
06:52 - the cup so I'm going to go back to the
06:54 - straw so the straw we're gonna have to
06:56 - hide the straw as well
06:59 - but before we do that we have to stop
07:03 - this Loop because when the forever Loop
07:05 - here so we're gonna say when I receive
07:10 - um
07:12 - customer walk away
07:15 - plus stop the script
07:18 - so I'm going to say stop add a script
07:20 - and Sprite and then we're gonna hide
07:24 - this job
07:25 - all right so basically after the straw
07:28 - comes to the customer I mean it still
07:30 - comes to the club I'll give it to the
07:32 - customer and then it will go away all
07:35 - right so let's just try it again so
07:38 - we're gonna have to put this put the cup
07:40 - back at the composition okay don't try
07:44 - this out so now we have this
07:46 - so where we have put the straw on right
07:49 - so the cup do this little shake and put
07:52 - the straw on so we can just click on
07:54 - this so to test
07:57 - so you can see the cup at the shape
08:02 - and then we broadcast a message and the
08:06 - straw goes in and the straw under a cup
08:09 - Glide to the customer and at the height
08:11 - so what we have to do is we're going to
08:14 - go to the customer and make the customer
08:15 - actually Glides away when he gets the
08:18 - the drinks so that it can be have like
08:21 - the next customer comes in so what we
08:23 - can do is go to customer
08:27 - [Music]
08:29 - and here we have the when we get the
08:32 - customer walks away right so here we say
08:34 - hey when I receive customer walk away
08:37 - I'm gonna make it kind of Glide toward
08:39 - the end here so we have motion say Glide
08:43 - two seconds
08:45 - to 200
08:48 - 25 so 200 is probably somewhere around
08:51 - this area
08:52 - after that
08:54 - I'm going to high
08:56 - and I'm gonna broadcast a new message so
09:00 - after the customer leaves he's gonna
09:02 - broadcast a new message called start
09:04 - again
09:08 - so start again so start again will
09:11 - actually help to have the new customer
09:14 - come in again so when we when we have
09:16 - start again
09:18 - in this customer
09:19 - we have to add some code so here we can
09:24 - add the
09:26 - when I receive start again
09:31 - so for the start again we'll just kind
09:34 - of wait one second and then we change it
09:37 - to the next costume which is the next
09:39 - customer
09:41 - and then we're gonna have a if condition
09:45 - here
09:47 - I'm gonna check the number of uh
09:50 - costumes so basically I have five
09:52 - customer so one two three four five so
09:56 - if my costume is greater than one
09:59 - [Music]
10:01 - then I'm going to
10:05 - a custom number
10:08 - greater than one
10:09 - so after that I am going to say move
10:14 - customer
10:17 - so uh for the start again we have after
10:21 - the the next costume the the number will
10:24 - be one right so the first one is gonna
10:27 - be one the second one will be two so
10:29 - once it put it in one which is two
10:32 - they're gonna move customer move
10:34 - actually to the
10:35 - to the golden back land and the
10:37 - customers start gliding back in
10:40 - okay
10:42 - all right so we have the customer we had
10:44 - the straw
10:46 - right and what we need to do next is we
10:51 - are going to uh work on the icon so
10:55 - so that when we give it to the customer
10:57 - uh you know the icon
11:00 - um
11:01 - will light up
11:03 - okay
11:06 - but before we go to do that let's finish
11:09 - the cat so the cat where we had the um
11:13 - start again we can also have
11:18 - uh with that change here so when I
11:22 - receive a start again
11:25 - so here what we're going to do is we're
11:28 - going to use the if and else condition
11:31 - here I'm gonna check these are not
11:34 - operator
11:37 - okay and then we have the customer
11:40 - counter so we're going to try to use
11:42 - that so we're gonna say equal
11:45 - and then customer counter equal to five
11:49 - so number five will be the last customer
11:51 - so if it's not equal to five
11:55 - we're gonna say
11:59 - uh next
12:03 - for one second so that will he'll call
12:06 - the customer
12:07 - and we're gonna change the
12:11 - oh yeah oh yeah I knew I missed
12:13 - something I'll come back to this so um
12:15 - we'll change the costume to uh one
12:19 - which is the standing custom and also we
12:22 - want to change the color of the uh you
12:24 - know the next uh next string so let's
12:27 - say change
12:29 - uh color
12:31 - by 50.
12:36 - so if it's the last customer so we're
12:40 - gonna say
12:43 - good job whatever you like to say good
12:46 - job
12:47 - making
12:50 - bubble tea
12:53 - for all the customers okay
12:58 - so we're gonna say hey good job missing
13:00 - bubble tea for all the customer and then
13:02 - you can stop the game here after that
13:04 - I'm gonna say stop all so I think I
13:08 - forgot one thing here uh
13:12 - so one of the thing I forgot was that
13:15 - you know I forgot to change the costume
13:17 - for this the cat so when we get when we
13:20 - give drink to the customer I want him to
13:22 - raise his hand
13:23 - oh
13:24 - I'm gonna add that right now so when I
13:27 - say when I say give dream to a customer
13:31 - I'm gonna say switch the costume to give
13:35 - and I want to say
13:39 - here you go
13:43 - okay and we'll do it for one second
13:45 - whatever okay so this will give to the
13:48 - customer and uh you know and then after
13:51 - that we'll when they start again we'll
13:54 - say next it's gonna change the color of
13:56 - the drinks
13:59 - and then when we go back you can see
14:02 - that in the customer after uh start
14:05 - again it's kind of called move customer
14:07 - so when move customer will run their
14:09 - broadcast start so we'll start over the
14:11 - game so let's just play it for a minute
14:14 - so make sure everything is good before
14:16 - we work on the actual icon
14:18 - okay so we have the first customer comes
14:22 - in
14:22 - I only have the cup
14:25 - we're gonna add the bubble
14:28 - let's add to T
14:30 - foreign
14:35 - [Music]
14:37 - and then it shakes the cup Okay so
14:45 - all right
14:47 - enough that the straw comes in so you
14:50 - can see it says give it to the customer
14:52 - customer walks away he raised his hand
14:54 - it says next and then the next customer
14:57 - comes in so as you can see it seems to
14:59 - be working fine right so
15:03 - yep so this is the next color so since I
15:06 - added the color right so the cat
15:08 - actually changed the color by 50 so
15:10 - after that it gives a different color
15:14 - so let's change the color for that and
15:18 - then pulled the straw and give it to the
15:20 - customer and you can see that it will be
15:22 - the next customer so you can see it
15:25 - gives the cats it raise his hand and
15:28 - then it has next it starts again it's
15:31 - called the next customer and the T will
15:33 - be different color each time so last
15:36 - time was green and we increased by 50 so
15:39 - change color is a different number now
15:41 - is 100 so you can see change color is
15:43 - 100. so you see it's a blue color okay
15:47 - all right so this is pretty much good so
15:50 - the only problem we had right now is
15:53 - just the icon so we'll work on the icon
15:56 - next
16:00 - okay
16:02 - so for the icon we are going to create
16:05 - the icon on the top
16:07 - okay so we'll go so the icon is actually
16:10 - exactly the same as the bubble tea cup
16:12 - so what we're going to do is just going
16:14 - to make it smaller does it
16:16 - and I'm gonna say when green flag is
16:19 - clicked
16:20 - we are going to make it high
16:24 - okay
16:25 - and then we we're gonna set the customer
16:28 - counter
16:31 - so here we'll change the customer
16:33 - counter to zero so this is where we can
16:37 - reset the customer uh you know counter
16:39 - each time
16:40 - and then we're gonna create so also the
16:44 - icon should have a index I think I
16:46 - already created that earlier so the icon
16:48 - make sure you create for the Sprite only
16:51 - so you're making a variable for index
16:53 - make sure you select this and type in
16:56 - Index right that's for the Sprite only
16:58 - okay since I already create I don't need
17:00 - it so
17:01 - icon index okay for the Sprite only
17:05 - I'm gonna set the index to zero
17:09 - and I'm gonna make him go to
17:13 - gonna start at negative two one five and
17:17 - one fifty okay
17:20 - and since I have five customer I'm gonna
17:22 - repeat five times
17:26 - here I'm Gonna Change index each time
17:28 - when we create one icon so I'm gonna say
17:32 - change
17:33 - index by one
17:37 - okay
17:38 - and then census starts at 1 in scratch
17:42 - so the first one what I want to do is
17:45 - again check if
17:47 - we're going to use anything else here
17:52 - and then we are going to use operator
17:55 - called equal
17:57 - I'm going to use the index so if the
17:59 - index is one
18:03 - so let me hide this one now we don't
18:05 - need that so when the index is one I'm
18:07 - gonna set it at this area so my icon
18:10 - will show up like somewhere around here
18:13 - okay so it was index F1 I'm gonna make
18:17 - this
18:18 - set X to
18:21 - negative two one five two fifteen which
18:25 - is what we had started and after that uh
18:28 - we're gonna
18:30 - change X by 40 so every time of the gray
18:33 - one will change X by 40 will create the
18:36 - next block here next one next one next
18:39 - one and now until we have all five icon
18:41 - okay
18:44 - and then we'll call this say
18:47 - create a clone of myself under here okay
18:52 - okay so when you have this cream my
18:54 - clone you have to do this one start as a
18:56 - clone
18:57 - uh what I'm going to do is going to set
18:59 - the ghost effect
19:02 - set the ghost effect to 50 so it's kind
19:06 - of transparent not very clear
19:09 - or not worry like you can see it real
19:11 - well and then once I go to the front
19:14 - layer
19:15 - and then we'll say show
19:18 - and then here what we can do is we can
19:21 - use the uh the code here if condition so
19:25 - where we can use the index so we're
19:27 - gonna put it here so if the index is one
19:32 - we are going to say wait until
19:37 - the operator equal
19:41 - and now we have the customer counter
19:43 - right so every time the customer we gave
19:45 - one to the customer
19:47 - uh we increase the counter that's why
19:49 - the cat thing either somewhere than the
19:53 - customer
19:57 - so it is actually here in the teacup so
20:00 - we keep the between the customer and
20:02 - increase the counter by one right
20:05 - so
20:06 - that's the way it is so when we wait
20:09 - until the customer account is equal to
20:11 - one
20:12 - and then we're gonna set the course
20:13 - effect
20:15 - so set the
20:18 - ghost effect
20:20 - to zero okay so we'll clear so it will
20:24 - see it so same thing we're gonna do this
20:27 - duplicate this
20:30 - like this we're gonna say the index is
20:32 - two we'll wait for the customer to be
20:34 - two we're gonna set the goals effect so
20:37 - the next
20:40 - three
20:41 - so this index is keeping track of the
20:44 - icon each time and this will wait until
20:48 - the uh the custom account it goes to
20:50 - three times we'll light them up so we
20:52 - can show it like clear so this is four
20:56 - and four
20:57 - and then last one
21:01 - five and five okay so we have all the
21:06 - icons so let's test it out real quick so
21:08 - if you see I start the game it created
21:11 - uh five icon you can see five icons
21:14 - started at 2 15 negative 215 and then
21:17 - add 40 each time so one two three four
21:20 - five six by five in the loop
21:23 - okay so let's just finish one so we're
21:25 - not gonna do multiple because it'll take
21:28 - too much time
21:29 - so once this fills up
21:33 - right so right now if you see uh my
21:37 - customer counter is still at zero right
21:39 - so when my customer counter becomes one
21:42 - it will light this guy up
21:45 - so now we're gonna give it to him so you
21:48 - can see it lined up right so these guys
21:51 - are still I mean these little cups are
21:52 - still kind of faded right transparent
21:55 - fifty percent
21:56 - so once the customer counter goes to two
21:59 - this guy will light up because this is
22:01 - the waiting condition here right so this
22:04 - is a index here so this is the second
22:07 - index of this uh bubble tea cup icon
22:10 - here so he's waiting the customer
22:12 - counter to be too
22:14 - right now customer counter is still one
22:17 - so once we give this we'll increase the
22:20 - counter in the teacup here you see this
22:23 - customer counter becomes two so this one
22:27 - lights up okay so I hope you guys
22:29 - understand that so I think we're almost
22:32 - done so the last part is just the rain
22:35 - effect for the game and I think you guys
22:37 - also did that last time
22:42 - I think on the I think you may have seen
22:45 - the project earlier I think uh we made
22:48 - one one simple
22:50 - um tutorial for the rain effect so the
22:53 - ring effect I'm gonna switch the costume
22:56 - to the First costume
22:59 - okay so I have like one two three four
23:02 - five six seven so what I'm going to do
23:04 - is just look through it six times so
23:07 - yeah
23:09 - uh what we have is I will start for the
23:11 - First costume
23:13 - and we're gonna say set the Y at zero
23:18 - and then we have to Forever
23:22 - and then we say set X
23:27 - and we can pick a random
23:32 - negative
23:34 - 240
23:36 - to positive 240.
23:38 - and then we have a repeat Loop
23:43 - six times
23:45 - and then we have next costume
23:48 - and then at the very end we're gonna
23:50 - switch it back to the First costume
23:54 - okay all right so let's try it out here
23:57 - so you can see the Raindrop kind of like
24:00 - just hitting on the table you can see it
24:02 - kind of if you look at closely so here
24:05 - what you if you want to make it go
24:06 - higher you can change the X and if you
24:09 - want to make go higher you change the X
24:11 - to like let's say 100 right so you can
24:15 - see that it's going to be higher so we
24:16 - run this again you can see the the rain
24:19 - kind of stopped like right here you see
24:21 - that if you want it to be lower
24:23 - uh
24:24 - uh you know you can put like negative
24:27 - one negative 50 or something so you run
24:30 - this you can see the brain drop all the
24:32 - way down to the bottom so for me I have
24:36 - a zero so what is actually is look like
24:39 - it dropped on the table so so you can
24:42 - see it kind of dropped on the table okay
24:44 - so you can adjust this however you want
