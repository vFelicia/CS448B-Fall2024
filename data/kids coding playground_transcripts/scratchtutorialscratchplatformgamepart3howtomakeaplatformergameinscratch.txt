00:08 - alright guys welcome back to the kiss
00:10 - queen playground Chino again today we'll
00:13 - walk on continue working on this
00:15 - platform scratch platform again we'll
00:19 - try to address on the issue encounter
00:21 - last time with the treasure hunter
00:23 - jumping through the platform here so
00:27 - we'll see if we can fix it now I think I
00:30 - might have missed some of the coal
00:33 - earlier so that's why I messed it up so
00:35 - we'll try to see if we can fix it and
00:37 - also before we begin please like share
00:39 - subscribe to our Channel and you know if
00:43 - you know anybody who's interested please
00:45 - pass our channel along to them alright
00:48 - so let's get started
00:50 - okay so the issue we have was jumping
00:53 - through a let's try and say we can fix
00:55 - it let's go to this Co here I think the
00:58 - last time we did not have to go for this
01:00 - where the at this code so basically what
01:03 - it does is we're trying to add the make
01:06 - this a platform called the front and
01:09 - then go back the layer so doesn't block
01:11 - anything in this platform and also we
01:15 - will add this go for the tree so when it
01:17 - green flag is clicked make sure the tree
01:19 - cannot go in the back so let's see this
01:22 - will help a little bit and also let's
01:25 - add this back to thee to this ninja here
01:29 - to is touching the brown color we'll
01:30 - move it down then we show where this a
01:33 - run without refresh on for this and this
01:38 - pay and okay alright I think those are
01:44 - the only one that's running on the loop
01:45 - without refresh that will help okay
01:47 - let's try it again so okay so here you
01:54 - see it does does get block him down I
01:59 - think somehow you know like I'm here
02:01 - because of the side or that little
02:04 - little side shall move them up that's
02:06 - the problem because of that little no
02:07 - side here because that's not not brown
02:10 - which having this brown line so unless
02:12 - you do like brown or this brown with
02:14 - some
02:15 - that and all don't walk a little bit
02:17 - better but for now we just try to just
02:21 - simple platform Jim for this new
02:24 - treasure hunter so we'll try to just
02:28 - adjust this you know so bacon can't land
02:31 - on the have enough space between you
02:34 - know each of the platform that he's
02:36 - jumping and so so we can we're going to
02:39 - suggest it so that you know your game
02:41 - basically just move so that would fit a
02:44 - little bit better so I've been no space
02:46 - to move okay all right okay so um
02:50 - basically fix the toe to toe so make
02:54 - sure that you have similar course I have
02:57 - you know what the color and everything
03:00 - so uh looks like it's fine now Oh have
03:05 - the or the Ronco here let's just go
03:08 - through it so you should have something
03:10 - similar like this the junk oh okay and
03:15 - then this is an arrow keys pressed
03:17 - welding the jump control will go here
03:21 - this simulate gravity we have the
03:23 - touching a brown color moving back down
03:25 - this is the cream color of the platform
03:29 - right here okay
03:32 - and now you get the main piece of code
03:35 - this will put these two together things
03:38 - somehow this works better for this one I
03:40 - don't know sometimes it has problem so I
03:42 - put it back seems like it's okay right
03:45 - now and this is the checker piece that
03:50 - doesn't have any key press and they
03:52 - should stay in still okay let's just try
03:54 - one more time so let's go so you can see
03:59 - this balancing is not moving him up so
04:04 - we can't jump we cannot jump straight
04:06 - through down it seems to be fine so that
04:12 - is seems to be a walking point so this
04:15 - one is little high I mean it's kinda
04:18 - hard to jump but a running jump but you
04:20 - know you can kind of move it back down a
04:22 - little bit so you see I can still do it
04:25 - if I run and jump
04:27 - depending on how you want that platform
04:30 - you can just China move back down a
04:32 - little bit adjust it as you want so
04:34 - let's finish this piece so we're almost
04:37 - done so through this slide so we have
04:41 - the same thing right we have within the
04:43 - costume yeah or the sly alright sly here
04:47 - so what we're going to do is we're gonna
04:50 - copy this L copy this control C copy the
04:53 - name out and let's go back to the code
04:56 - and similarly we'll duplicate this set
05:00 - of code here we'll say down arrow press
05:04 - we don't need the directions or wherever
05:06 - the direction is facing that will be the
05:08 - direction is going to slide toward and
05:10 - we can change the move speed in that
05:13 - move speed with the lock run speed it
05:15 - could be really fast or we change it to
05:17 - five so we'll put that here and then
05:22 - we'll change this to the sliding costume
05:25 - and we can use a run reuse that run
05:28 - reintroduce the run index here okay all
05:32 - right so we'll put it hard to run index
05:34 - costume okay let's try it again
05:38 - so push down as you can see slide really
05:41 - slow if you push to your left and right
05:43 - arrow key and sly it will go faster you
05:46 - see
05:46 - okay so we're pretty much done with the
05:49 - slide now last thing we want to do is we
05:52 - want through the skull and the chimp
05:54 - okay all right we'll be on the tomb so
05:58 - what we're going to do we're going to
05:59 - make a new block call a random position
06:04 - so we'll put the gym in a really good
06:06 - position okay okay and now what we can
06:11 - do is when you say when this call to
06:18 - call the random position and you can
06:22 - never repeat until and you say not we
06:32 - use an end one here where you can use
06:36 - sensing
06:40 - and we are going to use the not Raider
06:46 - so we don't want him to touch the
06:49 - platform we're gonna use another in
06:54 - operator here so let me zoom in a little
06:59 - bit okay we want to use the Y position
07:05 - of the gym so mission isn't Jim doesn't
07:07 - generate more than this Y position so
07:11 - the Y position has to be greater than 9
07:18 - negative 9 negative 95 so it has to be
07:23 - credited so use the operator and use the
07:32 - back here say Y position and should be
07:37 - greater than negative 95 so somewhere on
07:41 - the top and it should be maybe a right
07:46 - here right so 140 ish maybe and it
07:50 - should be less than 140 so we'll put and
07:56 - the Y position is nest and 140 so which
08:07 - are generated Jim pitch in these two
08:09 - area here and repeat until is not not
08:16 - theirs and career than the disposition
08:19 - in less than is efficient else will want
08:22 - to go to random position and then we'll
08:25 - show okay and then we'll add the call
08:31 - for the start so when green flag is
08:35 - clicked or say set variable can set
08:43 - set the score 2-0 and then we can use a
08:49 - forever loop to make it kind of flash so
08:56 - what's a forever
08:58 - look say change color effect by 25 then
09:08 - we are they use a sensing if oops
09:15 - if touching the this this treasure
09:19 - hunter so we'll say if touching treasure
09:24 - hunter okay whoa what changes name why I
09:26 - have two here then I was testing
09:28 - something earlier so sure it's correct I
09:34 - don't have anything - okay all right so
09:37 - with touching treasure hunter okay we'll
09:42 - change the score change change the score
09:49 - by one going up and we'll play this
09:53 - sound I have the favorite aspect yep
09:55 - already loaded so we'll say sound place
10:00 - down fairy dust and then we'll hide it
10:07 - hide us Jim and what we can do is we can
10:11 - like wait for three seconds or something
10:14 - like that however one many second you
10:16 - want to wait and then we get well going
10:18 - to call the random position again so
10:21 - move the ship to another location all
10:25 - right and initially you can set that Jim
10:28 - maybe right here or something like that
10:30 - if you want then you know this Jim will
10:33 - always go here right okay now let's
10:37 - start you can see the Jim is flashing i
10:41 - catched it it went away
10:43 - so let's get up you can get that
10:49 - right in running sly
10:54 - so let's lie and try to catch this gym
10:57 - here so you can't do that so so this is
11:01 - pretty much it we can add the sound in
11:04 - the background you can use whatever
11:06 - sound you like um you can use a forever
11:09 - loop and when the flag is clicked we can
11:13 - say control forever and what we want to
11:18 - do is we can upload a sound or you can
11:21 - use one of the random sound I had one of
11:23 - this down I previously done so this one
11:28 - will try to play this one so place this
11:34 - song sound here say until Dunham's will
11:38 - repeat okay let's say this let's test
11:42 - again one more time just take some time
11:44 - to say because the wav file is kind of
11:47 - big I'd be one you can just use any kind
11:50 - of file here at you and you know music
11:53 - they have a lot of actually you can go
11:55 - here you can find here say let's say you
11:59 - say search there's plenty of loop music
12:01 - you can use you know one up this down or
12:03 - not anything that's fine
12:05 - okay alright so let's start this game
12:09 - again we'll save everything
12:11 - oh whatever rename it call it media
12:19 - scratch platform game okay alright let's
12:23 - make it big let's try to run this right
12:26 - now
12:28 - you can see
12:34 - [Music]
12:46 - [Music]
13:13 - [Music]
13:16 - decorations I think one decoration the
13:18 - table everything facade to our house
13:21 - that might not work well this because of
13:24 - the white is white little light thing so
13:28 - it kind of mashed a cream color match do
13:30 - you like the stall and
13:35 - so just depending on the situation you
13:38 - can use the up the taxes and the portion
13:42 - all that you can add to this game so
13:44 - this is I don't have anything that way
13:46 - you can see some have level one right so
13:49 - but as you can see just like the ninja
13:51 - game you can create multiple level and
13:53 - hopefully something out for this again
13:58 - okay alright alright alright see you
14:03 - guys next time
14:06 - [Music]
