00:08 - hello and welcome back to the kids :
00:11 - playground Channel today we'll continue
00:14 - working on the Bo platformer game before
00:18 - we start please like share and subscribe
00:21 - to our channel and also if you like you
00:24 - can send in some of your game and if you
00:27 - we can review it and make a tutorial out
00:31 - of that for other kids to learn so
00:32 - please do that if you like - okay all
00:36 - right
00:38 - walk weekend so we'll laugh off where we
00:42 - were last time
00:45 - so last time we we had the basic setup
00:50 - of the layout for the three different
00:52 - stages right we have different stages
00:55 - while platform this is like stage 1 2 &
00:59 - 3 so there's a sound stage 1 welcome
01:03 - back to the stage 1 for now and then
01:06 - today we'll try to make the ninja move a
01:10 - little bit so that you can move up and
01:12 - left and right up and down and then well
01:17 - that will walk on and see what we can
01:20 - work on next
01:20 - ok alright ok let's go to the ninja so
01:27 - we have this start again so whenever the
01:29 - flat click this thought I can will
01:31 - happen and what we need to do is we have
01:34 - to make some new one rock we call run
01:43 - control so this is our custom block this
01:47 - will help us to make the ninja run oh
01:51 - whatever we're here for now oppai
01:53 - organizes later on to have better
01:56 - organization but we put the code ok ok
02:01 - so the run block we wanna I think we
02:05 - already created some variable as well
02:07 - there will be
02:08 - yeah we're that dying or I wish you were
02:10 - not dying when we're running so what we
02:15 - can do is whether put this if condition
02:18 - check here outside this block I hope you
02:22 - guys can see let me zoom in a little bit
02:25 - okay let us say if if dying so basically
02:37 - the thing just not dying when it's not
02:39 - the game right is n right so as you can
02:41 - see this is n right dying is equal to n
02:45 - times is not time and so what we have is
02:52 - we want to make this guy move so you
02:55 - looking hit to his costume you see
02:58 - something called all 0 right or 1 or 2
03:01 - or 3 or 4 or 5 so these are the running
03:05 - move so whether stuff from 0 to number 9
03:11 - right number 9 so when it gets a 9 then
03:17 - we have to uh switch to a circle back to
03:20 - 0 so what we're going to do is we're
03:22 - gonna create used our custom index I
03:25 - think we run the custom index so we're
03:27 - gonna start that at 0 as you can see
03:32 - right we have started at 0 and then
03:33 - we're going to do is we're gonna put our
03:36 - check here in the beginning ok go
03:42 - through this greater then if condition
03:47 - so I'm going to say if my running custom
03:55 - index will show this right now so that
03:57 - you guys can see it ok it's greater than
04:02 - 9 so basically you know after it goes to
04:05 - 9 then we want to set it back to 0
04:08 - so step this so that will go back to our
04:13 - run run 0 right so what we call the to
04:17 - join the statement later
04:19 - okay and what Nexus we are going to use
04:23 - this up check here so we are going to do
04:30 - the check of the player push the a
04:32 - button or you know the left arrow button
04:35 - so we can have a choice so people can
04:39 - use her yet
04:41 - aw SD Oh can use arrow key okay so we
04:49 - have to use the whole Warren right so I
04:52 - know what a quarter of sentencing to
04:54 - look for the key press so if whoops I'm
04:59 - gonna drop down okay we'll do it over
05:01 - here first I mean zoom a little bit I
05:03 - think so close so there's a oh go to the
05:12 - left arrow so basically this a or left
05:16 - arrow press Oh make tough ninja go the
05:20 - other way so you will say corn
05:25 - interaction so ninja that's 90s you said
05:30 - seed 90 is this way right so we we put
05:33 - negative 90 and we'll be up the other
05:35 - way so what we're to do whether cone
05:38 - negative 90 right and also make sure you
05:40 - select this if you don't the menu or
05:42 - flip over you see how if the door does
05:44 - not what we want right we'll have them
05:47 - put on this so that he'll face this way
05:49 - right okay anyway we can put them back
05:52 - this way doesn't matter so what we are
05:56 - going to say is minus 90 so when this
06:00 - when the left arrow key is pressed it
06:02 - can face to the left side and we have a
06:06 - running speed right 10 right so we can
06:08 - change I use that for the move so later
06:12 - you can like make it go faster slower
06:16 - you can change this you don't have to
06:17 - like we change to this here or you can
06:22 - use a variable so we'll drag this run
06:27 - speed so right now it's 10 so basically
06:30 - moving
06:30 - step to the left and then what are we
06:34 - gonna do we can switch to costume for
06:37 - this guy
06:38 - so switching custom as you can see one
06:42 - day our RS over 1 R 0 2 or 9 for the
06:47 - costume so what we can do is we're gonna
06:49 - use this operator mmm something called
06:53 - join that's too much ok yes ok so we are
07:00 - going to join our and then the index of
07:06 - that custom index right so but this year
07:09 - so will be R 0 right or 1 or 2 or that
07:14 - so what we can do is we'll put it here
07:17 - and we are going to change this run
07:23 - index by 1 so go or what are 0 1 or 2
07:29 - until 9:00 when they go over 9 to go
07:31 - back to 0
07:32 - ok got it ok so we'll do something
07:37 - similar right till the so to the other
07:46 - button so the D so this one is going to
07:51 - the right and we want to face the other
07:55 - way
08:02 - well similar thing right same thing you
08:06 - can either move this outside or inside
08:09 - here but I I feel like you're putting
08:12 - the cold I can you put it here may work
08:15 - as well so that you will need to repeat
08:17 - the code but I feel like me put it
08:19 - inside yeah it makes the game a little
08:21 - bit run more smoother so it depends
08:24 - I'm putting inside right now but as you
08:26 - can see this Co is really similar right
08:28 - so we couldn't go outside the if
08:30 - statement but you can try it but I think
08:32 - putting in here runs a little smoother
08:34 - but you can just try it yourself so now
08:38 - let's go on and then what we can do it
08:40 - we have to call this forever so that
08:43 - will make
08:44 - we'll check and keep on going right so
08:47 - what we can do is track the loop forever
08:51 - here and what we do is we are going to
08:55 - car block run control so let's just test
09:00 - it out for right now we'll save it we
09:03 - just click on this as you can see let's
09:05 - see he's running kind of all over the
09:07 - place I guess doesn't really matter so
09:10 - you can see if I go left
09:11 - it's going left or I go right is going
09:13 - right so as you can see minion just kind
09:15 - of running back nothing right right okay
09:19 - let me see if I move it out see this
09:21 - better if I see any like if we didn't
09:25 - put it back in
09:25 - let's take this out let's try this see
09:31 - if we you feel anything you see it's
09:33 - coming you see that it's kind of messed
09:35 - up right you see it's moving all over
09:37 - the place so I don't so this is not
09:39 - right so we don't want to do that why
09:42 - they put it inside okay we'll stop start
09:48 - again so as you can see this is better
09:51 - so I think when we put in outside that
09:53 - because that is condition even though
09:58 - that this is because we did not push any
10:00 - key we should not be running yeah that's
10:02 - correct so we shouldn't have put it
10:04 - outside so it doesn't work I also want
10:07 - start running all over the place okay
10:09 - all right so what we got we got a ninja
10:12 - moving so far the control so what we
10:15 - also need to do is we want to walk on
10:18 - the jump and also we want to walk on the
10:21 - gravity so that when ninja jumps up it
10:25 - kind of cool the ninja back down so what
10:28 - we're going to do is we're gonna create
10:30 - new nuke oh here I'm gonna move down so
10:36 - that we'll get more space it so we'll
10:39 - call it simulate gravity
10:47 - okay so this will simulate the gravity
10:49 - on the only game okay so this is another
10:53 - custom block and we are going to use
10:57 - this change by Y so every time this
11:03 - change my Y will change by the fall
11:05 - speed so basically however the fall
11:08 - speed the false video will try to move
11:13 - the this ninja down oh yeah I forgot to
11:16 - mention like give you two the running
11:17 - index right you can see this look next
11:20 - changing you see crazy zero nine and
11:23 - then when I gets back to one so that's
11:25 - how you change the costume just in case
11:27 - you you have any question of it okay so
11:30 - we join these two become our seven so
11:33 - let's say this is seven will be our
11:34 - seven so our seven will be whatever the
11:38 - are seven you know the ninja that's
11:40 - moving or seven right so like this guy
11:49 - here this guy right so actually okay
11:55 - correct so let's go back to I hope you
11:57 - guys understand that pretty simple
11:58 - joining the two things switching the
12:00 - costume to that name okay let's go back
12:03 - to this assimilate gravity okay so we
12:06 - want to make this ninja fall all the
12:08 - time by the fall speed and we're gonna
12:13 - put in a writer here we are going to use
12:19 - anything else to show it okay if it's
12:24 - touching platform so what we can do is
12:27 - we want to say it was touching the
12:29 - platform of this sprite but what we want
12:33 - to do is we want another join actually
12:36 - we want to end because we want to say
12:39 - touching platform and touching the color
12:45 - green so we want this green part that is
12:48 - going on top okay so that you know not
12:53 - not the brown pot right so he should not
12:55 - be
12:55 - on the brown pot only the green spot so
12:58 - click on this gonna come this little
12:59 - thing and you can look over here you can
13:02 - see the screen you can say this screen
13:10 - okay alright so we'll say okay it is
13:16 - touching D the platform and the platform
13:21 - for n touching the screen then we'll
13:26 - change the white chain UI okay we won't
13:34 - use 0 minus this fall speed so basically
13:41 - if it is if it's touching that then
13:45 - we'll try to change the negative
13:48 - position zone which are mighty make the
13:51 - vintage channel stay to the floor here
13:54 - okay okay go to 0 and then he falls be
14:01 - whatever the false be this so right now
14:06 - our fall speed is 0 I believe let's take
14:09 - this dying out or withhold that will
14:12 - take this as well okay so you can kind
14:16 - understand if you open your your
14:18 - variable we can see and keep track of it
14:23 - and then they were touching it then what
14:25 - we're going to do is kind of set it back
14:29 - to zero so set it back to zero else we
14:38 - want to change this change this fall
14:43 - speed by the gravity right what the
14:48 - gravity is no minus 1 right so keep
14:52 - coming down so what happened is when we
14:54 - run this or to put our block inside here
15:00 - [Music]
15:01 - okay
15:03 - so when we run this right now what it's
15:06 - going to do is gonna put the ninja back
15:08 - like I said I have to ninja up here
15:10 - whoops stop if I play this so he put the
15:18 - ninja back on this ground you see that
15:20 - so I cannot so you see I can still
15:24 - moving through here because my head is
15:26 - actually touching the screen so that's
15:28 - what I said right in the beginning that
15:31 - because of the of the sprite is so tall
15:37 - that's why it has problem but again
15:39 - using a small block then you'll not have
15:42 - this problem because you will not be
15:44 - touching the green and the platform
15:46 - because there's ninjas no hi
15:48 - so it could actually get to this kind of
15:52 - pointing is trying to able to move do
15:55 - the rocks even though he's not supposed
15:58 - to what you can do is you can put a
16:01 - hitbox around here to make him not able
16:04 - to do that and me and they put a hitbox
16:07 - around here so that way you will not be
16:10 - able to move or cross like this we'll do
16:13 - that in a bit okay okay so we have our
16:19 - ninja that can move right and now let's
16:24 - work on the jump for the ninja for now
16:26 - so that the ninja can jump up for now
16:28 - we'll fix the hitbox with the with a
16:32 - ninja later so we have to run we have
16:35 - simulated gravity pushing the ninja back
16:38 - down and what we're going to do is we're
16:40 - gonna walk on the jump so let's make a
16:42 - new block again so we'll call it jump
16:45 - control okay so for a chump control
16:54 - similar to the to the run control that
17:00 - we're doing so we also need to check if
17:03 - we should have players not time before
17:07 - we do that allow also not allow them to
17:10 - do the operation okay this is the same
17:14 - thing so we can I use the operator here
17:17 - to equal and we're too
17:21 - select the dyeing parable okay if it's
17:26 - not dying then we can let them run so
17:30 - same thing with a jump so we are going
17:32 - to set the variable as well so we're
17:39 - gonna set that jump index to zero and
17:47 - then what you wanna do is gonna repeat
17:50 - 10 times that we have 10 different
17:52 - custom ok and we are going to switch the
17:59 - costume so from you can see right the
18:03 - jump has what from 0 J 0 - j9 right so
18:09 - we are going to switch this costume just
18:14 - like how we did before with the opera
18:16 - join operator o put this here
18:19 - we'll put J here as the first letter
18:22 - which we don't have any spaces and you
18:24 - can put the index the jump custom index
18:30 - on here and then we will do the same
18:33 - thing will change the this jump index by
18:40 - one and then
18:48 - okay we are going to add the if
18:51 - condition here Sam similar thing with
18:56 - this guy so put this here okay move over
19:10 - a little bit so it is touching the
19:13 - platform and touching this green color
19:16 - then we are called a set this Chung
19:22 - speed set the fall speed to the Chum
19:32 - speed so baby moving up because if he's
19:34 - on this platform that we allow them to
19:36 - jump we will put the jump speed of 12 to
19:41 - that and also on to make it a little bit
19:45 - smooth with a jump where to kind of
19:48 - balance it out what we can do is you can
19:53 - do this change Y by -1 before that show
19:59 - jump and we'll add another one change Y
20:06 - by +1 after this jump
20:11 - so that way is a little bit more smooth
20:14 - actually so we have this jump control
20:17 - done but what they associate a button to
20:21 - this jump right so what we can do okay
20:26 - we are going to test it out let's see so
20:31 - jump is not working let's check our code
20:35 - okay things okay okay here's the problem
20:40 - I'm setting it the same variable this
20:43 - should be fall speed okay all right
20:47 - let's test it again okay okay this time
20:51 - jump is walking but as you can see this
20:54 - ninja after he jumps and move he kind of
20:58 - stuck in that position
21:00 - so that's we need to fix that right so
21:03 - as you can see he jumped and it kind of
21:05 - stuck at that position right so what
21:07 - we're going to do is I'm gonna add a
21:10 - coat of fix that actually ok we are
21:14 - going to get another even here when
21:19 - start let me stop everything and we're
21:23 - gonna call it not a forever loop and we
21:31 - are going to use the if condition and we
21:37 - are going to use some n operator
21:39 - different condition with it join
21:42 - together so we use as you can see I can
21:45 - put one more hand in here to make it
21:47 - like a triple and joint so this one we
21:51 - can use that not as well we'll put and
21:57 - then we say not pressing any key so what
22:05 - we can do is track this over here into
22:09 - the knot so basically we say if there's
22:12 - no key press and we have to use this
22:20 - condition here and our for speed is zero
22:29 - meaning is he all right fall down he's
22:31 - not doing anything right he's on the
22:33 - ground and he is also not dying so he's
22:43 - died and we don't want to we don't want
22:45 - to put him in that standing position so
22:49 - where to put the up how terrible here
22:52 - dying you go to know it's not time then
22:59 - so we'll track this and put this in here
23:01 - or the move this out of the way okay and
23:06 - with a reset how variable whether set
23:10 - the running
23:12 - costume index back to zero and let us
23:17 - set the jumping index back to zero
23:23 - custom index and also we want to switch
23:26 - to costume also switch to costume back
23:31 - to this Idol 5 ok let's start it again
23:37 - we'll start again so now if I jump
23:41 - you see he's back to normal when he's
23:44 - back down so oops it looks little
23:50 - jumping like we're mmm that's unbuckle
23:56 - and it didn't look ok
23:59 - I think I found the problem I forgot I
24:01 - changed it to any key basically no no
24:05 - key pressed then we don't want to make
24:08 - him do that so as you can see it's much
24:11 - more smoother right now right so you can
24:13 - jump up you can come up you come down
24:18 - jump up again so you see and see it when
24:21 - he jumping car change his costume and he
24:24 - can jump up we still have a issue with
24:27 - this walking on the road because his
24:28 - head is touching green and the platform
24:30 - so the mess we put out kinda hitbox in
24:34 - the brown area like right here then we
24:37 - can block him up but uh for now that's
24:40 - we get the basic movement of this of
24:44 - this ninja here he can jump up you can
24:47 - run laughs run right right ok alright so
24:51 - we'll stop here for this tutorial we'll
24:53 - continue next time please like share
24:56 - subscribe to our channel and give us
24:58 - some feedback to comment below thank you
25:01 - alright see you guys next time
