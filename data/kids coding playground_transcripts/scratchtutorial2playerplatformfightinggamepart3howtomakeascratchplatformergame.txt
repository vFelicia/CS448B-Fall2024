00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so this is the third episode
00:09 - of the two-player fighting game so if
00:12 - you haven't watched the first
00:13 - and second one i suggest you to watch
00:15 - that those two first
00:17 - it's kids coding playground and this is
00:19 - the third video
00:20 - so we're going to be working on the
00:23 - background
00:23 - the begin button and the selection
00:26 - screen today
00:27 - so first let's go to the backdrop open
00:32 - code in here we have the sound here you
00:35 - can take any sound you want
00:36 - but i downloaded this sound so let me
00:39 - zoom in
00:41 - so when fly clicked you want to switch
00:43 - the backdrop to
00:47 - this one the first backdrop which is the
00:50 - desert
00:52 - just you can rename it back back drop
00:54 - one
00:55 - bg one broadcast this message called
00:58 - start screen
00:59 - so start screen is to start the game
01:05 - start it'll start this a start screen
01:09 - for the selection
01:10 - so we'll put the forever down here put
01:12 - the sound in here
01:15 - and let's move on to the
01:18 - begin button so i have it in the
01:20 - backpack already
01:22 - so i can just drag it in here but since
01:24 - you guys don't have it i will show you
01:26 - guys
01:28 - so um i'll just make a new sprite paint
01:32 - i'm not paint i'm sorry um
01:36 - so we'll just get the button sprite
01:42 - button get this button so you can just
01:46 - type um make it
01:49 - maybe white white color
01:54 - so you can write begin or something
01:58 - shrink it
02:04 - and you can write another begin
02:10 - begin
02:14 - and then you can flip it over like that
02:22 - so that's how you make the begin thing
02:24 - oops
02:27 - there you go like that see this
02:31 - let's make it something like that so you
02:34 - can just i'm just going to delete this
02:36 - just copy this down make something like
02:38 - that
02:39 - so we want to get one flight another one
02:42 - fly click sorry
02:43 - so when it receives start screen we want
02:46 - to
02:46 - reset all the variables so we need to
02:50 - make two
02:50 - new variables one is called player1hp
02:55 - and we can make the other variable later
02:57 - actually because we don't have two
02:58 - players yet
02:59 - so just name it player one
03:02 - hp so player 1 hp
03:06 - you can just hide this so we want to set
03:09 - hp
03:10 - player 1 hp to 100 in the beginning we
03:12 - can
03:13 - make the other player 2 hp later because
03:16 - um
03:16 - we don't have two players yet so we can
03:19 - set the
03:21 - player one character to clear in the
03:23 - beginning
03:24 - so that means it hasn't selected
03:25 - anything yet
03:28 - so we can go to this position x
03:32 - zero y negative eighty this position i
03:35 - have already
03:36 - and set the brightness to zero
03:39 - because we will be changing the
03:40 - brightness when the button is clicked
03:44 - uh and then we can show in the beginning
03:47 - because after that when it's clicked we
03:50 - need to hide it
03:52 - so we're gonna broadcast another message
03:54 - called spin button
03:56 - so this broadcast just make a button
03:59 - spin
04:00 - it's just to make it spin to make it
04:02 - look better so just name it spin button
04:07 - spin button so when it receives spin
04:09 - button
04:12 - then we can do a forever loop
04:15 - turn two degrees to the left or the
04:18 - right whichever one you'd like
04:21 - and if it's touching
04:25 - if it's touching um the mouse pointer
04:28 - and mouse down
04:30 - so if it's getting clicked on basically
04:33 - touching the mouse pointer and mouse
04:35 - down
04:38 - then we can set the brightness effect to
04:40 - negative 10. so we'll make it darker
04:44 - change the brightness effect by negative
04:47 - 10
04:49 - brightness by negative 10 so make it
04:51 - darker
04:55 - so let's play it so when you play it
04:58 - um it'll play the music and when you
05:00 - click it it'll get darker
05:03 - we haven't done the code to us make it
05:05 - hide and stuff yet
05:06 - so we will do that later so the back
05:09 - let's make a little recap
05:11 - so the backdrop broadcast is start
05:13 - screen to the begin
05:14 - and again we'll will receive it and
05:17 - broadcast it to other sprites
05:19 - later on in the video so
05:23 - we still have some more code for the
05:24 - begin button
05:26 - so when the sprite is clicked
05:30 - when the sprite is clicked if when if
05:33 - else statement
05:34 - if the player
05:38 - being an equal sign if the player one
05:41 - character
05:43 - is equal to blank that means nothing has
05:44 - been selected yet
05:47 - then we can say
05:51 - uh for two seconds maybe uh players
05:54 - please select
05:57 - please select
06:00 - your uh characters
06:08 - and else if it is selected then we can
06:11 - start some pop like make a little sound
06:14 - effect
06:15 - then we can hide
06:19 - hide broadcast start game and wait
06:26 - start oops i need a new message
06:29 - called start game
06:37 - start game new uh message and we can
06:40 - stop
06:41 - other scripts in the sprite because we
06:43 - don't need the begin button
06:45 - at all after the game has started
06:50 - so this is the code for the begin button
06:53 - so let's play it click on it
06:57 - players play select characters and we
07:00 - have not we haven't done this uh
07:02 - selecting buttons
07:03 - so that's why it's uh saying that so
07:06 - that's why
07:07 - it's saying that because we haven't got
07:08 - done the selection
07:10 - so we'll do that later so for the player
07:14 - one
07:16 - have to change all the when flag clicks
07:19 - into the start game so it won't
07:22 - show up in the beginning we want it to
07:25 - show up
07:26 - once the button is clicked so start game
07:30 - just changes that for a start game
07:36 - just do it for all the
07:40 - wonderful clicks
07:44 - start game
07:47 - do we have any more let's drag to this
07:51 - side
07:52 - i think that's it for now we might have
07:54 - to do more later
07:59 - and finally we do not need this code
08:01 - anymore
08:02 - this is just testing so you can just
08:04 - delete it so
08:06 - next we will work on the artwork for the
08:09 - ninja girl buttons i already have the
08:11 - stuff in my backpack
08:13 - but i will drag it out and teach you
08:15 - guys how to play make it
08:18 - so you go to costumes so first
08:22 - let me delete this i'll show you how to
08:25 - do it
08:25 - from the beginning to end so you want to
08:28 - get the ninja girl
08:29 - idle costume and then convert to
08:33 - a vector select the whole thing
08:36 - ctrl c copy and paste it
08:40 - make a new costume and
08:43 - paste it over here so as you can see
08:46 - and now you erase everything under the
08:49 - head
08:50 - convert to bitmap with the eraser
08:54 - tool and erase everything under it
08:57 - until the head you have to be you have
08:59 - to zoom in a bit
09:01 - at the end because you have some uh
09:05 - hard parts to clean up so you got to go
09:08 - slow
09:08 - see like you can mess up sometimes
09:16 - like you can click it
09:19 - that's a good way to do it
09:23 - and you can set the things a smaller
09:25 - size like a 10 size
09:27 - to clean up this edges
09:34 - um we're almost done
09:40 - i mean it doesn't have to be too perfect
09:42 - but
09:43 - just clean it up try to do it the best
09:45 - you can
09:47 - like i'm doing
09:50 - oops there's a little cut on the hair
09:54 - maybe five size a bit smaller now
09:58 - to make it clean up better
10:03 - clean up this area
10:06 - um
10:14 - this is pretty good right now let's
10:17 - clean off the
10:18 - edges that's bad
10:25 - and erase this so that should be good
10:30 - so now you can just convert back to
10:32 - vector so you can select it
10:35 - so we can make a new sprite paint a new
10:37 - one
10:38 - make it right here get like a circle
10:41 - put like some orange color like i did up
10:43 - there
10:44 - put an outline like a brown color
10:48 - and you want the um and you want the
10:51 - thickness
10:53 - i'm just doing a random color just to
10:55 - show you and demonstrate
10:56 - you can um make six as the outline
11:01 - draw the circle and you hold down the
11:05 - shift key so you get a perfect circle
11:08 - like right now so you go to the head
11:13 - select it remember to convert back to
11:15 - vector
11:16 - ctrl c ctrl v now you can shrink it
11:23 - shrink it to the size
11:28 - and always drag from the corners
11:31 - so i have the ninja head you can make it
11:33 - a bit bigger actually
11:35 - so this is my ninja head and then you
11:38 - can just duplicate it
11:40 - um make a different color for the
11:43 - background
11:44 - like maybe blue
11:48 - blue blue and then the edge can still be
11:52 - black i guess
11:52 - and then you can just write with white
11:56 - or something
11:58 - player one
12:04 - and put it right there
12:08 - so when it will start out as this and
12:10 - when it's clicked
12:12 - it will change to this like that and
12:15 - that
12:16 - okay so i'm just going to delete these
12:18 - so if you ever need to
12:19 - um learn how to do it you can just go
12:22 - back a bit and
12:24 - watch me do it so i have the costumes
12:29 - same thing for the dragon do the same
12:32 - thing as the dragon when you're making
12:33 - the dragon button
12:34 - so let me drag this in let me take it
12:38 - so next let's work out the code for the
12:40 - ninja girl button
12:42 - so in the flat clicked we can set the x
12:44 - and y position
12:47 - so the reason why it's set right there
12:50 - is because i have in my backpack
12:52 - so it will set it to that so if you
12:55 - because
12:55 - it probably won't be the same place as
12:58 - mine so you could just set it as
13:00 - negative 170 or y60 you can do it
13:03 - anywhere you want actually but i'm
13:06 - staying with this we wanted to go to the
13:08 - front layer so
13:10 - everything will go to the back like the
13:11 - platforms and stuff
13:13 - switch the costume to costume one in the
13:15 - beginning
13:17 - like the regular costume non-selected
13:20 - one
13:21 - and we have to show in the beginning
13:25 - uh and when the sprite is clicked
13:31 - you want to set the player1 character
13:36 - to ng because this is the ninja girl
13:39 - button so when you click on it we change
13:42 - it to ninja girl
13:44 - so now we broadcast a message called
13:46 - player 1 select
13:53 - we can name it player 1
13:56 - select
14:00 - and when this receives player one
14:02 - selects
14:05 - then we get a fl statement
14:08 - if the player one character is equal to
14:11 - the ninja
14:12 - ninja girl
14:17 - then we can get change it to ng
14:21 - so if the player one character is ninja
14:24 - girl then we can switch the costume
14:25 - to costume two
14:29 - which is the selected one as you can see
14:35 - and switch costume else we can switch
14:37 - the costume to costume one
14:43 - the ng is matching with the sprite
14:45 - costume
14:46 - that's why we have to put ng
14:50 - as you can see costume is ng
14:53 - run ng jump ng attack
14:57 - that's why i have to put ng in the front
15:01 - and when i receive start game
15:06 - then we have to hide because when the
15:09 - game starts we want the buttons to hide
15:13 - player 2 dragon is pretty much the same
15:15 - thing
15:16 - you can just drag and drop all the code
15:18 - into here
15:19 - but we just have to change a couple
15:21 - extra things
15:24 - um
15:27 - drag this in
15:30 - and drag this in
15:34 - so now we have all the code here
15:38 - so instead of ng since this is dragon
15:41 - we have to set this to drk because uh
15:44 - the corresponding um
15:46 - costumes as you can see right here
15:50 - is drg see drg run
15:54 - drg attack drg jump
15:58 - so we set it to drt and we set the
16:01 - variable to
16:02 - here also to drg
16:07 - and one last thing
16:11 - i think we forgot to add it from here we
16:13 - have to change the x and y position
16:18 - to negative 65 y 60 which is that
16:21 - position
16:22 - right there
16:26 - and broadcast and when the sprites click
16:28 - we have to switch to the costume 2
16:34 - so yeah
16:38 - that's all the code so let me play it
16:41 - and you only select one
16:43 - so right now you only have one player
16:47 - so if you don't select anything they'll
16:49 - say players please select your
16:51 - characters
16:53 - players please select your characters
16:54 - we'll change the break which
16:56 - i'll fix the brightness thing later
16:58 - [Music]
17:01 - when you select one of them you cannot
17:02 - select
17:04 - [Music]
17:08 - everything still works smoothly and fine
17:15 - so since every single time you click the
17:17 - button
17:19 - it gets darker and darker like that like
17:21 - that
17:22 - you can't even see it put the clear
17:24 - graphic effects right here
17:26 - so now as you can see when you click it
17:29 - it'll clear back after it's done saying
17:31 - it
17:32 - [Music]
17:34 - so thank you guys for watching please
17:36 - like share and subscribe
17:38 - and i'll see you guys in the fourth
17:40 - episode of
17:41 - the two player fighting game
