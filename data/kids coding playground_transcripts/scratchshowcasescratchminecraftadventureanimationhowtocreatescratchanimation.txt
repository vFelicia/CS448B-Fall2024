00:33 - comments below so anyways let's start it
00:36 - so it's the morning and there's alex and
00:38 - steve
00:38 - and there's like a music to make the
00:40 - thing better what a beautiful
00:42 - day i think we should go for our
00:44 - adventure that is a great idea alex but
00:47 - we need to get some weapons from the
00:48 - house that is a good
00:49 - idea let's go and when they go in the
00:51 - house
00:52 - it changes its backdrop so
00:56 - you'll see that it comes out it says
00:58 - point
01:00 - and the sheet comes out
01:04 - and it goes inside and we go inside and
01:06 - there's like a music change
01:07 - and they're grabbing the weapons and
01:10 - they also change costumes
01:11 - this is the barbers they changed their
01:14 - costumes
01:15 - and he changed his costume and he got
01:17 - his diamond sword
01:19 - let's move out i'm a bit thirsty need
01:21 - some water it says few hours later
01:23 - so this is like a few a transition wait
01:26 - for me steve
01:27 - [Music]
01:29 - i'm going to jump into the light because
01:30 - he's really hot and he needs water
01:33 - so as you can see when he jumps into the
01:35 - lake
01:37 - there's water covered okay so you get
01:40 - out there there's a monster above you
01:42 - and a phantom comes out
01:44 - oh my god let me out of here and then
01:45 - they get armed and they try to fight the
01:47 - phantom
01:48 - so they keep on attacking the fandom
01:50 - with their gold swords and diamond
01:52 - swords
01:52 - come
02:07 - take that monster and just our argument
02:09 - flips over and dies
02:12 - yeah we did it and it makes some things
02:15 - so thank you for watching this animation
02:17 - so yeah so i cannot actually show you
02:22 - everything that we have here i am
02:24 - actually not going to do the tutorial
02:25 - because there's a lot of broadcast
02:27 - and a lot of code for the broadcast so
02:29 - i'm actually going to
02:30 - review some code with you so this is
02:33 - like
02:34 - the one the green flag is clicked set
02:35 - size to 100
02:37 - point direction 90 show switch costume
02:40 - the costume one that's the regular
02:41 - costume and i go to this position
02:42 - and it's like all broadcast and then
02:44 - like alex talks too
02:47 - and see so at one part um as i showed
02:50 - you
02:51 - in the showcase he gets small and goes
02:54 - into the
02:55 - barn house so when i receive go to the
02:56 - barn house that's that is a good
02:58 - good idea let's go wait wait for two sec
03:02 - says for two seconds set size is 75
03:04 - percent
03:05 - glide once one second to 80 why negative
03:08 - 19. so it's gliding and it's getting
03:10 - smaller
03:10 - and smaller and it's gliding inside the
03:12 - barn house
03:13 - so steve also gets some talking so steve
03:17 - also talks
03:18 - to and he also goes in the barn house so
03:21 - hey wait for me i'm coming
03:23 - i'm coming with you and then set size to
03:25 - 75 percent
03:26 - and glides in and then broadcast alex
03:29 - goes to bar
03:30 - and it'll set size to 40 and then it'll
03:33 - go inside
03:36 - so um this is when they grab the weapon
03:38 - so it makes like a sound it switches to
03:40 - costume too that's like the diamond
03:42 - sword
03:42 - costume i'll point in direction negative
03:45 - 90
03:46 - so i'm gonna show you the costumes this
03:47 - is costume one costume one costume two
03:50 - so here we go and then alex
03:54 - costume one costume two
03:57 - so yeah and they also grab the weapons
04:03 - so next i'll show you the pig
04:07 - so the pig is really simple it's just
04:09 - some
04:10 - coke because he's not really the main
04:11 - character he's just like a side
04:13 - character in a sheep
04:14 - it's really easy too and then um
04:18 - i'll also show you the few hours later
04:20 - so
04:21 - when the backdrop switches to the
04:23 - minecraft force it'll start blinking
04:25 - high wait 0.5 seconds and then show and
04:28 - then wait another 0.5 seconds
04:30 - and then i'll also show you the phantom
04:32 - the phantom is um
04:35 - when the green flag is clicked oh hi
04:37 - this is when the phantom
04:39 - flips over so say arg pointing direction
04:42 - negative ninety repeat until touching
04:44 - water
04:44 - change y by negative four and start
04:46 - sounding the splash sound
04:48 - i'll hide in a broadcast monster drop
04:54 - down
04:56 - so i actually cut some part of the water
04:59 - so it's the backdrop and i made a sprite
05:01 - called water
05:02 - just so it can cover steve's um feet so
05:05 - when i when the green flag is slicked
05:07 - out high and when i receive
05:08 - steven lake it'll go to the front layer
05:11 - and i'll show so it's like covering its
05:13 - legs
05:15 - and then yeah i know
