00:03 - [Music]
00:10 - so welcome back guys it's catch coding
00:12 - playground here
00:13 - today we'll be doing another video on
00:15 - the christmas platformer
00:18 - so from last video we're just going to
00:20 - go over the code
00:21 - from last video so let's do that really
00:23 - quick
00:24 - so this is the checking the player
00:25 - position like the green flag this is
00:28 - like
00:28 - positioning the green flag stuff like
00:30 - that if it's touching the green flag
00:32 - then it'll move on to the next level
00:35 - platform detection
00:36 - if it's hitting the ground starting a
00:39 - new level
00:40 - resetting the player re starting the
00:43 - game
00:44 - this is when you start the game um
00:47 - we have jumping and this is starting all
00:50 - the controls like
00:52 - moving and jumping and then we have
00:56 - jumping oh this is jumping sorry about
00:58 - that this is jumping and this is if it's
00:59 - hitting the ground
01:00 - and then this is jumping movement
01:03 - control
01:04 - and then this is the move player speed x
01:08 - okay and after that we have the animated
01:11 - character
01:12 - some simple code we didn't change
01:13 - anything from the last video
01:15 - green flag nothing here so no we'll work
01:17 - on that later round
01:19 - we have this code right here and the
01:22 - spikes will be
01:23 - uh completing it we'll be adding some
01:25 - other stuff too
01:27 - and trampoline we have not done yet so
01:29 - yeah
01:30 - so without further ado let's get into
01:32 - the coding so
01:33 - let's go over here let's get this block
01:36 - we coded from last video
01:38 - so the check player position so we're
01:40 - going to get an
01:41 - if then statement just put that
01:44 - on top so if
01:47 - it's touching the color so like this is
01:49 - like if it's touching the color red
01:52 - or it's falling off the edge so we're
01:53 - going to do this so if
01:55 - we need an ore okay so if
01:59 - touching the color red so we're going to
02:02 - use this little eyedropper
02:04 - and select this red color or
02:07 - the y position is less than one negative
02:09 - 170.
02:10 - so like we have like one level where
02:12 - like you can fall off
02:14 - so we're going to make that little fall
02:15 - off thing that's why we need this
02:17 - so if it's less than 170 negative 170
02:22 - so if the y position let's go here
02:25 - y position is less than negative 170.
02:28 - we're going to broadcast another message
02:31 - we're going to name it die so the player
02:32 - is dead if
02:34 - any of those conditions are true
02:37 - then we're going to get another if then
02:39 - statement so if
02:43 - if the g player
02:46 - uh dead is equal to yes so if the player
02:49 - is dead
02:50 - equal to yes so we're going to get g
02:52 - player dead
02:54 - detection of the player's death is equal
02:56 - to yes
02:57 - then we're going to wait a 0.1 second
02:59 - and then we're going to reset the player
03:00 - so
03:01 - 0.1 seconds reset the player
03:06 - and then we're going to broadcast start
03:08 - game
03:11 - start game right there okay
03:15 - so now we're done with this um we need a
03:18 - for this to receive die so i forgot to
03:19 - zoom in a little bit so now i zoomed in
03:21 - so you have a better
03:22 - look at it now so now we're going to do
03:25 - something else we're going to receive
03:26 - so when i receive dye
03:29 - when i receive dye we're gonna set the g
03:32 - is player dead to yes so she
03:37 - is player dead yes okay
03:42 - so now i think we can move on to the
03:44 - spikes
03:45 - let's go to the spikes so for the spikes
03:49 - we can add some more spikes for each
03:51 - level actually no let's work on the
03:52 - green flag
03:53 - first before we do the spikes but now
03:57 - as you can see when you touch the spikes
04:00 - you go back to the beginning
04:02 - as you can see so yeah now the spikes
04:05 - can actually kill you
04:07 - so yeah let's go into the green flag and
04:10 - work on the green plugins
04:11 - now okay so for a green flag we're gonna
04:14 - make
04:14 - some of the similar code as the spikes
04:16 - so we're just gonna drag and drop the
04:18 - place clone at xy
04:19 - just drag and drop that to the green
04:21 - flag
04:23 - and then in the green flag we can also
04:25 - drag and drop
04:26 - this when i start as a clone
04:30 - into here we can also drag and drop this
04:34 - as well and this of course we're gonna
04:38 - have to change some of the code up
04:40 - okay so as you can see now we have this
04:44 - we can take this out because we're gonna
04:46 - work we have to do different x and y
04:47 - positions
04:49 - so let's start coding in this block this
04:52 - is the block in particular we're gonna
04:53 - code for now
04:54 - so we're giving you a forever loop so i
04:56 - did this
04:57 - in the costumes where i made two green
04:59 - flags so what i did
05:01 - is i used the converted to bitmap cut it
05:04 - like that and after cutting it i flipped
05:07 - it horizon
05:08 - vertical and then i made two um
05:12 - uh costumes so then it looks like it's
05:14 - uh
05:15 - waving the flag is waving around so
05:17 - that's what i did so we're gonna
05:19 - do forever next costume
05:22 - and then we're gonna wait 0.2 seconds so
05:25 - if you do not have this you can
05:26 - either download one from online or you
05:28 - can just get it from our google drive
05:30 - in the description uh below or you can
05:33 - make your own if you'd like
05:35 - so this is the moving the flag waving or
05:38 - whatever
05:39 - and then in the beginning we actually
05:41 - want to hide this thing so when green
05:43 - flag
05:44 - clicked we want to hide okay i forgot to
05:47 - zoom in again
05:48 - but now you have clear look at this
05:51 - we're gonna
05:52 - put this right here i'm gonna hide
05:56 - okay and now we're gonna position this
05:59 - somewhere else so let's go to the setup
06:00 - code right here so we're gonna get an if
06:02 - then statement
06:03 - if level is equal to one
06:07 - so if the variable level is equal to one
06:11 - then i'm going to place a clone like
06:13 - right here you can drag and
06:15 - drag the flag wherever you want it to be
06:17 - maybe right here
06:19 - so i'm going to get these positions so
06:21 - place clone at
06:22 - um 208
06:26 - and negative 107. so those are the two
06:30 - um positions i have
06:34 - so yeah you can do any place you would
06:36 - like but i just like dragged it
06:38 - somewhere
06:38 - on the right side okay
06:42 - so now for the player now you can see it
06:45 - and i forgot to do one thing so before
06:48 - we um
06:49 - end the uh before we try it out i
06:51 - actually tried it out
06:52 - and there's above right here so you can
06:54 - put the hide and set the x
06:56 - to negative 99999 so you want to move
06:58 - the original green flag off of the
07:00 - screen so
07:01 - x to negative
07:04 - something like that okay
07:07 - [Music]
07:08 - so there you go let's try it out as you
07:10 - can see the flag
07:11 - looks pretty good when you hit spikes
07:13 - you die
07:14 - obviously and when you touch the flag
07:16 - you advance in the next level
07:19 - of course the um spikes are not done yet
07:22 - because on the next level
07:24 - we have like some of this but the spikes
07:26 - are still there because we didn't change
07:27 - the position
07:29 - so we're going to do that and um for the
07:31 - next level what i did was just like
07:34 - some of this just a tree i got a tree
07:37 - from the sprite library
07:38 - and i put a platform and and we put some
07:42 - of these
07:42 - things in the description so like you
07:44 - can download them if you'd like
07:45 - so let's go back to the spikes let's go
07:49 - to the code
07:50 - and then for the spikes we also have to
07:53 - do the same thing
07:55 - we have to hide and set the x
07:59 - to negative 99999
08:04 - okay something like that okay and then
08:07 - for level two we're gonna
08:08 - probably place the spikes maybe right
08:11 - here
08:13 - um this is just a random thing i just
08:15 - did
08:16 - um i didn't actually do this in the
08:18 - actual thing i don't think
08:20 - i'm just going to do it because why not
08:22 - so let's just do that
08:24 - so we're going gonna duplicate this put
08:26 - that so this is gonna be level two we're
08:28 - working on level two now
08:29 - so when level is equal to two we're
08:32 - gonna place a clone at wherever this
08:34 - place is
08:34 - 138 and then 44.
08:38 - as you can see right here
08:42 - oops add an extra four okay so this is
08:45 - the spikes
08:48 - and then we can also add the green flag
08:50 - at the end so we're gonna show the green
08:51 - flag
08:52 - so i'm going to give you one last look
08:54 - at this just did that
08:57 - and let's go to the green flag and then
08:59 - we showed it so that we can move it
09:01 - uh probably put it like right here okay
09:05 - so i'm gonna put it right there you guys
09:07 - can put it wherever you want
09:08 - whatever levels you want so i'm just
09:11 - going to move this
09:12 - duplicate this code put that right under
09:15 - put that right there so if the level is
09:17 - equal to 2
09:18 - we're going to go to 212 53
09:24 - okay so now let's try it out so save it
09:29 - play it so as you can see let's go to
09:32 - the next level
09:34 - as you can see the spikes are there and
09:37 - then the next loop
09:38 - so we we just have to keep on adding
09:40 - green flags on each level so as you can
09:42 - see the spikes are not there anymore
09:43 - because
09:44 - it's not the same level we didn't code
09:46 - it so yeah
09:47 - that's what we have for now and um let's
09:49 - work on the snowflakes like the snow
09:52 - thing so now let's work on that okay so
09:55 - for the snow we're going to
09:56 - make another variable we're going to
09:58 - name it g with global
10:00 - wind so what this does is like so like
10:04 - we can like change the direction
10:05 - of the snow so we're going to get a one
10:08 - green flag clicked
10:10 - zoom in a little forever loop
10:14 - set the uh g wind to pick random
10:18 - negative one to one
10:21 - uh g win
10:25 - right there so then we're going to pick
10:26 - random we're going to set it to pick
10:28 - around either
10:28 - negative one or one so what g wind is
10:31 - like
10:32 - just to change the x position of the
10:34 - snow and then we're gonna get another
10:36 - one green flag clicked
10:39 - so we're gonna set the ghost effect to
10:41 - 100 in the beginning
10:43 - and then we're going to start making
10:44 - clones after that so we're going to set
10:46 - the ghost effect
10:49 - goes to 100
10:52 - and then we're going to go to like
10:54 - negative 240 y 240 like in the top left
10:57 - corner
10:58 - that's what we want to do so we're going
11:00 - to set 240
11:04 - somewhere in the top left corner and
11:06 - after that we're going to get a forever
11:07 - loop
11:08 - you can like do anything that's in the
11:10 - top left corner
11:11 - we're going to forever loop uh create
11:14 - clone of myself so we played with the
11:15 - numbers a little bit
11:17 - so we want to wait a couple seconds like
11:21 - 0.005 so like this is the perfect amount
11:23 - i found
11:24 - is 0.005 seconds to 0.01
11:30 - so this is like um how many the delay
11:33 - of how many clones will spawn so like we
11:36 - just put a little bit delay
11:38 - so it looks cool okay let's save it and
11:40 - then let's get go to control
11:42 - and then we're gonna get uh when i
11:44 - started clone
11:46 - okay so now we're gonna start coding for
11:48 - the when i started clone
11:50 - so we can also make the uh snowflakes
11:53 - random colors so we're gonna set the
11:56 - size
11:57 - [Music]
11:58 - set size to pick random
12:03 - let's say uh
12:05 - [Music]
12:06 - 60 70 to 90 let's do something like that
12:10 - pick random from 70 to 90. i'm just
12:13 - making up some numbers right now
12:14 - you can do any number you would like and
12:17 - then we're gonna go to
12:19 - oh yeah and by the way the snow is in
12:21 - the description below
12:22 - and if it's just like a circle small
12:25 - circle i drew
12:27 - that's what it is and then uh we're
12:29 - gonna go to
12:32 - pick random duplicate that negative
12:35 - 240 240 so in the beginning you want to
12:38 - go there
12:39 - pick random negative 240 for the x
12:42 - position to 240. so it'll just either
12:44 - spawn from this corner
12:45 - or this corner and then the y is going
12:47 - to be 220. so it'll be on the top
12:49 - like right here and then we're gonna get
12:52 - a repeat loop
12:53 - repeat four times
12:56 - that's what i did so like it'll just
12:58 - keep on ghost effect as it keeps on
13:00 - going down
13:01 - so we're gonna change the ghost effect
13:02 - by negative 20 every time so
13:04 - we're gonna change ghost effect
13:08 - by negative 20 every time
13:11 - and we're gonna get another repeat
13:14 - repeat two times and then we're gonna
13:17 - change the y by negative five so it just
13:20 - keeps on constantly going down
13:22 - change y by negative five
13:27 - and then and then we're going to change
13:28 - the x by the g win which is
13:30 - right now defined as negative one to one
13:32 - so
13:33 - you just keep on moving so the wind can
13:35 - either push it to
13:36 - one or negative one it's like it's like
13:40 - it looks cooler it makes the wind blow
13:42 - in one direction
13:43 - so we're gonna do a change x
13:47 - change x by the
13:50 - p when put that in there
13:53 - and after that we're going to get a
13:54 - repeat until loop it's like what this
13:56 - is doing um when it's touching
14:00 - a repeat until touching any of these
14:02 - obstacles so we're gonna get a repeat
14:04 - repeat loop repeat until loop
14:07 - sorry and then we're gonna um repeat
14:09 - until it's touching
14:10 - any of these and then we're gonna change
14:13 - y by negative five
14:14 - and change the x by g when that's what
14:16 - we're going to do
14:18 - so we're going to do that real quick so
14:21 - and when it touches the things it's
14:23 - supposed to disappear
14:25 - so we're going to do we need a bunch of
14:28 - ores so
14:30 - or we're just going to put a bunch of
14:32 - oars in here
14:33 - so it has to touch all of these that's
14:36 - why we need a lot of ores
14:37 - how many do we need one two three four
14:39 - five so we need five because
14:41 - counting the edge we have the green flag
14:45 - the player the main character the spikes
14:49 - the ground and the edge
14:52 - and we can add the trampoline as well
14:53 - but we're not working with the
14:55 - trampoline yet
14:56 - we can still add it so we're gonna if
14:58 - touching
15:00 - main touching i know this is a bit
15:04 - long of a piece of code uh
15:07 - edge touching
15:11 - the green flag
15:15 - touching
15:19 - ground touching
15:24 - spikes and touching trampoline so like
15:26 - you can do something like this
15:29 - okay so like we just put a bunch of ores
15:31 - and all of them into the repeat and so
15:34 - so we're gonna change the y by negative
15:38 - five
15:40 - and then after that we're going to
15:41 - change the x by the g
15:43 - wind duplicate that
15:46 - and then we're going to repeat 10 times
15:49 - if not touching whites like if it's not
15:52 - touching white
15:52 - then we're going to change the y by
15:54 - negative 2 and then we're going to
15:55 - change the x by g
15:56 - when divided by 2.5 like some so just
15:59 - make a little variety to the wind
16:01 - of the way the snow blows so it's going
16:04 - to be a little bit cooler
16:06 - if not touching
16:11 - touching the color white so
16:14 - white just do this something like that
16:17 - like that
16:19 - touching white then we're going to
16:20 - change the y by negative 2
16:23 - change y negative 2 and then we're going
16:27 - to change the
16:27 - x duplicate that change the x we need
16:31 - division sign
16:32 - division g when divided by 2.5
16:37 - okay and then we're going to change the
16:38 - ghost effect by 10 so like when it
16:40 - touches something
16:41 - it just goes away change ghost effect by
16:44 - 10
16:47 - put that right there oops
16:51 - ghost effect by 10
16:54 - and then delete this clone once it
16:56 - touches something i'll just
16:57 - ghost and delete it okay
17:01 - so now let's save it and play
17:04 - so as you can see there's snow coming
17:05 - down and when it touches the
17:08 - player it just disappears it just goes
17:10 - away
17:11 - as you can see that's pretty cool snow
17:15 - so yeah we have level one and level two
17:18 - finished
17:19 - so yeah it's a pretty cool tutorial uh
17:22 - pretty cool
17:23 - snow and i think that'll be do it for
17:25 - this tutorial
17:27 - so if you guys enjoyed be sure to leave
17:28 - a like on this video and subscribe
17:31 - and i'll see you guys in the next video
17:34 - [Music]
17:42 - bye
