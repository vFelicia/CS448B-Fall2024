00:27 - hello guys welcome back to kids calling
00:29 - playground we i haven't done a video in
00:31 - a while been pretty busy but i thought
00:33 - of finishing this uh ninja platformer
00:35 - game
00:36 - what we had last time so we have done
00:38 - number three up to part three where we
00:40 - can make the ninja fly and
00:43 - attack the enemy but now we're going to
00:45 - work on the ninja getting attacked by
00:47 - the medusa and can die and also moving
00:50 - to the next stage okay all right so
00:52 - let's start so
00:54 - go to your main character
00:56 - so last time we had this message called
00:59 - check player position so we're going to
01:00 - start coding that
01:02 - so we're going to say when
01:04 - i receive check player position
01:07 - so what we're going to do is we're going
01:08 - to throw in the forever loop in here let
01:11 - me zoom in
01:13 - all right
01:14 - so this part we're going to get some
01:16 - operation here so we're going to use the
01:18 - if condition
01:20 - and then we're going to use some
01:21 - operation
01:22 - okay and then let's add one more inside
01:25 - this if and then we'll get else if
01:27 - inside okay
01:29 - all right so let's start so we're going
01:31 - to call the operation we're going to get
01:32 - in or join so what we're going to do is
01:35 - we're going to get two all join and then
01:37 - we'll get one end joint put that in the
01:39 - front
01:40 - okay all right and then we'll put this
01:42 - inside here
01:44 - uh we're gonna check
01:45 - if it's touching medusa
01:48 - okay
01:49 - so you touch medusa you can die but we
01:51 - don't want to touch medusa and die but
01:53 - if you look at the medusa we want to
01:56 - only if it touched medusa in any of this
01:58 - costume like seven eight nine ten you
02:00 - know these costumes not the dying
02:02 - costumes so if the ninja hit the medusa
02:05 - medusa is dying it should not be getting
02:07 - killed only if the medusa is walking
02:09 - we're getting if the ninja hits it then
02:11 - you can die right so that's why so let's
02:14 - go back
02:15 - to here so here what we're going to do
02:17 - is uh we're going to use the sensing
02:19 - block here
02:21 - and then we're going to use the all
02:22 - operator greater than so you're touching
02:25 - medusa and
02:28 - the costume
02:30 - number of the medusa is greater than six
02:32 - okay
02:34 - dump that in here and then for the or
02:37 - here what we're going to do is um
02:40 - if it's touching the spike
02:43 - then ninja can also die
02:45 - or
02:46 - you can get the y position so basically
02:49 - if the ninja falls off the
02:51 - the land
02:52 - like the land block it fall off and fall
02:54 - into the water you can die so we're
02:56 - going to say
02:57 - the y position
03:00 - so y position
03:03 - is less than negative 150 okay
03:07 - all right so let's go back let's zoom
03:09 - back out a little bit i guess so you can
03:11 - see
03:12 - okay here what we're going to do is
03:14 - we're going to broadcast
03:15 - a
03:16 - message so uh broadcast
03:21 - message uh click on new message
03:24 - and then say die
03:26 - okay
03:28 - and then here we're gonna check the
03:30 - portal
03:31 - so the ninja touched the portal we're
03:33 - going to move to the next stage
03:35 - so portal is this okay so
03:38 - and we want to only move the next stage
03:42 - if the portal is less than
03:45 - 10 so because i have 10 costume here so
03:48 - you see i have 10 costume so at the very
03:51 - end at the last costume sorry
03:53 - accidentally created one
03:55 - one more here
03:57 - at the very end of the last costume i
03:59 - say you win right so we don't need to
04:01 - move anymore so only up to the
04:05 - uh
04:06 - 9 costume on the ground
04:08 - the level then we're going to increase
04:10 - so
04:12 - we're going to use operator here
04:14 - and then we're going to say less than 10
04:16 - so
04:17 - we're going to use the level
04:20 - so the level is less than 10 we're going
04:22 - to increase it so change
04:25 - level
04:27 - by one okay
04:29 - and then
04:31 - here we're gonna broadcast
04:33 - a new message
04:35 - okay
04:36 - saying uh start
04:39 - new i think we might have this already i
04:42 - don't know i think we might have it
04:44 - already and cancel let me see if i have
04:46 - start new level
04:48 - no i don't have it yes i do yeah start
04:50 - new level right yeah just select that
04:52 - sorry about that and then the other one
04:55 - we want to we'll get to the end we're
04:57 - going to say
04:58 - you know u1
05:00 - okay
05:02 - all right
05:03 - okay
05:04 - so start new level so we're going to get
05:07 - this
05:08 - i'm going to say
05:09 - start new level
05:11 - so for start new level we're gonna reset
05:13 - it
05:16 - and then we are going to uh broadcast a
05:18 - message
05:22 - it's called start game okay
05:25 - and then we're gonna do the uh
05:28 - uh die so when we broadcast die we're
05:30 - gonna do something as well
05:32 - i'm gonna say die
05:34 - we're gonna set the
05:38 - the player is dead to true so that you
05:41 - know will not do
05:43 - anything not allowed to play the jump
05:45 - anymore and then we're going to say stop
05:48 - um
05:50 - other script in the sprite
05:53 - okay stop by the script in the sprite
05:55 - okay now let's move on to the ninja and
05:57 - then we'll come back to the main
05:58 - character so in the ninja we're gonna
06:00 - code the dying animation so we're gonna
06:03 - say
06:04 - when i receive
06:08 - uh die
06:09 - okay
06:10 - so here we're going to stop other script
06:13 - i don't want other thing to move
06:15 - so stop other script in the sprite and
06:18 - then we're going to play the sound
06:21 - uh place down until done so basically
06:23 - this is the library sound that we had
06:26 - with the alien alien making quick sound
06:28 - that's in the uh
06:30 - scratch library okay so you can use that
06:32 - so now we're going to say change the
06:35 - depth by one
06:38 - and then we're gonna
06:39 - set
06:40 - the custom index
06:43 - to one
06:44 - and then we're gonna switch to the
06:46 - custom index to
06:48 - switch the custom to that zero
06:51 - so that's zero so you can see i have
06:53 - that zero one you can see it's falling
06:55 - down down so let that zero to
06:58 - that number
07:00 - nine right so from zero to nine that is
07:03 - actually ten times right so but since we
07:06 - already used the first one we only need
07:07 - to loop nine times so
07:09 - let's go here put repeat
07:12 - nine time
07:14 - and then we're gonna switch the costume
07:17 - say switch costume and then we're going
07:19 - to use the join operation
07:22 - and we are going to put the d and then
07:24 - we're going to put the variable
07:26 - the custom index here so we're gonna
07:29 - call d1234 until d9 okay
07:33 - and then we're gonna change the
07:35 - custom index by one
07:37 - not set oops
07:39 - change
07:40 - custom index like one so we'll move to
07:42 - the next one okay and then after that
07:45 - we're gonna broadcast a new message
07:48 - uh we're gonna say um
07:51 - that
07:53 - animation done okay
07:56 - so we're going to come back to the main
07:58 - character so we're going to reset
08:00 - everything when the dead animation is
08:01 - done
08:02 - i'm going to say when i receive
08:04 - that animation done
08:06 - i'm going to do a little bit of weight
08:09 - 0.1 second and then we're gonna reset
08:14 - and then call the start game
08:16 - okay so let's try it out
08:18 - okay all right so you can see if i touch
08:21 - the ninja i mean ninja touch the uh the
08:25 - meduza
08:26 - you can die right okay but if i let's
08:29 - say if i kill the
08:32 - medusa i walk by see i don't die right
08:34 - because the ninja only dies when we get
08:37 - hit by when the medusa is actually
08:38 - moving not when it's done
08:41 - okay
08:42 - all right so let's go back let's put the
08:44 - ground back to one so we're gonna start
08:46 - moving the net level okay all right
08:50 - okay so when the ground level so when we
08:53 - say green flag is clicked
08:55 - we're gonna start
08:56 - creating this we're gonna set it to zero
08:58 - zero
09:00 - and then we're gonna use the forever
09:02 - loop
09:04 - and we're gonna say level
09:09 - i'm going to use if condition here sorry
09:13 - so if condition
09:15 - so the level is less than
09:17 - 11 because my level only up to 10 right
09:19 - so if level is less than 11
09:22 - then we're gonna switch the level so
09:24 - whatever level was uh change we're gonna
09:27 - switch it to that level okay so switch
09:29 - costume to
09:32 - the
09:33 - level
09:34 - okay
09:35 - all right so that is done for the level
09:37 - so similar thing we'll do it for the
09:39 - virtual ground so we're going to just
09:42 - copy
09:43 - kind of move it drag it here so now we
09:45 - have it here so on the virtual ground
09:48 - same thing but we are going to make it
09:50 - like a ghost effect
09:52 - and then we're going to kind of hide so
09:54 - we're going to say um set the ghost
09:56 - effect
09:57 - not high but set it like clear color
10:00 - kind of thing so set
10:02 - goes effect to 100 so that you can see
10:06 - it
10:07 - and then we have to do is show so that
10:09 - we can get detection and then we'll put
10:11 - this in okay
10:13 - all right so we have that done so now
10:16 - we're gonna move on to the crate so what
10:18 - we're going to do is we're going to make
10:20 - the
10:20 - gym after the ninja breaks the crate
10:23 - you can open the open the gym box kind
10:26 - of thing right
10:29 - okay so in the crate we're going to
10:31 - start with
10:33 - when i receive
10:36 - start new level
10:39 - okay so when i receive start a new level
10:42 - i am going to go to front layer
10:47 - and then switch costume i think my
10:49 - create a different costume so it can be
10:51 - this this or this okay so we're gonna
10:54 - switch your costume a random costume
10:56 - so switch costume
10:59 - pick random one two three because i have
11:01 - three costumes sorry three
11:03 - okay so you can put anywhere you want i
11:06 - think uh earlier we created one code for
11:09 - detecting the position in the main
11:11 - character i think
11:13 - see this m key right so let's say i want
11:16 - to put this flower thing here i can say
11:18 - m so it gives you the position 0 92 so
11:21 - you can put it at that and then you can
11:22 - just kind of adjust it as you want okay
11:25 - so let's say so for the first one let's
11:27 - say i want to put the crate over here
11:28 - around this this area right
11:31 - negative 36 83 it might be good it might
11:34 - not be good let's just see okay so now
11:37 - what we can do is hey
11:39 - if it's level one so i can say if
11:43 - and then we're going to use the operator
11:45 - here
11:46 - say equal
11:48 - right and then we're going to use the
11:49 - level
11:50 - if we go to level one let's say i put it
11:52 - this 30 negative 36 and negative 83
11:55 - right so let's see if that works well if
11:58 - it doesn't work well we can adjust it
11:59 - always okay so we're going to say go to
12:04 - um
12:06 - negative 36
12:07 - and negative 83
12:10 - so now let's see if we start the game
12:12 - let's see level one this box should show
12:15 - you see the box is kind of too high
12:16 - right so we're gonna make it move down a
12:19 - little bit right so we don't want it to
12:20 - be too high so what we can do is hey
12:23 - let's change it to negative 10 negative
12:26 - 93 so let's see how it looks so let's
12:28 - start again so you can see uh 92 is
12:30 - pretty good it's kind of on the ground
12:32 - so that's good so we can see we can
12:34 - attack the the crate but the crate is
12:37 - not breaking right now right we want to
12:39 - break the crate once the ninja attacks
12:41 - it so we can get the gym and we can open
12:43 - a portal right all right
12:46 - so whatever you want you can go like
12:48 - level two so you can just switch the map
12:51 - to let's say level two
12:53 - you can say hey where i want to put
12:54 - level two
12:56 - item i can put them let's say right here
12:58 - or something right you can do that so
12:59 - you put them right here you can see oh
13:02 - the crate is um at this position right
13:05 - next uh 133 and then three you can see
13:08 - that right so you can copy that and put
13:09 - it there
13:10 - right something like that
13:13 - so if you want to do that then then say
13:15 - level two you move your crate here you
13:16 - can see
13:17 - uh 133 right
13:20 - and then we'll change this to level two
13:23 - and then
13:24 - and then here the y will be like
13:25 - negative three right
13:27 - right
13:28 - okay so just that's what i'm saying you
13:30 - can put it anywhere you want right so
13:32 - that's kind of like that and you can do
13:34 - it all the way until you know level 10.
13:37 - okay
13:38 - and then after that we want to say show
13:40 - so i'm gonna only code two
13:43 - and you're gonna say show
13:45 - okay
13:46 - after that after you say show uh what
13:49 - you're going to do is you're going to
13:51 - check uh wait until the ninja attacks
13:53 - the crate and then we're going to break
13:54 - it so we're going to say um
13:57 - there's a thing called wait until
13:59 - so you can say wait until and then we
14:02 - can use a
14:04 - or condition here
14:07 - and then we're going to put one end
14:08 - condition in the front so what we're
14:10 - going to do is we're going to allow the
14:11 - canine to break it if that can i touch
14:14 - it okay so touching
14:17 - goodnight
14:18 - where's that little knife yeah right
14:20 - here oop
14:22 - okay goodnight which is this little
14:24 - knife okay if we touch this knife then
14:26 - we can break it
14:27 - or
14:28 - you know if it's
14:30 - uh touching the ninja
14:34 - but this time we have to check the
14:36 - costume of the ninja so if you see the
14:38 - custom of the ninja look at us i put all
14:41 - the attack costume at the very end so
14:44 - basically any of this attack costume so
14:47 - greater than 52
14:49 - then is attack costume so any of this
14:51 - costume hits the crate you're gonna
14:53 - attack that okay so we can say go back
14:57 - to the box
14:59 - okay and we're gonna say custom number
15:02 - so we're gonna use a greater than
15:06 - right i think it was 52
15:08 - something like that
15:11 - let's check again that thing is 52 right
15:13 - the costume
15:16 - okay so
15:17 - 52 is this standing okay so 53 so
15:21 - greater than 52 yeah so
15:23 - so we can say greater than 52 so it's
15:26 - greater than 52 the costume index
15:29 - so we're going to say
15:32 - uh select this select the costume the
15:34 - ninja and then custom number okay so
15:36 - costume number greater than
15:39 - 52
15:40 - we are going to play the sound
15:45 - okay play the sound
15:47 - crunch i think the the sound basically
15:49 - this down okay
15:51 - so basically it's like a sound that the
15:53 - crate got broken okay and then we're
15:55 - gonna say hi
15:58 - and then we're gonna
16:00 - uh broadcast a message
16:02 - say
16:03 - new message
16:05 - say
16:06 - create
16:09 - broken okay
16:11 - so when the crate broken then we're
16:12 - gonna show the gym so let's go to the
16:14 - gym
16:15 - so let's work on that
16:17 - so in the gym
16:19 - when i say when green flag is clicked
16:21 - we're gonna hide it so we're not gonna
16:24 - show the gem in the beginning
16:26 - okay
16:27 - and then we're gonna clear the graphics
16:29 - effect so we're gonna make the gym kind
16:31 - of flashing
16:32 - and then um
16:35 - so when we say uh forever
16:38 - i'm gonna use the forever control here
16:41 - we're gonna say
16:42 - uh change color effect by 25
16:46 - and then we're gonna have the if
16:48 - condition
16:50 - i'm gonna go sensing
16:53 - so if it's touching the ninja
16:56 - i'm gonna play the sound
17:00 - okay start the sound fairy dust so far
17:02 - it does is like a bling sound like that
17:05 - okay
17:06 - so and then we're gonna say um
17:08 - use the think
17:12 - and then we can put it here say
17:15 - gym
17:17 - obtain
17:19 - okay
17:20 - and we're gonna do it for one second
17:23 - and then after that we're going to hide
17:25 - the gym
17:26 - and
17:27 - and then we're gonna broadcast a message
17:32 - okay
17:33 - uh new message
17:37 - say gemma thing
17:41 - okay
17:42 - and then we can create a portal after
17:43 - that okay so and then we're gonna put
17:46 - this saying um
17:48 - if the crate is broken
17:50 - where's the crate broken yeah crate is
17:52 - broken i'm gonna go to
17:56 - uh
17:57 - go to the front layer
17:59 - okay
18:00 - and then we're gonna show
18:04 - and then when we start a new level
18:10 - a new level
18:13 - uh we are going to hide it
18:15 - so we're not going to show it
18:17 - and we're going to wait one second
18:21 - then we're going to go to crate so we're
18:23 - going to make sure the crate got set up
18:24 - first and then i'm going to go to create
18:27 - so the gym will go to wherever the crate
18:29 - set up so we don't need to worry about
18:31 - setting the gym okay so we only have to
18:33 - worry about setting the crate so
18:34 - whatever the position the crate goes to
18:37 - that is where the gym is gonna go okay
18:39 - all right so let's work on the portal so
18:42 - the portal is pretty simple too so
18:44 - portal right here so we have um
18:47 - when green black is clicked
18:50 - so for the portal
18:52 - we are going to hide it
18:57 - hi
18:59 - and then go to the front layer
19:02 - okay
19:05 - okay so after that when we say
19:09 - when i start as a new level
19:14 - uh we're going to hide this as well
19:17 - don't want to show it
19:18 - and then we say when we get the gym
19:25 - uh up gym obtain
19:27 - okay
19:28 - and then we're gonna put anywhere so
19:30 - let's say level one
19:32 - let's say our custom let's go back to
19:34 - level one let's say after the uh you
19:36 - break the crate we want to put the
19:37 - portal here we can make the portal show
19:40 - up and then let's say we moved it here
19:43 - and you can see the position 198 76
19:47 - right something like that so you can add
19:49 - that so just same thing like we did for
19:52 - the crate kind of thing so you're going
19:54 - to say um if
19:56 - right
19:58 - we're going to use the operator i'll say
20:00 - equal
20:01 - and then go to level let's say level so
20:04 - level equal to one let's say we want to
20:05 - put it here and this position 189
20:09 - 76
20:10 - then you can put that say go to
20:14 - 189.76 right so
20:17 - and then let's say we go to level two
20:20 - so let's say we go to level two and we
20:22 - want to put a different location so
20:24 - let's go to level two we'll switch the
20:26 - costume to level two so let's say level
20:28 - two i wanna put the
20:31 - portal right here so you can see is
20:33 - 194.85 right so in level 2 we're going
20:36 - to put
20:37 - negative 194
20:40 - and then
20:42 - negative 85 right
20:45 - okay so now let's just check it out so
20:48 - let's start the game
20:49 - so you can see the crate is where we
20:51 - want it right so if i break this crate
20:53 - so you can see the gym
20:55 - so once i get the gym
20:58 - you see the portal is going to show up
21:00 - portal didn't show up correctly oh i
21:02 - think i made a mistake let me check
21:04 - okay i think i messed up i forgot to
21:06 - finish the code we only put the port
21:08 - away we haven't show it so we're gonna
21:10 - have to do that
21:12 - so show
21:14 - put that in and then with the portal we
21:16 - have different costumes so you can see
21:18 - that different costumes so we can make
21:19 - it turn so what we can do is
21:23 - we're gonna say um
21:24 - forever
21:28 - here and then inside of forever i'm
21:30 - going to use another repeat uh 24 times
21:34 - and then we're going to go next costume
21:37 - so because i did 24 time because this
21:40 - guy has 24 costume see
21:43 - okay all right so let's save it again
21:46 - let's try it out
21:48 - okay
21:49 - let's start
21:50 - so let's let me destroy the uh
21:53 - the
21:55 - reducer so you can see the portal goes
21:57 - where we want so once we go to the
21:59 - portals it goes to the next level so now
22:02 - the crate is on the top so let's say i
22:04 - want to destroy the the crate on the top
22:07 - so let me move up
22:08 - let's uh
22:12 - so i can also use the
22:14 - sword to destroy that so you can see the
22:17 - portal went down right so if i move here
22:19 - it goes to the third level but the third
22:21 - level i didn't set anything right that's
22:22 - why this flower's here right so also
22:25 - this one if i jump off
22:27 - right you can see it died right
22:31 - so there's a a little lag right you can
22:33 - see a little lag like he's kind of stuck
22:35 - here so because we use the
22:37 - use the uh sound right when when it die
22:40 - we play until done right so you don't
22:42 - want to do that you can say
22:44 - just say uh start sound right so that
22:47 - way it will have not no lag we don't
22:49 - have to wait for this sound to be done
22:51 - so this will be a little bit faster
22:52 - right so let's let's try again so
22:56 - so let me get back to the third level
22:59 - right
23:00 - okay
23:01 - so second level
23:04 - okay
23:06 - okay okay
23:08 - come on so now let's see
23:10 - see it died immediately right because we
23:12 - did not have to wait for the uh sound to
23:15 - be done you see that looks a little bit
23:16 - better so you can do that so this is
23:18 - pretty much right in
23:20 - so
23:21 - the spike i think is a very similar to
23:23 - the uh to the crate and all that you can
23:26 - do it yourself probably so at the very
23:28 - end you can make it win
23:30 - or maybe i can do the spike i think that
23:32 - one is clone so maybe i can show you
23:34 - guys for that
23:37 - so for the spike if you're just using
23:39 - only one spike at one level then it
23:41 - doesn't really matter you can do it like
23:42 - the crate but if you want to use a spike
23:44 - with like clone then like you can put
23:47 - multiple spiked and you have to do
23:48 - something with clone so if you want to
23:50 - do that then let me kind of show you
23:52 - real quick we'll make a block
23:55 - we're going to call it a place
23:58 - clone
24:00 - at okay so this one will place the clone
24:03 - wherever we want
24:04 - we're going to put a two variable okay
24:08 - we're going to call it x and y
24:11 - and then check this one run without
24:12 - refresh
24:13 - okay and this one what we're going to do
24:16 - is we're going to say go to
24:18 - i'll grab the x grab the y
24:21 - and then
24:22 - call the
24:23 - creator clone myself
24:25 - okay
24:26 - and then what we can do is when green
24:29 - flag is clicked
24:31 - we can hide it
24:33 - okay
24:35 - and then
24:36 - when we start a new level
24:40 - uh new level
24:43 - we're gonna delete the clone
24:46 - it's okay
24:49 - and then when i start as a clone and
24:51 - then i will show so when i start as a
24:53 - clone
24:54 - and then i will show
24:58 - okay
25:00 - okay
25:01 - all right and then uh when i start a new
25:03 - level
25:05 - so let's
25:06 - do that again
25:08 - so here we're going to go to front layer
25:12 - okay
25:13 - go to front layer and then we can say
25:16 - whatever level let's say
25:17 - uh level one let's go back to level one
25:20 - let's say we put some spike on the
25:22 - ground we can do that so we're gonna say
25:24 - let's say um
25:25 - i think in my original game i have like
25:27 - level seven or something like that
25:30 - so let's say we want to go let's say we
25:32 - want to put in level two or something so
25:34 - let's check allow level two what look
25:36 - little two looks like
25:38 - so let's say level two wanna put a spike
25:40 - over here right
25:43 - so what we can do is open the spike
25:45 - costume and move it around here right
25:48 - right so i think that's a little hard
25:50 - let's put the spike here let's say let's
25:52 - say for example we don't put a spike
25:54 - here but not necessary so let's say we
25:56 - put a spike here you can see the
25:57 - position of 42 or 53 right so you can
26:01 - say uh just like how we did earlier
26:03 - right
26:04 - so we're gonna say equal
26:07 - and use the level
26:09 - right
26:10 - level equal to 2
26:14 - and then we're going to say um
26:16 - you can even make it flip upside down as
26:18 - well so you can say point in
26:21 - 90 point direction 90.
26:24 - okay if you want to go upside down let's
26:26 - say you have some some land on top you
26:28 - want to put upside down you can put this
26:29 - at negative 90. so flip around
26:31 - okay so i'm going to call the place
26:34 - clone at
26:36 - right and then we're going to put the
26:38 - sound right right position 42 and 50
26:41 - negative 53 right so say 42
26:45 - negative 53. let's say we want to put
26:48 - one more here like this right
26:50 - i mean this is gonna be probably
26:52 - impossible to jump over now either like
26:54 - fly a top but i'm just giving example
26:57 - then you can just say hey negative 55
27:00 - negative 53 right so we're going to copy
27:02 - this put it over here so negative
27:05 - 55. so i'm using negative 53 just the
27:08 - same so that was same uh level right
27:11 - so you can do that
27:13 - right if you do that then let's say we
27:14 - start the game let's start it again so
27:17 - let's go to step two
27:19 - okay
27:20 - so once we go to step two
27:22 - you can see see there's two
27:24 - two clones here right so
27:26 - so in order to go through that we might
27:28 - have to fly over right
27:30 - right
27:31 - so and then we can fly it back
27:35 - so see there you go so you can you can
27:37 - do that so if you let's try if we get
27:39 - hit by the spike we should die as well
27:43 - so
27:44 - so let's go here so let's see
27:47 - we die right we jump on the spike we die
27:50 - so the depth is increasing so pretty
27:52 - simple so um i think this is pretty much
27:55 - it for the video so at the end right uh
27:58 - just at the very end you can just make
28:00 - sure that hey at the very end we can
28:02 - display the u1 right sprite so that way
28:06 - you know
28:07 - you don't have to um you don't have to
28:09 - continue the game so maybe i can just
28:11 - show you that code real quick for my
28:12 - original game
28:14 - just one second let me move the code
28:15 - over
28:16 - so as you can see um so if you want to
28:18 - put multiple a spike you can have it
28:20 - like like this right for my other game
28:22 - my original game at level seven has bike
28:25 - level a level nine
28:27 - okay and then over here you know the the
28:30 - the crate same thing right we just put
28:32 - it like this you know we have a level
28:34 - one uh level two right just wherever you
28:36 - wanna put the crate same thing
28:39 - and then the gym
28:40 - pretty much is the same the portal is
28:42 - like the crate so you can just set it at
28:45 - any any position you want right
28:48 - and then you just you know show it up so
28:50 - let's just go back to the original game
28:53 - so you see the original game i do not
28:55 - have matusa in the first level so that
28:57 - people will let them get used to it
29:00 - after they've done this so now
29:03 - so medusa is dying
29:05 - so got that and then jump into the
29:08 - portal you can see right let's go to the
29:09 - next stage
29:12 - next stage
29:13 - and go on
29:15 - so you can see
29:17 - you can also add some music right
29:21 - so add some music to your game
29:24 - and
29:26 - see
29:27 - this one
29:29 - look up
29:32 - that kill there
29:36 - so here i don't think i have any spike
29:38 - here in this one
29:40 - but you know
29:42 - so once you did that
29:44 - you can fly up here see you see the
29:46 - spike so this is level seven i think so
29:49 - you see level seven i have negative 90
29:52 - so that flip the spike upside down and
29:55 - then you can slide over i don't think
29:56 - that i did i called the slide part from
29:58 - the original game but uh pretty
30:01 - just like slide let me see if i have it
30:03 - if i knock out i'll code it just one sec
30:06 - okay so let me go to the original game
30:10 - okay so let me go see this yeah i think
30:13 - i do have it so the slide does yeah it
30:15 - does have it see
30:17 - slide is there so i think it's fine okay
30:19 - so i hope you guys understand this game
30:21 - okay so at the very end uh where we win
30:24 - right you can just show the costume so
30:27 - when you say u1 right where we have the
30:30 - u1 costume i mean you want broadcast
30:32 - message from the main character
30:34 - so when we say you won you can just at
30:37 - the very end say hey you want show this
30:39 - that's it stop the game so i hope you
30:41 - guys enjoy the video thanks see you guys
30:43 - next time bye
30:46 - [Music]
30:55 - you
