00:09 - hello
00:09 - guys welcome back to
00:10 - kidscoolingplayground so
00:12 - today i was looking at the kidscooling
00:15 - playground studio
00:16 - and i saw this game as a clicker game uh
00:19 - done by this person here and i was
00:21 - thinking about making a script uh to do
00:24 - the auto click
00:25 - for me and uh i thought of doing that so
00:28 - i thought that was pretty cool
00:30 - i'll see if i can do that so i was
00:31 - looking at that earlier
00:33 - and i found that using python is
00:35 - actually really easy to do this so i can
00:38 - show you guys how to do that
00:39 - you probably can do it with javascript
00:41 - as well but since our channel we have
00:43 - some python
00:44 - tutorial done making it the uh you know
00:46 - the python tutorial for it
00:48 - so if you look over here let me go
00:50 - inside the game i'll show you how it
00:51 - looks like
00:52 - so the game looks like this uh so when
00:56 - you run it
00:57 - and then every time you click you get
00:59 - one point right and then after you click
01:01 - after some time you can
01:03 - buy something here to make it more click
01:05 - so one click you get like double the
01:07 - click
01:07 - and ten times the click 100 click so
01:10 - every time you click you get more points
01:12 - right so uh you don't want to click on
01:14 - this all day right so how can we do a
01:16 - script or something like that that will
01:18 - help us click this
01:20 - and you can get more points so i thought
01:21 - of um trying that so
01:23 - in order to do that you can uh you can
01:26 - go to uh python.org here
01:29 - dot download from here you can go to
01:32 - download and then download the latest
01:33 - version of python
01:35 - okay for your window or your mac or
01:37 - whatever okay after you
01:39 - download this you can install it
01:43 - okay so when you launch the launcher
01:45 - right for installation it'll come up
01:46 - like this
01:47 - make sure you add this one select this
01:49 - one say add python
01:52 - to the path basically if you once you've
01:54 - done that it will add it and then you
01:56 - can run python anywhere
01:57 - okay so i'm not going to install it
01:59 - because i already have it
02:00 - installed so i can cancel this okay
02:04 - and then you can go to like a window
02:06 - open up your uh command
02:08 - uh you know command prompt so just say
02:11 - run cmd you type cmd will come up with
02:14 - something like this
02:15 - just click on that you get this black
02:17 - screen and then you can go to your
02:19 - directory so you can like change
02:21 - directory right
02:22 - so cd path the directory so now you're
02:26 - on this directory i'm already on here
02:27 - but i'm just showing you so you can type
02:28 - change directory to go here
02:30 - and then what you can do is uh you can
02:32 - type it if you make sure your python
02:33 - works you can type python dash dash
02:36 - version
02:37 - so as you can see i have an older
02:38 - version of python 3.7.3
02:41 - okay so once you've done that what you
02:44 - have to do next is you have to type in
02:46 - this command
02:48 - pip three install
02:51 - okay let me move my mouse so you guys
02:53 - can see and you can say py
02:56 - auto gui so this will actually help you
02:59 - to uh
03:00 - help help you to control the uh the gui
03:04 - basically the graphics user interface
03:06 - using python so you
03:08 - type this command and you type install
03:10 - it will take like maybe
03:11 - like a minute or two to install the
03:13 - package for python so i'm not going to
03:15 - do that because i already have it
03:17 - so if you have not if you do it for the
03:20 - first time you do it okay
03:22 - so after that you go to your folder
03:23 - wherever you want and then you can just
03:25 - create a
03:26 - new file a text file and you can say
03:29 - let's say auto
03:30 - clicker and then you can change the
03:33 - extension to
03:34 - dot p y okay so you say yes
03:37 - so you see my icons a little bit
03:39 - different because i have a
03:40 - pycharm installed don't worry about that
03:42 - you know might look like
03:43 - some file right doesn't matter so we're
03:46 - not gonna use pycharm anyway
03:47 - so right click you can say open with
03:50 - let's say i'm gonna open with notepad
03:51 - so as you can see i open it with notepad
03:53 - i think for
03:55 - for mac you use text editor or something
03:58 - but
03:59 - window you can just use notepad or you
04:00 - can use any of your favorite editor
04:03 - likes sublime or whatever doesn't there
04:05 - okay so once you have this open
04:08 - uh you can say import okay pi
04:11 - auto gui okay so this will import the
04:15 - uh this package that we just installed
04:19 - and then you can say print okay
04:22 - and then you say py auto
04:26 - query that size
04:30 - so if you have multiple window it will
04:32 - actually um
04:33 - you know show the size of the main
04:35 - window so
04:36 - um if you have multiple window you have
04:39 - to just imagine that there's a whole
04:40 - thing so the um
04:42 - it will actually see the whole thing as
04:45 - one
04:46 - one window so you might have to move it
04:48 - further okay it depends on the size
04:50 - so let's say we go back to our game
04:54 - okay and then now we have this this file
04:56 - here right
04:57 - so let's say this is the size and we
04:59 - want to move the mouse so you would say
05:02 - right py
05:06 - auto grid dot move
05:09 - and then capital t o and then let's say
05:12 - you want to move to um 1
05:16 - 300 okay comma
05:21 - let's say 300 y so this is x and y
05:25 - okay comma and then say duration
05:29 - equal to one so it will be basically one
05:32 - second
05:33 - so for me i have two screens so i have
05:35 - to do 1 300 so if you're a smaller
05:37 - screen
05:38 - you know you have one screen maybe 450
05:40 - or something doesn't matter
05:41 - just try it okay you save it so
05:44 - to run it you go back here right to
05:47 - where we have the file same location you
05:49 - can just type python
05:52 - and then say auto clicker dot py
05:55 - so you if i run this you can see the
05:58 - mouse move right you see my mouse just
06:00 - move out the window
06:01 - so that's how the mouse moves right so
06:04 - um
06:04 - because 1 300 is still on the other side
06:07 - of the screen
06:08 - let's say i say 1 800. so you can see
06:11 - i'll save it again so if i run this
06:13 - again
06:14 - you'll see that the mouse move see so
06:17 - you can see how the mouse moves right so
06:19 - we're trying to move it to the heart
06:20 - right so um for this one i already
06:23 - actually have the coordinate down
06:24 - because i already did it earlier to
06:26 - test the location so i can just move it
06:30 - i'll show you
06:31 - so for here i'm going to move it to um
06:37 - 2100 and then
06:41 - 425
06:43 - so for you may be different okay for you
06:46 - if you have a single screen maybe 450
06:48 - or 400 just try it so now i have this
06:52 - on right so i'll save it ctrl s
06:55 - i'm gonna run that again you can see it
06:57 - moved to the heart shape so this is
06:59 - the exact position that i want to right
07:01 - go
07:02 - so now i found the position that i want
07:05 - so what you have to do is
07:06 - there's a couple way to do the click you
07:08 - can say uh py
07:10 - auto grid dot click and you can look up
07:13 - the uh you know the
07:15 - information on online okay that's
07:17 - different way but um
07:18 - for the code you have to actually look
07:20 - into the code of this project so this
07:22 - project you use something called mouse
07:24 - down so it's not a mouse click
07:26 - so that's different event so if you look
07:28 - at event here right that's like this
07:29 - sprite
07:30 - is clicked if you use this sprite it's
07:32 - clicked then that is actually a
07:34 - a click so you will say uh p y auto grid
07:37 - dot
07:38 - click that's the in python but since
07:40 - this is a
07:41 - mouse down so you cannot use mouse down
07:44 - i mean you cannot use click you have to
07:46 - use mouse down and then they also have
07:47 - something like wait until not
07:49 - mouse down so that means you have to
07:51 - make sure that you have to push the
07:52 - mouse back up
07:54 - so what we have to do is let's go back
07:55 - to this project again so let's go back
07:58 - to our code
07:59 - so here what we have to do is let's
08:02 - let's just go
08:02 - for 10 okay 10 times so 4
08:06 - x in range
08:09 - and then we'll do 10. so make sure you
08:12 - put a colon
08:13 - i'll just take up the space so make sure
08:15 - you put a colon at the end and then tap
08:18 - okay say print x so
08:21 - uh in python it will go from zero and
08:23 - then one two three right so it will be
08:25 - zero to nine
08:26 - so you can add semicolon or no semicolon
08:28 - doesn't matter okay
08:30 - uh you can say auto
08:34 - good dot mouse
08:38 - down okay like this
08:41 - and then what to say pie auto
08:45 - put that mouse up okay
08:48 - this is basically moving the mouse down
08:50 - then moving the mouse up
08:51 - back up so now i'm going to save it ctrl
08:53 - s to save it
08:55 - so now what i'm going to do is i'm going
08:57 - to run this game again
08:59 - okay so you can see zero
09:02 - so i'm gonna have here uh what i'm going
09:04 - to do is going to run it just click on
09:06 - the up key
09:07 - in your arrow key up here will
09:08 - automatically run the last command
09:10 - so when i run this again you can see it
09:13 - goes over there and then start clicking
09:15 - it you see that it click 10 times you
09:16 - see that
09:18 - so you can see also that this thing is
09:20 - also
09:21 - showing because i print the uh the x
09:24 - right
09:24 - x value which is the loop because in
09:27 - here
09:27 - i say print right print x right so you
09:29 - don't want to see this you can take this
09:31 - out and it won't show
09:32 - so now let's say if i want to run it for
09:34 - 100 times right just
09:36 - change this to 100 and then i'm going to
09:39 - run it again here
09:41 - right maybe i'll move this over here
09:45 - i guess you can see because i'm in full
09:47 - screen so anyway
09:49 - but you can see the clicker so
09:52 - so you can see it's called clicking so
09:55 - as you can see it keeps on clicking
09:56 - 100 times so just don't move your mouse
09:59 - if you move your mouse and they will
10:01 - try to click somewhere else so you see
10:03 - that they keep on clicking to 100
10:04 - so it will be 110 because we clicked the
10:06 - first time 110 right
10:09 - so uh you see i don't have to do any
10:10 - work so the program is running for me
10:13 - so it will click until 110 or stuff so
10:16 - you see
10:17 - it's stopped so we go back over here in
10:19 - this uh application you can see
10:21 - everything
10:22 - until 99 right so you see
10:25 - from zero to 99 so now once you have 110
10:30 - you can go into the shop
10:31 - you can buy this value i guess so now
10:34 - every time you click you get two points
10:36 - so
10:37 - you can go back and let's say we change
10:39 - it back to 10
10:41 - right so now every time we rerun it
10:43 - we'll get more points so
10:45 - let's run it again so we'll go over here
10:48 - and then i'll click so you see two
10:50 - points each time now
10:51 - okay so from 10 to 30 because we'll get
10:55 - two points so as you can get more money
10:57 - you can buy
10:58 - the power up which gives you 10 per
11:00 - click 100 per click
11:02 - something like that it's really cool uh
11:05 - thanks to uh this person who made the uh
11:08 - the game for the clicker so uh i was
11:10 - just
11:11 - experimenting with python today with
11:13 - this clicker so i hope you guys like the
11:15 - video
11:16 - and um yeah give us a thumbs up if you
