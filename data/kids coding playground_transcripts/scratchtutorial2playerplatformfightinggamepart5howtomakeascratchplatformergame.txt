00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground
00:10 - this is the fifth part for the two
00:13 - player fighting game
00:14 - so before i continue i'm just going to
00:17 - drag through the code to let you guys
00:19 - see if you've missed anything
00:27 - so i'm just gonna drag through
00:33 - this is the restarting this is for the
00:36 - jumping this is the running
00:39 - the run control we're running
00:45 - this is also for jumping this is for
00:48 - starting um and player 2 is pretty much
00:52 - the same thing also
00:54 - running jumping restart
00:58 - um and ulcer jumping simulating gravity
01:03 - and for the magic gem um
01:07 - this is from the um platformer easy
01:09 - platformer
01:11 - platform doesn't have any code begin
01:13 - button
01:14 - that's what we had from last time um
01:19 - the buttons they're pretty much the same
01:24 - thing
01:27 - and this button and the last video we
01:30 - did the
01:31 - hp bars it's pretty simple
01:35 - this is a health copy that down if you
01:38 - haven't done it
01:40 - thus player 2 hp bar and the player 2
01:43 - health
01:44 - okay so now we've gone through all the
01:46 - code that we did from last time
01:48 - let's start with the begin button so
01:50 - we're actually going to add one more
01:52 - thing
01:52 - let's get an ore
01:56 - so what this does is if the player one
01:59 - character
02:00 - or the player two character is equal to
02:02 - nothing
02:04 - then it will um say players please
02:07 - select your characters
02:08 - so be we adding this because before we
02:10 - didn't have two players
02:12 - now we have two players so we have to
02:13 - add this extra statement
02:16 - so let's take out that and we have to
02:18 - reset we also have to set
02:20 - um player two character
02:24 - to also blank in the beginning you have
02:26 - to reset it
02:28 - and next we want to go to player one
02:30 - we're gonna do the attack
02:31 - today so for the
02:36 - for the uh attack we're just gonna when
02:38 - i received the
02:39 - start game so when the game starts i'll
02:42 - zoom in a little
02:43 - let's get a forever loop forever
02:48 - get an if then statement so if the f
02:51 - or i'm just going to do f f and g as the
02:54 - keys to attack
02:55 - you can do anything you want i'm just
02:57 - going to do f and g
02:58 - so if the f arrow key is pressed then we
03:01 - can broadcast a message
03:02 - and wait called p1 attack one
03:08 - player one attack one so p1 attack
03:12 - one okay and we can just duplicate this
03:16 - right click duplicate
03:18 - instead of f we do g here i'm just doing
03:20 - g you can do any
03:21 - key one you can do p2
03:25 - p2 attack a p1 sorry
03:28 - p1 p1 attack
03:32 - two so each character has two different
03:35 - attacks a throwing attack
03:37 - and a melee attack and then we're gonna
03:39 - add less if then statement
03:41 - this is to check if the hp is less than
03:43 - or equal to zero
03:45 - so if when they or
03:48 - if the hp is less than or equal to zero
03:53 - the player one hp of course player one
03:57 - hp
03:58 - is less than or
04:01 - equal to zero
04:04 - then we can broadcast a message called
04:07 - p1 is dead
04:11 - p1 dead
04:15 - so next we'll want to um swish
04:18 - make it switch costumes to the
04:21 - corresponding
04:22 - buttons press so now we're going to just
04:24 - get another one
04:25 - uh broadcast so when it receives p1
04:28 - attack one which is from this
04:30 - when the f arrow key is pressed then we
04:32 - set the player attack costume to zero in
04:34 - the beginning
04:35 - so player attack costume
04:39 - player attack costume is the um zero
04:42 - so we have attack attack costume right
04:46 - here we set it to zero in the beginning
04:50 - and we repeat 10 times we repeat 10
04:53 - times only because
04:54 - we have 10 costumes for attack as you
04:57 - can see
04:58 - one two three four five six seven
05:02 - eight nine ten ten different costumes
05:05 - for attack
05:06 - so if you have a different amount of um
05:08 - costumes you'll have to switch it to the
05:10 - corresponding number of costumes you
05:12 - have so next we're gonna
05:14 - get a switch costume switch costume get
05:17 - to joins
05:18 - join
05:22 - join so join the player one character
05:25 - which
05:26 - in the beginning you select player one
05:29 - character
05:32 - with the drawing attack
05:36 - underscore um i'm doing attack
05:40 - underscore because in the
05:41 - costumes i named it attack underscore if
05:44 - yours
05:44 - is like something else like melee
05:46 - underscore or something you gotta
05:48 - make it that but since it's attack i'll
05:50 - do that
05:51 - and then we drag the player attack
05:52 - costume
05:54 - which is the costume number
05:58 - so we can also change the
06:01 - player attack costume
06:05 - by one so it'll actually look like it's
06:08 - attacking
06:09 - so we can just right-click duplicate
06:11 - duplicate this
06:13 - instead when we receive p1 attack two
06:17 - it's pretty much the same thing except
06:21 - um yeah i think it's actually
06:24 - just changed the p1 attack two that's
06:27 - all you have to do it's pretty much the
06:28 - same thing
06:31 - and next we're gonna work on the player
06:33 - 2.
06:36 - the player 2 has um the same thing
06:39 - just drag and drop it into the
06:42 - sprite like that
06:46 - so we have them too so i'm just gonna
06:49 - move it over here
06:53 - and we're gonna also have to drag and
06:55 - drop this
06:57 - we're just gonna have to change some
06:58 - broadcast messages
07:02 - let me move this up here zoom in
07:06 - so instead of f and g we're going to do
07:08 - zero and nine
07:09 - so for the melee we can do nine
07:14 - and we can do zero for this one
07:17 - um instead of broadcasting p1 attack one
07:21 - we have to do
07:22 - p2 attack one
07:26 - and for this one we do p2 attack two
07:33 - p2 attack attack
07:36 - two p2 attack two
07:39 - instead of p1 dead and we change some
07:42 - variables here
07:43 - so player 1 hp we do player 2 hp
07:47 - and we have also changes to player 2 hp
07:50 - instead of p1 dead we do
07:52 - p2d
07:55 - [Applause]
07:57 - p2 dead so when
08:00 - i receive p2 attack 1
08:05 - p2 attack this is the second one p2
08:08 - attack 2.
08:09 - so for this one i have instead of um
08:13 - uh um i mean throw we have to shoot
08:17 - so instead of so instead of
08:20 - attack we do shoot
08:25 - shoot
08:28 - so this is shoot and for this one i
08:31 - think i only have eight costumes for
08:32 - shooting
08:34 - so let me go to the shoot costumes
08:38 - zero okay one one two three four
08:41 - five six seven eight i only have eight
08:45 - so instead of repeating
08:46 - ten times you repeat only eight
08:50 - and i think that's good to go except we
08:53 - have to change this yeah player two
08:55 - character
08:56 - instead okay and this one instead of
08:59 - attack for the melee i said me
09:01 - and i did nearly so see really so i do
09:04 - kneeling underscore instead
09:10 - player attack cost we have to change
09:12 - this to player 2 character
09:15 - change this to p2 attack 2
09:19 - and this should be eight
09:23 - so that's it for all the attacking but
09:25 - we still haven't made it lose any health
09:29 - so when i play it and select these i
09:32 - guess
09:33 - it will attack but it's not fully
09:37 - functional yet
09:42 - [Music]
09:44 - so it's not done yet and i almost forgot
09:47 - we have to change this to attack one
09:50 - p to attack one so now
09:55 - you press nine i will do melee and shoot
09:59 - okay and i forgot to do
10:02 - this to throw sorry about that
10:05 - so this should be throw
10:07 - [Music]
10:09 - so now as you can see he'll do chop and
10:12 - it'll do the throwing motion
10:14 - yeah i duplicated it and i forgot to
10:16 - change it so
10:17 - remember to change that so that should
10:18 - be thrown so this is really thrown
10:21 - and for this one i have to kneel and
10:24 - shoot okay
10:25 - so now we have all of that done we can
10:28 - work
10:29 - on the um damage
10:32 - see if damage is being taken so for
10:34 - player one
10:36 - we're gonna just get if
10:40 - okay so when i receive we're gonna get a
10:42 - message
10:44 - and i receive p2
10:47 - attack one p to attack one
10:51 - if it's touching player two
10:55 - [Music]
10:57 - player two then we can
11:00 - broadcast a message called p1 got hit
11:05 - just to notify that player 1 has been
11:12 - hit
11:15 - so next we are going to work on the
11:18 - um like the bullet
11:22 - hitting the player one so let me explain
11:25 - a little bit more about this
11:27 - so from player two as i said right here
11:30 - um p to attack one it will broadcast
11:34 - from this sprite to this sprite and this
11:37 - will receive it and if it's touching the
11:39 - player two while it's doing the
11:41 - attack one then we can broadcast another
11:43 - message notifying that it got hit
11:45 - so now let's work on
11:48 - this part so we already had this part
11:51 - from the last
11:52 - episode i think or the previous one but
11:55 - last last one but we have to add an
11:58 - if-then statement to the end
11:59 - you can do this anywhere you want but it
12:01 - just has to be in a forever loop so i'm
12:03 - just going to put it right here
12:05 - if it's touching
12:08 - oh yeah and we have to load all the um
12:13 - range um the shooting and throw weapon
12:15 - their own weapons so
12:17 - i forgot to load those we'll need those
12:20 - so
12:20 - i just got this bullet from online you
12:22 - can just google um
12:24 - cartoon bullet or something and this
12:27 - comes with the
12:28 - um ninja ninja girl i think
12:31 - just download it in the description
12:33 - below we have we'll give you a link
12:37 - so next okay so let's go back to player
12:40 - one now
12:42 - as i said earlier we have to do touching
12:45 - bullet
12:46 - if it's touching the bullet
12:50 - then we can broadcast
12:54 - p1 got hit
12:59 - player one got hit okay now we have to
13:02 - add some more code
13:03 - so so when i receive p1 got hit
13:07 - we can do an if then so this is just a
13:09 - like
13:11 - a check so like um
13:14 - this player two cannot like rapid hit
13:17 - and it'll do very it'll do a lot of
13:19 - damage to it so this is just like stop
13:21 - it from
13:22 - attacking way too fast so we can get an
13:25 - equal sign
13:26 - i think we'll need to make a new
13:27 - variable so we'll need to make a
13:30 - variable called is player getting damage
13:32 - i think i already have it actually so if
13:35 - you haven't made it then make it
13:37 - so if player getting damage is equal to
13:39 - no
13:40 - or n then we can set the player getting
13:43 - damage to
13:44 - yes so it's getting that notifies it
13:47 - it's taking damage
13:50 - so is planet getting damaged so yes
13:54 - why and we can change the player
13:58 - one hp by negative five each attack does
14:02 - five damage so player one hp by
14:05 - negative five negative five
14:09 - and next we can do like so like when
14:12 - it's getting hit we can tell
14:14 - the player that you're getting hit by
14:15 - changing the color effect
14:17 - so we can do it repeat 10 times just
14:18 - change the color effect by 25
14:21 - put clear graphic effects down here
14:24 - and set back set the um
14:29 - is if is player getting damaged
14:32 - back to no reset it back to n
14:38 - so now you can just give this to the
14:42 - player two
14:46 - let's give it to the player too
14:50 - but instead we'll just change like some
14:52 - broadcasts
14:54 - so instead p1 got hit we can make a new
14:57 - variable
15:00 - so we can add if then statement right
15:04 - here sorry
15:05 - forgot about that if then statement
15:08 - right under here if it's touching the
15:11 - kunai
15:12 - which is the um sword thing the um ninja
15:15 - throws
15:16 - can i and we broadcast the message
15:20 - called p2 got hit
15:24 - new message p2 dot
15:28 - okay now we can receive the message p2
15:31 - got hit
15:33 - right here we change this to p2 got hit
15:37 - uh p2 got hit right here
15:41 - okay and then we can set it to no yeah
15:44 - that's
15:45 - similar instead player one hp we do
15:47 - player two hp
15:49 - um and this should be right that's it
15:54 - so for the bullets um the
15:57 - the magic and the bullet is the same
15:59 - sprite but just different costumes
16:02 - so when you select the character it'll
16:04 - it'll just switch to the costume
16:06 - to the corresponding um character you
16:08 - pick same with this
16:11 - there's the fire and the kunai
16:15 - so next we can add some variables to the
16:18 - players so in the beginning
16:21 - you know how it's reset right here so we
16:23 - can set some variables back
16:25 - up look at the variable set
16:28 - the is player getting damage to n in the
16:31 - beginning
16:32 - to know
16:36 - also set is player one dead we can
16:39 - do that later because we have not coded
16:42 - the dead yet but we can make a new
16:44 - variable
16:45 - is player as player one dead
16:50 - i don't think we have time to move on to
16:52 - the um
16:53 - player one dead yet but we can still
16:55 - make the variable i'm just gonna make
16:58 - is is player one dead
17:01 - we can we'll save this for part six
17:06 - so make it for all sprites and don't
17:09 - forget for is player getting damaged
17:11 - this is supposed to be for this sprite
17:14 - only
17:15 - so check it you can see player one this
17:18 - is supposed to be for only player one
17:21 - so we can just set another variable the
17:24 - um
17:24 - dead is player again is player one dead
17:27 - to
17:28 - no in the beginning so we can also do
17:32 - this for the other character
17:35 - so for player two we will just do that
17:37 - in two and
17:38 - for the start again we'll get the set
17:42 - set is player getting damaged
17:46 - is player getting damaged to n
17:51 - and set is player we make a new variable
17:54 - called
17:56 - is player 2 dead
17:59 - then we set a new variable
18:03 - is player two dead
18:07 - it's player two dead okay i'm going to
18:09 - run the game once for you guys
18:11 - and set this to n i'll set i'll run the
18:14 - game once for you guys so you guys can
18:15 - see
18:16 - what we have so far
18:20 - so you can select your characters if you
18:22 - don't select it you'll see players
18:23 - please select characters
18:25 - i'm just gonna select these
18:28 - we have we haven't got to the shooting
18:30 - out projectiles yet we'll get that
18:32 - tomorrow right now we cannot shoot out
18:34 - projectiles yet i'll get to that
18:35 - tomorrow
18:37 - attacked we haven't done like taking
18:39 - damage yet
18:41 - so today we got through the attacking
18:45 - attacking we got through the attacking
18:49 - we're not doing any damage
18:51 - yet but for this one it is
18:53 - [Music]
18:55 - so as you can see when the um
18:59 - thing the adventure girl was attacking i
19:01 - mean the ninja was attacking wasn't
19:03 - dealing any damage
19:04 - because i forgot to add this last bit of
19:06 - code
19:09 - so just duplicate you can just drag and
19:12 - drop it from here
19:14 - forgot about this just take it right
19:17 - here i'll zoom in a little
19:20 - when i receive p
19:24 - one attack one
19:28 - then if touching player one
19:31 - then we can broadcast p2 got hit new
19:34 - vari
19:35 - p2 got hit so now it should work
19:39 - [Music]
19:44 - as you can see she's taking damage we
19:46 - haven't got to the throwing yet we'll
19:47 - get to that tomorrow
19:48 - as i said so
19:52 - for this one it's also dealing damage
19:58 - we haven't done the dead thing yet so it
20:00 - hits zero hp
20:02 - we don't it won't do anything yet
20:04 - because we haven't done anything to it
20:05 - [Music]
