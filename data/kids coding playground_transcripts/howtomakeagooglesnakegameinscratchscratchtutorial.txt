00:00 - i'm pretty sure many of you are familiar
00:02 - with the game google snake today we're
00:04 - going to be making your own inside
00:05 - scratch if you're not familiar with the
00:07 - game i will show you a quick
00:08 - demonstration of what it is it's
00:10 - basically a simple snake game
00:12 - you know you're the snake the more you
00:14 - eat the longer you are
00:17 - and if you hit the edge obviously you
00:19 - lose
00:20 - so without further ado let's hop right
00:22 - into the video
00:31 - okay so now we're in scratch i'll show
00:33 - you my own game of google snake so
00:36 - let's click play so basically it's about
00:38 - the same thing
00:40 - so when you collect some oops i just
00:42 - died already so
00:44 - see you collect an apple you get bigger
00:48 - as you can see it was like pulsating in
00:50 - the beginning like as you can see like
00:52 - when you start you'll see like the other
00:54 - the sprites like pulsating a little bit
00:56 - it's because it's too big if you wanted
00:58 - to not do that then you can set the
00:59 - sprite as a smaller
01:01 - but since i already said it like that
01:02 - i'll show you guys so basically
01:05 - as you eat more
01:06 - um
01:07 - oops
01:09 - the more you eat the longer your length
01:10 - is and the goal is to survive as long as
01:12 - you possibly can
01:15 - so yeah that's basically my version of
01:17 - google snape
01:18 - yeah i just died right there so that's
01:20 - my version of google snake
01:23 - so without further ado let's
01:24 - create a new project so we're gonna
01:26 - create a new project
01:28 - you guys have noticed that we've hit 8k
01:30 - subscribers recently
01:32 - and currently 89.3 percent of you guys
01:35 - are not subscribed watching our channel
01:37 - so please help us get to 9k subscribers
01:40 - quicker by
01:42 - clicking the subscribe button that would
01:43 - really help and support our channel
01:46 - all right and then first i'm going to
01:47 - rename the project to google snake
01:50 - i already have all the sprites inside my
01:52 - backpack
01:53 - the um head and stuff i also get the
01:56 - background as well
01:58 - so yeah i just got the backdrop i
01:59 - actually forgot to get it so here it is
02:03 - um
02:04 - so all the sprites will be in the google
02:06 - drive remember so first i'm going to put
02:08 - in the backdrop it's just like the
02:10 - google snake backdrop you know it looks
02:11 - like this it's like a grid
02:14 - and then we'll delete the scratch cat
02:16 - and let's put in our sprite
02:19 - so right here we have the body and the
02:21 - head and like i said earlier sometimes
02:23 - you see it's like pulsating a little bit
02:25 - you can obviously just decrease the size
02:28 - of it
02:29 - there we go
02:30 - so now we have the two sprites uh two
02:32 - costumes one is the head one is the body
02:36 - and we're gonna get the apple so
02:38 - like
02:40 - the snake's gonna eat the apple right so
02:43 - first we're going to set the apple to
02:44 - maybe 50
02:46 - not too big yeah that's perfect size so
02:48 - apple we're going to get that spray and
02:52 - we'll make it we need one more sprite
02:54 - but i will add that later on so let's go
02:56 - to the snake again let's go to the head
02:58 - so inside the head we are going to get
03:00 - when green flag is clicked i'm going to
03:01 - rename the head actually so it's easier
03:04 - no i'll name it player okay so that's
03:06 - the snake um i want to zoom in level
03:08 - okay so when green flight clicked then
03:10 - we're gonna switch
03:12 - the costume of head
03:14 - switch head
03:16 - and
03:17 - switch cost me to the head costume you
03:19 - see
03:19 - and we're going to make a new variable
03:21 - this is called length we're going to
03:22 - name it length for all sprites
03:25 - length
03:26 - um and then we're going to make another
03:28 - variable we're going to name it high
03:29 - score
03:31 - and we're going to make a cloud variable
03:34 - so it's
03:35 - stored um on the cloud so then you can
03:38 - see who has the highest score
03:41 - and then right here in the beginning
03:42 - we're going to set both of the variables
03:44 - to zero so we're gonna set uh the length
03:47 - and we're gonna set the
03:49 - high score variable
03:51 - to zero
03:53 - also we're after this we're going to set
03:55 - the position of the player to zero zero
03:57 - which is the middle of the screen
04:00 - and we're going to get a forever loop
04:02 - we're going to make him forever go three
04:04 - steps in three steps
04:06 - so it will move no matter what move
04:08 - three steps and we're going to if
04:11 - uh touching the edge
04:15 - touching edge
04:17 - so if the player is touching the edge
04:19 - then we're going to broadcast a message
04:22 - and we're going to name it game over
04:28 - game over
04:30 - then we're going to broadcast a message
04:31 - called stop all
04:34 - and
04:34 - we're going to
04:36 - make a new variable called score we'll
04:37 - also need this later for all sprites as
04:40 - well
04:41 - all right and then after this we are
04:43 - going to
04:45 - um
04:47 - when greenfly clicked another one when
04:49 - you're clicked
04:51 - we're going to forever
04:54 - wait 0.25 seconds
04:58 - seconds and create a clone of myself
05:01 - and then right here we're going to make
05:03 - the movement of the snake so remember
05:05 - you got to look at this from the snake's
05:06 - perspective so let's say he's pointing
05:09 - downwards right
05:10 - it's pointing downwards
05:13 - um
05:14 - it's going to
05:16 - left is going to be this way forward and
05:17 - right is going to be this way
05:19 - so now we're going to create the
05:21 - movement for it
05:22 - so
05:24 - i'm going to
05:26 - when
05:28 - this key is pressed when
05:29 - key
05:30 - left is pressed
05:33 - when key left is pressed we're going to
05:34 - use an if else
05:37 - so if the direction is greater than zero
05:40 - so direction
05:41 - zero is point like pointing up
05:44 - right so if it's greater than zero
05:46 - meaning that means it's somewhere on
05:47 - this side
05:49 - that means
05:51 - so if uh direction is greater than zero
05:57 - if it's greater than zero then we're
05:59 - going to turn 90 degrees
06:01 - so that means it will turn to the right
06:03 - turn 90 degrees to the right so let's
06:06 - say it's going up
06:07 - direction is zero
06:09 - then we're going to turn to the right 90
06:12 - degrees else it's going to go to the
06:13 - left
06:14 - so you have to look at this from the
06:15 - snake's perspective
06:18 - not
06:18 - yours right has to be
06:21 - left like that
06:24 - then we're just going to duplicate this
06:25 - okay so right here
06:28 - when the key
06:31 - right arrow is
06:32 - pressed the direction is greater than
06:35 - zero we're going to turn left instead of
06:37 - right
06:39 - so
06:42 - so it's going to turn left instead of
06:44 - right also
06:46 - in the beginning you might want to set
06:48 - this
06:49 - direction
06:51 - to zero
06:52 - i mean 180 180
06:55 - 180 is point pointing the bottom so i'm
06:57 - gonna set it to 180 in the beginning
06:59 - and we're just going to duplicate this
07:00 - again we're new bottom so if the down
07:04 - arrow key is pressed
07:05 - and direction is greater than zero
07:08 - we're going to
07:11 - yeah we're just going to keep this same
07:12 - thing
07:13 - it's going down
07:14 - and if the direction is greater than
07:16 - zero we're going to turn right
07:18 - so we're going to this way
07:20 - if it's greater than zero obviously
07:21 - you're going to turn this way basis size
07:23 - greater than zero else we're going to
07:25 - turn to the left
07:26 - all right
07:28 - typically this one last time
07:30 - right left down up now if the up
07:33 - so
07:34 - up arrow so
07:36 - if
07:37 - the direction is greater than zero we're
07:39 - going to turn left 90 degrees else we're
07:41 - going to turn right 90 degrees it's
07:44 - going up
07:45 - zero is going to be uh greater than zero
07:47 - is going to be this way right
07:49 - so it was greater than zero we're going
07:50 - to make it turn left else it's going to
07:52 - turn right so that means if it's facing
07:54 - to the right then it's going to going to
07:56 - turn left
07:57 - so
07:58 - yeah it's kind of hard to understand
08:00 - because you have to look from the
08:01 - snake's perspective not yours
08:03 - um
08:05 - right now obviously
08:06 - it is not working yet
08:09 - because
08:10 - we have this thing we will need it later
08:13 - i'll show you how it will work
08:15 - all right
08:17 - and then
08:19 - next we're going to under apply clicked
08:24 - uh we are going to reset the timer
08:29 - and forever
08:33 - set the score to timer
08:39 - timer
08:43 - all right so if you unplug this from the
08:45 - code
08:46 - and play it
08:48 - it's going to move normally right
08:51 - yeah so the snake can move around pretty
08:55 - well
08:56 - so yeah it's pretty cool
08:58 - we'll now make the length and we also
09:00 - added the score right the timer so
09:03 - and then next we are going to
09:05 - attach this back on so
09:07 - when i start as a clone
09:11 - when i start as a clone we are going to
09:12 - switch the costume to body
09:15 - which is the second costume so when it's
09:17 - getting cloned we're going to switch it
09:18 - to this one
09:19 - instead of the first one as you can see
09:21 - right here
09:22 - if you ran it
09:24 - if you if you took this out
09:26 - it would be like this yeah and we do not
09:28 - want that so that's why you have to do
09:30 - squish costume to body
09:32 - when it starts as a clone and we're
09:33 - going to set the size of 75 so it isn't
09:35 - too big
09:36 - and we're going to wait till i'm 11
09:39 - seconds so we're going to wait
09:40 - whatever the length is so
09:43 - length
09:44 - is 5.5 seconds so
09:46 - we're going to wait length
09:48 - seconds however long the player is and
09:51 - then we're going to delete this clone
09:53 - all right
09:56 - save it
09:57 - obviously
09:58 - it won't work because you have to
10:00 - eat something in order to grow
10:03 - so now we are going to
10:05 - make it so that you can eat something
10:07 - and you will grow
10:09 - also when you play it you can see that
10:11 - it's pulsating a little bit if i like
10:13 - zoom in you probably can see it
10:15 - but yeah it's like
10:16 - little pulsate effect right there
10:19 - and we don't want that so you can make
10:21 - it
10:22 - even smaller if you want
10:25 - so
10:27 - there let's see if it has any more
10:30 - it still has a bit
10:34 - yeah as you can see now it's pretty much
10:36 - invisible it's not it's not visible
10:38 - anymore
10:39 - all right
10:40 - let's stop the project save it
10:42 - let's go to the apple
10:45 - so inside our apple we're going to go to
10:47 - the code
10:48 - one green flag clicked
10:51 - make it bigger
10:52 - so we're going to go to
10:55 - a pick random negative 200
10:58 - to 200
11:00 - place
11:02 - for the x and then for the y i'm gonna
11:04 - do one negative 150 to 150.
11:09 - so the apples will spawn from here to
11:11 - here from here to here so it's going to
11:14 - spawn like pretty much all around here
11:17 - all right and then we can get a forever
11:18 - loop forever we're going to
11:21 - so we're going to make it so if the
11:25 - head of the snake touches the apple then
11:27 - it will
11:28 - get eaten so we're going to
11:31 - get a
11:32 - touching color so we're going to get if
11:34 - forever if
11:36 - touching the color
11:39 - let's look at the tip of the snake like
11:42 - right there if it's touching that color
11:44 - now we're going to change the length by
11:45 - one
11:48 - change the length by one and we're going
11:50 - to go to
11:52 - just duplicate this again
11:55 - and put this right here
11:58 - all right
12:00 - so now let's run the game
12:04 - as you can see you will get bigger every
12:06 - time you eat it
12:08 - and i think i made the
12:10 - body too small
12:12 - so let me go ahead and increase the size
12:14 - a bit
12:19 - okay let's see how good it is now
12:22 - let's eat an apple
12:25 - yeah
12:26 - so that's more like it
12:28 - that's more like it yeah all right
12:31 - so now let's make it play some music i
12:33 - guess so let's go to the backdrop code
12:36 - um
12:37 - we can move the variables around a
12:38 - little let's put high score and score
12:41 - over here
12:43 - and length so let's make it play some
12:45 - music
12:47 - uh we're going to just pick a random
12:48 - sound i don't know let's go to loops
12:51 - classical piano whatever uh actually no
12:53 - this this does not fit the theme of the
12:55 - game
12:56 - what did i have last time i think i had
12:57 - like dance magic or something let's get
12:59 - that
13:01 - yeah whatever this is
13:03 - yeah
13:04 - all right
13:05 - so one group like clicked forever
13:08 - they're going to play them sound
13:11 - against magic until done
13:13 - okay now let's go back to the player
13:15 - real quick so inside the player we are
13:17 - going to
13:18 - put the high score mechanic into the
13:20 - game
13:21 - so let's move out of the way move this
13:22 - stuff out of the way and then we're
13:24 - going to get an effects event so if
13:27 - putting the forever loop we're going to
13:28 - do if
13:30 - a high score
13:32 - is less than the score or what score is
13:34 - greater than high score
13:37 - then we're going to set the variable
13:39 - high score
13:40 - to score
13:42 - all right
13:43 - there you go
13:46 - okay
13:47 - actually i don't know why i'm sending
13:49 - the high score to zero should be score
13:51 - sorry about that i don't i think i
13:53 - looked at the wrong thing except
13:54 - something so you want the high scores
13:57 - okay so that's more likely
14:00 - let's run the game as you can see the
14:02 - high score is going up with the score
14:04 - because this is a high score so far
14:07 - yeah as you can see the snake is growing
14:08 - big
14:13 - the length is in the right top hand top
14:15 - right hand corner you can see that it's
14:17 - also getting bigger
14:20 - yeah so that's basically it now we can
14:23 - add a game over and then
14:25 - our game will be finished so
14:27 - let's make a red text because usually
14:29 - game over is bread i guess i don't know
14:34 - [Music]
14:37 - let's make it big
14:39 - about that big
14:40 - uh maybe a little smaller actually
14:42 - that's a bit too big
14:45 - all right that's all right so then we go
14:47 - when green flag clicks
14:49 - gonna
14:51 - uh sorry go to front layer make sure
14:53 - it's in the front
14:55 - and we're going to hide and
14:57 - we're going to go to zero zero
15:01 - and then
15:02 - when i receive game over
15:05 - then we will be
15:07 - showing this thing
15:09 - and we will stop all okay so now let's
15:13 - run the game
15:18 - as you can see it's bigger
15:24 - so the length is growing getting bigger
15:26 - as well
15:28 - so in our game you can't actually uh
15:30 - lose by hitting your tail
15:32 - because the thing is you're always
15:34 - touching the body
15:36 - so if you want to make it so that you
15:38 - die when you touch your tail then you're
15:39 - going to have to make it a separate
15:41 - sprite
15:43 - so it's just a simple version of google
15:45 - snape
15:46 - so yeah that's pretty much for this
