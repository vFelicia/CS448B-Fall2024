00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding Clara today I will be doing
00:12 - a video to clarify ting game so one of
00:16 - our subscribers recommended us to do
00:19 - this he gave us this idea to do this so
00:22 - we'll give him a shout out here and this
00:26 - game took 20 hours to make so it was
00:29 - pretty difficult so this is how it looks
00:33 - like pete players will be able to select
00:35 - their characters so the origin which is
00:39 - player 1 will be able to select them
00:40 - these two and the green team which is
00:43 - the player 2 will be able to select from
00:45 - these two characters and they are
00:47 - allowed to select the desert map or the
00:50 - graveyard map and so today we'll be
00:56 - learning these following concepts and
00:58 - scratch so we're going to learn
00:59 - broadcasting messages the custom sprites
01:03 - like the drawing drawing sprites
01:06 - and will get custom blocks looking we're
01:09 - gonna do loops like forever loose stuff
01:12 - like that we can do to change color
01:14 - effects so when they get damaged then
01:16 - we'll change the color effects and for
01:19 - variables we will do them for all
01:21 - sprites and for this spray only we'll
01:23 - have well used both of them and this is
01:27 - important you must complete first
01:29 - complete our tutorial on the simple
01:30 - platformer game in order to work on this
01:35 - game and these are the two websites you
01:38 - can go to to get the sprites for this
01:41 - game so let's go here show you guys how
01:47 - the game works
01:48 - so let's play so my brother is here to
01:53 - play with me hi everyone
01:55 - I will pick the genie from the other
01:57 - thing I'll pick the ninja and also if
02:00 - you don't pick they both don't good one
02:02 - orbit close we saw four characters so
02:05 - you a ninja yes and we see when you
02:11 - check one other one does not check so
02:14 - you can also double jump so for the
02:22 - player one different roles is FN key you
02:25 - can change it of course for the team and
02:27 - WASD maggini is arrow keys and zero and
02:32 - nine zero it throws a fireball or I
02:35 - guess and one it will shoot all the
02:37 - magic when you get the gem of the appeal
02:43 - [Music]
02:46 - and you can slide the planer one can
02:48 - slide and you press the down button to
02:50 - the genie and the dragons and
02:55 - I enjoyed the story jumping on the road
03:02 - if it's double jump
03:03 - [Music]
03:08 - when they have a shield then will not be
03:10 - affected by any incoming damage huh okay
03:18 - so so when you win they will die in a
03:26 - tombstone sure
03:30 - so there's also what try another time
03:35 - and my brother so damaged
03:47 - [Music]
03:58 - I'm gonna go get them we shoot fire on
04:01 - Petraglia dragon we'll shoot fire out in
04:03 - this round is the lowest range attack is
04:16 - [Music]
04:24 - and to Allah
04:27 - so yeah that's pretty much the game we
04:33 - haven't added the player 1 and Claire to
04:35 - win yet like you can make like a
04:37 - windscreen we can do that later in the
04:40 - tutorial so as I said you have to be
04:46 - done with the simple platformer game the
04:48 - one where you can go around and wrap the
04:51 - gems this one so I know I think you've
04:54 - all done this one so let me make a copy
04:58 - of this save as copy so I'm gonna be
05:06 - loading up all the getting this into the
05:10 - two-player fighting game so two-player
05:19 - fighting game and I just uploaded all
05:22 - the sprites from the backpack
05:36 - so I'll play the platform's sway a
05:40 - little so now I'll teach you guys how to
05:45 - how the platform is done so we were just
05:52 - like you can just take out one of them
05:54 - because it'll cuz we still have the
05:56 - double jump it'll give it more room so
05:58 - you can double jump easy easier and we
06:03 - don't need any of these you can just
06:04 - delete them all so all we need is this
06:09 - one since we have another platform that
06:16 - with all the decoration and stuff we can
06:20 - just delete the other one but if you
06:22 - have not and then we will also work on
06:24 - this graveyard platform later and then
06:28 - newer videos in the next videos so we
06:33 - don't need this platform so we can just
06:35 - delete it so we have platform 2 we can
06:39 - just name it platforms rename it yes so
06:45 - we have the sign we don't need it
06:47 - because it's already in the backdrop we
06:48 - don't need the bush either cuz it's
06:50 - already in the backdrop and finally we
06:52 - don't need the tree I think because I
06:57 - think yeah it's loading the backdrop
06:58 - also so now we will have to rename all
07:05 - the costumes for it like the ninja girl
07:09 - we put mg in the front so later we can
07:11 - like join it with the variable so we can
07:15 - so when it clicks on it it will choose
07:17 - that character like all of these have ng
07:21 - and the Dragon has DRG in the front see
07:28 - it says DRG in the front so since we
07:32 - have 10 costumes for run for the ninja
07:35 - girl will also need 10 for the dragon
07:38 - but the dragon has initially only 4 I
07:41 - think for the running so you have to do
07:44 - some of the costumes to make it ten see
07:48 - it only has four moving walk you know
07:52 - there's five yeah
07:54 - sorry there's five walk dragging
07:56 - costumes so you have to duplicate five
07:58 - more you all set match the name for the
08:03 - Dragons let the run jump attack we can
08:10 - just put numbers underscore number
08:12 - behind them so that we can use a loop to
08:17 - go through so as you can see we just
08:20 - wrote DRG run and then put underscore
08:23 - the number behind it and then we have
08:28 - the jump the jump costume is basically
08:30 - the attack costume we use the same one
08:32 - just duplicate it I will show you guys
08:38 - now how to make the costumes for the
08:41 - sprites I put I know you guys can see it
08:44 - but we put tape on our screen so you can
08:47 - like proportion the sprites correctly we
08:51 - want the sprites to be the same size so
08:53 - when you play the game the costumes will
08:56 - be the same size so I put tape right
09:02 - here on the top two pieces of tape on
09:06 - the side and then one tape for the
09:08 - bottom one piece of tape for the bottom
09:11 - so that's how you're gonna position it
09:14 - so now we're gonna show you guys how to
09:18 - do it so we're gonna up the little
09:20 - costume
09:33 - just gotta get it so we can just use
09:42 - them a do so for now the Medusa costume
09:46 - as you can see this Medusa is very small
09:49 - compared to the dragon so we have to
09:51 - proportion it correctly the same size so
09:55 - we first we convict from vert to vector
09:57 - so you can select the whole thing so we
10:03 - select it and we just drag on the sides
10:04 - never drag on the bottom or the sides or
10:07 - it can mess up the proportion so you
10:09 - want to drag on the sides corner the
10:12 - corner sides so you wanna so remember we
10:16 - have tape on our screen that you cannot
10:18 - see we want to put the top of it
10:22 - touching the piece of tape the bottom of
10:24 - the sprite touching the bottom of the
10:26 - tape and the sides touching the side of
10:29 - the tape so you know it's perfectly
10:31 - proportioned so if you show it the
10:38 - Medusa is that big and if we show the
10:45 - dragon it's about the same size and the
10:49 - ninja girl is also about the same size
10:50 - so this is this is pretty good for the
10:54 - Medusa so you have to so I did one
10:57 - example you have to do this for all the
10:59 - all the costumes so it may be a little
11:03 - tedious but you're still gonna have to
11:04 - do it for the costumes you did it for
11:11 - all these costumes so we have one Idol
11:15 - costume ten runs ten run costumes and
11:21 - then we have one we have jump costumes
11:24 - we have ten of them I believe yeah we
11:27 - have ten jump costumes then we have some
11:30 - attack costumes this is the sword attack
11:32 - costume and we have also ten of those
11:35 - and then we have ten throwing costumes
11:40 - this is the throw the knife
11:43 - and then we have the slide costumes 1010
11:47 - slide costumes as well and then we have
11:49 - the dead costume so when the ninja dies
11:52 - it will lay down we also have ten I
11:57 - think
11:57 - yeah then we have the tombstone so when
12:00 - the character dies the tombstone will
12:03 - switch the costume to the tombstone
12:06 - remember you also have to adjust the
12:09 - tombstone size as well with the other
12:11 - costumes the dragon since we have less
12:16 - movement costumes we had to duplicate
12:19 - some like the jump ones we have to
12:22 - duplicate some attack and jump are the
12:26 - same costumes even though they are the
12:31 - same we still have to rename it to
12:34 - attack and jump so we can use it in a
12:37 - loop in the future and then we have the
12:42 - throw which is the shooting fireball mmm
12:45 - this is the dragon dead which also has
12:51 - 10 costumes to match the ninja girl you
12:57 - always have to have same amount of
12:59 - costumes and then we will delete this
13:02 - one so so for now I'm gonna duplicate
13:09 - all the code from the treasure hunter
13:11 - into the player one so so I'm gonna drag
13:17 - all this code into the player one from
13:20 - the treasure hunter so remember if you
13:26 - want to duplicate your code just drag it
13:40 - and finally so we're done with all the
13:44 - code and just separate it hmm so that's
13:56 - a lot of code zoom out I'm dragging all
14:03 - this code over here because it's I've
14:05 - already done it so if you guys have not
14:08 - done it you guys have to work on the
14:09 - costumes first oops so separate hold it
14:18 - okay so this is all the code when I play
14:23 - it it will not actually work yet cuz we
14:25 - you don't have the code yet because
14:28 - these numbers are different and we will
14:31 - work on that in the next video maybe so
14:35 - we will start stop here so thank you
14:37 - guys for watching please like share and
14:39 - subscribe and I'll see you guys in the
14:43 - next video
