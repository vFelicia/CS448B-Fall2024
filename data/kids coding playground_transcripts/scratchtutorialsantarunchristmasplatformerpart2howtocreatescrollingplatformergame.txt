00:03 - [Music]
00:08 - hey guys welcome back to
00:10 - kidscoolingplayground
00:11 - so today is january 1st 2021 so uh
00:14 - happy new year to everyone around the
00:16 - world i will continue with the uh
00:19 - this center uh platformer school
00:21 - platform game
00:23 - uh we did uh so as you can see we have
00:26 - the center here sliding down
00:29 - and then you have the main character uh
00:31 - so we have two costume
00:33 - okay the shorter one for the slime
00:35 - center and the taller ones for the
00:37 - standing up center
00:39 - okay so that is how that is i think uh
00:42 - some of the uh
00:44 - viewer asked us if we could give you all
00:46 - the uh
00:48 - ground sprite uh i only gave i think the
00:51 - first four
00:52 - uh because i want you guys to make your
00:54 - own it's pretty easy to do
00:56 - uh you just have to just copy from the
00:58 - previous one and then just add some
01:00 - stuff
01:01 - like from the bottom here you have the
01:02 - tree and everything right
01:04 - so you can just take that and then kind
01:06 - of edit it it's pretty easy
01:08 - okay if you don't know how to do that
01:09 - just watch the first video again
01:11 - okay so uh without further ado let's go
01:13 - on to the code itself
01:15 - um we are going to create a few
01:18 - variables
01:19 - uh so first we're gonna create some of
01:21 - the global variable
01:23 - so for global variable meaning is for
01:25 - all sprite i just have it as a
01:27 - g and then underscore so that way it's
01:29 - easier to
01:30 - to see right for all the uh variable
01:33 - that is uh
01:34 - for all sprite only so first we're going
01:37 - to create one called
01:38 - animation type
01:41 - so this one will help us to chat track
01:45 - what the player is animation type is
01:48 - like
01:49 - is dying or jumping or running stuff
01:51 - like that
01:52 - so we'll take one of that okay so next
01:57 - we'll create another one for our
02:00 - g underscore direction so this will
02:04 - kind of keep track of the player's
02:06 - direction
02:09 - so left and right then we're gonna
02:13 - go create one for gravity
02:16 - [Music]
02:18 - uh i mean i i had the gravity
02:22 - as a negative one i mean you don't if
02:24 - you don't want to use the gravity
02:26 - variable you can just
02:27 - have it negative one everywhere but i
02:30 - think having a gravity variable later we
02:31 - can change it or you know if you
02:33 - want to change some other place you have
02:35 - to just
02:36 - use the variable it's it's quite easier
02:39 - okay
02:40 - i said i did the same thing similar in
02:41 - the manga so i'm gonna go a little bit
02:44 - quicker on this uh since uh
02:45 - if you guys have not worked on this uh
02:47 - among us
02:49 - i suggest you work on that one first
02:51 - before you come to this one so this
02:52 - one's a little bit more complicated
02:54 - than the among us platformer because
02:57 - this one is like scrolling and then we
02:59 - change some of the code
03:01 - related to how how they use a sprite
03:04 - movement
03:04 - okay so next one we have g underscore
03:08 - is player dead so this will keep track
03:12 - if the player is dead or not
03:14 - and then and then we can you
03:17 - create one more rg mouse position
03:24 - so this will help us to you know when
03:26 - we're putting items or stuff on the
03:28 - ground or traps
03:29 - so we can uh check where it is
03:33 - and then next one is g
03:37 - on ground so this will check if the
03:40 - player is touching the ground or not
03:44 - okay so next we'll create a g
03:48 - run so this will keep track of the
03:50 - player running
03:52 - and then we are going to have the global
03:55 - variable for scrolling
03:59 - x
04:03 - and then make one more g uh right now
04:06 - we're not using the scroll y
04:08 - but in future you know another game you
04:10 - know you have a platform that scroll up
04:12 - we can do that so let's not create that
04:15 - for now let's not use the scroll white
04:17 - we're only going to use scroll x
04:18 - for now so this one doesn't have a
04:20 - scroll y for this game
04:23 - um okay let's make one more g
04:27 - will slide so this will keep track if
04:29 - the player is using the slide motion
04:31 - uh for the centers to slide down
04:36 - okay uh we'll have a few more
04:40 - uh g underscore uh speed
04:43 - x and then
04:46 - we'll make one more
04:49 - this is the velocities for the jumping
04:54 - ah okay after that we'll make a uh
04:58 - so be sure to have it on the main
05:00 - character here
05:01 - and uh we are going to make some um for
05:04 - this sprite only so
05:05 - i'm going to use the lowercase for
05:08 - jumping
05:10 - okay and then um
05:15 - okay so i am going to have this one the
05:18 - deviation
05:20 - for this sprite only
05:24 - it wrong sorry deviation
05:28 - okay we are going to make a few more
05:30 - variable
05:31 - uh for this sprite only as well we are
05:34 - going to say
05:35 - change x so this is for the scrolling
05:38 - part
05:38 - we will be using that then we'll make
05:41 - a few more say that uh
05:44 - i think we'll do level
05:48 - so this one now just because we are
05:50 - doing display we're
05:51 - not going to use the g so that will show
05:53 - up on the screen
05:55 - and then we'll make one more for life
05:59 - like how many light the center has
06:04 - okay we have a few more i know we have a
06:06 - lot of variable
06:08 - so this one is score for the score like
06:10 - when they collect the uh
06:11 - points and oops sorry
06:15 - and then we'll make some more uh so this
06:18 - one is for the sprite only
06:20 - we're gonna have something called start
06:23 - position x
06:26 - so this is for the position x for the
06:29 - sprite only
06:30 - make another one start position
06:35 - y so this is for also for scrolling okay
06:39 - okay so we have everything i believe
06:43 - that we needed at this time uh the
06:45 - timing and everything we can do that
06:47 - later
06:48 - so let me remove some of this we don't
06:51 - need to
06:51 - see this for now let's take out all
06:54 - these
06:55 - and we are going to only keep track of
06:57 - the level and the life and the score
06:59 - for now okay so maybe level can go here
07:04 - live can go here and then score can go
07:06 - into the middle
07:07 - [Music]
07:08 - all right okay so we are going to go to
07:12 - the custom block we're going to make our
07:13 - first block called reset
07:18 - okay you can click on the run without
07:20 - refresh for this one really really
07:21 - doesn't matter but
07:22 - run well refresh is probably faster but
07:25 - this is
07:26 - basically we're going to reset the
07:27 - variable
07:29 - what we're going to do is going to put
07:30 - the center somewhere like
07:33 - 200 0 so we'll drop down and then we are
07:37 - going to reset our variable
07:40 - so let me zoom in a little bit
07:43 - so here we'll say set
07:47 - so we're gonna reset the first variable
07:49 - if player is dead
07:51 - we're gonna say uh false so he's not
07:53 - dead
07:55 - okay then we'll duplicate this uh
07:58 - we'll do the uh gravity
08:01 - and the uh velocity and stuff like that
08:04 - so the velocity
08:06 - will reset it to zero uh
08:09 - on the ground we're gonna put it zero
08:13 - on the ground as well and then the uh
08:17 - we are going to put the uh um velocity
08:20 - of h
08:21 - of gravity so gravity we are going to
08:24 - use a negative one so
08:26 - fall down one one step i'm in one small
08:30 - position the y we're gonna use that
08:33 - and we are going to um
08:36 - something called g animation so this is
08:38 - the animation type kind of reset that to
08:41 - zero and then we're gonna
08:44 - use the uh g scroll
08:48 - x
08:53 - scrolling so we don't have y we don't
08:55 - need scroll y
08:56 - and then we need jumping so we have
08:59 - reset the jump also so
09:01 - jump is the uh for this sprite only okay
09:04 - so reset that okay
09:08 - okay we're gonna create some um
09:12 - sound uh for that so we are actually
09:14 - using
09:15 - a um something called um
09:19 - the list so using a list we can have
09:22 - like different uh
09:23 - position uh for the uh item later on and
09:26 - also the sound so we're gonna use that
09:29 - so for now let's create some of the list
09:31 - variable
09:32 - okay make a list so here we go
09:35 - global item
09:39 - x position list
09:42 - okay i'll make another one item
09:52 - y position
09:55 - list so i'm creating all the variable up
09:59 - front here so that way you guys can
10:01 - you know refer back to it if you need it
10:04 - later on so don't have to go to a
10:05 - different
10:06 - type of video so that's why i'm creating
10:08 - all this at the front so this is item
10:10 - type list
10:12 - and then one more
10:15 - this is a sound list so okay
10:19 - so these are all the lists that we are
10:20 - going to be using so this will keep
10:22 - track of the item where they are
10:24 - and what type they are so you can have
10:25 - many type of item
10:27 - and this is the sound okay all right so
10:30 - we're going to create a block
10:34 - called clear list you can say run
10:37 - without refresh here
10:38 - it really doesn't matter for this one so
10:41 - we
10:42 - are going to clean up the list so say
10:45 - delete
10:47 - um delete all okay
10:51 - so we are going to say okay x position
10:57 - y position the type
11:03 - and the sound
11:07 - okay we're going to create another block
11:10 - and shall i sound
11:15 - okay so uh this one what we want to do
11:18 - is
11:19 - we're going to initialize the sound
11:22 - array list for that so that way later we
11:26 - will use it to play the
11:28 - sound so when we jump it will only play
11:30 - like one time so the among us when i had
11:32 - it the sound you know when you jump it
11:33 - will
11:34 - it'll play the sound multiple times
11:36 - right when you're holding down the
11:37 - up key so in order to fix that
11:41 - we'll use this um this is actually
11:42 - better so for now
11:44 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to run
11:47 - a loop
11:48 - through so here uh i only have like a
11:51 - couple of sounds so if you have more
11:52 - sound you have to initialize the loop
11:54 - uh the with the loop higher so let's
11:57 - just initial i5
11:58 - i don't have too many sound actually uh
12:01 - just a couple of sounds like jump sound
12:03 - later if you want to add like other
12:05 - sound and you can initialize it higher
12:08 - so i'll explain more later on so for now
12:10 - let's do a repeat five time
12:13 - and then let's go back to the variable
12:15 - we are going to say add
12:19 - okay zero so uh zero midnight is not
12:22 - playing the sound one is playing the
12:24 - sound
12:25 - so like zero is like a boolean value
12:27 - right it's false
12:28 - one is true so we're gonna use zero and
12:30 - one so this is an initial i
12:32 - uh basically when i run this you see
12:35 - that the sound list will have five
12:37 - things so let's say if i click on this
12:38 - right if i show the
12:40 - sound list you see it will have five
12:42 - zero okay
12:43 - so that's what it does so when i clear
12:45 - this it will delete everything
12:46 - okay so these are the uh um the block
12:50 - for us
12:51 - currently for resetting the sprites and
12:53 - all okay
12:54 - all right next we'll go to the uh
12:57 - when the green flag is clicked
13:01 - we are going to say uh set
13:04 - so we're gonna set set the level to one
13:08 - so first level and then
13:11 - we are going to set the live so let's
13:14 - give him
13:15 - five okay and
13:18 - um we are going to set the size
13:23 - of the cent uh set size to 30 but i
13:26 - might it's already 30 but i'm just
13:27 - setting again
13:29 - just in case and then we are saying go
13:32 - and say
13:32 - show so this is for the black main
13:35 - character
13:36 - okay and then what we're going to do
13:39 - we are going to broadcast and wait
13:42 - so this one we're going to broadcast i'm
13:45 - going to
13:46 - start new level
13:49 - and wait so what this is going to do is
13:51 - going to set up the whole
13:52 - game for us okay
13:56 - okay so we had created some of this
13:58 - custom block right so the reset
14:00 - what we're going to do is we're going to
14:02 - call the clear list and initialize sound
14:05 - so later we call reset or call all these
14:07 - things together
14:08 - okay so
14:12 - okay that's good so far so now let's
14:15 - move on to the next part
14:17 - so we have something called start new
14:19 - level right okay so
14:21 - we're gonna use this when i start as a
14:24 - new level
14:26 - i'm gonna call this reset so every time
14:29 - a new level will start it will reset all
14:31 - this stuff
14:33 - and then i am going to broadcast a
14:35 - couple message here
14:38 - so we will broadcast one
14:41 - message called reset
14:44 - so this one is actually going to help me
14:46 - reset the other sprite
14:48 - like the enemy the spikes and stuff like
14:50 - that at the position
14:52 - so that's why we did that and then we're
14:55 - gonna broadcast another one
14:57 - called setup
15:00 - so the setup will actually help me to
15:04 - set up all the sprites the reset will
15:05 - delete all the clones on the
15:07 - on the other stuff okay and then we'll
15:09 - call one more
15:10 - here this will say start
15:15 - game so start game will be the message
15:18 - that
15:19 - actually helped to start the game okay
15:22 - so this is starting a new level new
15:24 - level we'll call the reset set up the
15:26 - everything and then call start game
15:28 - okay okay so we have this start game
15:32 - uh what we're going to do is we say
15:34 - start game
15:37 - and then we'll go to look
15:40 - uh we are going to say change
15:44 - change calls effect by 100
15:50 - okay so we have the change goals effect
15:52 - 100 so that will
15:54 - hide the main character but we still
15:57 - need to have this watch show so that way
16:00 - you know it will be
16:02 - when you touch the ground it will be
16:04 - push the character back up basically you
16:06 - need that
16:07 - in order to uh you know have the
16:09 - character be standing on the ground
16:11 - okay next we are going to use the
16:14 - repeat until
16:18 - okay so we'll grab a repeat until put it
16:20 - down here
16:23 - and we're gonna get an operator here
16:26 - [Music]
16:28 - variable and put this here
16:33 - so basically we'll repeat keep on doing
16:35 - this until the player is dead
16:38 - we are going to set the position
16:43 - the starting position
16:47 - okay and
16:51 - uh the x position
16:54 - and then we gonna start to the y
16:57 - position
17:00 - okay stop this thing
17:04 - okay and then we are going to broadcast
17:06 - a message
17:12 - and we're going to call this start all
17:16 - control okay
17:20 - all right okay all right let me uh
17:23 - continue here let me take this guy out
17:27 - okay we're gonna make a new uh my block
17:31 - it's called movement
17:34 - control so select run without refresh
17:38 - here
17:39 - okay okay so we're gonna work on this
17:43 - movement control here
17:51 - okay we are going to get this so use the
17:53 - if and else here
17:56 - and then we are going to use the
17:58 - operator a
18:00 - n get another n
18:04 - okay i'm going to explain what this is
18:06 - going to be
18:08 - okay
18:13 - okay so oops we'll put this out here
18:16 - then
18:16 - so when key down is press
18:20 - down arrow and then we
18:23 - are going to duplicate this a
18:26 - right arrow so basically to slide you're
18:29 - gonna push it down on the right
18:32 - and then we are going to have one more
18:35 - check
18:36 - make sure like the animator um
18:40 - the type is zero so basically we want to
18:43 - make sure the
18:43 - user is not dead uh the player
18:46 - okay so this is a animated type
18:50 - we're gonna say zero because that's the
18:52 - defining that player is not dead
18:54 - so we're gonna put all that in here okay
18:58 - all right so what we have to do is we
19:00 - have to go through the slide first
19:01 - because
19:02 - life's combined with the right and left
19:04 - so i don't want
19:05 - the left and right arrow key to work
19:07 - while sliding
19:09 - so we have to put this first into here
19:12 - before we do the uh the left and right
19:15 - movement okay and then we are going to
19:18 - use another one
19:19 - called if
19:22 - another if inside here so this one is
19:26 - important you guys can pay attention
19:28 - here we're gonna use the not
19:30 - and then we're gonna use the equal
19:34 - and then we are going to use costume
19:38 - number two so we have custom number one
19:43 - and two basically there's a shorter one
19:45 - and this is a longer one so this is two
19:47 - and this is one
19:48 - so basically if it's not two we are
19:51 - going to switch
19:52 - the custom to two so basically if you're
19:54 - doing a slide
19:55 - i want to use the small costume this one
19:59 - okay so the hitbox is smaller okay
20:03 - okay and then we are going to say set
20:09 - and inside here say set the direction
20:14 - let's set it to right okay
20:17 - and then duplicate that uh set the run
20:22 - to zero so he's not running so basically
20:25 - one make sure that he's not running
20:28 - and set the slide to
20:31 - one one min is a true okay
20:34 - so that means he's sliding and then you
20:36 - can set the speed
20:40 - uh x to 10 so when it's sliding we're
20:42 - gonna make him go a little bit faster
20:45 - okay next we are going to have a if
20:48 - an else statement again down here
20:52 - i'll grab this uh if and else in the
20:54 - control put this
20:55 - in here okay and then we are going to
20:58 - duplicate this one on top
21:00 - i'm going to put it down here so now
21:02 - we're gonna do the
21:03 - left key okay left arrow key
21:08 - and then same thing uh put this here
21:10 - sorry
21:11 - and then we'll put this inside here okay
21:14 - so it's not costume 2 we're going to use
21:16 - the small costume and this time
21:18 - we are going to say left okay
21:22 - and then the speed we're going to say
21:24 - negative 10
21:25 - so this is going backward okay the left
21:28 - side
21:30 - okay now we are going to the final else
21:33 - here
21:33 - we are going to take this block again
21:37 - so this time will be a little bit
21:38 - different we are going to check
21:41 - if it's not number one so that means
21:44 - this is not the sliding motion they're
21:46 - gonna do the running motion
21:48 - so it's not number one we are going to
21:50 - switch it to number one
21:52 - okay okay so we're gonna grab another if
21:56 - and else
21:57 - we're gonna put it inside here
22:01 - ah let me see i did not hide anything
22:04 - behind it yeah
22:05 - i did move this down a little bit
22:08 - okay all right so now we're gonna check
22:10 - the left and right
22:12 - movement we're going to use the
22:15 - operator and
22:18 - and then we're using the key again
22:23 - so now we're going to check the right
22:25 - arrow key
22:27 - and same thing the animator type is uh
22:30 - still zero so it's not that the play is
22:34 - not that then we're gonna let them move
22:37 - so here we are putting right
22:41 - okay slide will be uh run will be one
22:44 - okay and then slide will be zero
22:49 - and then this will be positive seven
22:53 - okay so uh running is a little bit
22:56 - slower
22:56 - okay and then the else part we are going
22:59 - to
23:00 - throw another if and else can do
23:03 - okay so let's grab one more if and else
23:06 - condition
23:06 - put it in here duplicate this put it
23:10 - here
23:10 - this will be the left key and then
23:14 - duplicate that
23:15 - put this in here it's gonna go go left
23:22 - okay and then run this one slide is zero
23:25 - and this is negative seven okay
23:28 - all right and then otherwise we're gonna
23:31 - put all this
23:32 - inside here can't delete this
23:35 - so nothing here zero for running
23:39 - zero for sliding and zero for the speed
23:41 - so that's like when it's idling
23:43 - okay okay so we are going to go to the
23:46 - center
23:47 - what we're going to do is we're gonna
23:48 - make the center follow it real quick
23:50 - we'll do a quick code to test okay so
23:53 - go to here so when green flap is clicked
23:57 - okay uh we're gonna set the size
24:01 - to 30 as well so 30 size
24:05 - and then we are going to set the
24:06 - rotation style here
24:09 - okay left to right so this is the same
24:12 - thing as selecting this in the middle
24:13 - okay
24:16 - and then we are saying say go to
24:21 - go to front layer okay
24:24 - and then we're gonna say show
24:28 - okay and then we have the event last
24:30 - time right we
24:31 - broadcast some event which is called uh
24:34 - start all control
24:36 - we are saying we're gonna make it go to
24:39 - the
24:40 - main character okay so for now that's
24:44 - what we're going to have
24:45 - let's just check it out okay so before
24:49 - we do that we have to call the custom
24:50 - block right we just created here this
24:53 - movement control so where's my
24:56 - start all
25:00 - okay so we have this dot all control
25:02 - right so same thing for this
25:03 - we are going to say when i receive uh
25:07 - start all control
25:09 - we're gonna call this block let's see if
25:11 - it works i'm not sure
25:12 - i think it does let's see run it
25:16 - let's see nope not working yet
25:21 - okay so you know we're only setting the
25:24 - speed right we actually
25:25 - haven't moved the move uh the hitbox yes
25:28 - so we actually have to create another
25:30 - uh custom block for that okay so we'll
25:33 - go
25:33 - say more hitbox
25:37 - okay run without refresh
25:42 - okay so we are going to put it here for
25:44 - now
25:45 - oh we forgot uh put one for the
25:48 - parameter here
25:50 - say speed x
25:54 - okay
25:56 - all right so let me zoom in a little bit
26:00 - so here we are going to say
26:04 - change x okay by the speed x
26:07 - so make sure you guys use change check
26:09 - not set x okay
26:10 - and then we are going to say set the uh
26:15 - okay set the deviation here to zero
26:19 - and then we are going to say use the
26:22 - repeat
26:23 - until and
26:26 - use the all operator
26:30 - and then use this and then grab the
26:34 - deviation equal to eight so this is kind
26:37 - of actually testing if the
26:39 - hitbox uh hit the platform or not later
26:41 - on
26:43 - okay and then
26:46 - we are going to um so maybe we'll do
26:49 - that next time so let's just say move
26:51 - the hitbox
26:52 - for now okay we'll do this next time so
26:54 - i think it's uh
26:55 - taking a long time so we'll say move the
26:57 - hitbox
26:58 - and then changing the x okay so we are
27:02 - going to broadcast another message here
27:10 - new message
27:14 - check platform
27:18 - detection okay so we will set that up
27:21 - for next time
27:22 - so this check platform detection we want
27:25 - to use
27:27 - here and then for this check platform
27:29 - detection we are going to call the move
27:31 - hitbox
27:32 - okay and we are moving with the
27:36 - g speed x which is set
27:40 - by the this okay so for now let's just
27:43 - use this
27:44 - let's just check it out okay
27:47 - so i can change my uh loops i forgot to
27:51 - put this back to 100 i was testing
27:52 - something earlier so we'll hide this
27:54 - black box
27:55 - let's test it out so as you can see
27:58 - the santa claus is moving right but um
28:03 - it is not it is not changing like the
28:05 - slide
28:06 - and all that stuff right but uh so far
28:09 - it is moving
28:09 - okay so this is where we are so far so
28:12 - our next
28:13 - uh next tutorial we'll walk on cinder
28:16 - making him turn around moving and and
28:19 - then some sliding and then some
28:20 - platform um detection okay
28:24 - so this is what we have so far all right
28:27 - so
28:27 - if you guys uh miss anything uh just
28:30 - take a look over here so this is what we
28:32 - have so far for this on top
28:35 - okay and then this is the
28:39 - movement code okay
28:46 - you can pause the video if you need
28:48 - there's a lot of code here
28:50 - and then we have the
28:53 - uh control okay the start game and then
28:56 - the
28:56 - control and the move hitbox all right so
28:59 - this is the end of the video
