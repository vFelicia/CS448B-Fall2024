00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hey guys and welcome back to kids coding
00:09 - playground
00:10 - today we'll be making a scrolling maze
00:12 - in scratch so before we begin this
00:14 - demonstration of the game i would like
00:15 - to give some of the credits
00:17 - to uh rayleigh1123 for um
00:21 - designing the scrolling physics of this
00:23 - game we added some extra levels and
00:25 - stuff like that
00:26 - but his um account will be linked into
00:29 - the scrap
00:30 - in the description up below this video
00:32 - and he has also made a few videos
00:34 - for this channel so be sure to check his
00:36 - videos out
00:38 - all right so i'm going to start so
00:41 - i'm going to play it as you can see when
00:44 - you go right
00:45 - the maze scrolls to the right yeah it's
00:48 - like a little scrolling maze
00:49 - the player can look like it's moving so
00:52 - as you guys know in scrolling um things
00:55 - the player doesn't move
00:56 - it's the maze itself that actually moves
00:59 - so the player is actually staying in one
01:00 - place the maze is just moving simulating
01:03 - that the player is moving so i have two
01:05 - levels right now so let's beat this one
01:07 - and then we go to the second one
01:08 - so in the second level let's get to the
01:11 - exit
01:12 - she has just a pretty simple um
01:14 - scrolling maze
01:15 - and when you get to the end you win all
01:18 - right
01:20 - so first let's create a new project
01:23 - all right so in our new project let's
01:25 - rename our project
01:27 - to scroll maze
01:31 - oops scrolling maze okay we can keep the
01:34 - scratch cap let's just
01:35 - rename it to player we'll keep this
01:38 - trash can
01:39 - and um right here i'm going to import my
01:42 - own maze right here
01:44 - oops all right so this is the maze
01:49 - so you guys can make your own maze i
01:51 - think in another video i think it's the
01:53 - um
01:53 - mouse and the cheese video we also gave
01:56 - this maze away so you can check that
01:58 - video
01:59 - um it's the mouse maze runner game
02:02 - so you can check that out we have it in
02:04 - there or you can draw your own
02:07 - we'll also be putting this link through
02:08 - google drive to the this video
02:10 - description as well so if you'd like to
02:12 - take this maze you may
02:13 - you can also make your own all right so
02:16 - first in the maze
02:18 - i'll show you the costume so basically
02:19 - inside it's just um we have two costumes
02:22 - one is for this one so last time i
02:24 - accidentally resized this way too big
02:28 - so i guess we'll just keep it like this
02:31 - um we just have to set the x and y
02:34 - position to a little bit different
02:36 - place so as you can see these two are
02:38 - different sizes
02:40 - so our maze is basically just a bunch of
02:45 - us blocks all right
02:48 - let's go to the code for the maze so in
02:51 - the maze for the last game i did i
02:53 - put i'm going to zoom in so we're going
02:55 - to get it when you fly clicked
02:56 - and then i went to zero
03:00 - negative 194 this was the position i had
03:03 - last time
03:04 - all right and as you can see in our maze
03:06 - we have some costume called costume one
03:07 - which is a blank costume
03:09 - and we will need this so basically in
03:11 - scratch
03:12 - if you switch it to the first costume
03:15 - increase the size um
03:19 - and switch back to the first maze the
03:21 - maze one
03:22 - it will actually change the size of it
03:25 - so
03:26 - you can set this to like 600 and it'll
03:29 - actually set the size to 600
03:30 - without switching the costume it will
03:33 - it'll cap
03:33 - the limit at 150 actually so as you can
03:36 - see it did gets
03:37 - set to 600 size so putting that
03:40 - costume can actually help it will um
03:45 - somehow allow you to um actually switch
03:47 - it to the size amount you want so i'm
03:49 - going to set it back to 150
03:50 - because that's the one i had last time
03:52 - 150 is the perfect size
03:54 - i guess all right and then after this
03:57 - we're going to
03:57 - go get a rubber loop so forever
04:00 - okay if if that's even so if you're into
04:04 - the or
04:05 - so if the up arrow key or w key is
04:08 - pressed
04:08 - so we're going to do we're going to let
04:10 - the player use both the wasd
04:13 - or the arrow keys so w
04:17 - alright then we are going to change the
04:19 - y by negative seven
04:20 - so you may be asking why don't we change
04:22 - it by positive seven because we're going
04:24 - up
04:24 - well the background this means is
04:26 - scrolling right so we want to simulate
04:28 - the players going up so we have to make
04:30 - it go down
04:31 - so we're going to change the y
04:34 - by negative seven instead of positive
04:37 - negative seven
04:38 - and then we're going to get an if that
04:39 - seam and put that inside here
04:42 - so if it's touching the player
04:45 - so if the maze is touching the player
04:47 - we're not gonna let it go through the
04:48 - walls
04:49 - so we're gonna make it change the y by
04:51 - seven
04:53 - to not allow it to get past right
04:56 - and after that we're going to just
04:58 - duplicate this
05:00 - and put that under here so next we're
05:02 - going to do the down arrow so
05:03 - down arrows pressed um
05:06 - or the key s press
05:10 - s then we are going to change the y by
05:13 - seven
05:14 - so remember we have to simulate how it's
05:16 - scrolling
05:17 - so moving up for the maze is basically
05:19 - moving down for the cap
05:21 - and then we're going to change the y by
05:22 - negative seven if it tries to hit the
05:24 - wall
05:25 - alright so now we've finished the up and
05:26 - down movement let's duplicate all of
05:28 - this
05:29 - we're going to make the left and right
05:31 - movement now so when the left arrow
05:33 - key is pressed left arrow key or a key
05:36 - is pressed
05:37 - then we're going to we're going to
05:38 - change the x's time
05:40 - so instead um for the left arrow key we
05:43 - are going to
05:44 - change the x by 7 to simulate as if it's
05:47 - going to the left uh
05:49 - left so we're going to change the x by
05:51 - seven
05:54 - um change x by seven and put this back
05:57 - in
05:58 - and we're gonna take this out and we're
06:00 - gonna do change x
06:02 - by negative seven if it's touching the
06:04 - player so then it won't let it pass
06:06 - and same right here we're going to do if
06:09 - key
06:10 - right arrow or key b is pressed
06:13 - cd is pressed then we're going to take
06:15 - this out
06:17 - and then we're going to change the x by
06:19 - negative seven
06:21 - to make it as if the player is going to
06:22 - the right and then we're going to put
06:24 - this back in and then we're going to
06:26 - change the
06:27 - x by seven so we will not pass the ball
06:30 - so as you can see this is what we have
06:32 - so far
06:33 - it's the maze movement so yeah that's
06:35 - pretty much it
06:36 - so i'm gonna put the player right here
06:38 - so as you can see you can see the maze
06:40 - kind of move
06:41 - the player can't get past yeah as you
06:44 - can see
06:45 - we'll probably have to make the player a
06:46 - little bit smaller so it'll actually
06:48 - work so as you can see the scrolling is
06:49 - working now
06:51 - all right okay so inside the player
06:55 - we're gonna go into the player we have
06:56 - to add some code in here
06:58 - so in the beginning when green flag
07:00 - clicked inside the player
07:02 - let's see manila and green flag is
07:04 - clicked
07:05 - then we're gonna switch the costume to
07:07 - costume one
07:09 - i'm gonna make the player like have a
07:10 - little walk animation so we're gonna
07:12 - switch
07:13 - costume one and i wanna set the size of
07:15 - the player to 40
07:16 - in the beginning and then the position i
07:19 - had him at last time was
07:20 - negative 63 and the y position is 41.
07:25 - right and we're going to set the
07:27 - rotation style to left and right so it
07:29 - won't flip upside down when you're
07:30 - moving
07:31 - around and then we're just going to make
07:34 - the little
07:35 - uh walk cycle for the player so
07:38 - forever loop
07:41 - if left arrow
07:44 - or a is being pressed so we're gonna
07:48 - if key left arrow
07:52 - or key um
07:56 - a is pressed then we're gonna point
07:58 - direction of negative 90
08:00 - um i mean positive nine because it's
08:02 - right arrow i'm sorry this should be
08:04 - left arrow sorry
08:05 - so we're gonna do negative 90. so if key
08:08 - left arrow or a is pressed which is
08:10 - going to the left we're going to point
08:11 - direction to negative 90 which is going
08:13 - to the left
08:14 - and then we're going to do next costume
08:17 - and then we're going to wait at 0.1
08:18 - seconds
08:20 - okay or else it'll look way too quick
08:23 - and then we're going to duplicate this
08:24 - in time so when the key
08:28 - right arrow is pressed or key d
08:31 - oops d and we're going to put in the
08:34 - direction of 90
08:36 - instead of negative 90. okay and then
08:38 - duplicate this we're going to do the up
08:39 - and down
08:40 - walk cycle so instead for the up and
08:43 - down we're just going to take this
08:45 - point direction out so i'm not going to
08:47 - make the when you're going up or down
08:49 - i'll point in any direction so we're
08:51 - going to go up arrow and w
08:54 - and we're just going to do the next
08:56 - costume and then we're going to do down
08:58 - arrow or s
09:02 - so i'm not going to make it point in any
09:04 - direction when you're going up and down
09:05 - so let's take that out
09:08 - all right so let's play it all right so
09:12 - i'll show you the code real quick so
09:13 - let's just
09:14 - move in walk costumes
09:18 - awesome okay as you can see the
09:22 - maze is scrolling around and the player
09:25 - is
09:25 - um has has a little walk cycle
09:30 - a little walking animation as you can
09:32 - see you can still
09:35 - do this as you can't we haven't coded to
09:37 - go to the next level yet
09:39 - so yeah so now the player can actually
09:41 - walk around and the maze actually kind
09:42 - of scrolls
09:44 - all right let's go back to the maze for
09:47 - a second
09:48 - all right so we're going to make a timer
09:52 - we're going to make a timer timer so
09:55 - we're going to
09:56 - show the timer and then when green fly
09:58 - clicks
09:59 - you're going to set the timer to zero
10:02 - we're just going to make a little timer
10:03 - running in the background we're also
10:04 - going to add a high score
10:05 - stuff like that and then we're going to
10:07 - get a forever loop
10:09 - we're going to get a control
10:12 - um control forever
10:16 - we're going to set the timer variable
10:19 - to the timer right here
10:22 - so we can actually control it using the
10:24 - variable all right
10:26 - and next we're going to allow the player
10:28 - advance to the next level
10:31 - so when greenfly clicked
10:34 - so right here um so remember as i said
10:38 - when you go down
10:39 - with the player the maze is moving up
10:42 - because it simulates the player going
10:44 - down
10:46 - so let's go to the end real quick
10:49 - so as you can see in the maze sprite
10:51 - right here the coordinates are moving
10:53 - repeatedly so let's say
10:57 - the y position is greater than 370.
11:00 - so when the y position is greater than
11:02 - 370
11:03 - like about right here then we are going
11:05 - to
11:06 - switch the costume to costume 2 which is
11:08 - the second maze
11:10 - so once the y position for the maze
11:12 - passes like right here
11:14 - then we're going to switch um the
11:17 - backdrop
11:17 - i mean the costume to the next maze so
11:20 - we're going to have forever loop
11:22 - if the y position
11:26 - is greater than
11:29 - y position is greater than
11:32 - 370.
11:36 - 370 then we're going to switch the
11:38 - costume to maze 2
11:40 - just the second maze and then we're
11:43 - going to make the player
11:44 - i mean we're going to make the maze go
11:46 - back to its original position
11:50 - as i have right here all right
11:54 - so now we can play it let's get to the
11:57 - end
11:57 - it should work
12:03 - all right see as you can see as soon as
12:05 - we got past
12:06 - the y position is greater than 370 we
12:09 - automatically went to the next level
12:11 - so after this level i'm going to allow
12:12 - the player to win so we're going to get
12:14 - an if then seaman again
12:17 - so if let's play it i want to see
12:20 - um how what the exposition has to be
12:23 - greater than
12:25 - in order for the player to um win
12:28 - so right here i'm going to keep on going
12:32 - so the exit's right here so let's say
12:35 - the x position is uh less than
12:40 - um if it's less than a certain amount we
12:42 - will
12:43 - let it um pass so let's say um
12:46 - [Music]
12:49 - uh maybe like right here negative 448
12:52 - okay so if the x position
12:56 - is less than so as you can see the maze
12:59 - is moving to the left because
13:00 - it's scrolling so we're going to do if
13:02 - the x position
13:03 - is less than negative 448
13:08 - negative 448 now we're going to
13:10 - broadcast a message
13:12 - and called win
13:16 - and we're going to stop this for now and
13:17 - then we're going to make a message let's
13:19 - name it win
13:20 - all right so now we're going to make a
13:22 - new sprite
13:25 - and we're going to paint it excuse the
13:28 - text i'm going to make it green
13:31 - swine on i'm going to write you
13:35 - you win i want to capitalize that you
13:38 - win
13:41 - let's make it big all right center the
13:44 - sprites
13:45 - all right now we have the u in text
13:47 - we're going to code in it so let's
13:49 - rename this right real quick to win
13:51 - and then we're going to go to the code
13:53 - so inside the code for the you win
13:54 - spread we're going to one greenfield
13:55 - click go to
13:56 - zero zero which is the origin of the
13:59 - um screen and then we're going to go to
14:03 - the front layer and we're going to hide
14:06 - okay
14:08 - and then when i receive the message when
14:10 - on the windsprite
14:12 - we're going to show
14:16 - and right now we're going to make a new
14:18 - variable we're going to
14:20 - this is high score we're going to make
14:21 - it a cloud variable so it will
14:23 - store on the server we're going to name
14:26 - it
14:26 - high score high score all right
14:30 - let's put the high score on like this
14:32 - side
14:34 - um and so inside here we are going to
14:39 - get an if that statement so under
14:41 - receive win
14:42 - show if the timer is less than
14:45 - the high score so basically the lower
14:48 - the time
14:48 - is the better the score is because this
14:50 - is like a speed run game
14:52 - kind of so the timer is less than high
14:54 - score
14:56 - that we're going to set the variable
14:57 - high score to the timer
14:59 - and we're going to stop all after this
15:02 - all right
15:04 - so now let's test out our game
15:09 - oh yeah and i forgot let's reset our
15:12 - high score real quick
15:14 - set high score back to zero
15:18 - actually let's set it to like 50 or
15:19 - something so then we can easily break
15:21 - this high score
15:26 - all right let's go full screen
15:29 - all right as you can see
15:32 - we are able to move around let's see
15:35 - exit we go on to the second level
15:39 - also if you want to add ops uh like
15:40 - coins or something don't put them into
15:42 - the maze spread because it will not work
15:43 - it'll just keep on bouncing out
15:46 - because we already have coded that if
15:48 - the cat is touching it it won't go
15:50 - through
15:51 - and as you can see once it's greater
15:53 - less than some position you'll see you
15:54 - win
15:55 - and it'll set the high score to the
15:56 - fastest time so let's say i do this even
15:58 - quicker
15:59 - than what i did before
16:02 - then it should set
16:06 - this new high score um in place of the
16:09 - other one
16:11 - as you can see the high score has
16:13 - changed
16:14 - so yeah that's pretty much for today's
16:16 - tutorial
16:17 - um scrolling maze so thank you guys for
16:20 - watching
