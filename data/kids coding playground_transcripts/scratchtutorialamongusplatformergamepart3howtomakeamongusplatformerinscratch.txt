00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to kids
00:10 - calling playground
00:11 - so today we're doing the uh among us
00:14 - platformer
00:15 - part 3 so
00:19 - before i start please like share and
00:21 - subscribe to our channel
00:22 - i really appreciate it that will really
00:25 - help us a lot
00:26 - so don't forget to give us a thumbs up
00:30 - on the video
00:31 - and share with your friends let them
00:33 - know about our channel
00:34 - that would be great okay all right so
00:38 - we are going to start working on the
00:41 - animated character today
00:42 - but before we go through that let's just
00:44 - check the code make sure that
00:46 - you guys have all the code that you
00:47 - needed so this is the code
00:50 - for the main character which is the
00:52 - black box that we're moving around
00:54 - so you guys can see let me zoom in one
00:57 - more time
00:58 - so this is the start and this is all the
01:01 - custom
01:02 - function that we define okay
01:05 - and then this is the starting of the
01:08 - start game which is called by start and
01:11 - then call
01:12 - out the other function here okay so
01:14 - we're gonna move over to this side
01:18 - so let me go here and let me zoom out
01:21 - once
01:23 - so this is the jump control the move hit
01:25 - box and
01:26 - checking the sprite hitting the ground
01:29 - okay so this is all for the main
01:31 - character and then the
01:33 - this is for the animated character okay
01:36 - so uh
01:37 - last what we left off was we're able to
01:40 - jump
01:41 - and walk and jump so we're gonna animate
01:44 - this
01:45 - character the anime character now
01:48 - okay all right so in the anime character
01:52 - uh what we can do is
01:55 - we can check with the looks here
01:59 - set this up for 50 just in case but uh
02:03 - if not it's already there here
02:05 - okay and then what we want to um
02:08 - um what we want to do is if the actually
02:11 - if the users
02:12 - uh if the player is not moving we want
02:14 - to put in the idle stage if it's moving
02:16 - then we're going to make him run
02:18 - running animation so what we did is put
02:21 - another if control here
02:23 - if statement okay same
02:27 - operator user n
02:31 - and what you need is a knot
02:35 - okay and then there's something called
02:37 - key press
02:40 - uh not any key press
02:43 - n and then we have this variable last
02:47 - time
02:47 - on the ground that we defined to test
02:50 - the place on the ground or not
02:52 - so we'll use this and for we're using
02:55 - one
02:56 - one is on the ground zero is not on the
02:58 - ground so we're gonna say
02:59 - if there's no key press and the play is
03:02 - on the ground
03:03 - then we are going to change it to
03:06 - the idle costume okay so the idle
03:09 - costume we put it at the last
03:11 - it really doesn't really matter in the
03:13 - beginning or last but
03:15 - i think on my sprite and last okay
03:18 - this little guy idle
03:21 - okay so this is for this part let's zoom
03:23 - out a little bit
03:25 - let's move over here uh what we're going
03:28 - to do is we're going to make the
03:29 - animated character runs around and
03:31 - switching costume
03:33 - so we're going to drag another green
03:35 - flag that's clicked
03:37 - now let me zoom in yeah from here
03:41 - and then we're going to use this forever
03:43 - loop here
03:48 - and then we are going to use the if
03:51 - statement here
03:54 - and then we do the sensing block
03:59 - if the right arrow is pressed
04:03 - uh what we want to do is we're going to
04:05 - point in neither direction pointing to
04:07 - the right
04:08 - so this guy is facing to the right this
04:12 - side
04:14 - and then we are going to use a condition
04:17 - here
04:21 - and we are going to use operator
04:25 - and go back to look
04:28 - getting the custom custom name select
04:31 - name
04:33 - equal to idle so basically
04:36 - we're saying yeah because the loop goes
04:39 - through right it runs
04:40 - all these different kind of uh costumes
04:43 - right
04:43 - if we get to the idle we don't want to
04:45 - display that while it's moving
04:47 - we'll move it back to walk one okay
04:50 - so what we're going to do is if it goes
04:52 - to idle the custom music of the item
04:54 - i'm gonna switch it back to walk
04:57 - one else we'll say next costume
05:01 - okay and after that we want to put a
05:04 - little bit of weight
05:06 - oops sorry put that under here
05:11 - and now we're going to wait 0.02
05:14 - so that's how i i tried a different
05:16 - combination i think now
05:18 - 002 looks good actually look pretty
05:21 - smooth
05:21 - if you wanted to move slower you can
05:24 - move it up
05:25 - and make it like zero five or something
05:27 - like that okay
05:28 - so for me i put it zero zero two it
05:31 - looks a little bit more smooth so we'll
05:32 - duplicate this so this time we are going
05:35 - to
05:36 - make the left arrow
05:39 - and we are going to make it this
05:41 - negative 90 pointing to the left
05:44 - same thing for this part okay
05:47 - and we are going to put it under here
05:51 - there's a web right arrow up arrow and
05:53 - then
05:54 - what we want to do is when the player
05:56 - jumps up we also want to do a
05:58 - something so want to have a different
05:59 - costume so put that
06:01 - here duplicate this
06:06 - up arrow and we just pick a random one i
06:10 - guess doesn't matter which one
06:12 - we'll pick the uh i think the first one
06:14 - first one is okay
06:16 - so when it jumps up put on you this
06:18 - custom otherwise you know we can't run
06:20 - through the
06:21 - thing okay
06:24 - all right so what we want to do is also
06:26 - we want to have play some sound
06:28 - so i think when if you guys took my
06:30 - sprite you have already have some sound
06:32 - oh
06:33 - i don't have it on this one okay because
06:35 - i create brand new
06:36 - so um but i think i have it in the main
06:40 - character
06:41 - let's see i have oh i also don't have it
06:44 - oh because i created this brand new
06:47 - so i don't have it so i'll upload some
06:49 - sound uh
06:50 - basically you can use like a jump sound
06:53 - or walk sound i have some of those
06:55 - already
06:57 - let me just upload that
07:01 - okay so let's go back to our animated
07:03 - character
07:04 - um having a backpack
07:07 - complete walk and then uh jump
07:11 - so we're gonna use this to sound uh you
07:13 - can use a jump sound from uh
07:15 - sprite i mean not from scratch also but
07:17 - i don't like that jump sound this is
07:19 - another one
07:20 - it's like this like uh like that
07:24 - it sounds okay so i think that sounds
07:27 - let me
07:27 - make it a little bit louder you guys can
07:29 - hear it
07:31 - so let's check like that and then the
07:34 - walk is like
07:38 - okay all right so that's what the two
07:41 - sound we're going to use okay let's go
07:44 - back
07:46 - so let me minimize this again so this
07:50 - is so far what we have for the uh uh
07:53 - walking
07:53 - and jumping okay and what we want to do
07:56 - we want to make some sound while he's
07:57 - walking
07:59 - okay all right
08:03 - so we'll put this um here
08:06 - [Music]
08:07 - and also we want to calculate how many
08:09 - depth the player had we can become
08:11 - variable
08:17 - make it for all sprites so i just put it
08:20 - like right here and then level on this
08:21 - side
08:22 - or the other one i don't need let's just
08:24 - take these guys out
08:26 - and then the main character i think
08:28 - we're good with those jumping
08:30 - and the deviation we're testing last
08:31 - time so i think i took that out
08:33 - okay let's go back here okay so back
08:36 - into the animated sprite
08:37 - um in the beginning we'll set the depth
08:40 - to zero
08:42 - and now if you if you think your sound
08:44 - is too loud
08:46 - uh you can set it like a sound like uh
08:51 - sound here you can set it like 50 or
08:53 - something like that
08:54 - volume let's just keep it 100 right now
08:57 - see how it goes
08:58 - if it's too loud we can set it at 50. i
09:00 - think in my original game i had at 50
09:02 - but let's just see
09:04 - okay so
09:07 - you can put the uh forever
09:10 - okay and what we want to do is we're
09:13 - gonna use the uh
09:14 - if condition here
09:15 - [Music]
09:19 - oops sorry got the wrong so if condition
09:24 - um and then we are going to use the
09:26 - operator or here
09:29 - and we are going to take this duplicate
09:32 - that
09:33 - [Music]
09:34 - take this hit that so we're saying if
09:37 - it's
09:38 - left or right uh arrows press
09:42 - and then we don't want to play the sound
09:43 - all the time because
09:45 - we'll be too annoying so what we're
09:47 - going to do is we're going to add
09:48 - another if statement inside here
09:53 - okay or you can put an end condition
09:57 - here as well it's okay but i think it's
09:59 - too long
09:59 - it looks kind of hard to see i mean from
10:02 - scratch but in other programming you can
10:04 - just add them up so you can do
10:05 - all at the end but i think i don't want
10:08 - to confuse you guys we'll put it inside
10:09 - here
10:10 - and what you can do is you're going to
10:13 - use another operator
10:14 - [Music]
10:16 - and you can check the costume
10:20 - [Music]
10:22 - so what's that costume number
10:25 - okay so we just put six so we have 12
10:30 - costumes right
10:31 - one two three four five six seven and
10:32 - then twelve right so what i'm saying is
10:35 - when i get to number six costume we're
10:37 - gonna play the sound
10:38 - or seven doesn't matter so just pick one
10:41 - something like that
10:43 - and then we say play
10:47 - the walking sound until done
10:51 - and then we are going to get another
10:53 - operator here
10:57 - and then we'll take this and we wanna
10:59 - say up
11:01 - and then we're gonna play the jump sound
11:04 - until done
11:07 - okay so we have the sound already in
11:09 - this game
11:10 - and we have the movement of the uh of
11:13 - the sprite
11:14 - okay let's just see how it looks okay
11:17 - all right
11:18 - so you can hear the step
11:23 - jump okay
11:27 - seems to be okay right
11:31 - okay all right so we have our little man
11:34 - that is
11:35 - walking and jumping and if it's not
11:38 - walking and jumping then he'll go into
11:40 - the idle stage as you can see
11:43 - will stay back in this idle stage
11:46 - right so i think it's working fine
11:49 - perfectly fine
11:51 - all right okay okay
11:54 - so what we can do is we are going to set
11:56 - up some of the
11:57 - bounce pad we can work on uh
12:01 - let's see okay let's go on and work on
12:05 - the jump pad
12:07 - i have it in my backpack i'll provide a
12:09 - sprite for you guys i'll upload later in
12:11 - the google drive so
12:13 - um this is the trampoline that we had
12:17 - so um we have all the custom here a
12:19 - costume
12:20 - okay just kind of animate it if you
12:22 - don't want this you can just draw your
12:24 - own
12:25 - like a little pad and then we'll stick
12:27 - okay
12:28 - but uh this one we have a costume uh
12:31 - animate so it looked like a little
12:32 - bouncy pad
12:34 - okay all right so we have this so before
12:37 - we do
12:38 - that we actually have to go back to the
12:39 - main character here
12:41 - uh what we're going to do is we're going
12:43 - to the broadcast another message here
12:47 - uh to the uh to set up the uh
12:50 - you know set up the uh the um the stage
12:54 - with the jump pad and stuff like that
12:57 - okay here we'll create one more
12:59 - broadcast
13:01 - it's a new message say start
13:06 - new level
13:09 - okay and then when i receive
13:16 - a start new level
13:19 - uh what we want to do is we're gonna
13:21 - broadcast two more
13:22 - message actually but um this time we are
13:24 - going to have the broadcast and wait
13:29 - so that we can um we can send the uh
13:32 - send the notification to all the sprite
13:35 - so that they could set up
13:36 - before it actually do something okay
13:39 - so we're gonna make a new message reset
13:46 - and wait okay and then duplicate this
13:49 - or make a new message called setup
13:54 - okay so this one new calls this too
13:58 - okay so we are going to set this up for
14:00 - the trampoline here
14:06 - okay in the trampoline we're gonna start
14:09 - with this
14:09 - [Music]
14:11 - and we are going to hide it
14:13 - [Music]
14:14 - okay and then we remember we broadcast
14:17 - our reset
14:18 - so let's get this
14:21 - thing as reset so we're going to use
14:24 - clone for this instead of hide and show
14:26 - that way it will give us more control
14:28 - and you can have multiple jump pad on
14:30 - the same level um
14:32 - if you use high-end show you're going to
14:34 - only have one so here we can say
14:37 - uh when the reset we make sure that we
14:39 - delete the clone because we're using
14:40 - clone so you have to
14:42 - make sure you delete it it's okay
14:47 - and okay and then what we're going to do
14:50 - is we're going to create a new block
14:53 - all right okay
14:57 - and say place
14:59 - [Music]
15:00 - clone
15:04 - okay i'm going to place a clone at this
15:06 - position
15:07 - i'll put fix and then have one more
15:11 - say y let me
15:14 - remember to select this run without
15:16 - refresh okay
15:18 - okay so i'm gonna define this code here
15:23 - and also we need to create two variable
15:26 - okay here make sure you create oh
15:29 - okay i already have x and y i think i
15:31 - copied from the whole
15:32 - thing yeah x and y but if not when you
15:35 - create this x and y variable
15:37 - make sure you create it for like this
15:40 - sprite only okay
15:41 - that's right only so you create x and y
15:44 - variable
15:45 - okay uh since i copy from the my
15:48 - old code i already have x and y variable
15:51 - okay i don't have to create it but if
15:52 - you have to make sure you create for x
15:53 - and y
15:54 - for this variable for this right only
15:57 - okay we're gonna set
16:00 - okay set the x to the x
16:05 - let's go faster i think almost time
16:09 - uh y and then what we're going to do is
16:12 - let's switch to
16:13 - costume number one okay the trampoline
16:16 - number one
16:18 - and then we'll say show
16:21 - and then we're gonna call the
16:25 - create clone myself okay
16:29 - okay you remember we have to uh set up
16:32 - here we have one
16:33 - for reset and one for setup right so we
16:35 - have to call this setup
16:37 - as well so let's duplicate this
16:40 - select setup delete that
16:43 - so what we're going to do is we're going
16:46 - to set the
16:48 - just to reset the variable for now set
16:51 - the reset to x and y
16:53 - to zero and then what we can do is uh
16:56 - you can um
16:57 - have an if condition here
17:01 - and then we're gonna check the level
17:05 - okay check the level
17:08 - go to one so level one let's say we are
17:11 - going to clone
17:12 - place the clone at this position let's
17:15 - say
17:15 - somewhere around here or whatever it
17:17 - doesn't matter right
17:19 - so let's just put 10 i don't know i
17:21 - think this is my some of my old
17:22 - coordinates i have
17:24 - 10 and then
17:25 - [Music]
17:28 - negative 28 or something i don't
17:30 - remember what i mean
17:31 - yeah it's negative 28 that's i think
17:33 - that's what i had
17:34 - earlier but uh you can see you can just
17:37 - show this and then you can place it
17:39 - anywhere you want
17:41 - so we want to actually place it here
17:42 - let's just go to the first custom first
17:45 - so let's say we want to place it here
17:47 - yeah let's just do this instead of this
17:49 - so
17:49 - you see that position right so go over
17:52 - here
17:53 - uh you see the position make sure your
17:54 - game is stopped so let's say you want to
17:56 - jump out here so you're 34 right so just
17:58 - put 34
18:01 - and then say negative 97
18:04 - something like that so on first stage
18:06 - we'll have the jump pad here
18:09 - okay so let's go so
18:12 - now we have to create this code now when
18:16 - i start as a clone
18:19 - so now is the real code here
18:23 - okay so what we want to do is we're
18:25 - gonna
18:26 - move this to this position
18:29 - and we are going to use the variable x
18:32 - and y
18:32 - here okay so which is coming from here
18:37 - so 3497
18:40 - and what we're going to do is we're
18:41 - going to put foreign
18:44 - in here and we are going to check
18:50 - if it touch the main character
18:54 - so everything is controlled by the main
18:56 - character okay so that's why we want to
18:58 - check we'll touch that
18:59 - and then what we can do broadcast
19:02 - [Music]
19:05 - new message bounce so this will balance
19:09 - the other guy
19:10 - and then we have a repeat loop
19:13 - we'll do eight times and
19:17 - we are going to send the next costume
19:19 - okay
19:21 - and then after that we'll switch it back
19:23 - to uh
19:24 - custom number one okay so just in case
19:28 - you know it
19:29 - it goes out of sync you know we still
19:32 - want to change it back to one
19:34 - so basically you know after bounce it'll
19:36 - change it back to one so i did a because
19:38 - we have a custom here okay
19:41 - okay all right so that is done
19:44 - so now i want to go back to the main
19:47 - character here
19:51 - okay in the main character uh all sense
19:53 - we have bounce right so we need to type
19:55 - event
19:56 - with the listen for that event
20:00 - when i receive bounce
20:03 - i use the set variable
20:06 - we're going to set the velocity to 25
20:11 - so it gives you a higher bounce okay
20:13 - let's
20:14 - save it and let's put some blocks into
20:18 - the
20:18 - background let's test it out so
20:21 - let's see we'll put this box here
20:27 - okay copy let's just put it over here
20:30 - oh can i put them on top of that guy
20:36 - okay something like this okay
20:39 - just for testing okay save it
20:43 - let's run it real quick okay
20:46 - so our guy is still working fine with
20:50 - the
20:50 - footstep sound and the jump sound
20:54 - so you see that so we can jump up
20:58 - jump up
21:02 - okay see
21:06 - okay all right so we're good with that
21:09 - so so far so good so now so next thing
21:13 - we will work on like changing the level
21:15 - and stuff like that
21:16 - so for right now these guys are working
21:19 - fine
21:19 - he's able to jump okay
21:23 - okay all right
21:27 - okay we'll stop right here i will see
21:29 - you guys next time
