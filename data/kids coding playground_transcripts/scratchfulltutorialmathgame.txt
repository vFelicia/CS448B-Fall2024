00:04 - [Music]
00:12 - so welcome back guys to another tutorial
00:14 - on kids coding playground today we will
00:16 - be doing a math game so the players can
00:19 - choose any operation such as addition
00:22 - multiplication uh Division and
00:24 - subtraction or you can pick a random
00:26 - operation so it'll choose a random one
00:28 - for you to play and the player can
00:30 - choose a type of operation and they
00:32 - would like to play and the cat will ask
00:34 - the math problems for each um operation
00:37 - so let's say you click on multiplication
00:39 - the cat will start asking questions for
00:41 - multiplication if you click on
00:43 - subtraction the M cat will start uh
00:46 - asking questions for
00:48 - subtraction so today we'll be learning
00:51 - these following concepts in scratch
00:53 - variables custom blocks broadcasting
00:55 - messages loops and we'll be using a
00:57 - bunch of operator blocks
01:00 - we can later expand this math game into
01:02 - a math racing game which I did for my
01:04 - tech fair about like two years ago and I
01:07 - got third place on the tech fair so
01:10 - later we can expand to that but first
01:12 - we'll need to work on the regular math
01:14 - racing game uh math game so I'll demo
01:17 - the game for you guys so um so in the
01:21 - beginning I just say let's play a math
01:23 - game answer the following questions
01:24 - press quit to stop all questions that's
01:26 - just a stop all choose one of the
01:29 - operations or Rand random so let me show
01:30 - you when you click on random it'll pick
01:32 - a random operation for you as you can
01:34 - see so I'm just going to um so when you
01:37 - get a a question correct it'll say that
01:39 - is correct and let's say if I get a
01:41 - question wrong on purpose like it'll say
01:43 - wrong
01:43 - number and there's also a different
01:46 - modes today we'll be working on addition
01:48 - and subtraction I think that's all we'll
01:51 - have time for we'll work on
01:53 - multiplication and division in the later
01:55 - videoos so let's see addition so 33 + 20
01:59 - that's
02:03 - 53 that's 40 so if you get it right they
02:06 - you'll get more score as you can see in
02:08 - the top right corner you can get more
02:10 - score so yeah that's pretty much the
02:13 - game so let's start a new
02:20 - project okay so we can keep the cat for
02:23 - now and um if you want to make a
02:25 - backdrop you can um so I just made like
02:29 - a little green backdrop with like no
02:33 - outline
02:36 - um and I just like use the darker green
02:40 - on this side like that and I just drew a
02:44 - square uh you guys can do whatever you
02:47 - guys would like I'm just going to make a
02:49 - backdrop so this is going to be my
02:51 - backdrop and we're going to keep the cat
02:54 - um I can rename it a cat actually but in
02:56 - the old one I just still had a es Sprite
02:58 - one but um and then we'll need to make
03:01 - some buttons I already have them in my
03:03 - backpack today we'll be making the
03:05 - addition and subtraction ones um and the
03:08 - quit button uh that's all we'll have
03:10 - time for I
03:12 - think so uh for the so for the addition
03:18 - um all we did was just drew a square a a
03:21 - rectangle and then wrote addition and
03:24 - same for subtraction we just drew a
03:26 - rectangle and then wrote um the word sub
03:29 - Direction and then for the quit button
03:31 - just a circle and then I wrote quit so
03:34 - that's it for the um three
03:37 - buttons and let's go working on the code
03:39 - now so actually first we need to create
03:42 - some variables so we're going to make a
03:44 - variable called answer to
03:50 - problem answer to
03:54 - problem
03:56 - problem so make this answer your problem
03:58 - it's for all Sprites
04:00 - and then we'll need to make another
04:02 - variable called guess so this is what
04:05 - the um player guesses as the answer and
04:08 - then we have the random number one which
04:10 - is the number picking the random number
04:14 - which is the first number they'll pick
04:17 - and then we also have a second number
04:19 - random number
04:22 - two and then we'll need to create one
04:24 - more called random
04:26 - game and score we need to create two
04:29 - more actually actually so Random game so
04:31 - this is for the um so let's say you
04:33 - click the random button it'll pick a
04:35 - random game so this is what it's for and
04:37 - then you have to make
04:39 - score and then we can delete my variable
04:42 - this is not use so this is all we have
04:45 - for now so let's go to the cat get a one
04:48 - fly clicked so one fly clicked um we're
04:51 - going to hide some
04:53 - variables so um I'm going to hide the
04:57 - variable score in the
05:01 - beginning actually no we don't need this
05:03 - we don't need to hide the variable we
05:04 - could just keep it showing I guess if
05:06 - you want I'm going keep the score on the
05:08 - right side so I'm going to get a one fly
05:12 - click and then I'm going to um show the
05:15 - variable
05:17 - score actually no we don't need that cuz
05:19 - it's already showing and I'm just going
05:21 - to make it say let's play a math
05:28 - game math game
05:32 - oops so let's play a math game I'll say
05:35 - it for like 2 seconds and then I'll
05:38 - duplicate it we're just going to tell
05:40 - them the instructions how to play in the
05:42 - beginning and then I'm going to say
05:44 - answer the following
05:50 - questions and then I'm going to do it a
05:53 - duplicate two more one is press
05:57 - quit the quit button
06:01 - to stop all
06:06 - question stop all questions so this is
06:08 - just a stop all and then one more we'll
06:12 - do a
06:13 - choose one of the
06:17 - operations
06:18 - or random so this these will be the
06:23 - instructions so if you guys want to make
06:25 - it um less less like less saying then
06:28 - you can just put all of the instructions
06:30 - in one say and just make it for a longer
06:33 - time so I just did it like this but you
06:36 - guys can do it any uh
06:38 - differently so I'm going to make a new
06:41 - variable right now I mean new
06:43 - broadcast I'm going to name it choose
06:46 - game so this this is just to uh select
06:49 - the game so choosing game so let's go
06:52 - into our addition and subtraction so for
06:55 - addition I'm going to get a one receive
06:56 - choose game we want to show so it um
07:00 - show up in the beginning and in the
07:01 - beginning we want to hide when flly
07:03 - clicked we want to
07:04 - hide um sorry
07:08 - hide so I'm going to zoom in a little
07:11 - bit uh when I when this Sprite is
07:15 - clicked so I'm going to do two more
07:17 - broadcasts one is called start
07:20 - game and one is called start
07:22 - Edition game and we'll make another one
07:25 - called start addition letting the player
07:27 - know it'll start the addition
07:30 - start start
07:33 - Edition start Edition and then when I
07:36 - receive start game we want to hide the
07:39 - button it is no longer needed after the
07:41 - game has started start game we want to
07:45 - hide and then um this part is not
07:49 - necessary but you guys can add it if you
07:51 - would like it's just to make your game
07:53 - look better so when you put your mouse
07:55 - on it it'll get bigger and smaller so
07:57 - just get a forever Loop uh
08:01 - if touching Mouse
08:04 - pointer then we can set the size to
08:09 - 85% uh else set it to
08:13 - 100 there are many other ways to do it
08:16 - but uh the other ways are a little bit
08:18 - more difficult so this is just an easier
08:20 - way of doing it um so now let's go back
08:24 - to the cat so for the cat we're going to
08:27 - have to make some custom blocks so we're
08:30 - going to get um a new custom block let's
08:33 - name it
08:35 - addition
08:38 - addition
08:41 - addition addition I think that's how you
08:43 - spell it but addition so we're going to
08:45 - define the addition block so let's
08:47 - define the addition block right now
08:49 - let's get a forever
08:50 - Loop and then in the beginning we want
08:53 - to set the guess to
08:55 - zero so the guess is zero in the
08:58 - beginning so so we set it to zero and
09:01 - then we want to set the random number
09:02 - one to pick random 1 to 100 so for
09:05 - addition it will pick random 1 to 100
09:10 - so um pick random 1 to 100 so the first
09:13 - number will pick random 1 to 100 and
09:16 - then we want to set the second number
09:18 - pick random number two to also pick
09:20 - random one to 100 and then we're going
09:23 - to use the variable set answer to
09:25 - problem to random number one plus the
09:27 - random number two which is the first
09:29 - number number which you pick random it
09:31 - could be like 25 or something and then
09:33 - the second one could be like 10 and you
09:35 - add them together so you get an addition
09:37 - operator so you add the random number
09:40 - one which is a random number pick one to
09:42 - 100 and random number two which is a
09:44 - pick random one to 100 so you add them
09:48 - up oops put that back in like random
09:52 - number one plus random number
09:55 - two and then I'm going to zoom in a
09:57 - little bit more so you guys can see it
09:59 - better and then we're going to get a
10:00 - repeat
10:02 - until so we're going to repeat until
10:05 - guess is equal to answer to problem so
10:07 - it will repeat until the answer is right
10:10 - so the guess is what the player inputs
10:13 - and the um answer to problem is the
10:16 - um answer to the problem the random
10:20 - number one plus the random number
10:22 - two and then we're going to ask
10:27 - ask ask join random number one join the
10:31 - add addition symbol random number two so
10:33 - it will ask what is the random number
10:37 - one plus random number two so we're
10:40 - going to
10:42 - join just pop that in there get in uh
10:47 - another join we need two joins and put
10:50 - it in here so we're going to get join
10:53 - the random number
10:55 - one addition symbol
10:59 - and then random number two like that so
11:03 - ask that and then we and then after that
11:06 - we want to set the guess to the answer
11:08 - which is the answer right
11:10 - here the correct answer and then if the
11:15 - answer is equal to random number one
11:16 - plus random number two so this is just
11:18 - to check if the player has got the right
11:21 - answer so if random number one is if the
11:25 - answer is equal to random number one
11:27 - plus random number two so we get an
11:29 - addition
11:30 - symbol if the
11:33 - answer is equal to random number one
11:36 - plus random number
11:37 - [Music]
11:40 - two then we can start actually this
11:43 - should be an if L statement cuz if they
11:46 - get it wrong then it should say wrong
11:48 - number so let's change this soon if
11:51 - else sorry about that so you put that in
11:54 - here and then when I get something right
11:58 - uh I'm going to get a new sound so I got
12:00 - like a guitar strum
12:02 - sound uh
12:05 - guitar strum this one sounds like
12:09 - this uh and then I just put in here play
12:12 - sound guitar strum and then it will say
12:15 - that is
12:18 - correct that is
12:23 - correct that is correct for two seconds
12:26 - and then we can change the score by one
12:29 - because they got the right
12:32 - answer else if they get it wrong oops
12:35 - let me just duplicate this if they get
12:37 - it wrong then we'll say something else
12:39 - we'll say that is the wrong
12:46 - answer and then instead of playing
12:48 - guitar strum um I got I got like a
12:51 - string pluck
12:52 - sound um from
12:57 - before plug sense of this
12:59 - just like kind of sounds like they got
13:01 - it wrong or something so I'm just going
13:03 - to go to sounds put that right here and
13:06 - then say that is the wrong
13:07 - answer okay and now we have to call the
13:11 - addition thing so um we broadcasted
13:14 - start addition from here remember right
13:16 - here so we're going to go to the
13:19 - cat uh when I receive start
13:22 - addition we want to call this block so
13:26 - addition so now let's try out
13:29 - let's try it
13:31 - out so it's going to say let's play a
13:33 - math game answer the following questions
13:36 - press the quit button to stop all
13:37 - answers choose one of the random
13:40 - operators operators are random so we
13:42 - only have one operation right now so
13:44 - let's click on addition so ask the
13:46 - answer as you can see right here so 54 +
13:49 - 42 is equal to 96 so let's put 96 and no
13:54 - say that is correct so it is working and
13:56 - the score went up
13:59 - and I forgot in the beginning we have to
14:01 - set the score to
14:03 - zero so it will go back to zero cuz uh
14:07 - forgot about that and then 60 + 35 let's
14:10 - say if I get it wrong let's put seven or
14:12 - something
14:14 - uh it'll say that is the wrong answer so
14:16 - it is working right now so 60 + 35 is
14:19 - actually 95 so it say that is correct so
14:23 - as you can see it's working now so the
14:26 - addition is working right now and we can
14:29 - work on the quit button but I don't
14:31 - think we have enough time to work on the
14:32 - subtraction like I said in the
14:34 - beginning um I think we'll work on that
14:37 - in the next video but so when this so
14:39 - for here I'm just going to do it when
14:41 - when this Sprite is
14:43 - clicked stop all because it's the quit
14:47 - button and then when fly clicked we want
14:49 - to
14:52 - hide and finally when I
14:56 - receive uh start game
14:59 - want to
15:00 - show show the quick button right there
15:03 - so that is it for this video don't
15:05 - forget to save your project and you can
15:07 - rename it to the math
15:11 - game so that's it for this video hope
15:14 - you guys really enjoyed uh don't forget
15:17 - to like share subscribe and ring the
15:19 - notification Bell see you guys in the
15:21 - next video
15:23 - [Music]
15:40 - so welcome back guys to another video on
15:42 - kids coding playground today we'll
15:43 - working the second part for the um
15:45 - scratch math game so in the last
15:48 - tutorial uh we learned how to make the
15:50 - addition and we made the addition button
15:53 - so today and the quit button um so we're
15:56 - going to work in the subtraction button
15:59 - um subtraction um the custom block and
16:03 - we're also going to work on
16:04 - multiplication so I'm just going to drag
16:05 - and drop the
16:07 - multiplication in here as well hold up I
16:10 - don't have it so let me get it okay so
16:12 - now I have the multiplication button I
16:14 - just got it from my other project so now
16:17 - I have the three buttons so let's start
16:20 - out from the subtraction button everyone
16:22 - um so everyone let's go to the
16:24 - subtraction button and let's code on
16:25 - here first let's zoom in a little bit so
16:28 - for for addition we can just copy paste
16:31 - everything just drag and drop everything
16:33 - into the subtraction except we just need
16:35 - to change up one broadcast that's pretty
16:38 - much it for the subtraction button so
16:41 - for subtraction button we're going to
16:42 - get um so we'll separate all
16:46 - this instead of here instead of start
16:48 - addition we have to broadcast a new
16:50 - message called start
16:54 - [Music]
16:56 - subtraction so we got to broadcast start
17:00 - subtraction so let's go back into a cat
17:02 - we have to define a new custom block so
17:04 - let's go to my
17:06 - blocks and let's make a new custom block
17:08 - and name it
17:11 - subtraction so subtraction click okay so
17:15 - let's define it now so let's get a
17:17 - forever
17:19 - Loop forever Loop so in the beginning we
17:22 - always want to set the guess to
17:24 - zero to zero and then we want to set the
17:27 - random number one and the random number
17:30 - two to pick random one to
17:34 - 100 and the um subtraction is a little
17:37 - bit different from addition that's why I
17:39 - didn't copy paste it because you need to
17:41 - find if the random number one is greater
17:43 - than random number two because if the
17:45 - random number uh two is smaller than the
17:48 - random number one and you're subtracting
17:50 - it we don't want negative numbers so we
17:52 - have to do that
17:54 - so so we have to set the two random
17:57 - numbers cck random one and 100 let's get
18:00 - a repeat until so we have to repeat
18:02 - until guess is equal to answer to
18:04 - problem so if the guess of the answer is
18:07 - equal to the actual answer so repeat
18:10 - until the guess is equal to the answer
18:14 - problem and then after that we want to
18:16 - get an if then statement
18:20 - if um we need if then else sorry put an
18:24 - if then else inside this repeat until
18:26 - Loop so we want to if r random number
18:29 - one is greater than random number two so
18:31 - this is where you detect if random
18:33 - number one is greater than random number
18:35 - two so if random number one is greater
18:38 - than random number two then we want to
18:40 - set the answer to problem of random
18:42 - number one minus random number two so
18:46 - let's set the answer to problem to
18:47 - random number one minus random number
18:50 - two so uh get a uh subtraction symbol
18:54 - put that in
18:55 - here random number one sub subtracted
19:00 - random number two so subtract the first
19:02 - number which is greater than random
19:04 - number two it'll be random number one
19:06 - minus random number two and then we'll
19:09 - ask a question ask we need to put two
19:14 - joins put a join here and put a join
19:18 - here so we want to say random number one
19:22 - in the first slot which is any number as
19:24 - from 1 to 100 then we join it with the
19:28 - minus sign
19:29 - and then we get a random number
19:32 - two and put it in here else if a random
19:36 - number one is not greater than random
19:38 - number two then we want to set the
19:40 - random then we want to just duplicate
19:42 - this and instead of doing this we're got
19:45 - to switch them around so instead of
19:47 - putting random number one minus random
19:49 - number two it'll be random number two
19:51 - minus random number one so it'll do it
19:53 - the other way around so then it'll
19:55 - always never be negative and then it'll
19:57 - ask instead here we're going to switch
19:59 - these two again so we're going to join
20:02 - random number two minus random number
20:05 - one and then we're going to set the
20:07 - guess to the
20:09 - answer down here let's set the guess to
20:12 - [Music]
20:16 - answer um and then if we're going to get
20:19 - another if then else okay so let's get
20:22 - an if then else and put it right here so
20:25 - if the guess is equal to the answer to
20:27 - problem
20:29 - guess is equal to answer the
20:33 - problem um then we're going to have to
20:36 - uh start the sound guitar shum I already
20:38 - have it start sound guitar
20:41 - strum and then we're going to say that
20:44 - is correct so I'm just going to
20:45 - duplicate this right here and then put
20:47 - it down here else we're going to do this
20:51 - string plug and say that is the wrong
20:53 - answer so as you can see subtraction
20:55 - needs a bit more code than addition
20:57 - because you have to find which number is
20:59 - greater than which so and then finally
21:02 - we have to do a uh we have to um call
21:06 - the function right here so we're going
21:07 - to get a broadcast when I receive start
21:11 - addition uh subtraction sorry about that
21:14 - we're going to run the subtraction call
21:17 - this custom blocker here so let's try it
21:20 - out right now so I'm going to save it
21:22 - and then play
21:25 - it let's try it out
21:29 - so okay so I have the subtraction button
21:32 - addition button so let's say if I click
21:34 - on subtraction boom now it will not be
21:36 - negative as you can see 90 - 49 is not a
21:39 - negative number so let's say I get right
21:43 - so let's say I get it wrong then it'll
21:45 - do that but if I get it right then it'll
21:48 - do
21:50 - this so there was a little bug right
21:52 - here so I got the answer correct which
21:54 - was 41 and it didn't work so I
21:57 - accidentally didn't answer the problem
21:58 - right here it should be guess so um you
22:01 - guys have to do guess instead of answer
22:03 - the problem that was a little U Mistake
22:05 - by me so don't do answer to the problem
22:08 - you have to put gu that's why it did not
22:10 - work so now let's see if it works now it
22:13 - should
22:17 - work
22:20 - so now let's go to subtraction so I'm
22:23 - just going to click on it 60 - 1 that's
22:25 - 59 so as you can see now it's correct
22:28 - back then I uh when I got the right
22:29 - answer it still didn't get it right
22:31 - because um there's a little bug in it so
22:35 - um so the answer is 22 for here let's
22:37 - see if it's right okay that's right and
22:39 - gain score and you get it wrong on
22:42 - purpose it'll say that is the wrong
22:43 - answer so now we have the subtraction
22:46 - and addition functioning correctly now
22:48 - we can work on our multiplication button
22:51 - so let's go to our
22:52 - multiplication uh just drag and drop all
22:55 - of this code into the multiplication we
22:57 - just have to change one
23:02 - broadcast just drag and drop all this
23:06 - and one
23:08 - more let's see if I got it all Oops I
23:11 - did not get one of them I
23:14 - think yeah I did not get the one flag
23:20 - clicked uh yeah this one so I'm just
23:22 - going to drag and drop over
23:24 - here and I don't know where this one
23:26 - went so I'm just going to give it to
23:28 - Hero as well
23:29 - so drag it from the front I think that's
23:32 - why so one fly click time yeah okay so
23:35 - now we have the code for the
23:37 - multiplication instead of broadcasting
23:39 - start subtraction we're going to have to
23:41 - broadcast start
23:43 - multiplication start
23:47 - multi
23:50 - multiplication I think that's how you
23:51 - spell it but that's just broadcast that
23:56 - and then let's go back into our cat
23:57 - Sprint
23:59 - and then so for the multiplication um
24:02 - I'm only going to do it 1 to 12 because
24:04 - um this is like for kids multiplication
24:07 - so I'm not going to make it too hard
24:08 - that you have to use like scratch paper
24:10 - and all that so to make a new custom
24:12 - Block it's called it
24:17 - multiplication
24:19 - multiplication click
24:21 - okay so we're going to Define
24:23 - multiplication so let's get a forever
24:26 - Loop um you want to set the guess to
24:30 - [Music]
24:32 - zero guess to
24:35 - zero and we're going to set the random
24:38 - number one and the random number two
24:41 - both to only pick random 1 to
24:44 - 12 so it isn't too
24:47 - hard so pick random 1 to 12 only you
24:51 - guys can do it any value you
24:53 - want and then I'm going to set the
24:55 - answer to
24:56 - problem to um random number one multiply
25:01 - by random number
25:03 - two so multiply this random number by
25:06 - this random number so random number one
25:09 - times random number
25:12 - two and okay so we're going to get a
25:15 - repeat until we're going to repeat until
25:19 - guess is equal to answer to problem so
25:23 - wait until the correct
25:25 - answer guess is equal to uh answer a
25:29 - problem and then once it is then we want
25:32 - to
25:32 - [Music]
25:34 - ask um
25:36 - ask we're going to ask two joins let's
25:39 - put two joins okay so we're going to
25:41 - since um you guys can do the star symbol
25:43 - for
25:44 - multiplication um or just use the X
25:47 - symbol I'm just going to do the X symbol
25:49 - so uh X letter I mean so we're going to
25:52 - join the Random Number One X or you can
25:55 - do the star symbol this one I'm just
25:58 - going to do the X random number two so
26:01 - it'll multiply these two ask what's
26:03 - random number one times random number
26:05 - two and then um we want to set the guess
26:09 - to
26:11 - answer set the guess to the
26:15 - answer put that in here and then we got
26:18 - to get an if L statement so
26:22 - if if the answer is equal to random
26:25 - number one multiplied by random number
26:26 - two that means they got correct
26:29 - random number one so if the answer is
26:33 - equal to random number one multiplied by
26:36 - random number
26:39 - two then we can just duplicate this this
26:42 - just to show they're correct I'll play
26:45 - start sound guitar strum that is correct
26:48 - and then change the score by one and if
26:51 - they get it wrong we will just duplicate
26:52 - this that is the wrong answer so that is
26:56 - the code for the multiplication and of
26:58 - course we have to call the code so going
27:00 - to go here when I
27:04 - receive uh start multiplication we want
27:06 - to run this code right
27:08 - here so now we have the multiplication
27:11 - let's try that out so just save it Go
27:14 - full
27:16 - screen so let's play a math game answer
27:19 - the following questions press the quick
27:21 - button to stop all questions choose one
27:23 - of the operators are random so I'm going
27:26 - to pick multiplication
27:28 - um so 1 *
27:30 - 11 so multiplication is working right
27:33 - now so as you can see when you answer it
27:35 - correctly it will say that is correct
27:36 - your score will go up let's say if I
27:38 - answer it wrong on purpose let's see if
27:40 - it works and it'll say that is the wrong
27:43 - answer so our game is working uh
27:46 - perfectly right now
27:47 - so that is uh I think we'll stop here so
27:51 - today we just worked on the subtraction
27:53 - and multiplication button tomorrow in
27:56 - the next episode I think we'll work on
27:59 - Division and the random so I think
28:02 - that's it for this video thank you guys
28:03 - for watching don't forget to like share
28:06 - subscribe and ring the notification Bell
28:09 - and I'll see you guys in the next video
28:11 - [Music]
28:28 - so welcome back guys to another tutorial
28:30 - on kids coding playground today we'll be
28:32 - working on the part three for the math
28:34 - game so I already have my division
28:37 - button from the backpack so what I did
28:39 - was just drew a a rectangle and wrote
28:41 - division so it's pretty simple to do
28:43 - pretty sure you guys can all do that so
28:46 - first I'm going to start on the code on
28:48 - division so I'm going to get a one flag
28:51 - clicked I want to
28:54 - hide let me zoom in a little bit one
28:57 - flly click hide and then when I receive
29:00 - start
29:02 - game I want to
29:05 - hide and then when this Sprite is
29:08 - clicked I'm going to um broadcast start
29:13 - game and I'm going to broadcast a new
29:17 - message and call it start
29:19 - [Music]
29:23 - division uh start
29:25 - Division and next um when I receive
29:29 - choose game we are also going to
29:33 - show when you receive choose game we're
29:36 - going to show and then this part is just
29:39 - for when you put your mouse on it it'll
29:40 - get bigger and smaller so when flly
29:42 - clicked get a forever
29:44 - Loop
29:46 - if uh touching Mouse
29:49 - pointer then set size to
29:54 - 85 85
29:58 - else we want to set the size back to 100
30:01 - so okay so that's all the code for the
30:03 - division button let's move on to the cat
30:06 - so for the cat we're going to be making
30:08 - a new custom block so let's go to my
30:11 - blocks so we can create our new custom
30:13 - block and we can just simply call it
30:16 - Division division and click
30:20 - okay division I'm going to move it onto
30:22 - this
30:24 - side so I'm going to start coding from
30:26 - this side okay zoom in a little bit so
30:29 - I'm going to get a forever Loop uh I'm
30:31 - going to set the guess to
30:35 - zero set the guess to zero and then I'm
30:38 - going to set the random number one to
30:40 - pick random one to 100 so I'm going to
30:42 - do uh uh pick uh random 1 to 100 but for
30:47 - the second one I'm only going to pick
30:48 - random 1 to 10 so it's not too hard
30:52 - random number two to 1 to 10 so it could
30:54 - be two digit divided by one digit or
30:57 - three digit divided by two digit so it's
31:00 - not too hard um so we're going to get a
31:03 - repeat Loop repeat until repeat until um
31:08 - we're going to repeat until we're going
31:09 - to get an equal sign and a mod so what
31:12 - mod is is basically the remainder of two
31:15 - numbers so let's say I have a 10 and I
31:19 - have a five so if you click on it the
31:21 - mod is zero because 10 and 5 do not have
31:24 - a remainder but let's say if you do 10
31:26 - and three the mod mod would be one
31:28 - because 10 / 3 is three remainder one so
31:32 - the remainder is one so mod is simply
31:35 - put um the two um values the and the
31:40 - remainder of the two values so that's
31:41 - what mod is so we're going to get the
31:44 - mod so this is just to pick it so it'll
31:46 - be a um so the two numbers getting
31:48 - divided would be
31:50 - even so it would not have remainders so
31:53 - we're going to make the numbers not have
31:55 - remainders so we're going to find the
31:57 - mod of random number one and random
31:59 - number two and if it's equal to zero
32:02 - because zero means um that there will be
32:05 - no remainder then we want to reset set
32:09 - the random number one to one pick random
32:12 - one to 100 like that and then we're
32:16 - going to set answer the
32:19 - problem uh to random number one divided
32:23 - by random number two so right here going
32:26 - to put random number one
32:28 - divided by random number
32:30 - [Music]
32:32 - two like that and then we're going to
32:34 - get a repeat until so we're going to
32:36 - repeat
32:38 - until repeat until um guess is equal to
32:42 - answer to
32:44 - problem guess is equal to answer to
32:49 - problem um and then next we want to
32:53 - ask ask uh join we need two joins um um
32:58 - since there's no division sign on the
33:00 - keyboard I'm going to be using the slash
33:02 - symbol which also means division so
33:04 - we're going to join the random number
33:07 - one and then I'm going to put
33:09 - slash random number two like that and
33:13 - then I'm going to set the guess to the
33:17 - answer set the guess to the
33:22 - answer and then after that I'm going to
33:24 - get an if else so let's put the if else
33:26 - in here drag the if else right here and
33:30 - if
33:31 - answer going to get uh
33:35 - equal so if the
33:39 - answer is equal to random number one
33:42 - divided random number
33:45 - two um random number one divide that by
33:49 - random number
33:50 - two then we're going to play I'm just
33:53 - going to duplicate this play sound
33:55 - guitar strum say that is correct and
33:58 - change the score by one and then when
34:00 - you get it incorrect I'm going to
34:02 - duplicate the same thing play the string
34:04 - pluck and say that is the wrong answer
34:07 - so that's it for the division block so
34:09 - now we're going to have to call it so
34:11 - let's go back right here um so I'm just
34:15 - going to get a broadcast when I receive
34:18 - start
34:20 - division I'm going to call the custom
34:23 - block
34:24 - Division and one last thing we have to
34:26 - do the random
34:28 - so I'm actually going to I have to put I
34:30 - still have to put the random in my um
34:32 - backpack so I'm going to do that real
34:33 - quick okay so now I have the random
34:36 - block so what this does is if you can't
34:39 - pick either of the modes then you can
34:41 - just click random and it'll pick a
34:43 - random mode for you so let's get a one
34:47 - flat clicked we won't hide this in the
34:49 - beginning
34:51 - hide and then when I receive start
34:55 - game when I receive start game we're
34:58 - going to
35:01 - hide and then when I receive choose
35:04 - game we want to
35:08 - show then um we're going to get the same
35:12 - thing from here drag and drop this into
35:15 - here this is all the
35:18 - same like that and then for the random
35:21 - part we're going to have to do the
35:21 - random part now so this function right
35:24 - here will pick a random uh mode for you
35:28 - so when this right click we want to
35:30 - broadcast start
35:33 - game and then we want to set um the
35:36 - variable random game we made from the
35:38 - beginning of the uh videos from the
35:42 - first video we made the variable random
35:44 - game so now we're going to have to use
35:46 - it so we're going to make it pick random
35:48 - one to four cuz there's four operators
35:50 - addition subtraction multiplication and
35:52 - division and then we're going to get an
35:54 - if then statement if random game is
35:57 - equal to
35:59 - one if random game is equal to
36:03 - one then we want to broadcast start
36:08 - addition um so I'm going to duplicate
36:11 - this everything else is pretty much the
36:12 - same so if random game is equal to two
36:15 - then we're going to have to do
36:17 - subtraction and let duplicate all of
36:20 - this put it under here and when random
36:22 - game is equal to three then we want to
36:25 - start multiplication
36:27 - and then when random number game is
36:30 - equal to four then we can start
36:34 - division okay so I think that's it so
36:38 - let's play the game I'm going to save it
36:40 - and then for the cat I'm just going to
36:42 - um put this right here so I don't have
36:46 - to keep on listening to this so let's
36:48 - make it bigger let's play Let's play a
36:51 - math
36:52 - game so let's click random as you can
36:54 - see it picked a random one for me and
36:57 - when you get it right it'll say it's
36:59 - correct if you get it wrong it'll say
37:01 - it's wrong so I'm going to quit um and
37:04 - I'm going to do division this time to
37:05 - show you guys what division is so 44 as
37:09 - you can see it's a whole it's a a number
37:13 - that uh it has no remainders um so 44 /
37:16 - 4 is 11 see there's no remainders uh we
37:19 - use the mod making it have no remainder
37:22 - so that's that's the good part of this
37:25 - so as you can see there's still still no
37:29 - remainder so that's working so it's
37:32 - pretty
37:34 - cool so that's it for this video I hope
37:38 - you enjoyed learning the
37:40 - series um make sure to like share and
37:43 - subscribe I'll see you guys in the next
37:45 - video
37:47 - [Music]
38:04 - so welcome back guys to another tutorial
38:06 - in kids coding playground today we're
38:08 - going to be evaluating to the math game
38:11 - so we're going to turn it into a math
38:12 - racing game um we convert it from the
38:15 - math game so if you have not done the
38:17 - math game you guys should do the math
38:19 - game first before working on this one
38:21 - and the players will have to answer a
38:24 - math question and every question it
38:26 - answers correctly will move forward if
38:28 - it doesn't answer any questions
38:29 - correctly it'll just stay put and the
38:31 - dog is controlled by the AI it'll just
38:34 - move amount uh like six steps or
38:37 - something like every second and if um
38:40 - the dog touches the Finish Line before
38:42 - the cat then you lose but if the cat
38:44 - touches the Finish Line before the dog
38:46 - then the dog loses so you want to beat
38:49 - the objective of the game is just to
38:51 - beat the dog and today we'll be learning
38:54 - these following concepts in scratch uh
38:57 - actually we will not be using variables
38:58 - and custom blocks this is from the last
39:01 - episode so that's why it has these but
39:03 - we will be using the broadcast message
39:06 - Loops I don't think we'll be using
39:08 - operator blocks but we'll be using some
39:10 - of these Concepts in here so let's go
39:12 - back to our project so I'm going to
39:14 - change this music right here because um
39:16 - we don't want to get flag our video
39:18 - flagged for copyright so that's not a
39:21 - good thing so our video might get taken
39:23 - down if we do copyrighted music so I'm
39:26 - going to show you the game now so I
39:29 - added some modifiers to this game like
39:31 - credits and all that stuff but and I
39:33 - also added an intro you guys can add
39:36 - that if you want as well let going turn
39:38 - up the volume a little
39:41 - bit so I added an intro it was pretty
39:44 - simple to make so these we will not need
39:46 - to get into cuz I did uh
39:51 - music um so let's go with multiplication
39:54 - because it's the easiest so if you get a
39:57 - question wrong you'll just stay in put
40:00 - if you get it right then you move
40:03 - forward if you get it right then you
40:06 - keep on moving forward so I'm going to
40:08 - try to beat this real
40:12 - quick
40:15 - 81 so as you can see um I'm pretty fast
40:19 - right now and the score still goes up
40:21 - right here so let's finish this real
40:25 - quick and I made made it a little bit
40:27 - more funny so like when you lose it'll
40:29 - say that you failed or something
40:33 - um uh we're almost
40:40 - there
40:46 - oops
40:48 - uh boom I think we got there I
40:51 - win and then it'll just say great job
40:54 - you beat the dog press the flag to play
40:56 - again and I can enjoy the music so
40:58 - that's what I did at the end so that's
41:01 - what I
41:02 - have so let's go to our project we were
41:06 - working
41:07 - on okay so now we are inside our project
41:11 - we work we were working on
41:12 - earlier so this is the one I've been
41:16 - teaching you guys with so we're going to
41:19 - go to the cat and we're I in the
41:21 - beginning I set the uh I made it go to
41:26 - um
41:27 - I think
41:28 - [Music]
41:30 - -204 -204 58 and I also set the size of
41:37 - the cat to
41:38 - 60 um set the size of the cat to 60 and
41:42 - I'm actually going to upload some uh um
41:45 - backdrops into this one so let's go to
41:49 - backdrops backdrops so I have the
41:53 - um this is the winning winning screen
41:56 - these are are the
41:58 - intros um and this is the track the race
42:02 - track actually I move this like right
42:04 - here this is the RAC trck
42:08 - so this is the RAC track for and this
42:11 - doesn't look very good is not very
42:14 - proportionate so I just moved it to the
42:16 - left a little bit so now it's covering
42:18 - the whole screen so now let's go to the
42:21 - cat put down the backpack again so I set
42:24 - it to -204 why fit 58 and I set the size
42:28 - to 60 so it'll be be between the tracks
42:32 - and then for right here for like every
42:35 - single right answer we're going to have
42:36 - to do this so when um after this when
42:40 - the answer is correct we need to
42:42 - broadcast a message let's call it
42:44 - correct
42:46 - answer
42:48 - correct
42:50 - answer so this will go to the um cat
42:54 - when it receives correct answer so it'll
42:56 - move forward so going to do
42:58 - that for here as well you're going to
43:02 - have to do it for every single
43:04 - one put in here and finally in here so
43:09 - that's it for here and then now we're
43:11 - going to have to receive the message so
43:14 - when I
43:15 - receive correct answer then we want to
43:19 - repeat 10 times move three steps so
43:22 - basically moving 30
43:23 - steps move three steps
43:27 - and then I did next costume wait 0.1
43:30 - seconds so it look like it's
43:32 - running wait 0 one seconds and then if
43:37 - it's touching the finish line and I have
43:40 - to get the finish line which I don't
43:42 - have so I'm going to get that quickly
43:44 - okay so I just got the finish line from
43:46 - my other project so what I did for the
43:49 - finish line is basically a uh
43:52 - rectangle just a long rectangle so if
43:56 - you show it I put it right there move it
43:59 - like right there actually I might have
44:01 - to like en longate it a little
44:03 - bit there you
44:05 - go Center it a little bit
44:11 - smaller uh and look that yeah that looks
44:14 - fine so that's going to be my um Finish
44:16 - Line just a rectangle so I'm going to go
44:19 - back into my cat let's go to the code
44:23 - and then um if get an if then statement
44:26 - if
44:27 - it is touching the Finish
44:30 - Line touching Finish Line then I will
44:34 - make it say I
44:37 - win uh I win for two seconds I guess I
44:42 - win and then I'm going to switch the
44:45 - backdrop to uh this
44:48 - backdrop um this one the back drops so
44:52 - tell them that they
44:54 - won so I'm going to go into cat and then
44:58 - make it switch to backdrop five which is
45:01 - the waiting backdrop and then I'm going
45:03 - to stop the script after you
45:05 - win or you can just put stop ball I'm
45:08 - just going to put stop
45:10 - allall um and then now let's go to the
45:13 - dog so from the I just got the dog from
45:17 - the Sprite Library so let's go dog this
45:20 - dog I just got this
45:22 - one so I made it go uh when receive
45:25 - start game which is a broadcast I made I
45:30 - believe uh start game right here then I
45:35 - want to show in the
45:37 - beginning uh go to front
45:40 - layer and repeat repeat until it's
45:44 - touching the Finish Line just like the
45:47 - uh
45:48 - cat um touching Finish Line so we're
45:52 - going to make it move six steps that's
45:54 - what I did move six steps
45:58 - and then I'm going to next
46:00 - costume wait one second so his two
46:03 - costumes are like sticking out his
46:05 - tongue so I'm going to make it wait one
46:07 - second
46:09 - instead and then
46:11 - if he is
46:14 - touching the Finish
46:16 - Line then I'll make him say I beat
46:21 - you for two seconds I beat
46:25 - you for for 2 seconds and then I'm play
46:29 - the sound dog so I just play the sound
46:33 - that's what I did and then I'm going to
46:35 - broadcast a message called you
46:39 - lose you
46:42 - lose um and then I'm going to
46:44 - hide and stop all so that's what I'm
46:47 - going to
46:50 - do and then I'm going to get a one flag
46:53 - clicked show
46:57 - and I made the uh uh dog go
47:02 - to
47:05 - 183 -2 for the X and Y
47:08 - position and I made him
47:13 - hide
47:15 - and actually we actually don't even need
47:17 - this show I don't even know why I put it
47:19 - there but um when the backdrop switches
47:22 - to backdrop 5 which is the winning
47:25 - screen I want it to hide so one backdrop
47:27 - switches to backdrop five then
47:31 - hide got to do the same thing with the
47:33 - cat so backdrop switches going
47:37 - hide then finally for the
47:39 - backdrop remember for I made like a
47:43 - little intro of the end flashing in the
47:45 - back I know it's not a good intro but
47:47 - you guys can do anything else so when I
47:51 - receed start game in the
47:54 - beginning I want to
47:57 - switch backdrop to backdrop one which is
48:00 - the first backdrop this
48:05 - one so after that I'm going to one fly
48:10 - clicked
48:11 - uh actually no we switched to backdrop 2
48:15 - sorry about that so when you start the
48:17 - game you switch to backdrop
48:19 - 2 and then we're going to get one flat
48:23 - clicked repeat five times
48:28 - switch backdrop to backdrop
48:31 - seven backdrop to backdrop seven which
48:34 - is the
48:36 - um the flashing stuff I'm going wait
48:39 - 0.35 seconds that's what I
48:41 - did 35 I just experimented until I found
48:45 - the right number and then I'm going to
48:47 - switch the backdrop back to backdrop
48:49 - eight and then after that let switch
48:52 - backdrop backdrop
48:53 - two actually no we're switching it right
48:56 - here I forgot about that so we're going
48:58 - to do backdrop one right here for now
49:01 - and then I'm going to get a forever Loop
49:03 - set the volume to 40% cuz you actually
49:07 - don't you don't have to do that but I
49:10 - actually had a medieval sound cuz back
49:12 - then I had another song that was really
49:13 - loud so I set it to 40% so I actually
49:16 - did the
49:18 - medieval medieval one sound you guys can
49:20 - pick whatever sound you want and then
49:22 - just got to play the sound medieval one
49:24 - and Sil so for the Finish Line I'm going
49:28 - to get a one flly clicked go to this
49:30 - position and
49:33 - hide 2 28 y -22 that's where it is right
49:39 - now um and then when backdrop switches
49:44 - to backdrop
49:47 - two then we can show which is backdrop
49:49 - two is
49:51 - the oops backdrop two is the racing
49:55 - backdrop so going to sh
49:58 - and then after that when backdrop
50:01 - switches to backdrop
50:03 - 5 then we're also going to
50:07 - [Music]
50:09 - hide so
50:10 - yeah so yeah that's the code for the
50:13 - finish line so it show on the racing
50:16 - backdrop and it'll hide on the backdrop
50:19 - five the winning
50:20 - backdrop so I think that's pretty much
50:25 - it see what else we can add oh yeah and
50:28 - a
50:29 - losing losing screen yeah losing so I'm
50:34 - going to paint new
50:35 - Sprite going to make it like a red color
50:39 - um put marker cuz it's easier to read
50:41 - remember you lose okay so remember we
50:46 - broadcasted fail on the um so you can
50:49 - hold on alts if you want so it'll keep
50:51 - the Sprite centered when you make it
50:53 - bigger so when the dog right here
50:58 - touches the Finish Line it broadcast you
51:00 - lose so we're going to get a one fly
51:02 - click right here I want to hide this in
51:04 - the
51:05 - beginning and I'm make it go to 0 0
51:08 - which is the
51:09 - origin make it go to 0 0 and then when I
51:14 - receive um you lose then I want to show
51:19 - and go to the front layer go to front
51:21 - layer and
51:23 - show so that's pretty much it let's try
51:26 - out now everyone I found out a bug while
51:29 - I was testing so in the beginning you
51:32 - want to actually hide I actually got the
51:35 - uh backdrops incorrect I'm sorry about
51:37 - that guys so up here where it's supposed
51:40 - to have a one flag clicked you have to
51:42 - replace it with the switch when this
51:44 - backdrop switches to backdrop one then
51:47 - you will execute all this code under
51:49 - here so that's one mistake I did and the
51:52 - other is inside the
51:54 - um backdrop I think yeah and these two
51:57 - are backwards I actually did it wrong I
52:00 - actually did it as backdrop one earlier
52:03 - which is wrong so you have to switch
52:05 - these
52:05 - two so that was um wrong so and the dog
52:11 - one last thing I wanted to make this dog
52:13 - at size 65 I think yeah I said I 65 so
52:20 - let's try it out now it should work so
52:23 - as you can see the intro
52:24 - plays and it say let's play a math game
52:27 - answer the following questions press the
52:29 - quick button to stop all answers uh
52:32 - choose one of the operations are random
52:34 - so
52:36 - see so that's correct you move
52:47 - forward so it's working as you can
52:52 - see so I'm going to try to beat this dog
52:55 - real quick
52:59 - uh1 and after I beat the dog I'm going
53:02 - to let you guys see what happens if the
53:04 - dog wins I'm going to like set the dog
53:06 - at going like 20 steps every time so or
53:11 - like 50 or something like that so I can
53:13 - show you guys what
53:15 - [Music]
53:20 - happens almost there I think one more
53:22 - should
53:25 - do there you
53:27 - go so now great job you beat the dog oh
53:30 - yeah and I can also make this hide if
53:33 - you want to do that quit you can just
53:35 - say when backdrop
53:38 - switches when backdrop switches to
53:40 - backdrop five which is the winning
53:42 - backdrop then you can hide so yeah as
53:45 - you can see it is working right now so I
53:47 - will show you what happens when you
53:50 - loose so let's do that make it like 50
53:53 - steps
53:56 - and yes I need to show this in the
53:58 - beginning when fly clicked hide and when
54:02 - backdrop
54:04 - switches to backdrop two I think is the
54:08 - racing
54:10 - one yeah so switch to backdrop two so we
54:14 - can qu when backdrop switches backdrop
54:16 - two then we want to actually show
54:18 - this so let's try it out this time I
54:21 - will let the dog win I put it at 50
54:24 - steps or something like that
54:28 - let it finish
54:30 - talking random beat me
54:34 - already so looks like the dog is going
54:36 - pretty fast so it'll say I beat
54:40 - you and then it'll say you lose as you
54:43 - can see so that's it for this tutorial
54:46 - on how to make a math racing
54:48 - game uh thank you guys for watching
54:51 - don't forget to like share subscribe and
54:54 - I'll see you guys in the next video bye
