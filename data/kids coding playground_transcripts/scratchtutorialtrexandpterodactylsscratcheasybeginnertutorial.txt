00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back to another video on kids
00:09 - go to playground today we'll be making
00:11 - game called t-rex and peridot
00:13 - pterodactyls so we have another game
00:15 - similar to this which is cat getting the
00:18 - apples but this one is a t-rex getting
00:21 - the pterodactyls this is how the game
00:23 - looks like so I'll be explaining how to
00:26 - play the game so use the arrow keys to
00:28 - move and the objective is just score as
00:31 - much points as you can press the
00:33 - spacebar to jump with the t-rex to eat
00:37 - the pterodactyls to get points this
00:43 - video is like the Apple cat one cat
00:46 - video except this one has added stuff so
00:50 - the cat one is more of a beginner's
00:52 - video if you're a beginner I suggest you
00:54 - to watch the other one this one is more
00:56 - of an intermediate video so in this game
01:01 - we'll be learning these following
01:02 - concepts such as broadcasting messages
01:05 - using the random operator touching
01:07 - sprites one key press and the joint
01:10 - function so I'll be demoing the game
01:13 - first before we start so when we make
01:17 - this full screen so as you can see this
01:20 - music in the background when you move
01:23 - around the dinosaur switches costumes
01:27 - when you press the spacebar it jumps and
01:29 - as you can see when you
01:31 - the kind of geeks the pterodactyls right
01:34 - they switch costume so yeah without
01:39 - further ado get a new project ready so
01:43 - new first we can rename it to t-rexes
01:48 - and pterodactyls think that's how you
02:01 - spell it
02:01 - but you can change it later so we we
02:06 - want to delete this cat then we'll want
02:10 - to get backdrop so let's get a
02:12 - background to this project we want the
02:22 - dress background because it's kind of
02:24 - like a dinosaur themed game so we can
02:30 - get the t-rex Dino dinosaur 4 and you'll
02:40 - need the pterodactyl type of Dino turn I
02:48 - wonder need some trees tree tree and
02:57 - just duplicate these right click
02:58 - duplicate right we'll need three trees
03:02 - okay first of all let's go to the
03:05 - backdrop so we'll need a one clicked
03:08 - forever
03:10 - play sound jungle will get a sound oh I
03:14 - prefer to pick the jungle I just search
03:25 - so this kind of a sounds drastic so
03:31 - before I can continue I would like you
03:34 - guys to please like share subscribe to
03:36 - this video and subscribe to our channel
03:39 - thank you so now let's continue
03:45 - so I code for the t-rex okay so as you
03:50 - guys in the first video we used like the
03:52 - key space key is pressed this is less
03:56 - smooth than the if-then statement and
03:59 - then you use the sensing key left arrow
04:02 - or right arrow press this is more
04:04 - smoother so we want the t-rex to go to
04:06 - the front layer in the beginning then go
04:11 - to somewhere like right here we want it
04:15 - to go to like a zero Center zero I'm
04:21 - just gonna put a random coordinate that
04:24 - might fit it zero negative 50 see that's
04:31 - pretty much in the center so now when
04:34 - you forever Lee if I'm edge bounce so it
04:39 - can't go off the map if then statement
04:47 - if then the left arrow is pressed take
04:50 - this left arrows press then point
04:55 - direction of negative 90 because he has
04:58 - eternal life he'll look to the left side
05:04 - so negative 90 move 10 steps so move
05:10 - this is like the movement for it and
05:14 - then switch costume to pick random one
05:16 - two three we want this because it can
05:20 - switch costume when it's moving we don't
05:23 - want it to switch costume next costume
05:25 - because we don't want it to switch to
05:28 - this costume because we don't want it
05:30 - when it's moving we don't want it to
05:31 - open its mouth randomly so we can just
05:35 - duplicate this code
05:38 - instead of left we can do right instead
05:40 - of one direction just put it to 90 move
05:44 - ten steps and pick random it's um one
05:47 - two three yeah we don't want to do it
05:49 - too wonderful
05:51 - put this under here so this is a
05:54 - movement of the Dino dinosaur so next
05:58 - we'll need to do the jumping up so when
06:03 - the key space is pressed repeat 15 times
06:10 - so this will make it jump up and then
06:12 - get back down change Y my 10 so go up
06:18 - change Y by 10 next costume so they'll
06:24 - open its mouth now change costume 1 2 4
06:27 - when you jump up then we can just
06:30 - duplicate this 15 times and then you
06:34 - have to make it negative time because
06:35 - you want it to go back down and you want
06:39 - to switch the dinosaur for this costume
06:43 - because you want it to open its mouth
06:45 - when it's jumping so as you can see now
06:49 - we've got the movement done oh yeah and
06:52 - I forgot you have to do this direction
06:57 - you to put it to this so it will rotate
06:59 - upside down now the dinosaur can jump up
07:06 - and down
07:07 - and move left and right I know the music
07:09 - center mode okay so next we'll move on
07:14 - some more code for the t-rex so we'll
07:18 - need to get it when clicked and flat
07:21 - clicked when they make a variable called
07:24 - score so score we want to set the score
07:29 - 2-0 in the beginning four to zero
07:33 - forever loop so in the forever loop we
07:37 - want to put it at the end statement if
07:40 - then touching the Dino 3 which is the
07:42 - pterodactyl or ever dinosaur 3 then
07:47 - broadcast when you broadcast and played
07:50 - a message called gap give this I spell
08:03 - it so next we move on to the pterodactyl
08:09 - code so when it receives got pterodactyl
08:14 - we can switch costume to the Dino 3d
08:21 - which is the one that's screaming I
08:24 - guess and then we wait 3.5 seconds to
08:28 - give it a slight pause 2.5 then we hide
08:34 - because it's eaten switch costume - Dino
08:40 - 3e
08:42 - which is this one they want it to start
08:46 - on this one
08:48 - so when clicked we need a one click this
08:52 - bigger thank us when the flag is clicked
08:55 - we want to switch costume to the Dyna 3e
08:58 - this one hide okay so we need a forever
09:04 - loop so wait pick random one two three
09:09 - seconds every single time it spawns so
09:12 - pick a random one two three seconds
09:14 - before spawning one two three go to it
09:19 - go to
09:20 - we're in a position but instead we'll
09:23 - take a join join function and a pick
09:29 - random so what this basically means is
09:31 - we need to add tree in a tree pick
09:34 - random 1 2 3 so you know we have 3 trees
09:37 - right so when you click on this tree 3
09:40 - see when you click on it it will join
09:45 - the tree plus the number so I'll
09:47 - actually go to the sprite tree 1 2 3
09:50 - either one of those see so we just put
09:56 - this right here
09:57 - so that's that code and then we want to
10:01 - change X change the X change the x pick
10:09 - random negative 50 to 50 so over you
10:11 - somewhere from the end of the tree to
10:14 - the other under the tree so pick random
10:16 - negative 50 to 50 okay we wanna change Y
10:25 - to 75 so be somewhere up here instead
10:28 - because if you say go to tree it would
10:31 - be in the center of the tree so we
10:33 - wanted to be up here so change Y by 75
10:38 - change by 75 okay so now you want to
10:44 - show show the pterodactyl wait two
10:49 - seconds and then hot okay now we just
10:58 - need to set up all the things we can put
11:01 - the tree one right here
11:02 - three two right here entry 3 let's move
11:07 - it a little bit more like this okay
11:17 - we also have to make the dinosaur go to
11:20 - the front so go to the front layer go to
11:26 - front layer when you bite it the
11:37 - dinosaur disappears
11:38 - oh yeah you can make the score change by
11:43 - one when you get the parameter doctorate
11:46 - so when you receive the message got to
11:50 - Rin Jarrod after you change the score by
11:53 - one yeah so now you can see the scores
12:01 - changing up using position the trees and
12:05 - different place if you want so yeah that
12:18 - pretty much sums up the video thank you
