00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - hello guys welcome back to
00:09 - kidscoolingplayground
00:10 - so today we will be working on among us
00:13 - platformer
00:15 - many of our viewers have suggested us to
00:17 - make another platformer game and some
00:19 - have suggested us to make among us
00:21 - platformer
00:22 - so we thought of creating one
00:26 - so it took us some time to get this
00:28 - working because uh
00:29 - all the sprite we have to draw the
00:32 - background
00:32 - and all that this sprite actually
00:34 - download from another website i'll show
00:36 - you guys later
00:37 - but other than that the background and
00:40 - other stuff we actually drew them so it
00:42 - took us
00:43 - quite some time to get it done okay
00:46 - all right let's move on to the next page
00:49 - here we'll be learning some of the uh
00:52 - concepts in scratch like key controlling
00:54 - the sprite broadcast messages
00:57 - custom block uh variable uh platformer
01:00 - logic
01:01 - so uh i and then this is where we got
01:04 - the
01:04 - sprite sheet so you can go to this link
01:07 - to get the
01:08 - sprite for the among us right so this
01:11 - person created for us
01:13 - so we can download and use it um if you
01:15 - like
01:16 - or you can go to our google drive we'll
01:18 - create the sprites uh
01:20 - and we'll upload there as well um okay
01:24 - so you can find all that in the video
01:26 - description okay
01:28 - and uh before i was working on the first
01:31 - platform
01:32 - was a ninja platformer and that has like
01:34 - a little bit of bug
01:35 - i think a lot of people asked if we
01:36 - could share that project
01:38 - so we didn't share that project because
01:40 - it has a little buggy
01:41 - so it gets stuck on the platform and all
01:43 - that so it's messed up so this is
01:45 - actually really good now
01:47 - uh for this among us platformer it has
01:49 - no uh no
01:51 - known bug that i know of so it's worked
01:52 - really well so you can
01:54 - use this logic to do your ninja platform
01:57 - when we like
01:58 - so it works good okay so here's some of
02:01 - the shower we had
02:02 - so these are some of the people some of
02:04 - the viewers that
02:05 - want us to work on our mangas platform
02:08 - kind of game so i think we had a manga's
02:11 - animation that we worked on earlier so
02:13 - this is a kind of a tutorial for the
02:16 - platform
02:17 - and then we have a community post this
02:20 - week
02:21 - regarding the uh counting the uh the
02:24 - cornucopia
02:25 - the turkey and then uh something else i
02:28 - think
02:28 - uh and then that right answer was 23. so
02:31 - these are the
02:32 - some of the viewer who answered it
02:34 - correctly really early
02:36 - so uh we're getting a shout out all
02:39 - right
02:40 - so let's jump into it okay
02:43 - so we have the game here so we're gonna
02:46 - go full screen mode
02:47 - it's gonna start again so
02:51 - this is just the first stage just
02:53 - showing how the game works
02:56 - so if you touch the laser then you get
02:58 - kill and you start back in the
03:00 - in the beginning of that same stage so
03:02 - we're in level two right now
03:04 - so it has a depth also counter here this
03:07 - is level two
03:08 - so we'll try to pass here oh come on
03:14 - let's jump over this little guy here
03:18 - oh let's jump over him oh okay okay so
03:21 - there's a little jump pad here
03:23 - so so you want to jump over that
03:27 - and then there's this smasher thingy
03:29 - with with some
03:30 - spikes coming down so you know you won't
03:33 - get hit by that
03:37 - and then this is a level five so you can
03:40 - make many many different levels
03:41 - and you can try to do that yourself as
03:43 - well so
03:45 - we'll show you the basic and then you
03:46 - can do much more
03:49 - okay so you can jump over here so this
03:51 - one you don't want to fall down
03:53 - so i fall down here yep i die right
03:55 - start back again
03:57 - and then you don't want to touch the
03:58 - spike also so
04:02 - so this is oh that's the last stage so
04:05 - this is just the uh the last stage so
04:08 - please subscribe and thank you for
04:10 - learning with us so if you guys have not
04:12 - subscribed
04:13 - uh please do so this is actually a demo
04:15 - of the
04:16 - of the platformer okay so we will get on
04:19 - to the actual uh coding of the game
04:22 - okay so i forgot to show you guys this
04:24 - so this is what we bought download the
04:26 - sprite
04:26 - from so you can go to this website here
04:29 - so uh this is the sprite resource
04:31 - website you can download this one so if
04:34 - you
04:36 - [Music]
04:41 - link below in download video as well
04:44 - all right guys so we are here at the new
04:47 - uh project
04:48 - um so we're gonna delete the scratch cat
04:51 - we don't need
04:52 - um i have something in my backpack for
04:54 - the backdrop
04:56 - for now so i'm gonna drag that in but
04:58 - i'll show you guys
05:00 - what i did with the backdrop
05:06 - okay so i'll just oops
05:11 - let me paint a new one so what i did was
05:14 - just draw you know draw shapes like this
05:17 - and then you can use the reshape tool
05:19 - to draw them so it took me a while to
05:22 - draw this but as you can see
05:24 - just drawing shapes so like
05:27 - let's say let me copy one of these guys
05:30 - here so
05:31 - let me just show you i'm not gonna draw
05:33 - it obviously it takes too much time
05:35 - so this is like one box so you have this
05:38 - color
05:39 - you can choose any color you want right
05:41 - and then i did 10
05:43 - 10 size for the pen here and then on
05:46 - that
05:46 - and then the other one i draw a lighter
05:48 - box here and then i use this
05:51 - reshape tool to uh so let's say you have
05:53 - a squash
05:54 - box here like this you know and then you
05:58 - you kind of reshape it like this guy so
06:00 - you see how they reshape too right
06:02 - so you kind of like maybe
06:06 - click on this like this
06:09 - then move this like that
06:13 - oops it took a lot of time so as you can
06:17 - see right
06:17 - you kind of go like this and then you
06:20 - can hold the shift
06:21 - and then oops
06:26 - and then like that so something like
06:28 - this so you can just draw your own
06:31 - little boxes and then draw another small
06:33 - box
06:34 - uh from here you can just like uh copy
06:37 - this
06:39 - make it a you know different color right
06:41 - obviously you can
06:42 - let's say use this color here then you
06:44 - can just fill this inside
06:46 - and then make this one's sorry and then
06:49 - make this one smaller
06:51 - [Music]
06:52 - and then and then you can say front
06:56 - so something like that right so like
06:57 - this one this one's like this
06:59 - so something like this you can draw your
07:01 - own and then this is just the yellow
07:03 - yellow with the pen filling so you can
07:06 - just match them all
07:07 - up so after all that oops i actually
07:11 - moved it my whole thing
07:14 - that's bad let me take this again
07:18 - i'll group it together pull it
07:22 - back to the center here
07:28 - so i accidentally put a little block
07:29 - over here uh let me delete that
07:33 - so you can just kind of move it like
07:35 - this try and make sure that
07:37 - it can show up on the in the screen
07:39 - something like this will be okay
07:47 - okay i think that's good enough okay so
07:49 - this is our background
07:51 - okay let me trash this one
07:55 - and uh yeah we can rename our project
07:58 - like
07:59 - among us okay
08:04 - platform
08:05 - [Music]
08:07 - okay all right so what we're going to do
08:10 - is
08:13 - uh we can i'm going to drag in this one
08:15 - so we're going to
08:16 - paint this one i'll show you what i mean
08:19 - so we're going to call this
08:20 - main character
08:24 - so the main character we are going to
08:26 - use a
08:27 - a a costume like this
08:32 - i'll put on the first custom so i'll
08:34 - show you what i mean
08:36 - okay so this is a little black box right
08:39 - so also
08:40 - we're gonna paint another costume
08:43 - so this is the animated character
08:46 - [Music]
08:49 - so this can be anything so uh what we're
08:51 - going to do we're going to upload the uh
08:53 - the sprite that we have downloaded
08:55 - so uh as you can see this idle will
08:58 - update idle first
09:01 - then we'll upload more
09:04 - and we'll walk so they have different
09:06 - ones so we'll just take
09:08 - all this
09:09 - [Music]
09:12 - all right and we'll trash this so idle
09:15 - is the first one
09:16 - it doesn't matter first one the last one
09:18 - i think in my original one i had it as
09:20 - the
09:20 - last one but uh doesn't matter so we
09:23 - have this
09:25 - idol so what you want to do is this
09:29 - so we're going to make this main
09:30 - character you control the movement for
09:32 - the main character
09:34 - and then you want the uh anime character
09:36 - following the main character
09:37 - so that is actually a little bit better
09:39 - so that the the code when you are doing
09:41 - it
09:41 - you know you can have more control and
09:43 - doesn't like glitch to the uh
09:45 - platform so what you can do is uh this
09:48 - you take one of this guy
09:50 - copy this ctrl a ctrl c
09:53 - okay go here so what you want to do is
09:56 - you want to
09:57 - fit this black square you see how this
10:00 - black square is kind of like the same
10:01 - size as this guy so it doesn't matter
10:03 - what color the square is
10:05 - so you want to try to fit the black
10:07 - square around the same size this
10:09 - this guy so that way you know um
10:12 - they when you touch the uh with the main
10:15 - character which is the black square
10:17 - touch like
10:18 - any of the object like spikes or
10:19 - whatever when it died
10:21 - right so you want to make it pretty much
10:24 - the same size
10:25 - okay and and then you can adjust it
10:28 - later how you want to
10:29 - adjust the the sprite maybe make it a
10:31 - little bit lower or higher like that
10:33 - whatever it is i'll show you what i'm in
10:35 - later uh so uh for right now
10:38 - you can't put uh put the black box in
10:41 - the center kind of thing
10:42 - right and then you put the main
10:44 - character and
10:45 - also in the center right so the main
10:47 - character is also in the center so you
10:48 - can convert the vector
10:50 - right so you see he's the center right
10:52 - so we want to put this around the center
10:54 - and this is black box is also around the
10:56 - center okay
10:58 - all right so we don't need this costume
10:59 - too so do a custom one
11:01 - so you just draw the black box you know
11:03 - how to draw a black box right
11:04 - just select this guy just draw a black
11:07 - box you can do no
11:08 - outline okay okay all right
11:12 - so we are done with the main character
11:14 - so we're gonna make him follow that
11:15 - [Music]
11:17 - okay so we're gonna create some level uh
11:19 - variable
11:20 - let's rename the first one uh
11:23 - level
11:26 - uh for all the sprite and this one let's
11:30 - trash this okay
11:34 - and then we'll create some more variable
11:37 - uh later on uh for now let's just keep
11:40 - it like this
11:40 - simple first and then we have to go to
11:43 - uh
11:44 - when start we're holding on the main
11:46 - character again
11:47 - by the way uh what we're going to do is
11:50 - set the level to
11:51 - one
11:54 - so we're gonna start with level one
11:58 - uh what we're going to do is we're gonna
12:00 - create a block
12:02 - called uh reset so for the reset block
12:07 - so for the reset block we're gonna use
12:09 - it to reset the uh
12:10 - some of the position and stuff like that
12:13 - so
12:14 - uh what we're gonna do is move
12:18 - this guy to uh
12:21 - go to 200 and zero
12:25 - or negative hundred sorry i wanna going
12:28 - to
12:29 - go to the left side so when you start it
12:31 - was somewhere in the left
12:33 - okay so we're gonna change the size to
12:35 - 50 here for both of these guys
12:38 - they're too big so so both the black box
12:42 - and the animated character who want to
12:43 - be 50 size
12:45 - or you can change it through with the
12:46 - code here as well it's fine
12:50 - okay or you can do the size set the size
12:54 - to
12:54 - 50 as well
12:57 - okay all right
13:00 - and we are going to reset and go to this
13:03 - level
13:03 - so we can use this to reset like when
13:05 - the player die and then
13:07 - uh the velocity and jumping and gravity
13:10 - and all that so
13:11 - for now we just have this okay so
13:14 - we created the reset so what we're going
13:17 - to do is we're going to call reset
13:19 - under here and then we are going to
13:22 - broadcast a message
13:25 - okay
13:29 - start game
13:35 - okay start game and we have a
13:39 - start game when i receive start game
13:44 - i'm going to change the ghost effect
13:49 - so we want to make the black character
13:52 - the like kind of ghost
13:54 - go away so and then we're going to make
13:56 - this guy in front of the black character
13:58 - okay so we'll make it ghost effect
14:01 - [Music]
14:05 - okay so here set the close effect
14:08 - [Music]
14:09 - to 100 and we're to make sure we have a
14:14 - show
14:17 - for right now um we are going to define
14:20 - another variable actually we'll make
14:22 - another variable
14:24 - uh we're going to call g for global
14:25 - variable
14:27 - so we know it's player
14:30 - dead okay for all sprite
14:35 - what we want to do is in this reset
14:38 - i want to set this
14:41 - okay so let's say false
14:45 - okay so play is not that then we're
14:47 - going to use a repeat until here
14:50 - [Music]
14:53 - and then we have to use the operator
14:58 - okay and we are going to say
15:03 - repeat until player dead which is true
15:06 - you can use one or zero or true or false
15:09 - doesn't matter
15:11 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
15:12 - do another broadcast
15:16 - here say start
15:20 - or control so this will
15:23 - uh tell it to start all the control
15:28 - okay we're going to make another
15:29 - variable here
15:33 - global variable also speed x
15:37 - for the sprite
15:42 - we're going to make another block
15:46 - movement control
15:50 - okay we're going to run it with our
15:53 - screen refresh
15:54 - okay so this is very important make sure
15:57 - you check that
15:57 - so that you know the uh the sprite will
16:00 - run much more smoother you wouldn't want
16:02 - to see the refresh every time with it
16:04 - kind of move up and down or whatever
16:06 - okay
16:07 - so what we're going to do is
16:12 - let's say everything else
16:18 - and then if later if key
16:21 - [Music]
16:23 - key yeah okay
16:26 - right arrow key right arrow
16:30 - uh what we're going to do is set
16:37 - uh global speed x to 5
16:42 - okay and then duplicate this
16:46 - and we are going to use another if
16:49 - condition here
16:50 - oops inside here
16:54 - and then we're going to check the left
16:56 - arrow here
16:57 - [Music]
17:01 - sorry so we'll put another if and else
17:04 - okay here we go and then this is the
17:08 - left arrow key
17:11 - and we are going to do a negative five
17:16 - and then here we are going to set it at
17:18 - zero
17:19 - just in case there's something else
17:20 - button we don't want it to move
17:23 - okay all right so this is the movement
17:26 - control we had
17:28 - okay okay so we have the broadcast start
17:32 - all control
17:33 - so we have to say
17:36 - um receive start all control
17:42 - what we're going to do is we're going to
17:43 - call the movement
17:46 - so my block okay
17:50 - what i'm going to do is take out the
17:51 - ghost effect for right now so that we
17:53 - can see
17:55 - okay so we're going to make a new block
17:59 - we're gonna move the hitbox
18:05 - uh we are going to have a uh an input
18:09 - we'll call speed x
18:12 - uh make it run without refresh as well
18:16 - and we're gonna put it on this side
18:21 - uh what we're going to do is uh change x
18:24 - make sure you get the change x okay is
18:27 - it x
18:30 - okay so what we're going to do is i'm
18:32 - going to create another broadcast so
18:34 - later we can use it
18:35 - uh we're going to check the platform
18:37 - it's called um so that we could
18:39 - use it for later on uh well we can put
18:42 - this here
18:43 - i'll call another call check
18:48 - platform detection
18:55 - okay i hope i spelled that right uh so
18:58 - next let's say check platform
19:01 - detection here we'll call this uh my
19:05 - block
19:06 - move hitbox and we are going to move
19:11 - with this variable okay
19:14 - all right let's just try it out
19:16 - [Music]
19:18 - so as you can see we can move this uh
19:20 - box
19:21 - right left and right kind of thing
19:25 - okay so we'll stop like around here for
19:28 - now
19:29 - uh so next time we'll work on the uh
19:32 - making this guy you know uh
19:35 - kind of move and stuff uh
19:39 - i guess we could just make him go to
19:40 - this one for now
19:42 - we'll be a little pretty quick uh let's
19:44 - just start here
19:46 - we're almost done um so and then we'll
19:49 - set
19:50 - the set the rotation
19:54 - style left to right or you can just
19:57 - click on this
19:58 - and click this okay it's the same so
20:00 - make sure that it doesn't flip over
20:02 - upside down okay
20:04 - and then you will say look go to
20:07 - front layer and then we'll
20:11 - say show uh
20:14 - draw in this forever
20:18 - and we say go to
20:21 - the main character which is the black
20:23 - box
20:24 - okay so for now we have this code let's
20:28 - just kind of
20:29 - see how girls run it so as you can see
20:33 - the black box is moving and this guy is
20:36 - following him
20:37 - right so later we can make him jump down
20:41 - here doesn't matter
20:42 - so uh so right now you see it's kind of
20:44 - following him
20:46 - okay and then you can hide this so
20:49 - put this back over here all right
20:54 - let's start again so you can see he's
20:56 - kind of moving
20:57 - left and right and you don't see the
20:59 - black box there's the black box actually
21:01 - doing the movement
21:02 - and we can animate this character later
21:05 - [Music]
21:06 - okay so we'll stop right here so please
21:09 - uh
21:10 - share like uh subscribe to our channel
21:13 - and i will continue this next time i
21:16 - will
21:16 - go with the part two uh with like
21:19 - some more code for the animated sprite
21:21 - to jump and stuff like that
21:23 - and then maybe doing some of the
21:24 - platform okay
21:26 - all right so this is all the code here
21:29 - so make sure you guys do subscribe
21:31 - to our channel okay and give us a thumbs
