00:00 - thank you
00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - welcome back guys it's kitchen
00:08 - playground here and today we're back
00:10 - from the beginning of scratch and today
00:11 - we'll be making us game called skeleton
00:13 - Blaster where you kill skeletons which
00:15 - is the objective and then um you fight a
00:18 - skeleton boss in the end so I'm gonna
00:19 - download the game for you
00:21 - so basically there's some music that
00:23 - plays and then the skeletons chase after
00:25 - you and when you get hit you lose a life
00:27 - and then um you see uh the lives up here
00:31 - uh they're losing so if you die then
00:34 - your tank could just break it says you
00:35 - lose so that's basically
00:38 - um
00:39 - the game and uh you have to kill
00:42 - something so uh if you kill this you you
00:44 - shoot the
00:46 - um explosive balls that just destroy the
00:48 - skeletons
00:50 - and then um once you get more than 175
00:53 - score which I'll be there in soon
00:56 - um the skeleton boss will come out
00:57 - [Music]
01:02 - so each shelter gives five and then the
01:04 - Skeleton thing is out you can see his
01:06 - health bar up here and he's chasing
01:08 - after me and then um
01:11 - make your click rate a little quicker at
01:13 - this point because uh you will not
01:15 - survive if he hits you uh so the
01:19 - objective is basically to kill him and
01:21 - then you win in the end but if you die
01:23 - by him that means you um if you get hit
01:25 - by him then if you lose so yeah
01:27 - basically that's it you win and then you
01:30 - have your score up here great
01:34 - so we're gonna be making this project
01:36 - today
01:39 - okay so first off we're gonna name this
01:41 - skeleton blaster
01:44 - oh
01:46 - skeleton blaster
01:48 - and we're gonna add some uh stuff in the
01:51 - backpack to our project so first we have
01:54 - the tank
01:56 - we also have I'll show you how to draw
01:58 - this
01:59 - um and then we also have the Blaster we
02:01 - also have the ball the explosion
02:04 - the Skeleton King
02:06 - and the you and you lose right so
02:10 - um we have the whole entire thing over
02:14 - here so for the tank
02:16 - to draw it um I'm gonna give you a
02:18 - little tutorial so
02:20 - um here's the tank
02:23 - so you have to draw the small sector
02:25 - first which you use as um rectangle and
02:29 - you can just reshape it so it looks like
02:32 - some sort of trapezoid
02:35 - and then you also have to do for the
02:37 - secondary layer so we're also going to
02:39 - draw another rectangle
02:41 - right like that
02:42 - and then reshape it to look like a
02:45 - trapezoid
02:46 - so I will have all of these Sprites on a
02:49 - no code project in my uh profile that
02:52 - you can copy off so my profile is
02:54 - Gumball 098 so and then over here you
02:57 - just put the wheels so you just make a
02:59 - rectangle and use reshape tool
03:04 - this reshape tool to
03:07 - kind of just turn that into some sort of
03:11 - uh ellipse slash Circle
03:15 - and yeah we're just going to turn that
03:17 - into
03:19 - um the wheel thing
03:23 - yeah and then you just draw circles in
03:24 - the middle to the wheels
03:27 - so Circle
03:31 - and then uh hold shift down to make uh
03:33 - like a perfect circle
03:35 - and then uh you can just use Ctrl C Ctrl
03:38 - V to make the other two wheels on the
03:42 - wheel
03:44 - so yeah and also we do have a scratch
03:47 - cat that scratch head that we're gonna
03:50 - put in so you just take like Sprite one
03:52 - just a scratch cat Ctrl C that and then
03:55 - go to the tank and then Ctrl V just
03:58 - maybe reshape it a little bit oops she's
04:00 - gonna group those two together
04:02 - yeah there we go take that one just
04:04 - shrink it a little bit put it on
04:07 - so it's just a scratch cat with the
04:09 - thing with the head
04:11 - so I'm gonna uh show you how the Blaster
04:13 - looks like so basically it's just a
04:15 - rectangle where you reshape it and you
04:18 - have like a little trapezoid on top and
04:20 - you have
04:22 - um sort of a reshaped rectangle over
04:24 - there it's just like a rectangle over
04:26 - here to for some shadow look so uh this
04:30 - is a blaster that we use from our July
04:31 - 4th game so you can go check that out in
04:34 - our channel so I'm just gonna delete
04:36 - this tank real quick and we'll just use
04:37 - this one
04:38 - and then there's also this tank
04:41 - which is
04:42 - so this is just basically like without
04:44 - the Blaster because the blasters are
04:46 - spread of its own which has basically
04:48 - like the
04:50 - um so it can move not like this one say
04:53 - stationary this is just for positioning
04:55 - so we're going to copy the tank over the
04:58 - cat tank so it can control C and then
05:02 - you move it to the Blaster you may you
05:05 - paint and just by Ctrl V so to get the
05:07 - right size and positioning you just
05:09 - delete this part and then now you're
05:11 - left with the Blaster and that we don't
05:13 - we're gonna delete that and then you
05:14 - just left hit the Blaster here for usage
05:19 - and now you have the blaster
05:22 - and basically the ball is just three
05:24 - circles it's not that hard just to
05:26 - research them yeah and then you just
05:27 - like position it
05:32 - and that's just the three balls over
05:34 - there oh I just did it for three colors
05:36 - because it looks better
05:37 - so now moving on to the explosion it's
05:40 - basically three costumes so we have uh
05:43 - zoom out so we have the uh second one
05:47 - and the first one second and third one
05:48 - so this one this grows up to the large
05:51 - ones so basically you just use like a
05:54 - really thick yellow line to draw extra
05:57 - like explosion effect so it's great
06:01 - and yeah so the Skeleton King we just
06:03 - made a skeleton and we got a crown and a
06:06 - sword from the internet and we just put
06:08 - it on
06:09 - here's the crown cartoons and then
06:11 - here's the sword cartoons
06:14 - so yeah we have that and we added it
06:16 - onto the skeleton
06:18 - and we used remove BG to remove the
06:22 - um background for the the internet like
06:25 - the swords and the crown
06:28 - okay and then we're just gonna move on
06:29 - to you and you lose it's just some
06:31 - simple writing you and use
06:33 - so uh we're going to delete the splash
06:36 - cat we do not need that
06:40 - and yeah so
06:43 - we have all our Sprites here except for
06:45 - the skeleton which I'm gonna put in
06:47 - right now
06:48 - so skeleton
06:51 - there
06:53 - it's okay so great so now we're gonna
06:54 - start coding
06:57 - so first we're going to make some
06:58 - variables for the project so the first
07:01 - one that we're making is lives
07:03 - we also have the king HP variable
07:10 - we also have score
07:15 - um and X position and Y position so
07:17 - let's get that
07:21 - X position
07:23 - I can't delete this variable quickly
07:26 - and then y position y
07:28 - position position
07:31 - so yeah we have all our variables King
07:33 - HP Livescore Expedition black position
07:36 - so now we're gonna start coding so for
07:39 - the tank let's go to the tank
07:44 - sees so when the green flag is clicked
07:47 - it will set lives to 10. you can of
07:51 - course alter this in any way you would
07:53 - like
07:54 - and then uh and set scores to zero
08:00 - and it will go to I already have the
08:03 - position here but you can just go around
08:04 - around here so around just here and then
08:07 - it'll switch costume to tank one
08:10 - because we do have three things we have
08:13 - three costumes this one and then the
08:15 - broken one and then this one so of
08:17 - course take one and then clear graphic
08:20 - effects
08:22 - um so
08:23 - we're going to start with
08:26 - okay so we're trying to finish the tank
08:28 - first so when the green flag is clicked
08:31 - it will wait one second
08:34 - and then forever
08:36 - um you need to if then
08:38 - so if then right here if then it touches
08:41 - the skeleton touching
08:43 - skeleton then you'll change lives by
08:46 - minus one
08:47 - of course you can alter how much life
08:49 - you want it to change but for right now
08:51 - it's negative one and then it'll start
08:53 - sound bite so you can tell if they have
08:57 - hit you or not and then you'll broadcast
08:59 - hit cat
09:01 - podcast
09:03 - hit cat
09:06 - so we have hit cut and then you need if
09:09 - then
09:10 - so you need if then right here under not
09:13 - over here under
09:14 - no actually no in here like that
09:18 - so if then
09:20 - over here
09:21 - or
09:24 - the lives are equal to zero
09:27 - let's get the lives potential equals
09:30 - zero
09:31 - or lives
09:34 - are less than zero so if you have died
09:38 - or Taken
09:40 - um less than zero lives then they'll
09:43 - broadcast game over
09:44 - thank you
09:50 - came over
09:53 - so now we're going to move on to here so
09:56 - when I receive hit cat this is just for
10:00 - uh visual effect repeat five
10:04 - and it'll change the color by 25 change
10:06 - color effect of course and then clear
10:08 - graphic effects after that and then
10:12 - you put
10:14 - um
10:15 - when I receive
10:18 - game over
10:20 - it will stop off
10:24 - so yeah we have this over here for now
10:26 - we might come back to the tank later for
10:28 - some extra cook so let's move on to the
10:31 - blaster
10:35 - so when the green flag is clicked
10:39 - um you'll point in Direction 90 which is
10:41 - this way and point that Rush 90.
10:45 - you know go to this position of course
10:47 - you can put it uh next to the tank
10:50 - somewhere near it just right here
10:52 - and then
10:54 - for forever it will Point towards Mouse
10:57 - pointer Point towards Mouse pointer so
10:59 - it'll follow your mouse if you didn't
11:00 - see in the demo it'll follow your mouse
11:02 - like that
11:04 - and then you have to have an if then
11:06 - statement if then the mouse is down so
11:09 - that means if you click
11:11 - then it will wait until
11:16 - not Mouse down so you can't just Spam
11:18 - click because spam clicking is a little
11:20 - broken
11:22 - so but until not messed down and then
11:24 - create clone of fall
11:26 - but create a clone
11:28 - of the ball
11:31 - so uh no spam clicking
11:34 - and then after that when the green flick
11:36 - is when the green flag is clicked it
11:39 - will switch costume to costume one which
11:42 - is this one
11:43 - uh clear graphic effects
11:47 - because when it receives hit cat it will
11:50 - also change color effect so we're gonna
11:51 - put that to repeat five times
11:55 - change color effect
11:58 - and clear graphic effects so I think we
12:01 - are done with the Blaster feel free to
12:03 - pause right here and now we're gonna
12:04 - move on to the ball since we have
12:07 - increased I mean um yeah made a clone of
12:11 - the ball
12:15 - so when I started as a clone
12:20 - oh yeah and first of all when the green
12:22 - fog is clicked it'll hide
12:25 - and oh then when the when I started to
12:28 - clone
12:29 - they'll set gravity
12:32 - to zero which is gonna be a new
12:36 - um
12:38 - variable here
12:40 - which is a part of the ball so gravity
12:43 - is going to be gravity gravity and is
12:48 - for this Spy only so click on this
12:51 - and it will set gravity
12:54 - to zero and then to a set size by 50
12:57 - percent
13:01 - and it'll go to the Blaster so it'll
13:03 - start the blaster
13:06 - and after that it'll Point towards Mouse
13:08 - pointer just like the Blaster and then
13:11 - it will go to the back layer
13:15 - as well as it will show
13:18 - then repeat until soon you repeat until
13:21 - right now repeat until touching Edge so
13:24 - this is until the ball touches the edge
13:27 - it will move 12 steps
13:29 - so it's pretty quick we have 12 steps
13:32 - and then change gravity
13:36 - by negative 0.3 so negative 2.3 so it
13:40 - will slowly fall back down
13:42 - and then it will change y
13:45 - 'all by
13:47 - gravity no no no all right
13:50 - change y by gravity
13:53 - yep and then it will delete this clip
14:00 - so when I start as a clone
14:02 - it will set
14:04 - a new variable called
14:07 - wait
14:09 - which is
14:11 - a part of the ball so ball there's gonna
14:15 - be a variable weight so this is also a
14:17 - very important task for this right only
14:20 - and then we have that so and it'll set
14:23 - weight 2.5 so
14:26 - I'll explain this after so set weight to
14:28 - 1.5
14:29 - and then it'll reset timer
14:35 - and after that it will wait until
14:41 - you need three ores so stick with me on
14:44 - this one or or
14:47 - or so wait until touching skeleton so
14:50 - the ball will stop you know so it'll
14:53 - just keep on flying until it touches the
14:54 - skeleton
14:56 - or it touches the Skeleton King
15:00 - Skeleton King
15:03 - well I I added actual word by bad so
15:06 - throw that away and then or and then you
15:09 - put this
15:10 - so greater than symbol
15:12 - timer
15:15 - is greater than
15:16 - wait
15:21 - like that and then
15:24 - you set
15:26 - the X position
15:29 - to X position so set X position to X
15:34 - position and then you duplicate that set
15:37 - y position oops y position to Y position
15:42 - just like that and then broadcast
15:44 - explode
15:47 - broadcast
15:49 - explode
15:52 - and after that it'll delete this call
15:59 - so this is all for the all Sprite
16:01 - um so let's see
16:04 - feel free to pause
16:06 - and uh this is basically showing uh so
16:10 - this weight is 1.5 seconds so it will
16:13 - the ball will fly for 1.5 seconds and if
16:15 - it doesn't hit the skeleton or the
16:16 - Skeleton King it'll just explode on the
16:18 - spot
16:19 - and then it'll
16:21 - um so if the timer is greater than the
16:23 - weight which is 1.5
16:25 - um it'll just explode right there if it
16:27 - doesn't hit anything
16:28 - so yeah
16:30 - have the ball finished now we're going
16:32 - to move on to the skeleton
16:33 - so the skeleton
16:36 - first of all the size is 75 so oopsies
16:40 - that's the ball my back
16:42 - it was 100 right but it's going to be 50
16:45 - anyway so it doesn't really matter and
16:47 - then um the skeleton
16:51 - I'm gonna go over here and the skeleton
16:54 - is 75 so 75. and then after that
16:59 - uh we're gonna have
17:01 - oops when the green flag is clicked
17:07 - and the green fog is clicked it'll set
17:09 - the rotation Style by left right so it
17:11 - doesn't like flip over does some weird
17:13 - jumbo Mumbo
17:14 - to no hide
17:16 - like this
17:18 - and then forever
17:21 - it will
17:23 - create a clone of itself and it'll wait
17:26 - wait
17:30 - I'll pick random
17:32 - uh 0.25
17:35 - 0.25 seconds to 0.75 so it'll wait how
17:40 - long for the next skeleton to spawn
17:45 - and then after that
17:46 - okay so we have a lot of when I started
17:48 - to clone stuff so when I start as a club
17:50 - right here
17:54 - it'll repeat until
17:56 - it touches the tank so
17:59 - repeat until touching tank
18:03 - and then it'll go next costume
18:07 - and then wait 0.5 seconds so it's just
18:11 - um just the animation of it walking and
18:14 - then delete this clone
18:26 - it will go to
18:30 - go to x 175 so I calculated this it's
18:34 - around here x 175 and then pick random
18:38 - the Y from negative 120 to 0. basically
18:43 - here to like here
18:46 - and then after that it'll show
18:51 - and then it will repeat until touching
18:54 - the tank so repeat until
18:57 - touching the tank
18:59 - [Music]
19:01 - and then it'll Point towards the tank
19:07 - so just follow the tank try to knock it
19:10 - down and then it'll move two steps
19:16 - and then delete this clone
19:22 - so and then you have another one I
19:24 - started to clone so when I start as a
19:26 - clone wait until
19:30 - wait until uh touching tank so just keep
19:33 - on going until it touches the tank
19:37 - and then it'll wait 0.1 seconds
19:40 - so the damage can register correctly if
19:43 - you do not have this weight is very
19:44 - important
19:45 - and then it'll delete this cloud
19:47 - just like that
19:49 - and then we have another one I started
19:51 - to clone it's a lot
19:55 - you can put it over here when I started
19:56 - to clone
19:57 - forever
19:59 - it will if then if it's touching the
20:02 - explosion so if it hits the
20:05 - the thing that the tank shoots out the
20:07 - explosion
20:09 - then it will start to sound rattle
20:13 - because it passed away
20:15 - and then it will change score
20:19 - by five
20:22 - and also delete this club
20:28 - and also uh another one I started as a
20:31 - clone I know it's a lot but hold on
20:33 - we're gonna start just a clone you need
20:35 - an if then statement
20:37 - if then the score is greater than 175 so
20:40 - we can put this score is greater than
20:45 - 975 then it was broadcast show Skeleton
20:48 - King so basically if your score is
20:51 - higher than 175 it will show The
20:55 - Skeleton Key
20:57 - so this is all the code
21:00 - maybe we can know okay so
21:03 - um this is all the code so feel free to
21:05 - pause at this moment I'm gonna give you
21:07 - like three seconds so just feel free to
21:09 - pause
21:10 - so yeah
21:11 - um we're gonna move on to the explosion
21:17 - so explosion
21:19 - when the green flag is clicked
21:22 - the green flag is clicked it will hide
21:26 - and then it will go forever
21:29 - and next costume so basically
21:33 - see it has three costumes like I showed
21:35 - earlier and it'll just be all three and
21:38 - it looks cool so yeah
21:39 - and also when I receive
21:44 - explode then it will go to
21:48 - go to x
21:49 - so we're gonna add a put an ad over here
21:52 - operator
21:54 - um X position
21:57 - plus 100
21:59 - and then y position y position
22:02 - so basically this is showing
22:04 - um
22:05 - uh where the explosion will be uh from
22:08 - terms of a ball so it will be 100
22:12 - um
22:13 - oh off from the ball but the same y
22:15 - position so that's pretty cool and then
22:18 - it'll show
22:20 - and repeat 15 times
22:25 - it'll rotate
22:28 - turn 15 degrees and then hide
22:36 - and after that we're going to move on to
22:38 - the Skeleton King
22:44 - and
22:45 - let's take a look at the Skeleton King
22:47 - so
22:49 - when the green flag is clicked
22:53 - and the green flag is clicked it'll hide
22:55 - variable King HB so since the king is
22:58 - not out no hide King HP and then it'll
23:00 - go to
23:02 - on a certain position you can put it
23:04 - like somewhere over here or if you want
23:06 - to make a challenge and put us some more
23:07 - over here but just put it somewhere over
23:09 - here
23:10 - and then it will go hide
23:13 - and then you'll set King HP
23:17 - to 5000. oops two thousand no five
23:21 - thousand and then
23:23 - when I receive
23:26 - show Skeleton King it will repeat until
23:30 - touching tank so it just
23:32 - tried to
23:35 - destroy that tank
23:37 - and then next costume
23:41 - uh it'll wait
23:45 - 0.25 seconds between each rotation of
23:48 - the costume and then we're gonna move on
23:50 - to this part so when I receive
23:56 - show the Skeleton King it will show the
23:59 - variable
24:01 - King HP and then it will show
24:05 - he'll try to destroy that tank he'll
24:08 - repeat until
24:10 - repeat until touching tank
24:14 - project touching tank
24:17 - and then we'll move two steps
24:21 - so of course you can make them like
24:22 - quicker if you want it more challenging
24:24 - or slower if you want it to be more
24:25 - easier
24:26 - and then wait
24:28 - 0.5 seconds
24:32 - okay and then when I receive
24:38 - came over
24:40 - it will stop other Scripts
24:44 - in this Spike
24:48 - now we're going to move on to
24:52 - um
24:52 - this part which is a really big bunch so
24:55 - hang tight
24:57 - when I receive
25:00 - show Skeleton King
25:02 - it will forever so far right here
25:06 - um if then if any statement if then
25:10 - if then it's touching the explosion
25:15 - then it will change King HP
25:20 - by minus 10 and if you notice that
25:23 - um why it changed by so much per shot
25:25 - it's because it stays on the king for a
25:28 - little while and then splash registers
25:30 - pretty quickly so it does more than
25:33 - 10 damage
25:34 - and then after that you need an if then
25:36 - statement right here under
25:39 - if then
25:41 - the king HP so or
25:45 - so if then the king HP
25:49 - is
25:51 - equal to zero
25:53 - or the king HP
25:57 - is less than zero
26:01 - then it will stop other scripts in the
26:04 - Sprite because
26:06 - you have defeated the king
26:09 - and then it will hide your looking HP
26:14 - and then it will hide
26:18 - then broadcast you win
26:28 - and then after the broadcast you win you
26:31 - have to have another if then
26:32 - if then
26:34 - touching tank
26:36 - so if it touches the tank it will
26:39 - broadcast game over because it's a one
26:41 - hit construct
26:43 - but I guess game over you know set lives
26:47 - to zero
26:51 - as well as stop the script
26:54 - so I won't continue walking or whatever
26:56 - it does
26:58 - and then after that we move on to the
27:01 - you win you lose Sprite so let's take a
27:04 - look at this
27:08 - so the green flag is clicked
27:12 - it will go to x00 as x0 y zero hide
27:18 - it'll hide
27:19 - and then when I receive
27:23 - game over
27:25 - then it will switch costume to costume
27:27 - two which is to you lose one so switch
27:29 - costume
27:31 - costume two and then show
27:34 - and then duplicate when I receive you
27:38 - win and no switch costume the costume of
27:40 - one and then show so when is this one
27:43 - yay and then the backdrop we will use
27:46 - Woods
27:51 - woods and then the music for this
27:55 - save it so the music for this is going
27:59 - to be so when the green flag is clicked
28:02 - it will change a set volume to 25 this
28:06 - is completely optional it's just because
28:07 - you can hear me while I'm demoing the
28:09 - game again and then um it'll forever
28:14 - play
28:15 - the medieval one sound effect
28:19 - [Music]
28:20 - it's kind of loud
28:22 - and then so let's put that in place on
28:25 - medieval
28:27 - one until done
28:29 - so now we have that finished we can hide
28:31 - the variables to our liking so X
28:34 - position y position can be hot hidden
28:36 - scores and lies will keep in King HP can
28:39 - be hidden for now and then we go to the
28:41 - ball
28:42 - ball gravity is going to be closed same
28:45 - with weight and then I guess you can put
28:48 - the lives up here
28:50 - and then the score all the way up here
28:52 - so now we can save the project Uno it
28:55 - should work yeah great so let's see
28:58 - we still do have two more scripts in the
29:01 - scratch chat that we might have
29:02 - forgotten or I have forgotten
29:05 - um about game over and you win so when I
29:08 - receive
29:10 - you win it will stop all
29:15 - and then after that
29:17 - when I receive
29:20 - when I receive
29:23 - game over
29:25 - it will
29:28 - switch costume to tank two
29:33 - and now if you need to if then so if
29:37 - then you need a or
29:40 - if
29:41 - the lives
29:46 - are equal
29:48 - to
29:48 - zero or
29:51 - lives are less than zero
29:56 - then
30:00 - it will
30:04 - um switch costume to costume two just
30:06 - take two
30:08 - so now we have all the code for
30:11 - everything here
30:13 - so right now we have this is the
30:16 - tank Sprite feel free to pause it give
30:18 - me like two seconds blaster
30:23 - feel free to pause ball
30:28 - it should work skeleton
30:36 - and then explosion
30:40 - yeah
30:40 - and then Skeleton King
30:47 - pass right here
30:50 - oh and we have one more thing before I
30:53 - just noticed when I receive
30:58 - um you win
30:59 - it will also stop other scripts in the
31:01 - Sprite so stop
31:03 - other scripts in this right so
31:06 - this should be the right
31:11 - code and then you lose you win
31:15 - and then the background so great now
31:18 - let's demo the game it just always does
31:21 - that
31:24 - so it does seem to be working I'll demo
31:26 - the game one last time so the live score
31:29 - and then the skeletons
31:32 - and then if I get hit I'm gonna get hit
31:39 - so um we're gonna win try to win so uh
31:43 - let's get to 175 score
31:47 - activate the king
31:48 - [Music]
31:51 - King is out oh no
31:54 - let's try to kill him
31:58 - he's not that hard if you just
32:01 - um click really quickly
32:03 - and then I should win if I get
32:09 - yeah it does work so and also
32:12 - um we do want to
32:15 - move the king HP here for just better
32:18 - look
32:19 - it's completely fine though and then if
32:22 - I lose let's see if it works
32:26 - [Music]
32:30 - so the you lose does work and I pointed
32:34 - this out so there's the Blaster is
32:35 - actually in front which
32:38 - um is doesn't look that good so we're
32:40 - gonna go to the tank and make it go to
32:43 - the front layer so
32:44 - it's now behind
32:47 - I guess we can also add that
32:49 - so yeah now we have the tank and
32:53 - the
32:54 - the skeleton Blaster and it still says
32:56 - Untold 55 here for some reason so let's
32:59 - delete that
33:00 - foreign
33:02 - this is what we have made today so
33:07 - um please like
