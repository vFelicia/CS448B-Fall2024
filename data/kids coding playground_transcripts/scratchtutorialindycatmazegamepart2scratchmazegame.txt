00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to the channel kids
00:09 - go to kalindra
00:09 - today we'll be continuing on the second
00:12 - episode of Endicott nice game so if you
00:15 - haven't seen the first one I suggest you
00:17 - to watch the first video first before
00:19 - going on to this one so this is the code
00:23 - we got from the first video I'm gonna
00:25 - drag through it and let you guys see
00:28 - look through the code and if you missed
00:32 - anything I suggest you guys to copy it
00:34 - right now you can pause the video and
00:36 - copy drag slow okay so that's all the
00:43 - code we have for now so next we'll be
00:45 - working on the turnstile this thing that
00:48 - turns around so all we want for this one
00:52 - it's pretty simple just drag it when
00:54 - flag clicked go to this position
00:57 - negative 195 Y negative 30 forever turn
01:04 - to the right one degree so we'll turn
01:08 - see look if I play it just going to turn
01:13 - kind of turn slowly so that's pretty
01:19 - much all the code for turnstile it's
01:21 - pretty simple let's do the whip tail
01:23 - this is the monster that moves around
01:25 - here and it can get the Indiana Jones
01:29 - Indy cat
01:31 - so um yesterday I mentioned in the first
01:34 - video to set it to size 40 so you if you
01:37 - haven't then set it to size 40 first
01:39 - okay so for this we want to track it one
01:43 - clicked when the flag clicked pointing
01:45 - direction of ninety so I'll point to the
01:47 - right in the beginning and we want it to
01:52 - go I have the coordinates written down
01:56 - so the coordinates I have are 190
02:00 - negative 197 negative 1 to 49 of course
02:06 - you guys can put any coordinate
02:07 - somewhere around here so that's fine
02:11 - and Warner forever loop glide five
02:18 - seconds again I have the coordinates
02:21 - written down to 171 171 and why negative
02:28 - 49
02:29 - so uh glide somewhere around here and
02:33 - then come back so we want it to come
02:36 - back we'll let it wait two seconds so
02:39 - the player can have some time to get up
02:41 - here and get the key wait two seconds
02:44 - one direction negative ninety so I'll
02:47 - look to the left say make him ninety
02:51 - then we can glide another five seconds
02:54 - back to the beginning of negative one 97
02:59 - and 197 y- 149 so next thing we want to
03:08 - wait another two seconds to let the
03:10 - player have a chance you'll toss the
03:13 - ball and point your action of 90 so turn
03:17 - to the right again and it'll repeat
03:20 - forever so as you can see when you play
03:22 - it it goes through glides glides it's a
03:27 - look right here wait two seconds then
03:29 - glides back and I'll stop right here and
03:34 - it will keep on doing it so yeah so
03:38 - that's the code for the whiptail so this
03:42 - top wall which is the top wall that it
03:46 - doesn't move for anything it's just like
03:48 - a trap so look if you touch it then you
03:51 - go back to the beginning so this strap
03:54 - will just do a well all the code we need
03:58 - is one clicked go to this position
04:01 - that's all we need for this this trap
04:06 - and then for the key this is the key and
04:11 - use the key to touch the lock and once
04:15 - you touch the lock a gate will open up
04:18 - so you can go into the exit
04:19 - so for the code we want to get it one
04:22 - clicks one flat click go to this x and y
04:25 - position 220 y 0 this position wanted to
04:32 - show in the beginning so we'll need the
04:38 - waiting till block wait until touching
04:40 - in the unique at the touching the in d
04:45 - cat
04:46 - in d cat and then I have the sound
04:50 - downloaded right here start sound
04:52 - afro string it comes with the when you
04:56 - download the sprite it should come with
04:58 - the sprite the sounds so we'll need a
05:02 - forever loop skip cook Patrol's forever
05:05 - loop go to indie cat if it's touching it
05:10 - so go to indie cat go to empty cat if
05:18 - then touching lock and it's touching
05:20 - this thing if then touching lock the
05:26 - lock then it'll start something afro
05:31 - string again this is just like sound
05:33 - effects you don't have to add it if you
05:34 - don't want to have some sound effects
05:36 - will broadcast gate open gate open
05:46 - broadcast gate open so this is a gate
05:50 - will receive this and you'll move and no
05:52 - hide if it's touches so that's the code
05:57 - you can copy it down so for the lock we
06:02 - we don't really need much code just a
06:05 - one click and set the x and y position
06:10 - pretty simple and yeah throw the gate we
06:14 - wanna when our receives gate open
06:17 - then we'll play the sound called dirty
06:19 -  this is just a sound effect
06:24 - is this the one I'm not sure so
06:33 - we I don't know if this is the one but
06:36 - I'll just put it I don't know why
06:38 - there's no name for it but I just put it
06:42 - right there oak like three seconds I
06:45 - have the coordinates written down
06:48 - collide 30 seconds to 192 192 negative
06:54 - 70 why
06:55 - so one 192 negative send me why would be
06:59 - somewhere around here
07:00 - but glide right here so then you can go
07:02 - okay so one click do we want to set the
07:05 - X&Y position of this is this is for the
07:09 - walk on these it's the lock sorry that's
07:14 - the gate this is the gate
07:15 - sorry I've actually coded in the lock so
07:18 - this is the gate and then we want to set
07:21 - the X&Y position to X 69 in Y negative
07:28 - 70 so that's it for the gate so for the
07:32 - gym so for the Jeff one or get a one
07:36 - clicked one flag clicked clear all
07:39 - graphic effects so it it will like
07:41 - change color chalk color in the game so
07:44 - in the beginning I want to clear all the
07:46 - color effects in forever under everyone
07:49 - forever loop change color effect by 25
07:53 - so change color to give it a little
07:55 - effects to make it look better
07:57 - and you'll need a when flag clicks go to
08:01 - this x and y position go to X negative
08:05 - 42 Y negative 48 right there and it'll
08:10 - show in the beginning show wait until
08:15 - it's touching the MU cap okay so when it
08:18 - touches the indie cat wait until
08:22 - touching in dica so when it's touching
08:25 - the endicott go start some called fairy
08:28 - dust I have it right here
08:30 - so start some fairy dust we can
08:33 - broadcast a new message called stone so
08:36 - what this one does is to alert the it
08:41 - will broadcast the stone and the stone
08:43 - will start gliding the
08:44 - start coming up and this strap will
08:47 - start sliding in so stow on skull stone
08:51 - call it anything you want stone and hide
08:54 - it hide so that's the gem so I see it
09:00 - seen and you play the gem changes color
09:03 - right now the defense's the traps don't
09:08 - work yet because we have not coded that
09:09 - part yet but I'll just go ahead and show
09:12 - you how this keyword see opening the
09:17 - gate will open and when we take it out
09:21 - play a song called fairness so that's
09:23 - all we have for now so next we can work
09:28 - on the wall left in the wall right
09:30 - so wall left will not move anywhere it
09:33 - will just be a one click set the x and y
09:36 - position you like some other spray set
09:40 - it to negative 48
09:41 - y 67 to this position and next all right
09:47 - all right we'll need quite some more
09:50 - code because this one would be gliding
09:52 - so when clicked you want to set the X
09:54 - and y position when clicked set the X
09:58 - and y position to 67 y and 67 X 67 y in
10:06 - 67 exercise right here and when it
10:09 - receives stone which is the message that
10:12 - um the gem the gem will broadcast it so
10:21 - this will receive it forever
10:23 - okay forever loop glide 2 seconds glide
10:28 - 2 seconds to negative 35 67 and then we
10:36 - can glide duplicate this and glide back
10:38 - to the home position of 67 67 so next we
10:45 - finally the last trap we can do it's not
10:48 - the last trap if still four more and as
10:50 - you can see for this trap in the last
10:52 - video it was two separate sprites so I
10:55 - combined them I combined them too
10:58 - right so you won't have to get to
11:01 - sprites just control-c control-v from
11:04 - the other sprite and copy paste it into
11:06 - the spray so now let's get out to the
11:09 - stone
11:11 - so when clicked we want to hide of
11:14 - course in the beginning we want to hide
11:18 - forever turn 15 degrees so that right so
11:24 - look like it's rolling that's like a
11:26 - rolling stone so when I receive stone it
11:30 - will when it receives the stone message
11:33 - it will get a forever loop it will go to
11:38 - this x and y position I writ I wrote
11:41 - down which is right here negative 32 I
11:45 - negative 39 sir 146 yeah so right here
11:49 - show it was show glide it will collide
11:55 - four seconds glide four seconds to 206 I
12:02 - wrote down these coordinates 206 one of
12:05 - 146 so applied to here and come back and
12:08 - then we'll hide so let go so as you can
12:15 - see I'll just cut the chin just get the
12:21 - gem rope I can show you guys what
12:22 - happens see the stone starts moving
12:38 - rolling stone from here never mind it
12:42 - rolls from this side to this side and
12:46 - actually you can do no you can do this I
12:51 - did this wrong I can for the wall left
12:55 - this should be in full right so it looks
12:58 - better if she'd be in here actually
13:03 - sorry
13:04 - so delete this yes II so now this
13:11 - one moves not this way so here we show
13:17 - you guys what happens so get the cable
13:22 - quick
13:27 - see now this one moves I started it in
13:31 - the other one so put it in the wall wall
13:36 - write the code and the stone appears to
13:39 - be rolling see like in the big boulder
13:44 - seen in the Indiana Jones movie so
13:48 - finally let's add the last trap so when
13:53 - clicked for the last trap this one one
13:57 - place we just want to go to this x and y
14:00 - position 182 y 72 and hide at the
14:04 - beginning going to receive stone which
14:07 - is the message which also goes to the
14:14 - spiky thing and the stone will need a
14:17 - forever loop hide hide hide wait two
14:23 - seconds and then show and then wait
14:27 - another two seconds so what this does is
14:30 - make it show and hide like it's coming
14:32 - out of the ground and wait another two
14:34 - seconds
14:38 - so right now I have all the traps done
14:43 - um and then finally we can add the
14:49 - script into the cat mu cat and we can
14:56 - also add some background music after
14:58 - this this script is gonna be pretty long
15:01 - zoom out a little so you know one
15:04 - clicked so this is if it's touching any
15:08 - of these things
15:09 - so if forever if then if we'll need a
15:18 - lot of or statements it's a really long
15:22 - one
15:26 - okay so if touching this is the sense if
15:33 - it's touching the UM traps so if it's
15:36 - touching the turnstile touching the the
15:42 - wall left touching the wall right
15:48 - touching the whiptail touching stone
15:58 - we'll need more or statements this is a
16:05 - very long one touching the stone
16:10 - touching the this is a sense stone trap
16:15 - or wall left
16:23 - well T yeah so this is all of it we zoom
16:28 - in a little
16:29 - so if it's touching any of these traps
16:32 - then we want to change the attempts by
16:35 - one so at the end will show that
16:37 - attempts number and then we'll go to
16:42 - this x and y position negative 205 why
16:46 - 150 or go back to the starting position
16:50 - if it gets hit and we'll use the my
16:53 - block again from the first video type
16:56 - words ouch ouch and say so we'll say it
17:02 - instead of thinking it and we can start
17:06 - a sound I have right here called cat oh
17:09 - just like make them yah sound so all
17:13 - right now let's add one more if-then
17:17 - statement to the Indiana Indy cat so we
17:22 - want to if then statement right here so
17:28 - if then touching the colored touching
17:33 - color
17:36 - you want to get this color is touching
17:40 - this color then we want to broadcast a
17:43 - message Club win so this is to detect
17:46 - the wind strip when the screen wind when
17:53 - so as you can see we still have a wind
17:56 - screen right here
17:57 - I made it says you won and I have it
18:02 - took you blank seconds and it took you
18:05 - blank attempts so for the code for this
18:08 - this is pretty simple so when it
18:11 - receives wind then go to the front layer
18:15 - it will alert the player that they won
18:19 - show show the variable timer should so
18:26 - show how fast you did the game in show
18:29 - the variable timer and show the variable
18:33 - for the variable attempts so show how
18:37 - much attempts you have and stop all and
18:39 - one clicked we want it to go to zero
18:42 - zero so shown the center and hide yeah
18:50 - and we can actually add some background
18:53 - music just get a one click forever
18:57 - forever loop sounds let's get one from
19:01 - the library go to loops I just get the
19:07 - cave sound forever place I'm cave until
19:13 - done
19:14 - so when you start type the instructions
19:18 - they're beginning
19:21 - so if you touch it you see ash and play
19:26 - me also so I'll show you how you can
19:56 - make it can make miss us you can make
19:59 - the speed of the obstacles so let me try
20:10 - again so I already had the gem obtained
20:18 - so it so you don't have to reflect the
20:21 - gem again
20:23 - right there so and you can position
20:28 - these you can double-click on this timer
20:33 - and drag right here and double click
20:39 - right here and put our here so it will
20:42 - say it took you how many seconds and it
20:45 - took you how many it sentence so this is
20:49 - pretty much the video so thank you guys
