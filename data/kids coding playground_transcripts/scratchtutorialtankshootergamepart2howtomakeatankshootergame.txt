00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another tutorial
00:09 - on kids cooking playground
00:10 - today we'll be doing the second tutorial
00:11 - for the tank game we've been working on
00:13 - so first we would like to go to the
00:15 - click and then
00:17 - we want to change a little bit we want
00:19 - to make it hide in the beginning
00:20 - so basically it won't be like this on
00:23 - top so now when you click play and stop
00:26 - the white will not be on top so and the
00:28 - game is still fully functional you can
00:30 - still click
00:31 - so yeah all right
00:35 - so i'll go over the code a little bit so
00:38 - this is like the movement so you can put
00:40 - any that you have not
00:42 - put yet so movement losing um
00:45 - taking damage to the cannon
00:48 - the boss we have not coded yet the
00:50 - enemies
00:52 - you can pause the video if you'd like
00:54 - and then these are just decorations
00:55 - nothing really
00:56 - the click so then click a laser
01:00 - alright so that's it so now let's go to
01:03 - the tank
01:05 - so inside the tank instead of putting
01:06 - stop all right here
01:08 - we are going to get broadcast broadcast
01:12 - um i'm gonna broadcast a message game
01:14 - over
01:16 - so the game over we're gonna repeat a
01:17 - new sprite
01:19 - and then i'm just gonna do red or
01:21 - something uh text
01:22 - and then we're gonna write game over
01:26 - okay game over we're going to make this
01:29 - a little bit bigger
01:30 - put it in the middle centered all right
01:33 - so inside here we're going to reflect
01:36 - lights
01:37 - inside the game over we're going to go
01:38 - to zero zero
01:41 - we're gonna hide
01:44 - when i receive um the message game over
01:47 - then we will show this thing
01:50 - we're gonna make it go to front layer
01:52 - show and then we're going to stop all
01:56 - all right
02:00 - and then so now when you take enough
02:03 - damage
02:04 - you will actually lose yeah so return
02:07 - can see when you go to zero lives don't
02:09 - say game over
02:10 - and you'll lose all right so now let's
02:13 - go to the boss so inside the boss we're
02:15 - gonna start coding in here
02:16 - so inside the boss we're gonna get a one
02:18 - green flag clicked
02:20 - zoom in we are going to hide
02:25 - after hiding we're going to make a
02:27 - variable
02:28 - and we're going to name it boss hp
02:31 - so boss hp i'll put that in the top
02:34 - right
02:35 - so we're going to hide the variable boss
02:37 - hp in the beginning
02:39 - and we're going to set the variable boss
02:41 - hp to 20 so if you want 20 lives
02:44 - we're gonna wait one second wait one
02:46 - second and then we're going to go to
02:50 - uh pick random on negative 240
02:56 - to 240 and then we're going to do 150
02:59 - for the y
03:01 - and after that we're going to wait until
03:02 - we're going to wait until so we're going
03:04 - to
03:04 - wait until the score
03:08 - is greater than let's say 2 000.
03:13 - so wait until the score is greater than
03:15 - 2000
03:16 - so for the demonstration i might have to
03:19 - like
03:20 - decrease the number so for now we're
03:23 - just going to put 2000 so it's going to
03:24 - be like that and then we're going to
03:26 - show
03:26 - once the score's over 2000
03:29 - and then we're going to show the
03:31 - variable boss so we don't want to show
03:32 - the variable boss hp in the beginning
03:35 - and then after um the boss appears then
03:38 - we'll show the variable
03:39 - and then forever forever
03:43 - we're going to point towards the tank
03:48 - point towards the tank and i'll make the
03:52 - boss move
03:53 - 0.5 steps instead of 1 so it's a little
03:55 - bit slower
03:57 - and then we're going to do if
04:00 - touching tank
04:04 - touching tank then we will um get an if
04:07 - that statement
04:09 - and we're also going to check if taking
04:10 - damage is equal to n
04:12 - so which is no so we're going to check
04:15 - we're taking damage
04:17 - is equal to n and if it is then we're
04:21 - going to
04:22 - broadcast taking greater damage because
04:24 - the boss does more damage
04:26 - so we're going to be taking later
04:30 - damage uh and after that we're going to
04:34 - then if that's even if
04:37 - um if boss
04:40 - has less than zero or uh equal to zero
04:44 - hp so
04:45 - loss hp is less than or equal to
04:49 - so
04:52 - oops it has to be or sorry or
04:55 - less than or equal to
04:58 - zero
05:02 - so boss hp less than or equal to zero
05:06 - then we will hide
05:09 - hide the boss because it's dead and
05:12 - we're gonna play the sound
05:13 - uh whatever this is alien creek until
05:15 - done
05:17 - alien creek two and then we're gonna
05:18 - broadcast a message
05:20 - called you win once you kill the boss
05:25 - so in all right right here in the box we
05:27 - have another script to code in
05:28 - so when the green flag clicked this is
05:31 - like if it's touching the laser and
05:33 - stuff
05:34 - so forever if
05:37 - so we're coding this in a separate block
05:39 - because if we code it in here
05:40 - it will the boss will keep on stopping
05:42 - because it has to run this code
05:43 - all over again so that's where we're
05:46 - going to put it in a separate place
05:48 - so if forever if
05:51 - touching laser touching laser
05:57 - laser then we're gonna change the boss
06:00 - by negative one change boss hp by
06:02 - negative
06:02 - one and then we're gonna start scr sound
06:05 - alien creek
06:07 - one yeah this time and then we're gonna
06:10 - change
06:10 - the score 300
06:13 - change the score by 300 every time you
06:15 - hit the boss
06:17 - and then repeat five times
06:22 - change color effect
06:26 - by 25 and we're going to clear the
06:28 - graphic effects
06:31 - and after that we're going to wait a
06:33 - point five second
06:36 - before continuing so
06:40 - it's gonna wait a little bit before
06:42 - ending the game all right so inside the
06:44 - tank
06:45 - remember we broadcast the taking greater
06:47 - damage we're going to code that right
06:49 - now
06:50 - so taking greater damage when i receive
06:52 - taking greater damage
06:55 - if it's taking greater damage we're
06:56 - going to get if that statement if we
06:58 - just duplicate this
07:00 - we have to change of the variables so
07:02 - tank taking damage is equal to no
07:04 - then we're going to set the tank taking
07:06 - damage to y and then change the life by
07:08 - negative two instead
07:11 - and all of this should be the same all
07:13 - right instead of one we're going to be
07:15 - minus two because the boss does more
07:16 - damage
07:17 - all right pretty sure that's it
07:20 - oh yeah and also here we have to make a
07:22 - new costume
07:24 - duplicate and then we're just gonna
07:25 - change this you win
07:30 - center let's make it green
07:34 - all right and then we're gonna when i
07:36 - receive
07:38 - um game over we're gonna switch costume
07:40 - costume one which is game over
07:42 - and we're gonna duplicate this when i
07:43 - receive you win
07:45 - then we're going to switch costume to
07:47 - costume uh
07:49 - to this costume one sorry all right
07:52 - so now let's try out the game
07:55 - so i'm trying i'm gonna try to get 2000
07:57 - scored
07:59 - so then i could try to get and the boss
08:25 - boston has like 13 hp that's not that
08:27 - good for us
08:28 - uh it's kind of hard to control
08:44 - all right as you can see we killed the
08:45 - boss you win
08:48 - so yeah that's pretty much it for this
08:50 - tutorial um
