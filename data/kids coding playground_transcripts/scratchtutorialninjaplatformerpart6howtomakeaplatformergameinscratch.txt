00:41 - all right okay let's begin okay so the
00:48 - ninja that throws the knife out is
00:51 - really similar similar to the attack
00:53 - ninja so what we can do is we can kind
00:56 - of duplicate this guy or now and we
01:00 - cannot hold him here we're gonna call
01:03 - this a ninja throw flowers right and now
01:10 - what we're going to do is we come and
01:11 - change it out a little bit so we'll
01:14 - delete all this costume here okay and we
01:20 - cannot delete the last one but uh
01:22 - there's a matter wall upload new one so
01:25 - upload costume we'll go back to the menu
01:29 - and we are called up along with the
01:34 - throwing knife so that's before that see
01:38 - if we have the name kunai knife here
01:41 - this is jump that is attack by run throw
01:47 - okay we'll have Pro here zero the nine
01:50 - we can get this sprite okay so we have
01:56 - all of them we can delete this a nine
01:58 - now and then we can rename it to t01
02:13 - there's too quick for five-year just
02:28 - calculate these you know six seven eight
02:49 - and last one another nine okay so we
02:54 - have our sprite ready so 0 9 0 1 0 t0 to
03:03 - say nine okay
03:05 - Wow what we will do is will not change
03:08 - out this a little bit so this would be
03:10 - the same will keep it the same
03:14 - this is also the same what we're going
03:17 - to do is without change yourself in sup
03:19 - attack will change the ninja to us send
03:24 - out the bright command for them we have
03:29 - it here right in the bottom here and we
03:32 - pull this in here come up rockin the way
03:36 - so we can duplicate this will buy a
03:39 - Babel going faster this time whether
03:41 - Lancome already so we can say - so when
03:48 - number t2 is press we can or cast a new
03:52 - message with our throw and - ok so this
04:00 - is the message that will throw the knife
04:02 - out so we'll go back to the ninja so
04:08 - it's up the attack right or say throw
04:12 - when I received roll - and then it's not
04:16 - dying then we want to set the action
04:22 - here same
04:23 - we did for the real attack and in sup
04:27 - show to just show one warship to show -
04:32 - okay and then we'll go back to I'm enjoy
04:35 - again so here similar to that so was
04:39 - show to when I receive show - it's a
04:42 - call didn't you attack hokodan in Jethro
04:45 - this time okay what we also need is the
04:50 - knife because when you when you throw
04:54 - the knife out right you'll have the
04:56 - knife right or what a tonight for that
05:00 - okay you can click on this say roll and
05:05 - we can find a knife here okay
05:13 - that's the knife okay we will have to
05:19 - still change the knife a little bit we
05:23 - won't come back to back we are going to
05:28 - rotate the knife so track you see this
05:35 - little like a little round thing track
05:38 - this we're gonna rotate a knife to you
05:43 - know okay like this so you can hold the
05:48 - shift key it kind of you're doing the
05:51 - track you can hold the shift key come to
05:53 - get straight it's no easier what we're
05:56 - gonna do is we'll change the sides at 25
05:59 - okay really simple call to what
06:07 - greenback is quite well come on zoom in
06:09 - here so you can see better
06:14 - you can say set side as we already did
06:18 - that right you can also do like this si
06:20 - 25 and then we can say I did we don't
06:26 - want to show it when the green flag is
06:28 - clicked and when we would continues -
06:34 - yeah
06:35 - the control here when I receive message
06:40 - hmm
06:42 - when I receive a pro-life so what a
06:48 - podcast from my first phone this guy
06:50 - actually so here at the coal floors I
06:59 - forgot so we don't want to put it down
07:02 - here we'll create another block so that
07:05 - it doesn't block anything while they're
07:07 - doing this changing a costume so when I
07:12 - say receive throw to that's when the
07:14 - user click on the click on this button
07:17 - here number two right the keyboard
07:22 - number two and we do the costume change
07:26 - here and also on what we want to do is
07:31 - we want that same condition check we can
07:36 - say what casts this new message okay so
07:48 - throw knife okay so we have this
07:52 - broadcast message so when we receive
07:54 - this to do the custom change and also we
07:57 - wanna throw the knife out so when we
08:00 - receive from knife go to ninja that
08:13 - throw so it's the ninja troll costume or
08:17 - say 20 direction now we've got a sensing
08:26 - my tractor's in here so we gonna choose
08:30 - that
08:32 - ninjatroll
08:38 - you can select direction and then we
08:44 - will say move what's the move Oh 25 step
08:55 - just can't move the knife out in front
08:58 - when it's throwing because when you say
09:00 - go to the ninja I can't go into that
09:03 - Center here than in your so we got more
09:05 - than I have a little bit so a move on if
09:08 - I step and then we'll all say show and
09:15 - then have to use the repeat loop here so
09:20 - we'll do you use a repeat until so
09:23 - making sure that when it hit the edge
09:27 - okay won't repeat until it hit the edge
09:31 - okay use this and select edge okay and
09:41 - then we'll say move ten step everyone it
09:47 - condition here also so if it hit that
09:51 - done hit the hitbox it'll disappear also
09:55 - need that sensing for that come back
10:00 - here get that select hitbox stop graded
10:04 - and we are going to hide it now you can
10:08 - use like this so you can use clone I
10:11 - think chrome will be a little bit more
10:13 - difficult with the coal but uh just
10:16 - there's things simple I mean is pretty
10:20 - much works almost the same okay so we
10:26 - got that so far so right now if it's
10:29 - hitting the knife if you touch the edge
10:31 - it'll go away or it gets to the end so
10:35 - let's test it out real quick so let's
10:39 - push number two you see it kind of gonna
10:42 - hit the hitbox it went way or else it
10:47 - goes the end noble cause
10:49 - so you can come up and you hit it so one
10:53 - thing I was talking earlier right why we
10:56 - need the weight and weight or kasev
10:59 - weight so that's actually some
11:01 - difference here so let's try this you
11:03 - see this up watch has a tap one and then
11:05 - throw to I wish is the other day so if I
11:09 - run in this game you see that this is a
11:13 - tap 1 this is throwing so let's say if
11:15 - I'm doing 2 button at the same time you
11:18 - see how it
11:18 - it's like attack and also throwing night
11:21 - right which is not good that's not what
11:23 - we want so when in order to fix that you
11:27 - actually need this so it's a what cast
11:30 - attack Russia say what cast attack 1 and
11:33 - wait when that condition is finished so
11:36 - that you not allowed to do that the
11:39 - second and then the same thing for here
11:41 - or casts and wait the throne - so now
11:47 - let's stop this again let's try it again
11:50 - so we'll do it hack 1 still walk to
11:54 - their works
11:55 - if I do two but two button at the same
11:58 - time you can see if you can't only does
12:01 - one thing at a time so you cannot do -
12:04 - okay so only attack all this so there
12:10 - you go so you're not allowed to hit two
12:13 - things at the same time okay so this is
12:16 - the attack for the ninja okay so what we
12:24 - can do is let's see okay now we have
12:28 - both the attack of the sword and draw a
12:31 - knife what we can do is we are going to
12:34 - make something that he can throw it or
12:37 - break it right so let's look at our
12:40 - crate here here on this okay we don't
12:45 - have much go here so what we can do is
12:49 - this so as you can see the ninja in the
12:52 - beginning it does some kind of a podcast
12:54 - with the crate set up so this set up
12:59 - message what cast has
13:02 - the platform rain see the platform so
13:05 - when is set up you know you can say okay
13:08 - move through a certain level or change
13:10 - level
13:10 - so once the setup or the platform is
13:14 - done or let's say you have different
13:16 - problem you can broadcast another
13:17 - message here and then the cray can take
13:20 - that message and then it will set up
13:22 - this its position so what we can do is
13:26 - we can broadcast a message here so after
13:29 - they cut the platform is set we can boy
13:33 - a new message saying create crate okay
13:41 - this will create a crate for placing in
13:44 - the right location so you can go back
13:47 - here and you say when I receive create
13:52 - great that's no bit so make sure go to
13:56 - the front layer okay and then you can
14:00 - check the level depending on which level
14:03 - you want you you know maybe it's the
14:07 - different position right so let's say we
14:09 - ended up with one right now right so
14:13 - we'll say go to the year here scrap this
14:17 - and save as level one and we're gonna
14:21 - make this position so that's already
14:23 - there so you just wrapped that yeah and
14:29 - then you say show me okay alright okay
14:40 - and then we have another loop to check
14:44 - if it get hit so you can say forever and
14:50 - then you can say like one touching and
14:58 - then you can use an if statement here
15:00 - and then use a hole operator actually so
15:08 - there's touching a ninja attack
15:13 - or it is touching the can leave call me
15:24 - so we can play a sound maybe with a
15:28 - blowing sound here select a sim okay so
15:36 - like like that's wake up pokin I mean
15:41 - you can use any sound I just thought
15:42 - that sound sound good so you can say
15:47 - start sound
15:48 - you don't have to say until done and I
15:52 - mean you can you can use either one that
15:56 - is fine it's really short and you can
16:00 - say hi and you can podcast another
16:05 - message and then you can say in a
16:13 - message pretty broken so the prey is
16:18 - broken so you can replace a crate after
16:21 - the crates broken you can replace with a
16:23 - gym or something like that later
16:26 - that's how we did on the original game
16:28 - so for now so let's test it out so we
16:35 - throw a knife so you see I broke the
16:40 - crate and it disappeared and let me try
16:43 - it with a sword
16:45 - so we chopped the sword it disappeared
16:48 - so that's how you kind of get the crate
16:52 - looking with the weapon so we can test
16:56 - it out you know later we can walk with
16:59 - the monster you know and you're gonna
17:02 - attack the monsters well so you can see
17:05 - the knight can't break the crane and
17:09 - sword also able to break it okay
17:13 - so we'll stop here we'll continue this
17:16 - next time alright thank you have a good
17:19 - day
