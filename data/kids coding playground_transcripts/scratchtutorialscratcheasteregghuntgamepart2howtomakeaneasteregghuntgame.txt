00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - welcome back guys to kids coding
00:09 - playground today we'll be doing another
00:10 - tutorial on scratch we're doing the
00:12 - easter egg hunt part two so we just
00:15 - recently bought a new mic um to go with
00:17 - their setup so we can make higher
00:19 - quality videos
00:20 - so
00:21 - if you can tell difference um from the
00:24 - mic from before and now please let us
00:26 - know in the comment section below if
00:28 - it's better or worse we really want some
00:30 - feedback so we're right now using the
00:32 - hyperx quadcast it's a pretty good mic i
00:35 - think so without further ado let's get
00:37 - started on our project so right from
00:39 - where we left off last time we're doing
00:41 - the player right
00:42 - so right here instead change ghost
00:45 - effect i'm going to set ghost effect
00:47 - um it doesn't really matter after i
00:49 - delete it but i'm just still gonna you
00:51 - can change that if you want
00:52 - and then next we have our uh broadcast
00:55 - so we're gonna broadcast a few messages
00:56 - from here so basically what we want is
00:58 - when you click the right or left arrow
01:00 - keys error a little arrow will come out
01:02 - um pointing to the direction and like
01:04 - flashing telling that which direction
01:06 - you're going to so we're going basically
01:08 - we're just going to get a broadcast
01:09 - we're going to broadcast right here
01:12 - we're gonna broadcast a message we're
01:13 - gonna name it move
01:15 - right and then the next one we're gonna
01:17 - do
01:18 - this is left arrow so we're gonna do
01:19 - broadcast move left
01:22 - we'll use these broadcasts later once we
01:23 - work on the arrows and then right here
01:26 - we have the hide arrow if you're not
01:27 - pressing down any button then we have to
01:29 - hide the arrow
01:31 - height arrow
01:32 - so here we have the broadcast we're
01:34 - going to be using them after
01:35 - now let's go into our ground sprite so
01:37 - this is the like the scrolling
01:39 - background
01:40 - scrolling around
01:41 - so we're going to get coding in here so
01:44 - first we're going to get a one green fly
01:45 - clicked let me zoom in
01:47 - so we're going to make it go to the
01:48 - middle at first so the first background
01:50 - is going to go to 0 0
01:52 - and then we're going to do a when i
01:54 - receive setup
01:56 - so when i receive setup
01:59 - uh we are going to wait 0.1 seconds so
02:02 - then basically we want the eggs to show
02:03 - up in the front so we're going to wait a
02:04 - little bit
02:05 - then we're going to go to the front
02:06 - layer after
02:08 - go to front
02:10 - and then right after that we're gonna
02:12 - have to make two variables for the
02:14 - sprite so uh we're going to have to name
02:16 - them
02:17 - uh we're gonna make them for the sprite
02:19 - only so we're gonna do x
02:21 - for the sprite only
02:23 - and then we'll also make a variable
02:24 - called y and for the spray only
02:27 - okay
02:28 - and then next we're going to set x and y
02:32 - set x to zero
02:34 - y to zero
02:36 - and then after that we're gonna switch
02:38 - the costume to one one so this is the
02:40 - first one
02:41 - all right and then next we're gonna
02:43 - define two custom blocks so we're gonna
02:45 - make a custom block so remember in our
02:48 - group patch tutorial on the scrolling
02:50 - platformer like how he taught that you
02:52 - can place the clones in a certain
02:54 - direction
02:55 - a certain place like in our scrolling
02:57 - platformer tutorial um we basically
03:00 - we put the bat like the scrolling
03:02 - background in a certain spaces it's like
03:05 - we're going to use this custom block to
03:07 - place the backgrounds so we're basically
03:09 - going to write make a one custom block
03:11 - we're going to place
03:13 - clone
03:15 - at okay and then we're going to make two
03:17 - inputs so one is gonna be x and one is
03:19 - gonna be y
03:21 - so here we have it and then we're gonna
03:22 - click okay so here we have defined this
03:25 - so we're gonna set the x right here
03:29 - so we're gonna set the x
03:30 - to x so this we're going to get a
03:33 - multiplication so we're going to set the
03:34 - x to this x times 480 because the width
03:38 - of each ground right here on each
03:40 - costume is 480 pixels so we're going to
03:42 - do
03:43 - 480.
03:45 - and then next we're going to set the y
03:47 - to the y so we're going to drag this
03:49 - right here we have the y
03:51 - and then we're going to get a go to so
03:53 - basically we're going to make this
03:54 - ground go to the x and y
03:57 - all right and then next we're going to
03:59 - create a clone of myself so basically
04:01 - this is going to create a clone
04:03 - in this place so we're going to create a
04:04 - clone
04:05 - so this is just drawing the ground like
04:07 - cloning the grounds so we're going to
04:09 - create clone of myself and then we're
04:11 - going to go next costume
04:13 - so we're going to go next costume
04:14 - because we want to go down the costume
04:16 - list so make the ground look different
04:19 - and then next we have another custom
04:21 - block this is the position of it so
04:24 - we're going to
04:25 - make a block we're going to
04:26 - position and then we're going to make
04:28 - two inputs x and y so we have two of
04:32 - those and then click ok we're going to
04:33 - define it
04:34 - so to find it we're going to start off
04:36 - by saying go to
04:38 - the x and y
04:40 - x and y
04:41 - and then so basically if the x is we're
04:44 - gonna do if else
04:46 - so it's if it's equal to
04:48 - if the x is equal to the x position
04:51 - if x is equal to the x position then
04:54 - we're gonna show it else we're gonna
04:56 - hide it
04:58 - show else we're gonna hide
05:02 - so what this code basically means in
05:04 - simple terms is it's basically adjusting
05:07 - the ground to where the player is so
05:09 - they can continue scrolling
05:11 - and then so next we're going to get a
05:13 - when i receive resets so i receive reset
05:17 - we're going to delete this clone so when
05:18 - you reset the thing it's going to delete
05:20 - all the clones
05:21 - and one more thing we're going to get a
05:23 - this is the scrolling of the thing so
05:26 - we're going to get a when i receive move
05:28 - ground
05:30 - um when i receive move ground we are
05:32 - going to get the position
05:34 - and then we're going to do x minus the
05:36 - scroll x so we're gonna get minus
05:40 - so we can hear the variables x minus
05:43 - square x
05:44 - g square x
05:45 - and then zero for the y
05:48 - okay
05:49 - and here we're going to place the clones
05:51 - so basically we're just going to place
05:52 - them x1 apart because the width is 480
05:56 - so we just want to make them all
05:57 - attached to one thing so unlike the
05:59 - scrolling platformer we made like
06:01 - separate platforms so they're not
06:02 - attached we want to make them all
06:03 - attached together so we're going to get
06:06 - a
06:07 - place clone at
06:09 - and then we're just going to do 0 0 for
06:11 - the first one
06:12 - and then we're just going to increase
06:14 - the x by 1 every single time
06:17 - so we're going to put this over here and
06:18 - then we're gonna just duplicate this so
06:20 - we're gonna make it one
06:23 - and then we can just duplicate this
06:26 - two
06:27 - three
06:28 - duplicate all that
06:30 - four five
06:32 - six
06:33 - seven i believe we have uh eight
06:35 - costumes
06:36 - which is basically yeah so you have
06:38 - eight so we have to clone eight times
06:41 - so
06:42 - and then next we're gonna hide the
06:43 - sprites
06:44 - after we're gonna hide the sprite after
06:46 - it's done cloning and then we're gonna
06:48 - set the x of it to negative 9999 because
06:52 - we want it off the screen basically
06:54 - so
06:55 - we're gonna set it to looks like
06:57 - something like that
06:58 - okay
06:59 - so now we have our scripts for our
07:01 - ground let's run the game
07:04 - let's start it okay so as you can see
07:06 - the scrolling is working we're using the
07:08 - arrow keys to move around and as you can
07:10 - see the background is scrolling along
07:13 - so let's get to the
07:14 - end so yes
07:17 - basically it for the background so i
07:19 - mean the ground so
07:21 - that's what it is now let's get a
07:23 - backdrop so we're gonna go to the
07:24 - backdrop and we're gonna draw it
07:27 - okay so to draw our backdrop we're going
07:29 - to draw like a blue sky and then we're
07:31 - going to have a sun in the top corner
07:32 - and then it's going to shoot a shine
07:34 - like a ray down here so it looks bright
07:36 - so we're going to make the background
07:37 - look a bit better so what we're going to
07:39 - do is basically just get a square
07:44 - so we're gonna get a light blue color
07:46 - about like this bright and then we're
07:47 - gonna get this
07:49 - shade and then here we're gonna get
07:51 - white
07:52 - so it's gonna look something like this
07:55 - oh no no outline
07:57 - uh so we're gonna hide the outline
08:00 - actually let's adjust it a little bit
08:02 - maybe let's not make the whites
08:04 - uh maybe let's turn up let's make it a
08:06 - little bit let's make it a really light
08:08 - blue
08:09 - maybe that will make it look a little
08:10 - bit better this one let's make it darker
08:15 - okay so i think this should make it look
08:16 - better
08:18 - now let's draw our rectangle okay so it
08:20 - looks pretty good
08:22 - so here we have it and then we're gonna
08:23 - get import a sprite so we're going to go
08:25 - into the sprite library i think there is
08:27 - a sun in here yes this one
08:29 - so what we're going to do is just copy
08:31 - this
08:32 - uh
08:33 - that
08:34 - group it
08:35 - ctrl c and then we're going to go in the
08:37 - background ctrl v we're just going to
08:39 - put it in the top right
08:41 - about like right here
08:44 - yeah about right here and then we're
08:45 - just going to delete the sun sprite and
08:47 - then one last thing we're going to draw
08:48 - a circle basically with the middle like
08:51 - yellow and the outside is no nothing so
08:53 - we're gonna get
08:54 - this thing
08:56 - and then we're gonna swap this we're
08:58 - gonna make it really light yellow
09:02 - a light yellow no outline
09:04 - and then right here we're gonna
09:07 - uh
09:08 - this one we can just swap it and then
09:10 - this one we just put nothing so here we
09:13 - have like a really light yellow
09:15 - so we can just draw a circle kind of
09:18 - like that hold down shift
09:19 - so we get perfect circle so something
09:22 - like that maybe move right here so as
09:24 - you can see it looks like the sun is
09:26 - actually kind of shining down so it
09:27 - basically just makes your game look a
09:29 - much better
09:30 - so here we have our background
09:32 - so there let's play it yeah as you can
09:35 - see it makes the game look much better
09:37 - with that backdrop
09:40 - okay let's save the project let's do the
09:42 - uh background scrolling now so
09:44 - this is like the scrolling background so
09:47 - like this is the ground right
09:49 - and then behind this will have another
09:50 - background that scrolls a bit slower
09:53 - so it makes the game look much better so
09:55 - some of this code is similar so we're
09:57 - just gonna drag and drop some of this
09:58 - code inside
10:00 - so
10:01 - inside the ground so
10:02 - we're just going to zoom out one time so
10:04 - i can show you guys all the code
10:06 - if you've missed anything then you can
10:07 - put it down now
10:09 - all right so i'm just going to drag in
10:11 - some of this code that we need so
10:13 - we're going to use this one
10:16 - please clone at
10:17 - the position we're gonna have to
10:18 - obviously change some of this stuff but
10:20 - it will work
10:22 - when i uh change some of it up
10:24 - and then we're gonna get the reset
10:26 - when green flag is clicked
10:29 - and then we'll get this entire chunk as
10:31 - well
10:33 - but obviously i have to change some of
10:34 - it up so let's get started on that
10:38 - right here
10:39 - on the position we're just going to get
10:41 - x y go to x y
10:43 - and then we're just going to show
10:46 - um because you're not going to be
10:47 - scrolling with the player it's just
10:49 - going to be scrolling
10:50 - when you're moving to the right or left
10:52 - it will just scroll with the other
10:54 - ground
10:55 - so
10:56 - place clones x y we can keep all of this
10:59 - except for the next costume because
11:01 - there is only one costume
11:04 - and then next right here 125 clicks
11:06 - we'll just go like this and then we'll
11:08 - hide
11:10 - reset delete this clip and then here in
11:11 - the setup
11:13 - we take out the weight 1.1 seconds so
11:15 - we're gonna go to the front layer right
11:17 - uh no go to back layer sorry
11:20 - so we have to go to the back layer
11:21 - because this is like the background
11:22 - behind everything
11:24 - so we're gonna go we're gonna put this
11:26 - after so set x y and then we're gonna
11:28 - hide
11:29 - and then i'm just gonna switch the
11:31 - costume to bg scrolling
11:34 - and then we're gonna make it go to the
11:35 - back layer
11:37 - and some of it is gonna be different so
11:39 - basically what we're gonna do is we're
11:41 - going to make a clone like this
11:42 - and then maybe we're going to flip it 90
11:44 - degrees so then the rock is on this side
11:46 - and the tree
11:47 - is on this side
11:49 - um so it will make me make the game look
11:51 - a little bit more variation so basically
11:53 - it's going to be reversed everything is
11:55 - just going to be flipped over 90 degrees
11:57 - or negative 90 degrees so it just makes
11:59 - the game look a little bit better have
12:01 - more variety in your background
12:03 - so by doing this we're just going to do
12:06 - a point direction of 90.
12:08 - place a clone at zero zero
12:10 - and then we're going to point direction
12:12 - of negative 90.
12:16 - and then after that we're gonna place a
12:17 - clone at one zero
12:19 - so basically we're only gonna have two
12:20 - of them so we're gonna make the
12:22 - background scroll much slower than
12:23 - everything else
12:24 - i forgot to zoom in so here is
12:27 - it all zoomed in
12:29 - and then right here we're going to get
12:30 - the hide
12:31 - i don't know why i deleted that we
12:32 - actually still need that
12:34 - and after that after that we're going to
12:35 - set the x to negative 9999
12:38 - so we can move this backdrop off the
12:40 - screen once it's done
12:42 - okay we can delete all this
12:44 - and then next we're going to get a
12:47 - when i receive move ground so remember
12:49 - the broadcast
12:51 - and receive move run
12:53 - we're going to use that right now
12:54 - so basically we're going to get the
12:56 - position of it we're going to get the
12:57 - position
12:59 - so we're going to the x minus the round
13:01 - of scroll x divided by 10.
13:03 - so basically
13:05 - this means that it's going to be
13:06 - scrolling one-tenth of the speed as the
13:09 - ground
13:10 - so we're going to get
13:11 - this so we're going to get a minus sign
13:13 - so subtract
13:15 - so we're going to get round as well so
13:17 - then we want uh whole integers so we're
13:20 - going to get an x
13:22 - minus the round
13:23 - of g scroll x divided by 10 so it's
13:25 - going to scroll
13:26 - one tenth of the speed as the ground so
13:28 - we want to make the background just
13:30 - scroll a bit slower so we're going to
13:32 - get a
13:33 - g scroll x divide by 10 and then we're
13:36 - just going to get the y and put that in
13:37 - here
13:39 - so i think that should be it let me zoom
13:41 - out let me put everything together and
13:43 - let's zoom out
13:46 - okay
13:49 - let's save the project and let's run it
13:52 - so as you can see you're moving right
13:54 - as you can see the backdrop right there
13:56 - you can see it is moving in the backdrop
13:58 - there's like a backdrop behind this
14:00 - backdrop
14:01 - as you can see it's kind of flipped
14:02 - right here see the two rocks
14:04 - uh you see there's like a rock right
14:06 - here there's a rocket there it's because
14:07 - we flipped it 90 degrees to give the
14:09 - game a little bit more variation
14:11 - so you only need two clones for this one
14:15 - so yeah that's pretty much for this part
14:17 - two of this series
14:19 - we worked on the ground
14:21 - and the background scrolling
14:23 - for this uh tutorial this is part two of
14:25 - the easter egg hunt
14:27 - um we're gonna make one more parts for
14:29 - the eggs and you win
14:31 - so
14:32 - and the arrows i almost forgot about
14:33 - that
14:34 - so
14:35 - thank you guys for watching don't forget
14:37 - to like share and subscribe and ring the
14:39 - notification bell and i'll see you guys
14:41 - in the next video
14:42 - [Music]
14:52 - you
