00:08 - hello guys welcome back to the channel I
00:12 - thought before I was gonna be able to
00:14 - finish the Medusa on one video seems
00:17 - like that is too long so I did break it
00:19 - in half so this is the private final
00:23 - video now for this series for this ninja
00:27 - platform okay so before we start please
00:30 - like share subscribe to our channel and
00:33 - if you know anybody who would like to
00:35 - work with kids Cody please pass our
00:39 - channel to them I will introduce more
00:42 - different kind of coding later on but
00:44 - for right now we're using a mostly
00:47 - scratch later we'll probably look into
00:49 - other language such as Python and other
00:52 - may begin because studio to another kind
00:56 - of language to do the programming okay
00:59 - so let's begin okay what to hurry up and
01:04 - finish it I think taking a long time in
01:07 - the video let's try to get it done
01:09 - quickly so the unit is I can get hit
01:13 - right so what to have dad okay so um
01:18 - what they put more coal for that so what
01:22 - we're going to say is this because I got
01:27 - hit right so how to make this knife
01:30 - disappear also but I just finished in
01:34 - the do the first let's say Oh back over
01:39 - here event here we'll say looks at ball
01:48 - one cut it
01:55 - okay if the Medusa got hit I will change
01:59 - the metal sir HP buy one
02:05 - Medusa HP by one by negative one sorry
02:10 - negative one and then with a check and
02:21 - where the check if the Medusa HP is
02:30 - equal to zero so that means you know
02:33 - there's a dead wanna put in a Cell me
02:37 - such for like a squeaking screaming
02:41 - sound so this is pretty good
02:47 - we'll use that so if it gets to the end
02:53 - you know whoa my curse just come on
02:56 - scream I'm not sure you can see this I
03:02 - mean zoom back in a little bit okay and
03:04 - the wall switch to costume so we'll
03:09 - switch to custom to deaf number four
03:13 - number one or whatever that matter and
03:17 - then wait
03:25 - Oh a four-point do it one five-second
03:29 - and that was footage to death number two
03:35 - mm so let's check out custom depth or
03:43 - one and two how they look so def number
03:48 - one number two okay
03:51 - that's how they look let's go back and
03:58 - there none will have to one so if it's
04:02 - dead then what it said say that else oh
04:06 - I forgot anything else fe if an else
04:09 - actually let's change this out okay I
04:23 - also set the Devere on this variable
04:28 - back I will set the custom back to one
04:36 - and then we'll say ok this is actually
04:46 - wrong sorry sorry so we want the one her
04:49 - not zero so this is when it's actually
04:52 - greater than zero meaning this she's not
04:57 - exactly dead yet you know she she just
05:00 - got hit so we try to make her like like
05:03 - ouch
05:04 - kind of sound but uh that's not when
05:07 - she's when she's when she's greater than
05:09 - zero so if it if she's she's not that
05:12 - good we'll do this but when she's dead
05:14 - we'll actually do something else
05:16 - actually so we'll look at the costume so
05:22 - we have deaf he writes or custom moving
05:24 - one right one two three so we will use
05:29 - the death one two three so we reset that
05:32 - to one and we can switch the costume
05:38 - Peter sixth time I think with six eight
05:41 - one two three four five six right okay
05:45 - so we'll repeat sixth time J captain to
05:48 - Pier
05:51 - what's a six and then we'll change the
05:55 - customer before that we had to actually
06:02 - make the Coase effect so we when we kill
06:06 - the Medusa we don't do that also we
06:11 - don't want a year actually the ninja
06:13 - getting hit by the Mateus actually even
06:15 - though she's dead but she's not totally
06:16 - dead yet and you can still get hit so
06:19 - what we can do is I'll show you how what
06:22 - I mean later okay let me put in the KO
06:25 - first okay go to look whoa do a change
06:35 - ghost attacked by ten so kind like time
06:41 - slowly the Medusa fade away so we want
06:43 - to do that then we will put in here
06:46 - saying the switch in the costume will
06:49 - use the join operator again so we have
06:53 - something called a friend definitely I
06:57 - have spelled correctly let's just check
06:59 - yeah yeah okay and then we will use the
07:04 - index of the custom here okay and then
07:09 - with a increase their customer count
07:12 - here
07:19 - okay all right and then we'll played
07:24 - when actually when she's totally dead we
07:26 - might have there not a sound that's just
07:28 - this magic think that sounds good so
07:35 - right so when she's dead we'll play that
07:38 - self like you can't get a porn or
07:40 - something
07:41 - okay so we'll say start okay well say
07:53 - yeah play the cell start magic sound and
07:57 - then we'll we'll hide this Medusa here
08:01 - and then we'll what casts a message what
08:10 - we're going to do is we're gonna what
08:11 - cast this Sun message to let the Medusa
08:17 - start again so we'll say again okay so
08:27 - this is our message so when I receive
08:34 - this thought again what you can do is
08:37 - you can like come wait have a way
08:40 - condition here you can use a random like
08:48 - maybe three to five seconds another ten
08:51 - doesn't have like kind of wait for some
08:54 - time and then you can call this block
08:56 - again so now we're almost done right so
09:01 - with the actor Cole for the fourth is
09:05 - right and was that the co for the ninja
09:08 - as well so okay um so when the ninja I'm
09:15 - into the matter so get hit you get this
09:18 - broadcast here what we can it was go
09:22 - back here whoa-ah some Cole year saying
09:30 - if I receive cap here basically cut and
09:34 - hit the Medusa I will just hide is this
09:40 - knife so that doesn't keep on traveling
09:42 - to the end right and also in the ninja
09:46 - here bombing on the water is so on what
09:54 - we also need is that for the Medusa if
09:57 - it hit it got hit with who saw something
10:00 - so let's move this up a little bit
10:02 - Oh daddy no not if condition then I'm
10:08 - gonna have to track this he'll they've
10:10 - got him it'll get messy
10:14 - okay so here we will say so we actually
10:20 - have to check him and do the help I'll
10:22 - show you what I mean later as I'll show
10:24 - you this first I think so I just say
10:29 - touching my here I said sages advice a
10:32 - touching
10:34 - deucey that I can say what cast death
10:38 - right like this way but it will not be
10:40 - good I'll show you how why I mean that
10:43 - okay let's let's start this let's just
10:47 - try
10:48 - [Music]
10:55 - okay I was having some issue earlier my
10:58 - ninja gets stuck when I put the Medusa
11:01 - in I think I found out what the issue
11:04 - was um the issue is that the ninja here
11:07 - sometime if you have more than one of
11:10 - these custom block inside of the year
11:14 - when start with the foil loop it has
11:16 - some problem I have seen that in the
11:18 - past so I broke this up this one used to
11:22 - be like forever loop with the two
11:25 - similar gravity and run control inside
11:28 - how to break this up into write two
11:31 - different one that actually fixed at the
11:33 - issue and then one you have to in a
11:35 - forever loop going in there's things
11:38 - getting messed up and it's not
11:40 - triggering the custom block so I have to
11:43 - break this up into a separate one being
11:46 - black is quick now it's working fine let
11:49 - me just take us out that variable now so
11:52 - when you actually have any problem with
11:54 - your Korra you always want to open up
11:56 - the variable and just kind of go through
11:59 - what they are so that way you can
12:02 - actually see you know what things are
12:04 - not walking or walking whatever it is
12:07 - okay so let's take a look again so we
12:11 - have the Medusa on left and right
12:14 - basically he's trying to like find out
12:17 - when the moves I see if I know how far
12:19 - you can walk to the left
12:20 - oh how far you want the right before it
12:24 - turns around so it that's why this toe
12:26 - is there this - um 70 and plus seventy
12:30 - okay alright so the meter says 3 HP so
12:34 - what we're going to do is I mean Joe and
12:38 - India when the Medusa touched a ninja
12:40 - right here so we'll put it inside here
12:46 - so I show you something so we need to
12:50 - change this condition actually
12:52 - so let me just save this let's run this
12:54 - so as you can see there's a squawking
12:57 - light on HP right so we can jump up hope
13:05 - that we get her good so one more thing
13:09 - like if we use that pipe we hit her you
13:12 - see how she's laying down on a ground of
13:15 - course effect but we still capture by
13:20 - her so what we can do is we can fix this
13:27 - condition here so instead of talking
13:30 - Medusa we are going to say touching
13:34 - Medusa and HP is greater than zero okay
13:38 - so we have to condition here and I'm
13:43 - gonna do sir HP is greater than zero
13:49 - move this over a little bit so basically
13:56 - for each piece he wrote and you know we
13:58 - we cannot we cannot get attacked by her
14:02 - okay we're gonna try it again
14:04 - let's stop
14:05 - [Music]
14:17 - so you say I would not be a problem
14:20 - because I that coal right so only if
14:23 - their HP is greater than zero then I
14:25 - can't get attacked by her some of them
14:27 - we see that after three to five seconds
14:30 - she can appear again that we can change
14:33 - it here depending on how wait I can
14:37 - change the condition
14:40 - [Music]
14:45 - [Music]
14:53 - [Music]
14:57 - so he said okay that's something there's
15:00 - still some error there
15:03 - the Medusa did not hold the effect is
15:06 - fading but it's not going down right so
15:12 - okay so we have the issue with the
15:14 - Medusa the getting hit is still kind of
15:17 - moving so what we need to do is we're
15:20 - gonna use this block here saying stop
15:22 - otoscope in the sprite so we have to put
15:26 - it before this so we'll stop this guy
15:29 - because this guy said conjoined emitters
15:31 - are moving so we wanna stop this and
15:33 - then we'll make the death animation and
15:35 - then we'll start again so this will help
15:38 - and also we can reduce the Medusa speed
15:41 - maybe two three then she's moving way
15:44 - too fast let's give it a try now so
15:47 - she's a little smaller yes let me put
15:53 - the sound back I think I just might
15:59 - [Music]
16:04 - so let's go back oh oh
16:08 - my coop got hit by her so he see it
16:14 - she's she's no longer and she'd fade out
16:19 - she should not be moving again so she
16:24 - says she never move again and we have a
16:26 - passer problem okay so I think that
16:29 - fixed that issue
16:33 - [Music]
16:47 - got the gym oh by the way Simon you can
16:53 - do like 10 region 3 to 10 seconds so
16:57 - something like that off I just and maybe
16:59 - a little bit better so that she don't
17:01 - come back so quickly so say this is bad
17:10 - stage our final stage so we landed here
17:17 - so this final stages here so let me high
17:20 - just label tips of a costume and ok
17:27 - let's test the game from the beginning
17:29 - [Music]
17:39 - you can keep the right gal with a ninja
17:44 - [Music]
17:45 - when when the ninja die you can actually
17:48 - like you know we make different things
17:51 - like after portal when you can say stop
17:54 - the do cell phone tell me how again you
17:57 - can't do a lot of different things if
17:58 - you like and also you can put up a
18:00 - little way of the ninja diary it
18:02 - wouldn't respond and wait as well
18:05 - [Music]
18:41 - so we can count them or one you win so
18:45 - that's kind of about it with this ninja
18:47 - platform game I mean if I have time
18:50 - later maybe I can try to fix some of the
18:52 - issued with the this a green platform
18:56 - here later because you know sometime we
19:01 - can get stuck in between of this to
19:03 - platform and if we hit put the hitbox
19:06 - then sometime you cannot get on to it
19:08 - and it's gonna fall off so it's a little
19:10 - buggy on this sorry about that
19:13 - so that's about it for the ninja
19:16 - platformer game just hope you guys
19:18 - understand now just this is just a
19:20 - simple one showing how you do like
19:22 - platformer from one stage to the next
19:24 - station
19:25 - having some the ninja different custom
19:29 - attack throwing the knife out and stuff
19:32 - like that
19:33 - okay alright thank you
19:35 - [Music]
