00:00 - [Music]
00:07 - so welcome back guys to another
00:09 - tutorial on kids coding playground so
00:11 - today we'll be working
00:12 - on a tutorial on how to do the among us
00:15 - animation
00:16 - since we have many requests but before
00:19 - we get started
00:20 - we would like to share something with
00:21 - everyone so
00:23 - someone actually tried to copy one of
00:25 - our projects
00:26 - so videos so the first among us video
00:29 - got copied right here
00:31 - so you just don't so this person i think
00:34 - they downloaded it and then re-uploaded
00:36 - it as their own
00:37 - which is against the youtube policy so
00:41 - i do not want any account and you can
00:43 - get banned you can get banned after like
00:45 - three strikes or something like that
00:47 - and we do not want anyone to get their
00:50 - youtube account banned
00:52 - so so just please don't copy anyone's
00:54 - videos
00:55 - at all so without further ado let's
00:57 - continue on to the video
00:58 - hand it over to my dad hello guys
01:02 - welcome back to the channel
01:04 - so we'll be working on the among us
01:06 - animation story
01:07 - um animated story so i think we have a
01:10 - lot of requests saying that they want to
01:12 - know how to do the tutorial so we'll
01:15 - kind of teach you guys step by step how
01:17 - to do this and then we will also upload
01:20 - our
01:20 - uh sprite that we can share with you on
01:23 - our google drive you can download and
01:24 - make your own among us
01:26 - animation story game okay so let's begin
01:30 - [Music]
01:32 - so for the among us animation animated
01:34 - story we'll be learning these following
01:36 - concepts in scratch
01:38 - variable loops podcast message custom
01:41 - sprite
01:42 - uh you can control the the uh science
01:45 - sprite uh with your
01:47 - with your key also and also animated
01:50 - animation with like player interactions
01:52 - so basically
01:53 - like you know when you when the story
01:55 - goes on you know
01:57 - you're able to uh control the science
02:00 - right where you could like
02:02 - do different special moves that will
02:05 - take out the crew
02:06 - so that's what we're going to do on this
02:09 - uh
02:09 - tutorial it might be multiple parts so i
02:12 - think it might
02:13 - take a while so i'll i'll try to do uh
02:16 - as much as i can to uh share you guys
02:19 - share with you guys how to do the uh
02:21 - animation okay
02:23 - all right let's get started
02:26 - okay so we're here the project
02:30 - so as my kid said regarding the
02:32 - copyright
02:33 - in youtube make sure you don't copy
02:36 - other people's uh
02:37 - video and re-upload you can get in
02:39 - trouble for that
02:41 - so we do not want to see you like
02:43 - getting
02:44 - banned for that so yeah please don't
02:46 - take other people's work and then
02:48 - trying to upload as your create as your
02:50 - own so we should not do that
02:53 - okay other than that let's go on to the
02:56 - uh
02:56 - the game uh so what we are going to do
02:59 - is uh
03:00 - i'm going to share all these uh sprites
03:02 - with you
03:03 - uh we have drawn all these sprites uh
03:05 - some of them i got it online
03:07 - uh uh some of them we drew so um
03:11 - like that the door we drew that among us
03:13 - and
03:15 - sprite we did that the box we do that
03:17 - and then this one we drew that
03:19 - and then some other one we drew
03:22 - the cape and then these are recap from
03:24 - online and this is where they drop
03:26 - so there is a lot of different sprite
03:28 - here that to
03:30 - where to make so it took us a lot of
03:32 - time to
03:33 - to make this game uh so we do want to
03:36 - share to you guys so that
03:37 - all the kids can also learn right uh so
03:40 - once you get the sprite that you have
03:42 - with your game you can make a different
03:43 - story
03:44 - but for now we'll try to just um go with
03:47 - what we have
03:48 - so far and then um you know when you're
03:51 - watching the uh
03:52 - tutorial once you get a hang of it how
03:54 - to do animation
03:56 - then you can change your story as much
03:58 - as you like okay all right
04:01 - before we begin um please like share and
04:03 - subscribe to our channel that means a
04:05 - lot to us
04:06 - and give us a thumbs up and comment on
04:08 - the video below
04:10 - if you have any questions or whatever
04:12 - you'd like
04:13 - to say thanks okay so let me uh run the
04:17 - game
04:18 - once for you guys to see uh from the
04:20 - start to be in
04:21 - i think uh some of you guys already have
04:23 - seen the video of
04:25 - our game from you know the first episode
04:29 - second and third
04:30 - but uh at that time it's not completely
04:33 - done
04:33 - so now it's actually completely done
04:35 - i've fixed some of the code
04:37 - so that you're not able to you know
04:39 - perform certain action if you have not
04:41 - waited
04:42 - until the sprite finished talking so all
04:45 - those things have been fixed
04:47 - so let me run the game one time for you
04:49 - guys to see
04:50 - so this is kind of the among us uh like
04:53 - a band
04:54 - like a scratch firm page that you see
04:56 - before the game begin
04:58 - so when you start the game so you get
05:02 - to display this screen for a couple
05:04 - seconds and then they go into this
05:06 - so we added this ability so that you
05:09 - know the people
05:10 - know how to play the game so you have
05:12 - control of this uh
05:13 - uh science sprite you can move them
05:16 - around
05:17 - with left and right and then to open
05:19 - door you have to push the up arrow
05:21 - but uh since right now you cannot go in
05:24 - the door because you have not take out
05:25 - the red
05:27 - crew member here so you can use any of
05:29 - this ability here you don't have to use
05:31 - one right you can use two whatever
05:33 - it is it's fine and also we do
05:37 - we don't actually disable after you hit
05:39 - the first time you know you can actually
05:42 - uh you know you cannot kill me anymore
05:44 - right but we have not done that uh just
05:46 - so that you can play around with this uh
05:49 - you know you can actually
05:50 - hit it more than once so but you can
05:54 - actually do that if you like but um
05:55 - i will require a little bit more change
05:57 - to go but for now we actually don't have
05:59 - that
06:00 - so um if you want to let's say you want
06:02 - to take him out with the
06:03 - club you can just hit the one right or
06:06 - if you want to hit him with a laser you
06:08 - can hit two
06:09 - so anything you like let's say you get
06:11 - two
06:13 - and you get the laser and as you can see
06:15 - he kind of died
06:16 - the crew member here so at this point
06:19 - you can actually go into the door you
06:21 - can push the up arrow key
06:23 - and the door will open that little
06:25 - animation showing the door open and you
06:26 - go in
06:27 - so here same thing will show this uh
06:30 - kind of the ability
06:31 - for like the first three stage and after
06:34 - that we'll take it out
06:36 - so for here you can you know do anything
06:39 - you like you can use
06:40 - six as well so six is the whole
06:43 - so you hit that then you actually change
06:46 - into this
06:46 - costume here with the phone okay
06:50 - so you can go into the portal push up
06:54 - so once you go into the portal you see
06:56 - another
06:58 - crew member here he's doing something
07:00 - he's not really looking at you
07:02 - so let's say you want to do the doctor
07:04 - strange portal number five
07:06 - this one the big portal is only
07:08 - activated at the end
07:10 - of the game so actually this one doesn't
07:14 - you cannot activate seven so you can
07:16 - activate five
07:18 - if you use five then it will open a
07:20 - portal up on his head and pull more
07:22 - so for now we'll use four let's say use
07:25 - a lightsaber here
07:26 - so that change him into pixelated and
07:29 - then you can move on to the next
07:31 - stage so here let's say it doesn't show
07:34 - anymore so as you
07:35 - you remember you remember all the moves
07:37 - so number five is the portal
07:39 - let's try that so we change number five
07:42 - will actually change the customer for
07:44 - the cyan
07:44 - and then it kind of make him disappear
07:47 - okay
07:48 - so once you go into here so this is the
07:51 - first initially we actually have the
07:53 - voltage like this and later on we
07:54 - actually change it
07:56 - so for right now we are just going to
07:58 - always pick the gray one because the
08:00 - stories for the gray
08:01 - are getting kicked out the first time so
08:03 - we kind of put a great but you can do it
08:05 - randomized on the list
08:07 - so as you can see after finish this it
08:09 - goes to another
08:10 - kind of cutscene then go in back into
08:13 - the
08:14 - game here so where you can control the
08:17 - the cyan guy again but you will not be
08:20 - able to do any kind of move here
08:22 - like you cannot destroy the uh the
08:25 - other crew member here so you kind of
08:26 - have to wait until the uh dialogue is
08:28 - finished and you cannot really leave the
08:30 - room
08:30 - so you kind of wait so once the dialogue
08:34 - is finished then you can read through
08:38 - okay so they're kind of trying to figure
08:39 - out who was the bad guy and then
08:42 - you know they're like oh okay the
08:43 - science guy said okay see you we're
08:45 - leaving
08:46 - having a nice time kind of thing so when
08:48 - cyan move out here you see the brown was
08:50 - talking to him so the cyan cannot attack
08:52 - the brown yet until
08:54 - you finish talking now we can attack so
08:57 - here you know you can smash him with a
08:59 - hulk hand or you can just
09:00 - use the pole to set him away or you can
09:03 - use the daniel's hand
09:06 - until the gun will disappear so here
09:09 - um this whole uh you can uh so we have
09:12 - the
09:13 - decoration here uh you can break so if
09:16 - you use the whole can you can break this
09:17 - decoration
09:19 - so as you can see um just switch the
09:22 - costume that is broken and fall down
09:24 - so after that you can you can go into
09:26 - the door pushing up again
09:29 - so when you go into up you see the green
09:32 - guy here he's doing some kind of mixing
09:34 - costume
09:35 - so this this also we can break later so
09:39 - cyan right so this time is i want to see
09:42 - some magic
09:43 - and this is busy so here you can use the
09:46 - dr strange
09:56 - so as you can see cyan kind of i mean a
09:58 - purple can pop up here on the top here
10:01 - so here you can use the whole pan again
10:04 - to kind of
10:05 - smash things how you you can hear it oh
10:08 - sound right that's in the back because
10:10 - the even though the sprite is not
10:12 - showing the hulk hands actually hidden
10:14 - because he's right here
10:15 - it's not shown i mean we can make it in
10:18 - such a way that you know you cannot kill
10:20 - more than once but but we haven't done
10:23 - that uh you can we can
10:24 - we might do it when we actually do this
10:26 - game here later on
10:28 - so now you can actually move in push the
10:30 - up key so when you move up key here
10:32 - there's another cutscene again that was
10:34 - the episode three
10:36 - that when we were doing the among us
10:39 - where you know the purple thing that is
10:40 - getting our pen
10:42 - so he went the meeting where he pressed
10:44 - the button
10:47 - so we kind of have that sound right and
10:50 - then we call everybody in for reading
10:53 - and then they were just talking saying
10:55 - that you know they think the cyan guy is
10:57 - the bad guy
10:58 - so science is like just the orange guys
11:02 - kind of really
11:03 - doesn't really think he's the bad guy so
11:05 - they were just kind of
11:06 - fighting back and forth and he's asking
11:09 - him do you see him
11:10 - you know what happens you know they see
11:13 - the bodies they know it
11:15 - kind of move away and this guy says kind
11:18 - of cheat chatting with
11:18 - cyan we got another costume for him
11:21 - putting the
11:22 - little alien head on him you can put
11:24 - like a cheese or whatever
11:26 - doesn't matter and then this guy would
11:28 - just give him a party hat
11:31 - so they're gonna do the bolting so this
11:32 - time i actually made a change to the
11:35 - voting
11:36 - i think in the beginning i didn't do it
11:37 - i just use a list
11:39 - and then later on you know i kind of put
11:41 - more effort
11:42 - into it making like a uh kind of like
11:44 - this similar to like the among us voting
11:47 - right
11:48 - and then they try to fall and see they
11:50 - want to kick somebody out
11:54 - and then this guy he will come to vote
11:57 - and then the orange guy is gonna vote
11:59 - for the purple
12:01 - so we're gonna get a tie here
12:03 - [Applause]
12:05 - so you can still control the green i'm
12:07 - inside and guy you see how you can move
12:10 - and back and forth and then science got
12:12 - talking
12:13 - so you say ha ha we have a tie then you
12:16 - know he
12:16 - this this is the kind of like thinking
12:18 - like he said he can use the doctor
12:20 - strange ability and hulkabil let's just
12:22 - give you a hint
12:23 - that you could smash the tables or the
12:25 - table you can be smashed by hope's
12:27 - um ability so you can smash that and
12:30 - then kind of these guys can run away
12:33 - here you can cast the final spell which
12:34 - is a seven
12:36 - so if you push seven there's a bigger
12:38 - portal that comes up
12:39 - and then you can suck everything out
12:41 - into space
12:42 - so that's what happened so once they
12:45 - went to the space
12:46 - you know you can still control him and
12:48 - he'll have
12:49 - and then these the queen guys still with
12:51 - the space seeing this guy
12:54 - you know uh he got kicked out earlier
12:58 - right
12:58 - so and then you see he's laughing at the
13:00 - end
13:02 - that's it so that is the end of the
13:05 - the animation so how do we do this so
13:08 - so there's a lot of code here uh what
13:11 - we're going to do is i'm going to give
13:12 - you all this code here so what we
13:14 - trying to do is kind of explain some of
13:16 - the code here okay
13:19 - okay all right so i have cleaned up all
13:22 - my
13:22 - all my code so there's no more code
13:24 - between each of the
13:26 - the sprite here so um if you look into
13:29 - the sprite for
13:30 - cyan i have different costumes so we
13:32 - have first costume for him
13:34 - second custom we have a gun we just put
13:36 - it on him
13:37 - and then third costume is a cape okay
13:41 - we drew the cape here so i just kind of
13:43 - draw a cave and then paint it and then
13:44 - copy it
13:46 - and then play play on cyan guy and then
13:48 - this one is just a
13:50 - costume hit for the cyan okay
13:53 - and then the um the
13:57 - this one so the red uh so red when we
14:00 - kill the red or kill anybody that the
14:03 - little bone comes out so uh when we do
14:05 - the hulk smash right
14:07 - so for those you actually have to have a
14:09 - matching uh
14:10 - icon so here's red dead right
14:13 - so there's a pink so pink dead so we can
14:16 - use that to switch the icon when the
14:18 - hulks actually smash down
14:20 - right there's the orange and whatever
14:22 - right these are all the colors here
14:24 - so ideally any color you can pick and it
14:27 - will still go
14:28 - but for our story we kind of use the
14:30 - going from
14:31 - one custom to the next costume so we'll
14:34 - start with the red
14:35 - and pink or yellow you know uh gray
14:39 - whatever
14:40 - okay so i hope you guys understand that
14:42 - so uh if you actually want to make a new
14:45 - costume or something like that then you
14:47 - can just say right click
14:49 - just say duplicate so for here
14:52 - you just change it right any color you
14:54 - want let's say you want
14:57 - i don't know teal we have teal right i
14:59 - don't know what else
15:00 - we don't have uh let's say we want to
15:04 - have this color or you can't even use a
15:06 - two color kind of thing right
15:08 - doesn't matter so what you can do is you
15:10 - can have like a
15:12 - like this is a lighter color then you
15:15 - can maybe do a darker color
15:18 - right darker color like this and the
15:20 - darker color you can color
15:22 - the outside so this is not dark enough
15:24 - let's say make it a little more dark
15:27 - so you see like these so
15:31 - so these this is not a good color so
15:33 - because we're using two color right so
15:35 - dark is not really helping
15:36 - so probably use one color is better
15:38 - that's why i used before
15:40 - just one color so i think that will be
15:42 - probably better let's try one color
15:44 - so let's color first color and then you
15:47 - can use a darker color here and then
15:50 - oh i should i should do both of them at
15:53 - the same time so
15:54 - that's actually another piece here so
15:56 - you fill the first two
15:58 - top ones so this one and this one then
16:01 - you can choose a darker color here and
16:03 - then you can feel the
16:04 - other part so you kind of have a
16:08 - red reddish orange kind of color right
16:11 - so that's how you create the uh icon i
16:14 - mean these guys you can paint them if
16:16 - you want but i already paint them for
16:17 - you
16:18 - so you don't really need to paint his
16:19 - eyes or anything just paint the
16:22 - the body the first part and the second
16:24 - part that's it
16:26 - so i don't think we have orange here
16:28 - right so if you want to paint orange you
16:30 - can so
16:30 - let me trash this so but if you make
16:33 - sure that you make
16:34 - one of these and you want to make a
16:36 - another custom just copy the other guy
16:38 - and then
16:38 - just color his body the bottom part
16:42 - right the bottom part and then the
16:44 - stomach part and leave everything the
16:46 - same
16:46 - all right so this is just a bone that i
16:48 - drew
16:50 - okay so i guess i hope you guys
16:52 - understand this part
16:53 - so the second part is the um you know
16:56 - the door
16:56 - the door is just a different costume i
16:59 - drew
17:00 - so this is like the different like draw
17:03 - the costume and then
17:04 - the layout just different layer you can
17:07 - see right this is
17:08 - like a layer here this is a box here
17:11 - just kind of
17:12 - bend them bend some shape and put it in
17:14 - and then use a water
17:16 - digger border so this one i drew one
17:18 - here then i drew another one here for
17:20 - the door opening
17:21 - so that you can have a door closed and
17:24 - then you know you can switch costume for
17:26 - a door opening
17:27 - okay so if you guys want to draw
17:29 - something else you can
17:31 - right and then the box i just drew the
17:33 - box here
17:34 - right that's two box so just kind of
17:36 - draw it like a
17:37 - cube uh this one is the uh you know
17:41 - just the like three rings you know you
17:44 - kind of shoot out like a
17:46 - you know sonic power or something
17:47 - doesn't matter
17:49 - and the table i just kind of
17:52 - i download the table online and the
17:55 - button just put it there
17:56 - and what i did was i just kind of draw
17:58 - the paper
17:59 - break the table in half just draw it
18:03 - so what you do is you can just cut them
18:05 - right
18:06 - so let's say you want to do this and you
18:09 - wanna
18:11 - okay so the table you can draw like this
18:14 - so what you can do is you can convert it
18:16 - to a bitmap
18:17 - and then you can like kind of you know
18:20 - select the uh
18:22 - you know the eraser kind of thing and
18:24 - you can kind of
18:26 - erase like this
18:29 - right so now you have kind of two table
18:32 - so what you can do is duplicate this guy
18:34 - again
18:35 - and then you can use the eraser to kind
18:38 - of
18:39 - erase everything else on this side
18:43 - right so here you can just kind of erase
18:46 - all that stuff here
18:49 - let's see so i'm gonna make it bigger
18:52 - so we erase all this thing and then do
18:56 - the same thing for this side but you're
18:57 - going to erase this side
18:59 - of the table right
19:01 - [Music]
19:06 - so and then you kind of draw your black
19:09 - marker back in
19:10 - but what you can do is convert back to
19:12 - the vector
19:14 - this guy convert back to vector and you
19:16 - can select him
19:18 - and you can tell rotate him like this
19:20 - kind of thing right
19:22 - and you can get this guy you can convert
19:24 - back to uh
19:25 - it's alright vector yeah select him copy
19:28 - ctrl c
19:29 - just move it away and put them like this
19:31 - kind of rotate like that or whatever
19:34 - and then you can just use the black
19:36 - color just filming
19:38 - like let's say 10 or whatever just
19:41 - kind of draw it in or something like
19:44 - that
19:47 - right something like that
19:52 - you see what i'm saying so something
19:55 - like that right
19:56 - so you just draw in so it's just trying
19:58 - to make it look like this you know
20:00 - something like this
20:03 - right something like what we have
20:06 - as a table so that will be good enough
20:09 - all right got it
20:10 - okay so i actually then deleted my table
20:13 - so i have to get it back
20:14 - so this is the broken table i had
20:18 - and then this this is just some text
20:21 - text nothing here this is just the uh
20:25 - you know i can't draw it and then trying
20:26 - to reshape it using the reshape
20:29 - to reshape the uh you know the the look
20:33 - like a cape and then just paint the
20:36 - black stuff and then color with red okay
20:40 - and then this is the emergency same
20:42 - thing you know just kind of
20:44 - you see i have all the uh you know the
20:47 - um
20:48 - this reshape and then kind of reshape it
20:51 - and then put another
20:53 - color on top so that's actually two
20:55 - different colors so if i
20:56 - kind of duplicate this you see if i move
21:00 - this guy
21:02 - so you see red and then you have this
21:04 - color on top you see that
21:07 - and then you can move like let's say
21:08 - this word can go in front
21:10 - and you click on the front so that will
21:12 - go in the front and these white
21:14 - white lines are just you know you can
21:16 - just draw like white line here using
21:18 - white
21:19 - 20 just draw a line using the line tool
21:23 - and then different size so just for
21:25 - these two i just draw
21:27 - and then create another one and then
21:29 - just put on top of it
21:31 - okay so you got that thing and then this
21:34 - one
21:34 - i think this one is a little bit tough
21:37 - so what you do is
21:38 - you kind of draw a big uh costume kind
21:41 - of bait
21:42 - so what you do is you just gonna take
21:43 - the table put it here
21:45 - take the cyan guy like the science right
21:48 - here take
21:49 - him put it here and then draw a hand or
21:52 - something like that
21:53 - you know to push the button so that you
21:56 - know when you look at him
21:58 - so well let's say i show this one
22:01 - so you see how let me move this guy this
22:04 - guy's actually in the front
22:06 - let me make this guy go away so you can
22:10 - see right now
22:12 - so you go back here you can see the cyan
22:15 - like this right with this guy
22:17 - right imagine here is not there right so
22:20 - something like this
22:22 - okay so next is the spy box
22:26 - that one is uh you know you just kind of
22:28 - draw the square
22:29 - squiggly line and then what you do is
22:32 - you can just
22:33 - kind of cut the sprite from the purple
22:38 - cut that head put it in here okay
22:42 - cut that and then this one this is just
22:44 - the uh like a banner kind of thing in
22:46 - the beginning so that we could show
22:48 - different
22:48 - banner so this is the first one uh what
22:51 - we're saying is the
22:52 - animation right and then the second one
22:55 - we just took a screenshot put it here
22:57 - put some text
22:58 - and then the third one is where you know
23:00 - you just put stuff together just take
23:02 - the background
23:04 - you know take one of the background take
23:05 - the door put it there take the take one
23:08 - of the decor put it here take the
23:10 - box guy put it here and then just kind
23:12 - of
23:13 - do some editing right so you can have a
23:17 - screen like this that you can
23:18 - demonstrate later you know
23:20 - in between the scenes right and then the
23:23 - decor
23:24 - you know you can just have this on top
23:26 - of the box which through the box here
23:28 - right
23:28 - just download this online and then i
23:31 - just made this
23:32 - fall down and then draw some squiggly
23:34 - line on it
23:36 - okay and then this one the same thing um
23:39 - i think there's another project that
23:41 - they provided some flask
23:43 - so i just took that and i just kind of
23:46 - dropped them over here draw the squiggly
23:48 - line on it so make sure you group
23:50 - you know when you're moving object make
23:52 - sure you group all the object in one
23:55 - one one place if you don't group all the
23:57 - object then when you move it sometimes
23:59 - you know these things goes away
24:01 - so i can show it to you right so let's
24:03 - say i did this
24:05 - and i ungroup this right so if i ungroup
24:09 - it i try to move right you're going to
24:10 - move
24:10 - color like this so which is no good so
24:13 - make sure you that
24:14 - you group all your objects so that you
24:17 - can move them all together
24:18 - if not you're gonna miss something like
24:20 - this and it's totally messed up
24:23 - okay so to group the object just
24:26 - highlight them and then click on the
24:27 - group button here
24:30 - okay so the voting thing same thing so
24:32 - what we did
24:33 - uh we can't draw a different sprite uh
24:35 - so the first one is kind of like the
24:37 - the just the plane so
24:40 - where they have not both then we draw
24:44 - the second one where one person
24:45 - voted the one the person voted
24:49 - so as you can see it takes a lot of time
24:51 - to do all these kind of
24:52 - animation special animation takes a long
24:55 - time than
24:55 - game where the draw comes it seems right
25:00 - kind of like that and you can put it in
25:03 - so you get these
25:04 - just the little head that i drew and
25:06 - then i put them in
25:07 - so some of the head you cannot just take
25:09 - it from here
25:10 - and put it there because this is thicker
25:13 - so you see how
25:14 - thick this is 10 right so make sure that
25:16 - when you draw this little head you have
25:18 - to change the size
25:19 - outline you know maybe instead of 10 i
25:22 - don't group it for you
25:23 - so instead of 10 you know draw five or
25:25 - something right
25:26 - because if not then you know it all
25:28 - messed up it looks ugly
25:31 - okay so last this one is just
25:34 - same thing just draw i took it from the
25:37 - other
25:37 - custom here right this guy took it from
25:40 - here
25:41 - then i won't get a background put it
25:43 - here and then i draw the
25:45 - little theme circle and then put this
25:47 - little guy here
25:49 - okay and then there's the same thing
25:51 - this is just the
25:52 - uh ability just put them together here
25:55 - and then just kind of take each item put
25:57 - it here and then kind of line them up
26:00 - okay i hope you guys understand how to
26:02 - get all the sprite in
26:04 - if you need to do that uh or you have to
26:06 - do any kind of custom sprite
26:09 - so what we have to do is we are going to
26:11 - have to work on each of these guys
26:15 - okay so what we're going to do is we are
26:18 - going to start with this one
26:19 - first the story continues sprite so the
26:23 - story continues let me hide this one
26:26 - so the story continues this one so what
26:30 - we're going to do
26:30 - is we are going to use the first one
26:33 - first
26:34 - so what we're going to do is we're going
26:36 - to use the um
26:38 - let's flat click right
26:42 - uh what you want to do is make it go to
26:44 - 0 0 in the center
26:48 - then go here say make it go to front
26:50 - layer so that will cover other stuff in
26:52 - the back
26:53 - and then say show what i did was i kind
26:57 - of wait for four seconds you can wait
26:59 - three seconds doesn't matter
27:01 - so how many seconds you want kind of
27:03 - wait for four seconds
27:05 - then i say hi and
27:08 - from here after that i say broadcast
27:13 - so what you want to do is uh you can let
27:15 - the other sprite know that the
27:18 - kind of the uh
27:21 - the game begins so start episode one
27:25 - so this is the broadcast i call
27:30 - so um what we're going to do is we're
27:32 - gonna create the variable
27:34 - of already happens and i copied the
27:36 - other one so make sure you create this
27:38 - uh allow to open door uh
27:42 - current among us dialog in progress
27:46 - i will rename this without the space in
27:49 - between
27:50 - so i think all the no space dialogue and
27:53 - progress
27:53 - so all these all these uh variable uh
27:56 - global variable
27:57 - basically when you make the variable
27:58 - just leave it as for all sprite okay
28:02 - uh enable final spell and then imposter
28:05 - so these are all the variables we need
28:07 - we don't need a lot
28:08 - and then we have a name list so make a
28:10 - list called nameless so make a list here
28:12 - for sprite called nameless okay nameless
28:16 - okay so we have all the variables done
28:18 - [Music]
28:20 - okay so what we're going to do is we
28:21 - have this spot episode one right so what
28:23 - we're going to do is we'll go to the
28:25 - backdrop
28:27 - uh here we're going to do a start when
28:30 - start
28:31 - screen flashes click what we can do is
28:34 - lower music i already loaded the video
28:36 - game
28:36 - too i think it's actually in the loop
28:38 - somewhere
28:40 - uh video yeah so this is a video
28:45 - so video came to us here so in the um
28:48 - in the loop music so you just load it in
28:50 - here so once you load it in here you can
28:52 - just
28:53 - play the music so you can say control
28:56 - forever
28:58 - and then you go to sound okay so we'll
29:01 - have this uh music going on
29:03 - so what we want to do is uh we saw the
29:06 - um
29:07 - here right when the striking areas start
29:09 - episode one right
29:10 - so what we want to go back to the
29:12 - backdrop
29:13 - you have to find somewhere that you
29:15 - could always uh
29:17 - kind of go from one scene to another so
29:19 - we're gonna use the backdrop since
29:20 - backdrop has
29:21 - different scenes my backdrop one two
29:25 - you know three four different scenes
29:27 - right
29:28 - so as you can see there's different
29:31 - scenes here
29:32 - right so we're gonna go with the first
29:34 - one so when
29:36 - when i receive start episode one so what
29:39 - you want to do
29:40 - is um so switch to backdrop you say
29:44 - back drop one so that will begin the
29:46 - first backdrop
29:49 - okay so test it so when we run this
29:51 - right so we can
29:53 - run for four seconds you're gonna switch
29:55 - it will hide this and you'll see the
29:56 - first backdrop
29:58 - so that's kind of what we are right now
30:01 - so now let's go to our cyan uh
30:04 - we can call it different way we can just
30:07 - say you know
30:08 - when the green flag is clicked so we
30:10 - want to make the cyan to be able to move
30:14 - right but and then you say there's a
30:17 - something called a variable
30:19 - something called dialog in progress so
30:21 - what we want to
30:22 - do is you know we don't want to allow
30:24 - the assignment to do certain moves
30:26 - certain time
30:28 - like when the dialogue is in progress so
30:29 - we have to set it to yes so for right
30:31 - now
30:32 - we are going to set it to no
30:35 - there's no doubt in progress right now
30:37 - so i'll set it to no
30:40 - uh what we want to do is we're gonna
30:42 - switch it to costume
30:43 - one for now which is the regular costume
30:47 - of
30:48 - this guy right here okay
30:51 - and then we're gonna throw in a forever
30:53 - loop that we can control the sprite
30:56 - for this
31:00 - and then we need the if statement
31:08 - okay here you go sensing and then
31:11 - there's a key press so let's say
31:14 - right arrow key press uh you want him
31:18 - to point in direction
31:23 - 90 so pointing to the right and then
31:26 - motion move 10 step duplicate this block
31:31 - put in the bottom uh changes to the left
31:35 - arrow
31:37 - and then you say point to negative 90
31:40 - and then move 10 steps so when you point
31:43 - the direction then you
31:44 - actually have to change it to negative
31:45 - okay if you change it to negative it's
31:48 - going to be incorrect because we're
31:49 - already pointing to that other direction
31:52 - so all right so what we want to do
31:55 - is uh let's run the game again so after
31:58 - the element
31:59 - story uh screen goes away so you see
32:02 - this right it's not showing up
32:04 - so make sure you have the show okay so
32:07 - put it in the show after after the
32:09 - dialogue
32:11 - after this backdrop switch to backdrop
32:14 - one right this is controlling the
32:15 - backdrop one
32:17 - so what you can do is this so you say
32:20 - event so you don't want to show them all
32:22 - the time right
32:23 - so you don't want this guy to show up
32:25 - when actually the
32:27 - animation haven't begun yet so what you
32:29 - do is you can say something like this
32:32 - when i switch to backdrop one
32:36 - i'm going to make him go to front layer
32:40 - and then i'm gonna put him at some
32:42 - position doesn't matter
32:43 - let's say we put it at this position
32:45 - here and then we say okay switch to
32:48 - costume
32:51 - uh in case it you know it switched to a
32:54 - different costume let's just
32:55 - switch it to custom one again just in
32:57 - case you know when you're
32:59 - doing doing testing and all you can be a
33:01 - different costume
33:03 - and then you want to test certain thing
33:05 - you know you're going to go back to this
33:06 - backdrop one one swinging back to custom
33:08 - one
33:09 - so here we have custom one so now when
33:11 - we run the game again
33:15 - so after this goes away you can see oh
33:18 - you have this guy you kinda can control
33:20 - him left and right as you can see the
33:22 - yellow
33:22 - thing is moving that's how you know your
33:24 - clothes running
33:26 - right all right so here after that we
33:30 - have the kodi among us
33:31 - uh sprite so i think we're gonna finish
33:34 - this
33:35 - red sprite i mean they are the among us
33:38 - uh sprite here the first one and then
33:40 - we'll stop
33:41 - uh okay so here you can call the event
33:44 - green flag is click okay let me zoom in
33:48 - [Music]
33:50 - so what you want to do is you say point
33:53 - in direction nine
33:54 - it doesn't matter i mean wherever you
33:55 - want to face him let's say you want to
33:57 - face it to the right and you point to 90
33:59 - 31 face the left point of negative 90.
34:02 - so what i want to do is this
34:05 - now we want to start off with some um
34:08 - some kind of uh sprite costume so let's
34:12 - say
34:13 - so the current among us we're gonna call
34:15 - it red so which is the first costume
34:17 - right
34:18 - so red is his name make sure that
34:20 - matches the name so we can use that to
34:22 - switch when he's getting hit he can
34:24 - switch into red dead right
34:26 - so make sure that name is matching
34:28 - exactly
34:30 - okay so first we set it to red
34:34 - then what we can do is this
34:37 - say custom switch costume and then you
34:41 - can use a variable
34:45 - okay so that way if this one runs
34:48 - you will get the red class 2 okay
34:52 - and then you can say go to front layer
34:57 - and then i'm going to clean the graphics
34:58 - effect because when you
35:00 - when when you kill the sprite right they
35:03 - turn to pixelated or
35:05 - fish eye we want to clear that effect
35:07 - every time
35:08 - okay and then you want to hide it in the
35:10 - beginning first we don't want to show
35:13 - same thing when we're switching back
35:15 - drop right this is switching the
35:16 - backdrop of the episode one stop
35:19 - uh we want to do the same thing like
35:21 - what we had for this guy right
35:23 - so let's drag it here and put it here
35:26 - for now we're gonna change it up a
35:28 - little bit
35:30 - so when the backdrop starts what i want
35:33 - to do is i'm going to go into a
35:34 - different position
35:36 - [Music]
35:38 - okay i'm going to put him at negative
35:42 - 95.
35:45 - and then negative
35:49 - 99 doesn't matter 100 doesn't matter 100
35:54 - okay and you can put them the other way
35:58 - i think we had it initially you had it
36:00 - like this right
36:02 - oh you can turn them around someday
36:05 - so this one doesn't really matter you
36:06 - can throw it away also
36:08 - which doesn't matter or you can keep it
36:11 - either way it's fine so but backdrop one
36:13 - we're gonna turn them around
36:16 - and now we're gonna do the click
36:18 - graphics effect as well just in case
36:22 - and we're gonna show so we already have
36:25 - the costume
36:26 - we know what the costume is is red right
36:28 - so let's try it again
36:30 - so when we start the game you know wait
36:33 - a little bit
36:34 - we're gonna switch the costume let me
36:36 - switch the backdrop here
36:37 - the backdrop will come back over here
36:39 - and letting these two diagonally
36:41 - appear so the red will kind of stand
36:43 - there you cannot control the red
36:46 - and then you can only control the
36:47 - science where you're
36:49 - moving this guy right right
36:52 - so just like the animated story we had
36:54 - the cyan can like
36:56 - hit it with a club or something
36:57 - [Applause]
37:00 - so next time we'll work on the attack
37:03 - with the club and all the different
37:04 - things so for right now
37:06 - this is what we had so far i will upload
37:09 - this uh
37:10 - all the sprites and all the costumes on
37:12 - the how google drive
37:14 - uh make sure when you go to the google
37:16 - drive right you need to download
37:19 - each of the items down and then you can
37:21 - upload if you don't know how to do that
37:23 - let me just show you
37:24 - real quick so for example we have the
37:28 - google drive here in this video
37:30 - you can click more right so you can go
37:33 - to this
37:34 - click on this or open up a new screen
37:37 - like this
37:38 - um you know you can just right click
37:40 - let's say you want download power up or
37:42 - laser the tree doesn't matter
