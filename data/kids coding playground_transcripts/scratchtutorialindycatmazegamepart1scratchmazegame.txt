00:00 - [Music]
00:06 - so welcome back guys to another video on
00:09 - kids coding playground today we'll be
00:11 - making an Indiana cat 2 game it's kind
00:13 - of like Indiana Jones
00:14 - so you objective of the game is to get
00:17 - the gem which is right here and avoid
00:20 - all these traps and gets the exit which
00:23 - is right here
00:24 - you can find this game idea and a book
00:26 - called super Scratch programming
00:27 - adventures for more information check
00:30 - this link right here and we'll provide a
00:34 - link to our Google Drive in the
00:36 - description below on downloading these
00:39 - sprites and will be learned today we'll
00:43 - be learning these following concepts and
00:44 - scratch broadcasting messages custom
00:47 - blocks using operators touching colors
00:51 - using a list in your variables so I'll
00:55 - show you guys how the game works
00:57 - I took up I took out the Indiana Jones
01:02 - music because because YouTube can claim
01:06 - her video if we play copyrighted music
01:09 - so I've just decided to take a sound
01:11 - from the library so when you start and
01:17 - types out to say then churches and you
01:22 - can use arrow keys
01:24 - to move around when you get hit until it
01:27 - we're gonna sleep out and same yeah make
01:30 - a mess out so just try to get past all
01:33 - these traps because you can see if you
01:40 - get the key right here gets not a
01:42 - keyhole open then you can get them then
01:46 - you can get the gem and go to the exit
01:49 - OOP here avoid the spike and all these
02:02 - traps are sort of moving and I'll say
02:15 - you won it took you how many seconds and
02:18 - it took you how many attempts so let's
02:21 - go make a new - new project so first we
02:29 - need to get all our spread set up you
02:32 - still like the scratch pad I already
02:33 - have everything all the sprites in the
02:37 - backpack you can just load the sprites
02:40 - into here to load the Indiana I can load
02:45 - the gate just drag them into here
03:02 - so now we have everything set up so this
03:06 - is the layout you can just put all this
03:12 - and I forgot the keyhole yeah so now we
03:17 - have everything set up so let's go to
03:20 - the code for the cat the movement so
03:24 - first we'll be working on the movement
03:25 - and also since we put all these stuff in
03:29 - her backpack it's all in the right
03:31 - position so if it's not like this
03:33 - Dragons the right position like this you
03:36 - can do it any way you want of course but
03:38 - we're gonna do it like this and the Indy
03:42 - cat should be 90 size and the whiptail
03:45 - this thing should be 40 size I scaled it
03:48 - correctly that's the best size for them
03:51 - so let's go for the movement for the cat
03:56 - first so for the setup we'll need to
03:58 - make a couple variables so let's get our
04:03 - three variables we do not need the my
04:05 - variable just delete it make a new
04:07 - variable called attempts attempts so
04:15 - this is supposed to count how many
04:17 - attempts it takes it takes for you at
04:20 - the end make a new variable a letter
04:24 - letter that's the that's for so you know
04:29 - how when in the beginning it will type
04:31 - out the word we'll need that for the
04:33 - type text thing and we'll need make a
04:37 - new finally one more variable called
04:39 - timer and the timer supposed to be at
04:42 - the end I'll tell you how fast you
04:44 - completed the game in so and then we'll
04:47 - need one list called words this is for
04:49 - the type text again we'll get on to that
04:52 - later
04:53 - so now I have the variables we can
04:56 - actually start on the cat so I'm going
05:01 - to start on the movement of the cat so
05:04 - when clicked we have to set the attempts
05:08 - to one cuz at the end it'll show us one
05:12 - attempt so just set the attempts of one
05:13 - in the beginning
05:15 - hide the variable attempts hide all the
05:17 - variables in the beginning hide variable
05:19 - timer and set the timer to zero in the
05:23 - beginning so let's start on zero we can
05:29 - show these for now so I can show you how
05:31 - these variables work right now so next
05:36 - we want to set the size from the cat to
05:38 - 90% so hiding the variable is the same
05:43 - as unchecking them so you can either
05:45 - uncheck them in the beginning or
05:47 - anything - or you can use the hide fear
05:50 - pool
05:51 - so easy to uncheck or use hide variable
05:54 - so we want to set the size to 90 again
05:59 - set the size to 90 in the beginning I
06:01 - already know I know I already said it's
06:03 - a 90 but if you haven't then you can
06:05 - just put this block right there we want
06:08 - it to go to like somewhere right here I
06:12 - already set the coordinates for it
06:16 - so I've got negative 295 205 native 205
06:23 - and 150 that those are my coordinates I
06:25 - got it last time and forever loop and
06:31 - this is a movement like um arrow keys
06:36 - WASD so if then if the left arrow key he
06:44 - he left key opt or W the key up arrow or
06:50 - W is pressed
06:53 - that means if either one of these are
06:55 - oops X if either one of these keys are
06:59 - pressed then it will go up so if so
07:03 - we'll change the Y by three so we'll go
07:05 - up huge y by three and if then touching
07:13 - the color want to if then steam it in
07:16 - here if then touching the color of the
07:21 - edge like this thing the edge
07:26 - just select the edge of it that yeah it
07:30 - is touching that color which is 10 color
07:33 - 100 saturation and 95 brightness then it
07:37 - will change the Y by negative 3 so go
07:42 - back so you can't go through the wall so
07:51 - now let's work on the other arrow keys
07:55 - so you can just duplicate this put it
07:58 - right here if then let's say down arrow
08:02 - or s arrow s key is pressed then we'll
08:08 - change the Y by negative 3 mm and oh and
08:14 - if touching that color then I'll change
08:16 - the Y by 3 so you will always want it to
08:18 - be the opposite of it so go back and
08:20 - we'll go through the wall so you can
08:22 - just duplicate this typically both of
08:25 - them so put her here so if the now if
08:31 - the right arrow is press that or the D
08:37 - or D is press then we can change instead
08:42 - of Y with these X because we're going
08:44 - side to side
08:45 - so change the X by three-point direction
08:55 - of 90 so face the right side and you can
09:03 - just move take this out put the change X
09:07 - by negative 3 in here if it's touching
09:11 - the color so now we have this right
09:16 - arrow now let's work on the left arrow
09:20 - left arrow just pretty much the opposite
09:24 - of it it's pretty much the opposite of
09:26 - this thing duplicate left arrow left
09:31 - arrow key or a is press ok then we can
09:35 - change the X or negative 3
09:38 - pointing direction of negative 90 so
09:41 - we'll face the left side negative 90 and
09:45 - change X by three opposite so I won't
09:48 - come through the wall so now we have all
09:52 - this for the movement so now I can move
09:57 - left and right up and down you can use
09:59 - the WASD and it can't and when it
10:03 - touches the color it will not go through
10:06 - you can see it will go through the walls
10:10 - you just hide the letter they're gonna
10:12 - look so now let's see it won't go
10:16 - through so that's the movement and let's
10:26 - add we can do the type text thing today
10:29 - so we need to make a new block so today
10:34 - we'll just cover the cat movement and
10:36 - the text type a thing so we can name
10:41 - this type birds type words add two
10:46 - inputs one is one is gonna be told text
10:52 - one is called text and one is called
10:54 - type so two two inputs so you click OK
11:08 - so you have this so in the beginning you
11:11 - want to set the letter to one so you got
11:13 - one letter letter to one and delete all
11:20 - of words sort of delete the word list in
11:22 - the beginning so you want to get the
11:26 - repeat repeat the Len length of text
11:34 - this means they'll repeat however long
11:38 - the text you write is so if you write if
11:42 - you write like hi it's - its - so repeat
11:47 - two times so you will change so
11:51 - we'll add you need to go to variables
11:54 - add add letter it will add letter letter
12:05 - letter the variable put it into here of
12:10 - the text so add the letter you input to
12:16 - the text to the word list so you want to
12:19 - change the letter by one every time
12:22 - every time you write a new new letter so
12:28 - you change it by one you can take an
12:30 - if-else statement take it if then I'll
12:33 - stating it put it under here
12:35 - so if type is equal to say which means
12:42 - if the type is equal to same not not
12:45 - thinking so there's two types there's
12:47 - thinking and say if the type this thing
12:51 - is equal to say then I'll say say the
12:55 - words say or say okay say words you'll
13:05 - say the words in the word list you put
13:07 - in and else if it's not if the type is
13:11 - not equal to say if it's not true then
13:14 - I'll think the words so next you can do
13:22 - under here you can do a weight 0.1
13:25 - seconds just to make it a little slower
13:28 - so people can read it there for 1
13:32 - seconds wait one second down here and
13:35 - clear
13:36 - clear the words say so what you want to
13:40 - do right here is just clear and then we
13:46 - need to add something else let me zoom
13:48 - in so you guys can see you can stop
13:50 - you're done then we could take a few
13:54 - clicks forever
13:58 - set timer set the variable timer
14:03 - to the sensing timer so the timer will
14:07 - keep on going up second-by-second mm-hmm
14:11 - and in the beginning in the beginning we
14:14 - can um take the type text type words put
14:18 - it right here put the instructions like
14:21 - go get the Chan and escape like that and
14:32 - think so I put think right here so we'll
14:37 - think it not saying so so right here it
14:40 - says if type is equal to say then I'll
14:43 - say it else they'll think so if this is
14:45 - not say then I'll think it so if you put
14:48 - anything right here it will still think
14:50 - so let's play it I'll think she's
14:54 - thinking and say go get the gem and
14:56 - escape and type it up and the movements
14:59 - don't works and if you show the variable
15:05 - timer it's actually going up right here
15:09 - see so we'll actually stop right here so
15:15 - right now we have the movement the type
15:17 - text words and the timer done so
15:20 - tomorrow in the next video we will work
15:24 - on the UM work on the like the other
15:27 - deep the traps will work on the traps
15:31 - and the walk and the keys next time so
15:36 - I'll see you guys in the next video
15:37 - thanks to you guys for watching and
15:39 - please like share and subscribe to our
15:42 - Channel and I'll see you guys next time
