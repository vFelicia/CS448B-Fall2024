00:08 - hello and welcome back to the kids
00:11 - calling playground Channel today we'll
00:13 - go over to try to make the ninja move
00:18 - around the the platform here and also he
00:23 - should not be open to he should not be
00:25 - able to walk through this wall here so
00:28 - we'll try to fix that and so before we
00:32 - begin now please like share and
00:33 - subscribe to our Channel and if you know
00:35 - any friend that's interested in doing
00:37 - Scratch programming
00:38 - please introduce our channel to them and
00:41 - ask them to watch some of our video and
00:44 - hopefully they will subscribed as well
00:46 - alright and now let me try to go through
00:50 - what we have earned last time okay here
00:54 - we go
00:55 - let's take a look at what we have done
00:56 - last time so we had created some of the
01:01 - custom block here jump control run
01:03 - controls and make roughly and start
01:05 - again basically this is like kind of
01:08 - reset the game so as you can see this is
01:12 - start again so if you have missed any of
01:14 - the code please you can pause the video
01:16 - and I'll just take a look and make sure
01:18 - that you got everything that you need it
01:20 - so this is the green flag like this is
01:24 - the run control right and then here says
01:28 - simulated gravity let me throw this away
01:31 - it was testing something and here is the
01:35 - checking if the the user is hitting any
01:39 - button if not we'll put him back to a
01:41 - standing position and this is the Chum
01:45 - control and we added the arrow to jump
01:48 - we can also add like the W key to jump
01:57 - as well since we already added the other
02:01 - key for moving left and right D he and
02:06 - the 18 right so at the W key okay so
02:10 - this is so far that's what we have for
02:12 - the ninja right that's the code for
02:15 - ninja from top here
02:18 - and then someone call in the bottom here
02:22 - we can probably organize it better a
02:24 - little bit la later putting all the
02:27 - custom block maybe on this side so that
02:31 - way we can kind of focus on there on all
02:35 - the other camps and stuff so custom
02:38 - block on the left side and go on the
02:43 - right side okay all right so this is our
02:47 - kind of begin this is another when flat
02:51 - click and these are two sham control can
02:55 - pop or the army next to this get this
02:58 - jump so that way we have everything
03:01 - together okay all right what a nice and
03:04 - neat okay what we're going to do is
03:08 - right now we want it I'm gonna teach you
03:12 - guys how we can make a hitbox prevent it
03:14 - and just kind of run across here so
03:17 - let's try run test this game now again
03:21 - okay okay let's begin I think I had some
03:29 - Co here let me remove this kill this
03:31 -  hitbox I was actually trying
03:34 - something earlier let's put it back
03:36 - originally it is the codes like this
03:38 - okay now let's stop this let's run it
03:41 - again so as you can see that it just
03:43 - kinda can't move right but one problem
03:46 - is he can kind of run through here you
03:48 - see that that's not what we want so what
03:51 - we want to do is prevent the ninja from
03:53 - running across like this now what we can
03:56 - do is we can bill hitbox so once you set
03:58 - up all your platform or your platform
04:02 - make sure that you have a code and make
04:05 - sure that all when it start we always
04:07 - want to go to the position that you want
04:09 - to lay your your image here and we'll do
04:12 - something similar for the air hitbox so
04:15 - on the platform once you have the
04:16 - platform set up with all your three
04:18 - costume when you can do is this I
04:21 - already have it right here but I'll show
04:22 - you so you can say right-click duplicate
04:25 - so we'll create something new right for
04:28 - this what you can do is you can go in
04:30 - and you
04:31 - edit this so what I'm going to do is I'm
04:34 - gonna go in already have the hitbox here
04:36 - what I'm gonna do is go in and edit the
04:38 - first level basically I'm gonna take off
04:41 - the Queen part and leave the brown part
04:44 - in place so that you know we can use as
04:46 - a hitbox so that the the character
04:49 - cannot run through it works well for
04:51 - like this kind of level but um and this
04:54 - level is fine but this level will have
04:56 - some trouble you'll see later on why
04:58 - because of the you know the small box
05:01 - here in between okay so it's not so how
05:06 - you do it right you just do a copy
05:08 - duplicate and then similar to - yeah
05:11 - right habit so I'll show it to you here
05:13 - so what you do once you duplicate you
05:16 - can go in and kind of remove the top so
05:19 - I'll show you how how this is being done
05:22 - so let's say I'm over here on this one
05:25 - so what you can do is this you see how
05:27 - you have these boxes ready so when you
05:30 - can do select the bottom piece just hold
05:33 - the shift key and when you do is select
05:36 - the more copy and then come control V
05:40 - control C and control V and you kind of
05:42 - move it on top like this
05:44 - okay and then after that what you can do
05:48 - is you can select these guys on the top
05:50 - the green part and just trying to tidy
05:52 - them like this and if you want to adjust
05:55 - your you know up and down you can do
05:57 - that as you can see is not perfectly
05:59 - even if you want it to perfectly even
06:02 - then you know click on it you can push
06:04 - the up key up here to make it come out
06:07 - perfectly even right whatever you like
06:10 - to do so you can see this perfectly even
06:12 - so same thing for like other boxes so
06:15 - you can do is just select these just the
06:18 - middle row copy control C control V move
06:23 - it like right here and you can just
06:26 - delete the top piece all right so that's
06:30 - how we'll actually do it right so same
06:34 - thing for this just find one that you
06:35 - like and put it
06:37 - okay so this is how you actually do the
06:39 - platform removing the hitbox just
06:42 - removing copying and removing the top of
06:44 - here
06:45 - okay so let's go back to my hitbox I can
06:48 - Trash this that was just an example we
06:51 - go don't trash it I'll show you
06:53 - something later okay let's go back and
06:55 - let's fix our level one so for our level
06:59 - one hitbox I just did a copy from here
07:01 - so it's the exact same position so what
07:04 - we can do is kind of go in and delete
07:06 - all this wrong icon here so we don't
07:10 - need that so what we can do is we can
07:13 - just copy this guy then ctrl V and you
07:21 - can see I just laid over here and then
07:25 - I'll delete the top same thing with this
07:33 - C control V
07:41 - so we'll delete the top wall just the
07:45 - height here so come from the back down
07:49 - at all you can just adjust them using
08:02 - the up and down here if you wanna
08:04 - perfectly aligned so so I have my second
08:10 - level down here same thing here your
08:13 - copy control C and control V you can
08:22 - just put it like right here something
08:27 - like that if you wanna just sit just use
08:31 - the arrow down arrow it's a little
08:35 - easier
08:36 - okay just delete that this part so now I
08:40 - have my color my hitbox here right okay
08:45 - alright so what I did I write it in
08:48 - level 2 and for level 3 new series there
08:53 - will be some issue we can either cut it
08:56 - later I'll show you
08:57 - so we'll leave it like this for now so
09:01 - let's save it let's put our then you're
09:05 - back to the here so what we need to do
09:08 - is go back to the platform go back to
09:11 - the cajon so when we start we're going
09:15 - to set the level so what we wanted to is
09:19 - set level 2 1 send us our custom write
09:26 - number 1 so it will match that costume
09:29 - if it is a 1 2 3 right right 1 2 3 so
09:35 - we'll use that as a change switch
09:37 - costume so you say switch costume to the
09:42 - variable level which is 1 right now
09:47 - ok that means I'm in a little bit so you
09:50 - guys can see better ok now
09:53 - what I'm going to do is I'm gonna make
09:55 - it go to the back layer because they
09:58 - don't want the platform to be covering
10:01 - the ninja whatever all the tree right so
10:04 - will be called black layer and next time
10:08 - when we increase let's say go to the
10:11 - next level where some coke and changed
10:13 - level by one or you can do that later we
10:15 - don't need to do now so what we had is
10:18 - kind of set up the level and what we can
10:21 - do is go back to our hitbox same thing
10:25 - right
10:26 - without hitbox we want to one set it up
10:31 - as such right so okay for the hitbox we
10:39 - will kind of keep it done on level one
10:44 - for now we'll have some logic like be
10:46 - depending on the level what we want to
10:50 - show for now we're just gonna three the
10:52 - track is quick because I'm actually
10:54 - going to change that later on to maybe
10:57 - receive a message thing when they start
11:00 - up our setup then we'll do that but I
11:03 - will go for right now we're testing the
11:06 - hitbox so uh we can just put in a logic
11:09 - light something like this if so we have
11:14 - the variable level right we'll change it
11:19 - later on this thing so it is equal to 1
11:26 - it was equal to 1 then we want this to
11:30 - go to this position so wherever this
11:33 - position is right so what we want to do
11:36 - we want to make sure this hitbox and the
11:38 - platform goes to the same position so
11:40 - that it over to each other right if not
11:42 - then you'll have some issue okay what
11:46 - we're going to do is we're gonna put
11:47 - into platform 1 for now so we're gonna
11:50 - test it out and now hitbox is also on
11:54 - platform 1 right okay so what we're
11:59 - going to do is we're gonna set the ghost
12:01 - effect of the hip
12:04 - so that you cannot see the hitbox ok
12:12 - what look ok step closer effect till 100
12:20 - so when the green flag is clicked go to
12:23 - the number 110 I will use this costume
12:27 - or can do my chain costume or whatever
12:29 - alright so we'll just say switch custom
12:33 - for now till level 1 right
12:42 - okay alright so very similar to the
12:45 - platform right ok what a hip-hop so we
12:50 - say start or save it lets thought so you
12:55 - will so what we are going to do is that
13:00 - we have to delete this this is kind of
13:02 - blocking the way right let's just trash
13:04 - this guy ok this is what we have so far
13:08 - so the hitbox is behind here you
13:10 - couldn't see it what we can do is we're
13:13 - going to keep the ninja from walking
13:16 - past this right so we're gonna go back
13:20 - to the ninja go ok so we have it hearing
13:26 - so we don't want the ninja to run pass
13:29 - it if I touch the hitbox mmm so what we
13:33 - did to do is we're gonna use this one we
13:35 - are going to use this enjoin and this is
13:38 - a knot so basically is if it's not
13:40 - touching the hitbox and he's not dying
13:47 - then we'll let him move right so put
13:49 - this so change that out change it out to
13:52 - this and then we will actually need
13:55 - another stops script here
14:03 - so what I'm doing is having different
14:05 - start script so that is the it multiple
14:07 - you know is going with different thread
14:11 - so it doesn't block whatever is doing so
14:14 - this guy can do one thing this guy can
14:15 - do another thing right so I had the
14:19 - stuff Flags quick so basically when you
14:21 - click on this green flag these co-run
14:23 - what we want to do is use of whatever
14:26 - loop and we are going to use our
14:31 - condition check here okay so we are
14:41 - going to see if it actually touch the
14:43 - hitbox right so what we say is hitbox it
14:47 - is touching the hitbox and actually if
14:54 - this is not correct the movie this one
14:57 - only that ifs payment actually inside
15:00 - the if statement will put it if they'll
15:03 - statement inside okay so this is what
15:06 - we're going to check is what direction
15:08 - and then just pointing to the name is
15:10 - pointing to to the right which is 90
15:12 - then we want him to go back there is
15:15 - pointing to the left they trying to hit
15:17 - the hitbox and we'll go back to the
15:19 - right
15:19 - so either way right so with a check the
15:22 - direction of the ninja is pointing when
15:24 - you can do them you can use this and
15:30 - where the kotas go to the ration and
15:33 - leave us in here here exposition so this
15:37 - is the direction of the ninja in the
15:39 - direction of the ninja is 90 which is
15:41 - pointing is facing to the right side we
15:46 - want to change his eggs okay change is
15:51 - six by minus 10 so within minus 10
15:55 - because that's how fast is running right
15:58 - you remember with the run speed in the
16:00 - beginning so it runs speed is 10 so this
16:03 - is kind of matching that up
16:05 - so minus 10 backward so else so he's not
16:11 - going to 90 then they must be going the
16:14 - other way
16:15 - so you will say +10 so make him go back
16:17 - to the right so he's facing to the right
16:21 - and when we can go left is facing to the
16:23 - left when we feel good right if he hit
16:25 - him box okay let me stop it
16:29 - so before as you can see right we wash
16:32 - it running through let me take this out
16:33 - you can can see again so if I run the
16:36 - run oh okay
16:39 - so because of this we are blocking him
16:42 - right also we put this here just in case
16:45 - if he actually run faster and he
16:49 - actually hit this right we wanna put him
16:52 - back okay let's run again bigger so now
16:57 - so you say you cannot pull into the
17:00 - hitbox so he cannot run through the wall
17:03 - now so you see he can run like this like
17:08 - this but he cannot run through now
17:10 - because this Co here we came pushing him
17:13 - backward and this Co is stopping him to
17:15 - able to go forward okay alright so this
17:21 - works pretty well right let's check
17:23 - let's stop this and let's say we use a
17:26 - platform number two and see what happens
17:30 - and we'll make this guy go to open up
17:37 - wait for one second okay here so what we
17:42 - couldn't do I think though I don't even
17:44 - platform two is the same position I
17:46 - think the co2 can be else I actually I
17:49 - have not moved my platform when I did
17:52 - the I'm doing different level so
17:56 - actually well what I'm going to do is
17:59 - I'll put a little weight here so I want
18:01 - this I want this to set up the variable
18:04 - before this guys go right so put a
18:08 - little weight here will change all this
18:11 - later on okay what we can do is we can
18:17 - even draw this if statement we don't
18:19 - need it
18:20 - so what let's make it easier okay this
18:25 - will throw this away okay so the hitbox
18:28 - will just follow
18:29 - the level hairspray so let's start again
18:34 - so you see how it is slow right so you
18:37 - see this that's why it doesn't work well
18:39 - so you make wou have to want to make
18:43 - sure that you know next time we'll have
18:45 - this setup right well some kind of setup
18:48 - so it will wait for the level to
18:50 - generate before we put the music in you
18:53 - can do that next time
18:54 - but for today we were just trying to get
18:56 - the the hitbox working correctly so now
18:59 - the ninjas you right so we still haven't
19:05 - fixed the box right with the Box we had
19:07 - to make sure that okay here is this
19:09 - level water put the box here or
19:11 - something like that we can do that later
19:13 - but with the setup once they generate a
19:15 - map we know what it is then we'll set up
19:17 - the box okay so let's go back to the
19:20 - ninja so that's running again so as you
19:24 - can see right he can he can compare go
19:30 - inside the box easy it's getting block
19:32 - right it works pretty well right for
19:34 - this kind of platform so we can kind of
19:37 - go through that he'll fall into the
19:38 - water
19:38 - we haven't walk on the coal for water
19:41 - yet so he'd found the water make him
19:43 - back over here right now we can walk on
19:46 - next time but as you can see if we try
19:49 - to go through like the third level let
19:52 - me just take this out I'm gonna switch
19:55 - it manually to dirt hole and here in
19:59 - this hitbox no selector which is this
20:02 - one so now we start you can see that
20:13 - we're fine with this one they cannot run
20:16 - through but you see he's getting it when
20:20 - he get into here when you trying to jump
20:22 - up this is coming getting stuck on him
20:25 - right you see this because we have this
20:27 - hitbox everywhere and then they charge
20:31 - em up we got chopped
20:32 - back away right so what you can do is um
20:38 - what you can do for simplicity sake you
20:41 - can go here and you can go back to any
20:44 - box what you can do is you can convert
20:46 - this to bitmap first or you can just
20:50 - change it but uh make it smaller right
20:53 - so but you if you don't convert the
20:56 - bitmap you wanna erase it doesn't erase
20:58 - you see yes it doesn't erase so you're
21:01 - the convert to bitmap so this one I
21:03 - converted to bitmaps of what I did was I
21:05 - tell you raise a lot of it just leaving
21:09 - just a tiny bit on top tiny bit on top
21:11 - so if I use this now it walks a little
21:15 - bit better so let's try again so you see
21:20 - only if I jump all the way on top here
21:23 - right if I hit that then there's a
21:25 - little problem but other than that this
21:28 - is okay we cannot really get around with
21:34 - that unless we'll we'll just remove the
21:37 - hitbox like this lioness let me try this
21:40 - so there's duplicate this let's put this
21:43 - up here so what we can do is we are
21:49 - going to delete all these guys no hitbox
21:57 - on the top so if I show you this you see
22:02 - so the linear can can can you see if he
22:07 - can get running through it right which
22:09 - is kind of bad so again you can jump he
22:15 - doesn't have any issue but you can jump
22:19 - but you know sometimes we can get into
22:21 - the middle of it right so that's why
22:25 - that's why we added those hitbox but uh
22:28 - I mean I'm not sure that's a a better
22:31 - way to do it for now you know we can
22:34 - just kind of make it smaller I think
22:36 - there may be some way we can check
22:38 - mr. jumping action and then we can make
22:42 - more that or something with a hitbox it
22:46 - was a running action then we have to
22:47 - stop it but that will require some call
22:50 - to check so basically this is lesson
22:52 - just trying to get the ninja kind of
22:56 - move around with the with the hitbox are
22:59 - in place so that you know we can't block
23:02 - him from moving across the platform
23:04 - that's what we're trying to do so we got
23:07 - the light using a level 2 level 2 is
23:09 - fine it works pretty well right level 2
23:15 - as well right move the ball at this that
23:19 - thing can I moved into the into the
23:22 - rocks but um you know level 3 with those
23:26 - little step there's some problem so what
23:29 - we'll see let me think about that see if
23:31 - we can do that a little bit better if
23:33 - not what we'll just continue with the
23:35 - with just cleaning out the thin strip
23:39 - here so that you'll prevent him from
23:42 - getting his head stuck in the middle of
23:44 - this grass when running okay alright I
23:47 - think we'll stop here for now I will
23:49 - contain next time thanks for doing the
23:54 - lesson with me I'll see you guys next
23:56 - time
23:57 - thank you
