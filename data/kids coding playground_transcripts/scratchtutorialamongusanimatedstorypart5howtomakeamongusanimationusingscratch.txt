00:00 - [Music]
00:08 - hello guys and welcome back to the kids
00:10 - calling playground channel
00:12 - so today we're gonna work on the among
00:14 - us part
00:15 - five i think this will be the last one
00:17 - for now
00:18 - um i'm going to show you the transition
00:21 - between the uh the episode so basically
00:24 - the episode
00:25 - ends where they vote and then they kick
00:28 - out the
00:28 - uh the gray among us uh
00:31 - sprite and that's in and then i'll show
00:34 - you how to go into episode two
00:37 - and then after that you know you guys i
00:38 - think you should be
00:40 - getting the hang of it you can do it on
00:41 - your own and you can do like episode 3
00:44 - and 4 whatever you like or how you want
00:46 - to plan out
00:48 - the the game i mean the animation i have
00:51 - provided all the sprites and everything
00:53 - so you guys should have everything and
00:55 - now you can just look at uh
00:57 - i will share my uh project and you guys
00:59 - can look at that
01:00 - and if you have any questions just kind
01:01 - of go through and check that out
01:04 - um anyways uh so i was looking at among
01:07 - us today and
01:08 - trying to understand a little bit more
01:09 - and there's some fun fact about mankas
01:12 - actually
01:13 - mangas is only developed by three
01:16 - developer
01:17 - that's what i found out so which is
01:19 - really amazing
01:21 - and also that they did not the among us
01:24 - game actually did not get any popularity
01:28 - until you know uh july 15 or so this
01:31 - year
01:32 - actually after this year july 15 then a
01:34 - lot of people stopped playing you know
01:36 - like the
01:37 - bigger youtuber like mr bees and
01:40 - pewdiepie
01:41 - they're playing it and then all the
01:42 - bigger streamer they stream it so that's
01:45 - why among us got so popular
01:47 - now so yep so so there was only three
01:51 - developers that was really
01:52 - surprising you know they don't have a
01:54 - whole team so
01:56 - so imagine just you know three people
01:59 - you can achieve so much
02:00 - so you guys put your heart into it you
02:02 - know doing something
02:04 - you can always achieve something big all
02:07 - right
02:07 - anyway uh let's get on with the uh the
02:10 - uh tutorial so this is uh the among us
02:14 - story in a minute story so uh so far
02:16 - this is the uh
02:17 - cyan sprite uh this is the covoy
02:21 - anyway um i will also share my project
02:24 - my project will have a little bit more
02:25 - code than this
02:26 - since uh my project has the actual
02:30 - um you know the whole story from episode
02:33 - one to episode three
02:35 - so it will be a little bit different
02:38 - okay let me go on to the next sprite
02:40 - this is the amanca sprite
02:42 - so this is the code for it so if you
02:45 - guys have anything you can
02:46 - pause it and pick it up the door
02:50 - this is the code for the door i think
02:52 - orange sprite doesn't have anything i
02:54 - think it comes in like
02:55 - episode not two or something so
02:59 - that one doesn't have anything uh brown
03:02 - has some stuff
03:05 - um green
03:08 - yeah something there purple something
03:10 - there not much
03:12 - i'm gonna add some coat to the box
03:13 - actually today
03:15 - and then this is number blue there's
03:18 - something in the blue
03:20 - gray there's some some some color in the
03:24 - gray here
03:28 - okay and then computer no i don't have
03:31 - anything
03:32 - nothing here no this is the uh
03:37 - the for the uh like the laser gun
03:40 - okay and this is the portal
03:44 - okay so that's to go into the photo to
03:47 - open the door
03:48 - okay maybe i can put it like this
03:52 - it's easier to see
03:56 - you know
04:00 - okay all right club
04:05 - the table the gauntlets
04:12 - texts
04:15 - ah nothing here lightsaber there's some
04:18 - cold here
04:20 - okay rain yeah that's some cold for the
04:23 - rain
04:24 - as well okay
04:27 - this one will work on this today the
04:29 - cape actually doesn't have any code
04:32 - we might work on the whole can i'll try
04:34 - to finish them all
04:35 - so that and then these are for the other
04:38 - other stuff so we don't have anything
04:40 - okay and then we have this this is the
04:43 - episode like from momento to another
04:46 - and this is the power that shows like
04:48 - what the abilities are
04:50 - and this is the in screen apparently so
04:53 - you will not do that
04:54 - okay so we'll just finish that real
04:57 - quick
05:00 - okay let's play the game so far what we
05:03 - had so that you guys can
05:05 - remember what it is so we take out the
05:09 - uh
05:10 - the sprite here go into the door
05:14 - then you know we can use the gun shoot
05:16 - them
05:17 - you know what let's call the box for
05:19 - this uh let's add it
05:21 - at the box here before i show so that
05:23 - looks a little better with
05:24 - some decoration here okay so the box
05:27 - let's do it real quick
05:30 - when green flag is clicked
05:33 - go to wherever the box is i think
05:39 - uh the box right now is it's located
05:42 - where did i call that oh what did i do
05:48 - okay i want to call the box since i was
05:50 - on this icon
05:51 - just delete that it's getting all crazy
05:55 - so the box is actually here okay let's
05:58 - go
06:00 - okay make sure i'm on the box okay
06:04 - zoom in motion let's put the box here
06:10 - look
06:13 - back layer or high
06:20 - then we have say switch to
06:23 - let's say backdrop number two will show
06:25 - it
06:29 - [Music]
06:32 - and it will show
06:36 - so show up let's duplicate that
06:39 - let's go for backtrack number three i'm
06:42 - gonna put another position we will get
06:44 - moving this side
06:45 - so like let's say negative 195 or
06:48 - something
06:48 - okay and see if that's okay i think
06:52 - that's why okay
06:53 - and then what we want to do is you know
06:55 - when we move from one stage to the next
06:58 - one i hide them
06:59 - as well so
07:04 - next stage look
07:08 - and hi and then um
07:12 - at the end where we have to stall we can
07:14 - also hide it
07:17 - um that way you know just in case with
07:20 - testing or something like that
07:22 - you know we can we can always click on
07:26 - those backdrop
07:27 - tests so hide it here okay so this is
07:30 - the code for the
07:31 - box so far so we want to show them in
07:33 - stage two and stage three
07:35 - okay all right the code for the box is
07:38 - done
07:39 - let's just test it out so far let's see
07:41 - what we have
07:42 - okay
07:45 - so so stage two should have the box now
07:50 - let's see yep another box here
07:54 - so stage two box all that
07:57 - might not be a good idea i put in a box
07:59 - away the portals here let's put a box on
08:00 - this side
08:03 - so let the photo stay here let's put the
08:05 - box on this side
08:08 - so let's stop this so what is the box
08:13 - position here
08:16 - look potion
08:19 - okay let's put the box at this position
08:24 - instead
08:27 - okay so stage two will have the box at
08:30 - that position stage two
08:40 - yep box at that position destroy him
08:44 - get the photo let's go in
08:47 - stage three the box also there oh that's
08:50 - too close the thing doesn't shoot
08:52 - actually these two holes
08:54 - will not be able to touch it so stage
08:57 - three where the box
08:58 - stays four right
09:01 - and then we'll go here that's where the
09:03 - voting things begin
09:05 - so that's what we left off last time
09:07 - saying no it's not me and then they say
09:09 - sia
09:10 - so weather kick him out so uh let's do
09:13 - that
09:14 - so let's go to the graves right i think
09:17 - this is uh finnish voting right so
09:20 - i say no no it's not me and then uh
09:23 - science a
09:24 - sia right and then we're gonna have a
09:26 - broadcast here
09:28 - so let's do it over here in the table
09:30 - then the tables control the voltage
09:32 - so you can't pick your sprite where you
09:34 - want to put your code
09:35 - so that way you know you cannot remember
09:38 - where you
09:38 - put your stuff at you know
09:42 - so let's call it see ya let's wait for
09:45 - four seconds and then we will gonna
09:48 - podcast a new message
09:58 - say cake
10:01 - out to space
10:05 - so this is kicking out the gray costume
10:07 - this great guy
10:08 - but you cannot really use the craze or
10:10 - what you want to do you want to create
10:11 - another one
10:12 - uh that's great so put it on here one on
10:15 - this guy
10:16 - so let's say when start flappers do this
10:20 - we'll clear the graphic effect just in
10:22 - case you know with
10:23 - any kind of i like animations or you
10:26 - know
10:26 - like changing this costume or something
10:30 - so after that just put it in some
10:32 - position it doesn't matter
10:34 - and then you say 90. yeah don't put it
10:37 - too close on this side we're going to
10:39 - make him spin
10:40 - and then touching edge so put it 120
10:43 - don't put 200 if you put 200 will get
10:45 - stuck over here okay
10:47 - all right so let's do this say hi
10:52 - so what we want to do is we want to keep
10:54 - him spinning you know when they get to
10:56 - the
10:56 - gray so what we want to do is this
11:01 - when i when the switch backdrop
11:05 - right to star which is the
11:08 - grade so we are going to have to add
11:12 - that
11:12 - we're going to have to switch the stall
11:14 - in the background also
11:15 - you know and uh when we kick him out of
11:18 - space right
11:19 - so let's take that first
11:25 - then say switch costume
11:29 - we'll take this to start
11:33 - so this will switch to custom to start
11:36 - now go back to the
11:37 - three guy
11:41 - so um when we receive uh switching to
11:44 - star
11:45 - we'll put him at this position again
11:50 - and then we'll say wait for one second
11:55 - and then we're gonna make him glide
12:00 - apply so kind of like you know just go
12:03 - to the star
12:04 - costume here backdrop put on star
12:07 - just hi everybody i mean if you want to
12:09 - call it like this
12:11 - just kind of hide this guy item
12:19 - so that's why we have like a i have a
12:21 - script
12:22 - on all the uh um you know like when you
12:24 - move to different
12:26 - uh screen high then you can it'll be a
12:28 - little bit faster you know like you can
12:30 - just click on that
12:31 - and then you know item but for now i
12:33 - just do it like this
12:35 - just for the for the thing of it we'll
12:38 - hide this list so now we have the black
12:40 - star right so we want to
12:42 - show this guy so what we want to do is
12:45 - we want to glide them like maybe until
12:47 - here or something right
12:51 - whatever that that position is or right
12:53 - here or whatever
12:54 - so we're going to make him kind of close
12:56 - glide to this position and then we want
12:57 - to make him turn
12:59 - okay so now let's see where's the uh
13:04 - motion okay so i mean i i kind of play
13:08 - around with it a little bit so i know
13:09 - what the
13:10 - amount is so i put six seconds that's
13:12 - kind of about right
13:14 - so we want to glide them to around one
13:17 - like here maybe one
13:19 - so that will touch the edge negative 185
13:21 - or something
13:22 - oops
13:28 - oh man that was going on so it's just
13:31 - somewhere like that
13:32 - okay
13:35 - and then we're gonna we are going to say
13:39 - broadcast
13:47 - so
13:51 - episode 1 so this is where the episode
13:55 - went in
13:56 - and we are going to hide it
14:00 - and then also when we switch to backdrop
14:03 - number five
14:05 - [Music]
14:08 - um we want to hide this as well
14:12 - [Music]
14:14 - okay okay also
14:18 - when we when we when we go to the star
14:20 - one let's tell him like
14:22 - like he's gonna make some comments like
14:24 - jeez or something like that
14:26 - so we can do that for five seconds
14:30 - so because six seconds he'll glide to
14:31 - here right so we want to do one second
14:33 - less
14:33 - so say jeez
14:38 - okay so so far that's what we have now
14:42 - but we want to spin him right so we'll
14:44 - need this again
14:46 - oops did not want to do that
14:52 - okay so when we we see star
14:56 - so i don't know that i have a different
15:00 - costume so i have gray right so
15:02 - i think uh you can make sure that you
15:05 - switch to grey costume i guess you can
15:07 - say switch to
15:09 - gray okay then you say
15:12 - go to the front layer
15:15 - go show and then
15:18 - we're gonna take one
15:22 - so it was a repeat loop
15:26 - okay and then we are going to sensing
15:31 - so we want to repeat until we touch the
15:33 - edge
15:34 - and we are going to turn
15:38 - like 5 degree 15 too fast so let's just
15:42 - try this okay see how it works
15:45 - so we're going to click on this first
15:48 - okay and then we are going to backdrop
15:50 - right number five right a star right so
15:52 - let's change this to start
15:55 - what we're gonna do is we're gonna we're
15:56 - gonna you know just double click on this
15:59 - so you can see see he's like geez
16:03 - he's gonna turn turn turn turn turn and
16:06 - then it
16:06 - is stopped okay so that's what we want
16:10 - okay so this is so far so good
16:16 - okay so let's go back over here the
16:18 - story continue we have this so far right
16:20 - so let's we need to have this event
16:26 - so when i receive episode 1 in
16:29 - [Music]
16:35 - we want to say
16:38 - go to zero zero so this will come up
16:42 - so this looks like this right so the
16:44 - second custom we're going to use this
16:45 - one okay
16:48 - so we say go to the front layer
16:55 - we're gonna say switch to costume
16:59 - i don't know what oh no backdrop sorry
17:01 - switch costume
17:02 - that's episode two
17:05 - then we are going to say show
17:09 - i mean i put one second ideally you need
17:12 - like three seconds or something
17:13 - right so you don't want to be one i was
17:16 - testing early so let's just put three
17:18 - and then you say new message
17:22 - say start
17:25 - yep two okay
17:29 - so you have spot episode two so what you
17:31 - want to do is you're going to go back
17:32 - and
17:32 - kind of go on to the next stage so let's
17:36 - go back here
17:38 - so we have something let's say start
17:40 - episode 2 right
17:42 - so start episode 2 should be s
17:45 - so what you want to do is uh switch to
17:48 - uh backdrop number six because
17:49 - five was the voltage thing like six
17:52 - seventy one
17:53 - so uh they're still in the voting room
17:55 - but uh we just duplicate number six okay
17:59 - okay so what we want to do is when we
18:01 - switch to backdrop six
18:07 - we wanna have something called you
18:10 - remember where this dialogue thing right
18:11 - whether
18:13 - make sure we set it to yes so that no
18:16 - the uh cyan guy cannot attack
18:18 - okay because all his attack move is
18:21 - based on this dialog because no
18:23 - okay so that's why you want to do that
18:25 - make sure you do that
18:27 - okay all right
18:32 - okay not sure what happened there it's
18:34 - gonna flash the screen
18:38 - so what you want to do is go back to the
18:40 - cyan
18:41 - you can't have any kind of comment uh
18:43 - like uh say what they want to say
18:45 - right so what we're going to do is we're
18:47 - going to duplicate this and make this a
18:49 - 6.
18:51 - so what we're going to do is we're going
18:53 - to put the cyan
18:56 - um you know he's gonna talk
18:59 - something okay so let him go the back
19:02 - layer
19:03 - costume that's fine show so what we want
19:06 - to do is just say
19:10 - it's like oh my bad
19:14 - it is not great
19:24 - i was so sure it
19:27 - was with him
19:36 - okay so i didn't upgrade
19:41 - but i was so sure it was him okay
19:43 - whatever something like that
19:45 - so you can put it for like four seconds
19:47 - whatever
19:48 - and then you can broadcast something
19:50 - like uh since the gray is gone we
19:52 - can broadcast and ask the orange to walk
19:55 - in kind of thing
19:57 - so broadcast new message say
20:01 - orange walk
20:04 - in okay
20:11 - so in the orange we'll just do a little
20:13 - coal because
20:15 - if you want to spend too much time on
20:17 - this one we still have to do the uh
20:18 - the the hulk hand and then the the uh
20:23 - doctor strange portal so we try to
20:25 - finish all this quick
20:27 - okay so we'll say clear graphics effect
20:30 - um so he's we're gonna make him face
20:33 - this way
20:34 - negative 90. okay
20:37 - and then we're gonna put him over here
20:40 - and we say hi
20:43 - [Music]
20:44 - okay and then we'll when
20:47 - walks in right
20:51 - we see orange walks in
20:57 - all we can do is we're gonna make him go
21:00 - back to this place as well so just in
21:02 - case you know sometimes
21:03 - it walks in different location while
21:05 - re-test you can always have it like that
21:08 - and i i'm going to have this rotation
21:11 - style first
21:12 - because actually later orange spin so it
21:15 - needs that
21:17 - and we want to make them go to 90
21:22 - and then we'll say go to front layer
21:26 - since orange is in the bottom actually
21:28 - so it needs to be in the front
21:34 - okay so go to the front layer we'll say
21:38 - show and we're gonna make him glide
21:45 - we're gonna make it like two seconds you
21:47 - kind of glide through it
21:49 - we'll do 140 or something like that
21:53 - it's gonna glide toward it
21:56 - so and then we're gonna
22:00 - do a little wait
22:04 - 0.5 half a second
22:08 - and let's say something
22:17 - so
22:17 - [Music]
22:20 - is the voting all done
22:24 - that we get him
22:28 - oh you can keep it like whatever second
22:30 - three seconds probably okay
22:32 - and then you need another beat kind of
22:34 - thing make it look a little bit better
22:38 - and you can broadcast
22:43 - a new message say
22:47 - purple top so this is when the
22:51 - when when the when the orange guy comes
22:53 - in it tells the portable
22:56 - top top so we'll leave it like that
22:59 - we're not going to do the purple because
23:01 - that's going to be too much work
23:04 - so after that so purple we have to make
23:07 - sure that he
23:08 - shows up right at the stage all we want
23:11 - to do is just going to duplicate this
23:12 - for now
23:14 - i'm going to call it that six you don't
23:16 - really need the position just have these
23:18 - two show is also fine
23:20 - but just in case you know you're moving
23:22 - different places you might
23:23 - you know you might need it well you can
23:25 - delete that now
23:27 - okay so let's just keep these two so far
23:30 - so so that make sure that stage 6 will
23:33 - also show up
23:34 - okay and then we'll probably do
23:37 - something for this guy
23:38 - so we also want to make the green guy to
23:41 - show up
23:42 - i think the green guys yeah it's like
23:45 - he's one of the people on stage six as
23:48 - well too
23:49 - for the ball hanging so just take this
23:53 - out
23:54 - i also have to rotate left and right
23:57 - because what we need is uh
23:59 - when we do the spin where to like get
24:01 - the final thing like when all my spin
24:04 - others set the rotation style
24:06 - so that's why i have to set it here left
24:08 - and right so that you know when i
24:09 - go into stage the uh the green guy will
24:12 - actually
24:13 - looks correct you know it doesn't
24:15 - doesn't go on
24:16 - be messed up like half of them turn
24:18 - upside down or something you know
24:20 - don't want to do that so make sure you
24:22 - have that okay
24:24 - so i think purple is good six i think
24:27 - blue
24:27 - needs it so let's do
24:31 - blue number six we also have that
24:34 - rotation style right
24:37 - i think these are fine the coordinates
24:42 - i think blue is in the back layer not
24:45 - exactly
24:46 - sure maybe okay
24:50 - yeah then maybe he's okay so that's blue
24:53 - so blue orange brown and then brown is
24:56 - it
24:58 - do one more browns in the front i think
25:01 - uh
25:02 - we'll set the rotations down as well set
25:05 - that
25:05 - six that's it blue as six yes yeah
25:09 - purple six green six
25:13 - orange that's when we walk in which is
25:16 - six
25:17 - that's fine okay great gray should be
25:20 - high from six because
25:22 - he died right he flew off so what we
25:25 - want to do is
25:26 - pie for number six okay
25:29 - so great all these guys are good
25:33 - okay let's run that one time or maybe
25:35 - we'll just do the hand and all that so
25:37 - and then we'll run it because we
25:39 - don't want to run out of time okay
25:43 - so let's go to the cyan guy we'll call
25:45 - it for the
25:47 - power where's all my power
25:50 - my power is down here right yeah number
25:52 - two right so we're gonna call for number
25:54 - five
25:57 - so that's code for number five which is
26:00 - the uh
26:02 - after strange portal the small one so
26:04 - what we
26:05 - have here is i'm i'm i have this code
26:08 - here
26:08 - just like this the end joint because i
26:11 - don't want him to cast a small portal at
26:13 - the uh
26:14 - you know what when when when they're in
26:16 - the final stage
26:18 - so that's why i have this extra
26:21 - if you're not doing that all the way you
26:23 - might not need it but uh let's just
26:25 - i'll just show you guys what i did so
26:27 - it'll be the same
26:29 - and you can follow along and we're gonna
26:32 - check the backdrop
26:36 - number so we're going to check it for
26:39 - backdrop 10 basically in background 10
26:41 - that's the final stage
26:43 - uh we don't want them to cast this uh
26:46 - small border we want to cast a big
26:48 - portal but anyway
26:49 - so let's look at the costume here we
26:51 - want custom number three
26:53 - okay so let's select custom number three
26:57 - we'll wait for one second and then fire
26:59 - laser we're gonna call
27:00 - cast portal spell
27:06 - okay and then say wait and then change
27:08 - it back to custom number one
27:11 - all right okay so let's go to the portal
27:18 - okay so portal we're gonna do it quickly
27:22 - uh look say hi
27:25 - okay when i receive
27:29 - oops casting the spell
27:33 - uh we're gonna switch it
27:36 - to let's just start with order one
27:38 - that's a small portal
27:40 - all right this is the big one this is
27:42 - small we'll use a small one
27:44 - therefore and then uh go to
27:48 - uh we're gonna go to the manga's sprite
27:50 - which is
27:51 - this one that we're killing this guy
27:53 - right
27:54 - and then uh we'll say
27:57 - point in direction 90 it's fine
28:01 - uh set y
28:06 - uh at 50 or whatever you want so
28:08 - somewhere on top here that's why
28:11 - we set it 50.
28:15 - sorry got the wrong one set why
28:18 - 50 okay okay so we got set y50 went to
28:23 - show so so show up the portal
28:27 - and then what we want
28:43 - 15 degree so let's see how this actually
28:45 - works
28:47 - so let's run this let's run it
28:52 - let me hide this thing here
28:56 - okay let's go back to bro let's to run
28:59 - things i just click on this you can see
29:01 - right it's kind of
29:02 - come rotating okay all right
29:05 - good good okay so what we want to do
29:08 - also we want to play a sound
29:10 - i think i already have a portal sound i
29:13 - think the portal sound was i'm not sure
29:15 - where i got it i think it's here
29:16 - actually
29:18 - teleport yeah
29:21 - see
29:22 - [Music]
29:25 - so we you can use it and then i think i
29:27 - cut some of it
29:28 - so i don't know i remember so it's like
29:31 - make it a little bit shorter
29:33 - so what you want to do is um
29:36 - when we receive this cast portal we
29:39 - don't want to do it
29:40 - in here what we want to do is do it here
29:41 - so that way you know
29:43 - you can have another it won't block them
29:46 - so you can say play until done okay
29:49 - oh i guess you can put this here but you
29:51 - will not use that until then
29:53 - that's fine either way okay so what we
29:56 - also want is a
29:57 - mission complete so this thing is
29:58 - spinning right forever what you want to
30:00 - do you want to kill this thing
30:02 - when you finish the mission basically
30:03 - you go on to the next stage right
30:05 - whatever
30:06 - so we need to finish this i'll say when
30:09 - the
30:12 - mission complete
30:15 - you are going to say stop
30:19 - i love script in the sprite
30:22 - so select this not a script in the
30:24 - sprite
30:26 - and then we are going to hide it
30:29 - okay so that will just clean that up
30:34 - okay i want to test it out
30:37 - uh what i'm going to do is going to hide
30:39 - this one so
30:40 - uh let me push number five so you can
30:43 - see
30:47 - the photo spinning on top so what we
30:49 - need to do is we can make him kind of go
30:51 - up like this
30:52 - okay so what we need to do is we're
30:54 - going to go back to the among us sprite
30:59 - okay so what we want to do
31:02 - is okay
31:06 - when we receive the uh cast portal spell
31:09 - right with the portal spell
31:12 - uh there's a couple of things so one
31:15 - thing we want to do
31:17 - is gonna say
31:22 - no
31:28 - something like that whatever
31:31 - i will do it for three seconds
31:34 - then i'm gonna duplicate this also
31:37 - so we want to make it glide
31:43 - so we're gonna glide four seconds i'm
31:46 - gonna go somewhere
31:48 - like to the portal instead of here right
31:49 - you need to actually have the
31:51 - the location of portal right wherever
31:53 - the sprite is
31:54 - so you say go here for the sensing
32:00 - take this
32:03 - select the uh
32:07 - the portal yes yes photo spell so not
32:11 - not this portal but this one okay and
32:14 - then you say x position yep
32:16 - that's that's good duplicate this again
32:21 - go to the y position so basically it's
32:25 - going to fly up
32:26 - toward wherever that is we'll put four
32:27 - seconds so this will glide up toward it
32:31 - and then we're gonna duplicate one more
32:33 - of this
32:36 - so while this is doing this is also
32:38 - doing something and then this one is
32:40 - waiting for it
32:40 - okay so what we want to do is just say
32:43 - wait
32:47 - wait until and then you can say
32:54 - touching
32:58 - or spell okay
33:01 - control repeat 10 times
33:05 - and then you can use the ghost effect
33:12 - by 10 so 10 times 10 is 100 right so
33:15 - that will
33:15 - make them invisible we'll do a weight
33:20 - of 0.1
33:27 - and then we want to play that recording
33:30 - sound
33:33 - and then we'll work out the message
33:36 - complete right
33:39 - okay so let's try again so let's put him
33:42 - back down here
33:44 - and try to cast number five so let's say
33:47 - we move him
33:47 - like here right so the power will come a
33:49 - little bit here so let's try again
33:51 - number five
33:53 - [Music]
33:56 - so you see how he flew up and it's gone
33:59 - and then the
34:00 - cape turned back looks good so far
34:04 - okay so next we'll work on the hulk's
34:06 - hand
34:07 - uh so actually i had two different hand
34:10 - here
34:10 - left and right actually when i was i had
34:14 - to flip it over
34:15 - to make it like a one like this side and
34:17 - then the other one is this side
34:19 - because uh when i download it i only
34:21 - have one side
34:23 - so if i was using a like uh like
34:26 - like similar to a lightsaber like left
34:28 - and right facing
34:29 - it doesn't look good the hand doesn't
34:31 - look good so that's why i have the
34:32 - duplicate two hands
34:33 - so anyway i'll show you the code for one
34:35 - hand and then you guys can work on the
34:37 - code for the next hand okay
34:39 - so we're gonna do the left hand
34:42 - so um okay
34:45 - so when the green flag is clicked
34:49 - we want to hide it okay so always want
34:51 - to do that
34:52 - so okay and then we say
34:55 - when
34:59 - number six
35:03 - let's click press that is the
35:07 - end and then
35:10 - so this is left so point to
35:13 - 90. okay
35:17 - and then we'll say if
35:23 - uh similar to that what we had before
35:26 - right and then we need to use the n
35:28 - operator here
35:31 - and operator and we'll use the knot
35:35 - uh then we'll be using not okay
35:41 - [Music]
35:42 - variable
35:44 - no yes okay
35:47 - we'll drop this one here
35:51 - we might zoom out okay and then we
35:56 - say
36:04 - and the direction of psi n is less than
36:07 - zero so that means you will know that
36:09 - he's facing this side
36:11 - so i'll go to sensing
36:15 - get this put this here
36:18 - select cyan and then it says direction
36:22 - okay so basically this it's
36:25 - not no no dialog is in progress and it's
36:28 - facing this side then you can
36:30 - execute this code so for the right hand
36:32 - you just do it the opposite
36:34 - right greater than okay
36:37 - all right so you say go to
36:43 - go to cyan and then
36:46 - we say set the x
36:50 - ends we're going to say set the y
36:54 - um or we can just say um yeah i think
36:57 - this is probably better yeah let's do
36:59 - set x and y
37:01 - let's duplicate this and we are going to
37:05 - use the operator
37:07 - so this we're going to do the minus
37:10 - because it's going to go on the left
37:11 - side right
37:12 - so we're going to do the minus
37:15 - so this minus what i had is 80 you can
37:19 - adjust it so i found that 80 is good
37:22 - so that's why i had it like that
37:26 - and this one is the wide position we
37:28 - can't make him go up a little bit so
37:30 - we're going to use
37:31 - plus so this will make
37:35 - this is the y this is the x position
37:38 - so this is like the x position minus 80.
37:41 - so he's already facing left
37:42 - so minus 80 the hand will be on this
37:45 - side and then this is the y position we
37:47 - want to make the hand clock
37:48 - here
37:49 - [Music]
37:52 - okay so drop this inside here
37:56 - and you say go to the front layer so
38:00 - it doesn't cut i covered by anything
38:02 - show
38:04 - and then what we want to show we're
38:06 - going to do a little wait before we
38:08 - smash the hand down
38:11 - 0.5 and then we'll say
38:16 - broadcast
38:20 - right here no message
38:26 - up smash left
38:29 - so this is the left hand so
38:32 - we're gonna go to code that say
38:38 - um smash left
38:42 - or do a repeat
38:45 - 10 times and we're going to turn this
38:48 - way right
38:51 - and 10 degree so the hand will kind of
38:53 - fall down like that
38:55 - okay and we'll say wait for one second
39:00 - and then we're gonna hide the hand okay
39:03 - so now let's try it out
39:06 - so here um
39:09 - stop it so let's go back to
39:14 - the beginning right
39:15 - [Music]
39:17 - so let's try the hand works six
39:21 - so you can see right so if i do this it
39:24 - doesn't work on the left side trying to
39:25 - hit it it won't go
39:26 - only on the right side i mean uh right
39:29 - i'm facing left side
39:31 - but i'm doing right side i'm trying to
39:33 - hit the handle because of the
39:35 - condition here so when you do the right
39:37 - side you have to change the condition
39:39 - and change this you can look at my share
39:42 - code
39:42 - okay all right so this is the hand
39:45 - walking now whether
39:47 - make him die right after the hulk can
39:49 - smash him
39:51 - so we'll change the code there
39:54 - okay so let's drag this
39:58 - event
40:02 - so hulk smash left
40:06 - okay we are gonna have to wait until
40:12 - we until and then this is touching
40:17 - [Music]
40:21 - touching hook left left hand
40:24 - okay and then say if
40:31 - we'll do the f condition here
40:36 - okay and then you say
40:40 - so one check of the actually the the guy
40:43 - is already
40:44 - um you know um we have the uh
40:47 - dead so we'll make sure like if the
40:51 - if this guy is dead or not so if he
40:53 - already died you smash him again it will
40:54 - not
40:55 - you know do anything so what we say
40:58 - we want to get this knot
41:02 - and then we are going to use something
41:04 - called contain
41:07 - so contain basically like like you see
41:10 - apple right contain a
41:12 - that's true right because apple has a
41:14 - letter a if you say contain
41:16 - b like this then that's false
41:20 - because apple doesn't have a letter b
41:22 - right so all we're gonna check the name
41:25 - all right the custom name
41:31 - okay what's the name custom name
41:35 - select name so we say contain
41:38 - dead so what happened is you see your id
41:42 - sorry red red red
41:44 - and then there's red dead so we're gonna
41:46 - switch it to this
41:47 - and then there's pink and then you have
41:49 - pink dead right so that's what we try to
41:51 - do
41:52 - okay let's go back to the code so we say
41:56 - not
41:56 - dead and we want to say switch
42:02 - costume okay but we need to join
42:06 - so because we want to join the name
42:08 - right
42:11 - of that among us right and we have the
42:14 - variable i remember in the beginning
42:16 - we're using a variable
42:18 - right in the beginning
42:24 - okay so we'll continue here we'll move
42:27 - this guy in here
42:29 - and we want to do the join of the among
42:32 - us
42:32 - um current among us and
42:36 - dead so if that hit
42:39 - will change to that and then we'll say
42:43 - play the sound
42:46 - until done then we'll say wait
42:51 - one second and then we'll broadcast
42:54 - mission complete
43:00 - okay so let's try it out and see if it
43:03 - works
43:04 - okay okay let's run this game again
43:09 - so so let's see
43:12 - so we can only smash it on this side
43:15 - so you can see oh it's dead definitely
43:18 - dead
43:18 - right so so you see it's not making any
43:22 - noise
43:23 - you can smash it on this side only this
43:25 - side you can smash okay
43:27 - so you can go in so that looks correct
43:31 - see oh we did not clear the custom you
43:33 - see that that's messed up
43:35 - so let's fix that
43:39 - okay so we actually need to add some
43:41 - code here to fix this
43:43 - actually so here we are going to drag
43:46 - this code here switch
43:48 - costume and we're going to drag this one
43:52 - here this variable
43:55 - i want to put it just before this next
43:57 - costume okay
43:59 - okay now let's try it again
44:02 - okay let's see if it works this time
44:04 - hopefully it works so we'll smash him
44:08 - and then we'll go to the door
44:12 - and next yep looks good
44:15 - we'll do number five which is dr strange
44:19 - portal
44:20 - all right let him go away and then
44:24 - we can go in right number three
44:28 - daniel's hand gauntlet that's working
44:31 - fine
44:33 - uh and then number four this is a
44:36 - lifesaver
44:37 - that looks a little bit messed up we
44:39 - might want to adjust that ring a little
44:41 - bit higher
44:44 - okay i think my lifesaver is fine i
44:46 - think when i was doing the
44:48 - lightsaber and then i change this switch
44:51 - it like this
44:51 - now it looks like it's fine okay
44:55 - okay i think that's fine okay so
45:00 - i think this is working fine let's just
45:02 - run through real quick
45:04 - i think at the end it kicks him out
45:06 - let's see
45:08 - oh man i wanted to finish quick
45:11 - it's getting too long on this video
45:14 - so we'll go in
45:18 - and then this
45:22 - okay that's fine
45:25 - that's fine
45:33 - [Music]
45:35 - okay and then they vote for the grey guy
45:38 - and grace gonna get kicked out
45:43 - and then let's just see oops see this is
45:46 - messed up
45:47 - so see uh when i change the star i
45:51 - need to hide all this thing so what we
45:53 - want to do is
45:57 - when when the backdrop
46:01 - change the star
46:05 - so add that change the star
46:10 - say hi
46:15 - right so we want to hide this next is we
46:18 - want to hide the
46:19 - blue guy so drag this to the blue guy
46:24 - right we also want to hide the uh
46:28 - the uh was it the green guy
46:31 - okay i'm gonna hide the brown one
46:36 - i wanna hide the purple
46:39 - you wanna hide the table
46:43 - and we want to hide the gray
46:47 - so so far we have all this now let's try
46:49 - it again with the star
46:54 - right um so we
46:57 - can go and take this
47:02 - star let's try it again click on this
47:05 - so you can see right these guys are all
47:07 - gone also
47:08 - we need to hide this list also and get
47:11 - to the star right
47:12 - so wherever we're showing the list let's
47:15 - that
47:17 - so let's stop this so wherever we're
47:19 - showing the list
47:21 - right so you see we have we have the
47:24 - sign coming in
47:25 - so we're gonna have to show the table
47:27 - again right
47:29 - so after we hide the table we went to
47:31 - backdrop number six right
47:34 - so we're gonna show the cyan
47:39 - so backdrop number six
47:42 - we are going to show the table
47:46 - and also when we have the star i want to
47:48 - hide this list
47:50 - and hide the variable right while we
