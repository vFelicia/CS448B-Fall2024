00:04 - welcome to loop land let's learn about
00:07 - the times loop
00:10 - the times loop repeats code for you
00:13 - isn't that cool
00:14 - use it when the monkey will be repeating
00:16 - the same actions over and over again
00:20 - this is how you write the times loop
00:23 - first you have to decide how many times
00:24 - you want to loop your code
00:27 - and
00:28 - whatever number that is you put it in
00:30 - for x
00:32 - period
00:33 - the word times
00:35 - space
00:36 - dash greater than sign you see how the
00:39 - dash greater than sign looks like an
00:41 - arrow
00:42 - and then underneath you put all the
00:44 - commands you'd like to loop on make sure
00:46 - you indent those commands and you do
00:49 - that by using the tab key on your
00:51 - keyboard
00:52 - or you can use four spaces
00:56 - let's look at the times loop in action
00:59 - here's a challenge that probably looks
01:01 - familiar to you
01:03 - we want the monkey to collect these
01:05 - three bananas and it looks like there's
01:07 - a sort of pattern here
01:09 - but if we were to coat it sequentially
01:13 - we would
01:15 - let's see what do we want the monkey to
01:16 - do first we want the monkey to turn left
01:20 - and then step 15. that gets us to the
01:24 - first banana next we would
01:27 - turn left again
01:30 - and step 15.
01:32 - that gets us to the second one and then
01:35 - we'll turn left
01:37 - and step 15 to get to that last banana
01:42 - okay let's make sure this works
01:47 - [Music]
01:53 - okay
01:54 - it works but we want to use a loop
01:57 - instead
01:58 - so
01:59 - um
02:00 - let's see we've we've repeated the turn
02:03 - left step 15 three times
02:07 - so what we could do is just have one
02:10 - occurrence of that pattern
02:13 - and put that one occurrence into a times
02:16 - loop
02:18 - okay by default it's giving us the three
02:22 - which is exactly what we want
02:24 - but if we wanted to loop let's say five
02:27 - times we would just change that to a
02:28 - five
02:30 - but we want it to loop three times
02:33 - now
02:36 - you see how the turn left is indented
02:38 - but the step 15 isn't
02:41 - what would happen if we did that if we
02:43 - just ran the code like that
02:46 - ah the monkey
02:48 - turned the monkey turned left three
02:51 - times and then
02:53 - ran the step 15.
02:56 - now sometimes you want code like that
02:59 - you want to have a loop and then you
03:00 - want to do something afterwards and
03:02 - that's how you would do it but in this
03:04 - case
03:06 - we want
03:08 - to do both of those commands in the loop
03:11 - so i want both commands indented
03:14 - so now if i run it
03:18 - it will turn left in step 15
03:22 - three times
03:24 - very good and we get our three stars yay
03:30 - okay very nice
03:32 - so that's the times loop now it's your
03:35 - turn to use the times loop good luck
