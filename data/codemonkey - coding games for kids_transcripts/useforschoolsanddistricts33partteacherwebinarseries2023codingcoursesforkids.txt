00:02 - hi everyone my name is uh Zach izakow I
00:06 - am the VP of sales at code monkey before
00:09 - I get started here just going to share
00:11 - my screen
00:15 - uh Tyler we can you can see my screen
00:21 - yes I can okay so welcome everyone uh
00:24 - this webinar it's a half hour webinar
00:27 - we'll get you out at uh 3 P.M Eastern
00:30 - Standard Time or wherever else you may
00:32 - be in the United States
00:35 - um we are on our third webinar the final
00:39 - uh series we've done a couple of them
00:41 - which I'll discuss in a second this one
00:43 - is specifically Code Monkey for schools
00:46 - and districts uh so welcome everyone
00:49 - we're really excited about this we've
00:50 - had a couple good webinars and now we're
00:52 - on our third and final one at least for
00:55 - these uh these these short webinars just
00:58 - to introduce myself again uh I'm Zach uh
01:02 - VP of sales at Code Monkey been working
01:04 - here for a number of years started to
01:06 - hear I think this will be my sixth
01:09 - theoret Code Monkey really looking
01:10 - forward to uh
01:12 - um
01:13 - presenting all of you uh specifically on
01:16 - this topic and then I'll let my
01:18 - colleague introduce himself as well
01:24 - Tyler maybe you gotta unmute yourself
01:27 - yep that's what you have to do so my
01:29 - name is
01:31 - um I've been with Code Monkey for
01:33 - several years now I'm a regional sales
01:36 - manager
01:38 - um just here to assist Zach there's any
01:40 - q a we'd love uh if you guys have any
01:42 - questions feel free to let us know and
01:45 - I'm looking forward to the presentation
01:47 - side Perfect all right so uh just so
01:50 - everyone should know if you have any
01:52 - questions you can always write on the um
01:55 - the the chat or the I'm pretty sure the
01:58 - Q a and Tyler will answer uh through
02:00 - writing and then maybe we'll deal if
02:02 - there's time for questions at the end
02:04 - um we'll do that so
02:08 - here's the uh the agenda for today so
02:12 - we're going to be looking at
02:14 - um what do we do the past
02:16 - webinars Tyler gave the one previously
02:19 - and then the one before that was given
02:20 - by by Molly then we're gonna figure out
02:24 - why why is coding in schools and I guess
02:26 - in districts hard
02:27 - how does coder monkeys support teachers
02:30 - our curriculum the weekly schedule and
02:33 - the admin dashboard
02:35 - um the focus of this particular webinar
02:41 - if I had to give it a slogan or a line
02:44 - is how to systematically implement a k
02:48 - to eight computer science program so
02:51 - whether you're a small school a large
02:54 - school a small District a large District
02:56 - or anything in between
02:58 - We Believe at code monkey and I'm sure
03:01 - many of you those of you who are joining
03:03 - in around the United States believe
03:05 - that computer science coding and I'll
03:08 - use those two words interchangeably
03:11 - believe that computer science should be
03:15 - taught as a subject just like you would
03:18 - be teaching any other topic whether it
03:21 - is English language math science history
03:24 - geography so on and so forth
03:27 - the way that coding has been done I
03:29 - would say in the last five six years
03:32 - has been done more sporadically you'll
03:34 - have a teacher here use this program
03:36 - another teacher there this and it's sort
03:38 - of been great as the computer science
03:41 - education has developed and improved
03:43 - throughout the United States it's very
03:46 - important additionally
03:48 - that now that we're growing in this
03:51 - space that we become a little bit more
03:52 - organized we come a little bit more
03:54 - systematic and do it in a way that
03:57 - really suits the needs of an institution
03:59 - because now are the teachers on the
04:02 - ground as well as those who are leading
04:04 - whether principals or superintendents or
04:06 - directors of curriculum they're also
04:09 - looking they're also looking at computer
04:12 - science in that way and that's what I
04:14 - want to show you how Code Monkey does
04:16 - that as well
04:17 - so before going into it before going
04:20 - into it what is Code Monkey so first and
04:24 - foremost Code Monkey is a leading coding
04:27 - program for students I personally like
04:29 - to use the term curriculum uh where a
04:32 - curriculum for kids all over the world
04:35 - um just a little couple things over here
04:37 - were made with schools and teachers in
04:40 - mind standards aligned
04:43 - um curriculum as well as a full K
04:45 - curriculum and the no prior coding
04:48 - experience needed to teach these are
04:49 - sort of like our four main added values
04:52 - pieces over here
04:54 - um and the idea there is we're going to
04:58 - show you how code monkey and these four
05:01 - specific aspects really impacts and
05:04 - allows you as a school or District to
05:07 - implement computer science in a real
05:09 - organized and systematic way
05:11 - so
05:12 - why is coding schools in heart
05:15 - what's Difficult about it why can't we
05:17 - just begin it why is it taking schools
05:20 - and districts years to properly
05:23 - implement the program
05:24 - and I would say the number one issue
05:27 - which in my time here at code monkey and
05:29 - I'm sure Tyler would say the same
05:31 - um and many of you is that there's a
05:33 - lack of teachers and I always joke you
05:37 - know computer science is a four-year
05:39 - degree in University or if you're doing
05:41 - now boot camps or anything like that
05:43 - it's like 10 months intensive full-time
05:46 - so teachers who are trained in history
05:49 - Math Science and all of the other
05:51 - subjects who are now being required to
05:54 - teach computer science we're asking
05:57 - really such a challenging thing for
06:00 - teachers to do and I've seen this
06:02 - teachers on the ground it doesn't matter
06:03 - if they're first starting or they've
06:05 - been teaching for 40 years they're all
06:06 - in the same place to ask teachers to
06:08 - learn not just to be able to teach a new
06:10 - topic but to learn an entire
06:13 - University degree is an extremely
06:16 - challenging task for schools all over
06:20 - the globe
06:21 - and that's very that's something which
06:23 - we see day in and day out and something
06:25 - which Tyler in his in his previous
06:27 - webinar really focused which we're not
06:30 - going to do today we'll talk about it a
06:32 - bit but a major Focus was on the teacher
06:34 - platform
06:36 - um and we'll send out that webinar as
06:38 - well will be on our website and you'll
06:39 - be able to access it next is timing in
06:42 - the weekly schedule there are states and
06:45 - meaning I don't know where everyone is
06:47 - from here today but there are states
06:49 - that are now for example in New York
06:51 - requiring that students learn K-12
06:54 - computer science but if it's not a
06:56 - requirement or even if it's something
06:58 - new where do you find time in the weekly
07:00 - schedule to do it
07:02 - so then let's see if you find teachers
07:03 - or you find timing which curriculum
07:06 - there's Code Monkey there's this there's
07:07 - that there's what the standards are
07:09 - there's so much and how do you choose
07:12 - which is the right one and then what I
07:14 - always like to talk about and I think
07:16 - it's something really important I think
07:17 - it's something that we always have to
07:19 - keep in mind because as Educators and I
07:21 - spent you know roughly 10 years in the
07:24 - classroom we have to think of the
07:25 - students we really have to think of the
07:27 - students and and if there's one thing
07:29 - that I can say absolutely about Code
07:31 - Monkey is they are we are student
07:34 - focused from the get-go meaning that we
07:37 - started off with a game-based computer
07:39 - science course now we're a full
07:41 - curriculum which I'll talk about but
07:43 - that's really where we Thrive and that's
07:45 - really what we try to do is solve that
07:48 - last part that's what we tried to solve
07:50 - first is coding's hard how do we get
07:52 - students to learn okay we created Code
07:53 - Monkey it doesn't seem so hard for
07:55 - students anymore with our program so
07:59 - now
08:00 - again you uh Tyler went a lot more in
08:03 - depth in the previous uh webinar but
08:06 - this is a major aspect when we're
08:09 - talking about how do we get
08:13 - um teachers how do we Implement a
08:15 - computer science program in a really
08:17 - organized way
08:19 - it really focuses and starts and ends
08:23 - with the teachers those are on the
08:25 - ground those are in front of the
08:26 - students
08:27 - and what we have done at Code Monkey is
08:28 - unbelievable we have created a platform
08:31 - a user experience for teachers despite
08:36 - their backgrounds we have have had
08:38 - teachers who are computer science
08:40 - experts they're teaching hundreds and
08:42 - hundreds of students within the district
08:43 - and we have some teachers who've never
08:46 - even thought about coding before and
08:48 - have started teaching it and have done
08:49 - so successfully and we have an entire
08:52 - dashboard again which I'm not going to
08:54 - focus on very much but again you could
08:58 - see the recording they're very short
08:59 - webinars 30 minutes we have lesson plans
09:02 - video tutorials we have everything
09:05 - technology wise and I'll show you here
09:08 - just a little bit this is our teacher
09:10 - dashboard we have
09:12 - all the lesson plans we have solutions
09:15 - to every single challenge that we have
09:18 - in each of our course we have video
09:20 - tutorials
09:21 - um in terms of the actual functionality
09:24 - we
09:25 - um have the ability to easily add
09:28 - classes to get into classes to see
09:31 - um where students are limit progress we
09:33 - have
09:34 - um answers also over here if I click
09:36 - over here it'll take me to a three-star
09:38 - solution which gives me the actual
09:40 - answer we have quizzes proficiency
09:44 - reports automated grading again not
09:46 - gonna go too much into it but what we
09:49 - have done is we have seriously focused
09:52 - after we we created our first few
09:54 - courses we realized okay we we've
09:57 - created something really great for
09:58 - students
10:00 - um and again in our I'm not going
10:01 - through our courses or showing that
10:03 - because in our first session with Molly
10:06 - um we went all into our courses and
10:08 - again that will be on our website and
10:09 - we'll share that afterwards
10:11 - um but what we have done here is on the
10:15 - tech side of it the technology we have
10:17 - automated everything from grading to
10:20 - videos to quizzes everything we've
10:23 - automated so that the teacher does not
10:26 - have to focus on the technology we
10:28 - realized very early on that if we can
10:31 - get the tech side of it to be automated
10:34 - now let's try to focus on the pedagogy
10:36 - and ensure that our teachers who despite
10:39 - the record know how to teach and so we
10:41 - created lesson plans video tutorials
10:44 - um little little short videos everything
10:46 - in order to help the teacher
10:48 - but more than that if I would continue
10:52 - the lack of teachers very much leads
10:55 - into professional development and Code
10:58 - Monkey is has created a professional
11:00 - development plan which we have we've
11:04 - suggested various types of
11:06 - um
11:07 - professional development options it
11:09 - could be webinars it could be short
11:11 - 45 minute PE sessions through the year
11:13 - you know the more focused one is
11:18 - um
11:19 - the the most focused one is maybe heavy
11:22 - PD in the summer which we know a lot of
11:25 - schools and districts do a lot of times
11:27 - I even suggest don't do any PD in your
11:31 - first year take the take the curriculum
11:34 - use it get re get ready for it learn how
11:38 - it goes and then after that in your next
11:41 - year when you realize when everyone
11:42 - understands the technology whenever
11:43 - anyone's on board or when you've done
11:45 - all that work then you can focus on PD
11:48 - additionally in a regular Code Monkey
11:50 - subscription there's already PD um Tyler
11:53 - showed this in the last one but if I go
11:56 - over here there's an asynchronous
11:59 - um asynchronous
12:01 - uh recording of a introduction to text
12:05 - based computer science which I'll talk
12:07 - about we have an entire page dedicated
12:09 - to webinars which all of our webinars as
12:11 - you can see will be posted up there and
12:14 - so on and so forth talking about
12:16 - technology maybe pedagogical so just
12:19 - built within our Code Monkey
12:21 - subscription you already have
12:23 - professional development options and
12:25 - it's so easy for teachers it really
12:28 - really is
12:29 - so when we're talking about how can we
12:31 - Implement a district-wide or school-wide
12:34 - computer science
12:36 - curriculum program however you want to
12:38 - define it you need to think of the
12:40 - teachers in Code Monkey very very early
12:43 - on like seven eight years ago has
12:45 - already started focusing on how we can
12:48 - make this best for every single teacher
12:52 - now I have to go into the curriculum now
12:55 - I mentioned how do you well when the
12:57 - hard things was how do we choose the
12:58 - curriculum and all that but I would even
13:00 - step
13:01 - take a step back and tell you that many
13:05 - of your teachers on the ground and a lot
13:07 - of you know this there's a lot of
13:08 - computer science coding programs
13:11 - curriculum maybe there are
13:13 - Hardware software a mix of everything
13:16 - and the question which you have to think
13:18 - about is what is an activity what is a
13:22 - program and what is a curriculum
13:25 - a connectivity or a program
13:27 - I would say is what's been happening the
13:31 - past few years teacher finds something
13:34 - that they really like they think it
13:35 - would be engaging to the kids so they
13:37 - bring it into the classroom and they use
13:39 - it twice in the year great check mark
13:41 - you've done coding
13:44 - that's not how we learn that's maybe how
13:46 - you get kids excited and I'm not
13:47 - downplaying those programs activities at
13:50 - all in fact there are many schools and
13:52 - districts that use Code Monkey as well
13:54 - as other maybe Hardware activities which
13:57 - are once or twice that they can pull it
13:59 - out
14:00 - um every single time maybe that there is
14:01 - a a extra time during the day or
14:04 - anything but curriculum that's the term
14:06 - that's the language we want to use when
14:08 - it comes to computer science we don't
14:10 - want to use activity we don't want to
14:12 - use program just like when we're talking
14:14 - about English or Spanish or math we use
14:17 - curriculum and what I'm showing you here
14:20 - just a couple of awards that we have won
14:23 - across the globe and I don't say this as
14:27 - like an ego boost to Code Monkey even
14:29 - though it sort of is
14:30 - I say that because the experts in
14:34 - computer science
14:35 - around the world
14:37 - have recognized Code Monkey
14:40 - as a leading computer science curriculum
14:43 - globally and that is really important
14:46 - it's very important because I've been I
14:49 - mean I'll be at iste and I hope everyone
14:51 - here if you're going to iste in
14:53 - Philadelphia in a few weeks you'll join
14:55 - us uh you'll come to our booth
14:57 - and I see when the when those who have
14:59 - learned computer science they see it and
15:02 - they instantly realize wow this is
15:04 - something unique this is something
15:06 - special this is something different and
15:09 - I'll explain why we're a full K8
15:12 - curriculum
15:13 - we go all the way from kindergarten with
15:16 - pretty simple easy to use courses
15:20 - all the way up to python courses which
15:22 - are quite difficult
15:23 - and this is a major difference in terms
15:26 - of what we are doing at code monkey
15:28 - versus what's happening maybe with some
15:31 - other programs and again no idea to
15:32 - compare contrast just trying to talk
15:34 - about the value of Code Monkey
15:37 - when you're looking at your curriculum
15:39 - for your school or District
15:41 - what's happening and I I don't know
15:43 - everyone's background here
15:45 - so I'm going to assume it's a little bit
15:47 - more that you would unknow what block
15:50 - based coding is I would say roughly
15:53 - between 90 to 95 of computer science
15:57 - maybe curriculum program activities
15:59 - whatever you want to say for the K to
16:01 - six
16:02 - is block based meaning it's the drag and
16:04 - dropping of code
16:06 - that's really really important there's
16:09 - no doubt about that
16:11 - but the question is until when do you do
16:13 - block based coding so Code Monkey
16:16 - meaning if I go to our courses you can
16:19 - see on our on our platform
16:21 - we have block based coding we have block
16:23 - based coding novice beginner but then
16:26 - you'll see that it's text-based coding
16:28 - and what does that look like so again
16:30 - not to delve into it because we've
16:32 - already done this but just to show you
16:36 - if I were to go and this is our courses
16:38 - and I'll get into sort of the students
16:41 - oh this is not a good example sorry
16:44 - let's just uh pick you over here
16:48 - the students over here they're writing a
16:50 - loop so let's say if they're writing
16:54 - over here
16:55 - um Step 13 turn right what you see is
16:58 - students are actually writing code as
17:02 - opposed to block based coding and that's
17:04 - really significant in terms of what we
17:06 - are doing
17:07 - and this is why it's really important I
17:10 - read today just as an example
17:12 - um csta and co.org they launch a every
17:17 - year a
17:18 - a yearly
17:20 - um CS overview of all of the United
17:22 - States and I I read today specifically
17:24 - like in terms of Connecticut five
17:27 - percent of high school students in
17:29 - Connecticut take computer science
17:31 - courses
17:32 - and the reason is because not enough
17:34 - students are probably doing it in
17:36 - elementary school but more than that
17:39 - even if they are doing in the middle in
17:41 - elementary middle school what are they
17:43 - doing if they're doing block based
17:44 - coding courses when they get to high
17:46 - school and they have to take AP Computer
17:48 - Science courses or maybe not even AP but
17:51 - regular computer science courses they're
17:54 - really really behind because
17:56 - the best example I always like to give
17:58 - is it's like you're teaching a language
18:00 - English Spanish whatever it may be if
18:03 - you took kindergarten in grade 8 and you
18:06 - only taught students grammar and then
18:08 - you get into ninth grade and you say go
18:10 - write an essay right
18:13 - um
18:14 - you say go write an essay
18:16 - they'll be like we've never written an
18:18 - essay we just learned about essays we
18:20 - learned grammar we learned exclamation
18:23 - points and verb but all of that
18:25 - but if they've never written
18:27 - then they're gonna have a very hard time
18:29 - in high school writing an essay and
18:30 - that's very much our belief in Code
18:32 - Monkey we want to make sure students are
18:36 - progressing year after year after year
18:38 - just like they are doing with other
18:40 - subjects math science again I'll sort of
18:43 - stress that that's extremely important
18:45 - to us
18:46 - we do not want to continue our students
18:49 - on block based coding when they're in
18:51 - Middle School
18:52 - right if they're doing that that's great
18:54 - but then the idea it's not great it's
18:56 - it's good that they're doing that as
18:57 - opposed to nothing but then where's the
19:00 - organization there where's the
19:01 - systematic approach there where is the
19:04 - thought processes in terms of ensuring
19:06 - that by the time they get to high school
19:08 - they're prepared like they are in other
19:10 - subjects and that's why our curriculum
19:13 - is extremely important right so when
19:16 - you're choosing a curriculum you have to
19:18 - think what curriculum prepares students
19:21 - for high school what curriculum takes
19:24 - students from kindergarten and ensures
19:25 - that they're progressing and building on
19:28 - their theoretical knowledge as well as
19:30 - their skill set year after year after
19:32 - year and that's what Code Monkey is
19:34 - doing so when you're thinking about your
19:36 - school or District that in terms of
19:38 - curriculum you have to be thinking how
19:40 - are the students progressing are they
19:42 - going to be ready for ischool and even
19:44 - more so and this may be this could be a
19:47 - school and a district are all the
19:49 - students learning the same thing are you
19:51 - giving them equal opportunity right if
19:54 - you have some students in schools in one
19:56 - area only doing Block Base and other
19:59 - schools doing Tech space the students
20:01 - who are doing text-based coding writing
20:03 - code and learning how to code are going
20:04 - to be way more advanced when you choose
20:07 - a curriculum for your school or for your
20:10 - District you're providing equal
20:11 - opportunity to all schools all students
20:15 - in terms of giving them the proper
20:17 - Computer Science Education
20:20 - and again I'm not I'm not there's we
20:22 - have 10 minutes here so uh I'll get to
20:24 - everything yeah I would be remiss if I
20:27 - talked about curriculum and don't talk
20:28 - about our our courses and and again we
20:31 - we did this
20:32 - so much in in one of them like you could
20:34 - see every one of our courses are our
20:36 - gamified and I I want to be very clear
20:38 - we do not have games Code Monkey is not
20:41 - a game code monkey has courses that are
20:44 - gamified and there's a very big
20:46 - difference there when you play a game
20:48 - you may learn you may not learn when
20:50 - you're doing a course you're learning
20:52 - the gamification in what we are doing is
20:57 - bringing the students in it's engaging
20:58 - them it's created in a way that is so
21:02 - special for them and so easy and
21:03 - intuitive
21:05 - they learn
21:06 - through osmosis they learn through play
21:08 - they learn just by doing and that's a
21:11 - very very unique aspect and I could even
21:13 - push it so far and I don't want to jump
21:15 - into this too much
21:17 - but
21:18 - we ventured this year out of coding we
21:22 - created two digital literacy courses
21:24 - which you can see on a Code Monkey Trial
21:27 - on www.codemonkey.com
21:30 - um
21:31 - digital literacy courses but in the Code
21:34 - Monkey way the pedagogy that we've done
21:36 - and this year after one year became our
21:39 - third most used course out of all of our
21:41 - courses because it was such a needed
21:44 - course but we were able to take that
21:46 - pedagogy this gamification these aspects
21:48 - and apply it to the field of
21:52 - technology digital literacy we have a
21:54 - digital use and a digital citizenship
21:57 - course
21:58 - but we did it in the Code Monkey way and
22:00 - it is unbelievable and we're only
22:01 - building on that and so when we talk
22:03 - about curriculum it's not just about
22:06 - you know systematic curriculum equal
22:08 - opportunity all these things are
22:10 - important it's also important about the
22:11 - individual student how are you
22:13 - supporting all of you became teachers
22:16 - Educators principals superintendents
22:18 - because you care about the large school
22:21 - the district but you also care about the
22:23 - individual student and we talk about
22:25 - Code Monkey being hard for students
22:26 - we've really solved that in in one of
22:29 - the most unbelievable Ed Tech or
22:31 - pedagogical ways that they've been just
22:34 - a couple of more things
22:35 - um that I think are just like good
22:36 - things about Code Monkey not you know I
22:39 - think it applies to the you know the
22:41 - what I'm trying to show is why code
22:42 - monkeys breed for schools and districts
22:44 - it's great for individuals or groups
22:47 - you know whether they're you know
22:48 - they're learning in in school by
22:50 - themselves I remember visiting a
22:51 - district in New Jersey where one student
22:54 - was up to challenge 50 another was up to
22:56 - challenge 20 the student and challenge
22:57 - 50 came up helped the student challenge
22:59 - 20. they can learn by themselves it's
23:02 - all web-based you don't need to download
23:03 - anything so students can even do it at
23:05 - home for homework so it's really great
23:09 - um some other things we have courses
23:11 - that you are learning and courses that
23:14 - you are creating I I won't have time to
23:16 - show that but of course is that I know
23:18 - that that's very important to have
23:21 - um results like okay so they're playing
23:23 - this course but how does that show in in
23:25 - in their actual skill sets so we have
23:27 - courses where they're challenge Builder
23:29 - they're building challenges they're
23:30 - building games they've built a chat bot
23:32 - in Python and so on and so forth so we
23:35 - have everything inclusive I think this
23:37 - is cannot be stressed enough I'm very
23:40 - happy to see sort of nowadays that that
23:43 - edtech companies are are becoming more
23:45 - inclusive adding more tools to be more
23:48 - inclusive of different types of students
23:50 - with different learning challenges and
23:52 - different backgrounds and we have a
23:54 - narration tool we have buttons that you
23:56 - know it's not drag and drop but it
23:58 - writes for the students that have a
23:59 - difficult time with maybe some motor
24:01 - functions and we're constantly trying to
24:03 - get better and better at that and I I
24:04 - don't think obviously I think I on a
24:07 - systematic level that is absolutely
24:09 - significant and we're only trying to do
24:11 - better and the more we partner with
24:13 - districts and schools the better
24:15 - feedback we get and the more we try to
24:17 - improve there
24:18 - thankfully this is not as relevant as it
24:21 - used to be but still relevant uh Code
24:23 - Monkey again you don't need to download
24:25 - anything it's all web-based it's
24:27 - fantastic program in school it's a great
24:30 - program outside or even both so if
24:33 - you're a virtual school or if you have
24:34 - virtual Cloud you know it's it's
24:36 - fantastic
24:37 - um have a few minutes here left
24:40 - this is really important and I think I
24:42 - only have a couple more slides and leave
24:44 - a few minutes for questions
24:46 - so if you're embarking
24:48 - on and I I had a meeting today really
24:51 - just an hour ago with a district of five
24:53 - schools that's really looking at
24:55 - improving their uh computer science
24:57 - program
24:59 - it's not mandatory in the state yet but
25:01 - they understand that it will be in a few
25:02 - years and they want to start
25:03 - implementing so how do you do that how
25:05 - do we do that so maybe there's not
25:07 - funding maybe there's not time you you
25:09 - have tax Schedule so these are the sort
25:11 - of if we if you sort of start with the
25:14 - most intensive and go down these are
25:17 - some of my suggestions so this is very
25:19 - um uh common in middle schools and Code
25:22 - Monkey again is K to eight
25:25 - um so we're in elementary and Road
25:26 - school so
25:27 - some do short rotations of six to eight
25:30 - classes throughout the year so maybe not
25:32 - everyone gets throughout the year but if
25:34 - they do eight classes in in in in eight
25:38 - weeks or whatever that may be that gives
25:40 - them you know a lot of time to use it
25:43 - practice go ahead and really build up
25:45 - their skills so that they can get to the
25:46 - next year that may be too much so maybe
25:49 - once per week 45 minutes to an hour
25:52 - once bi-weekly
25:54 - right that that sometimes we have a
25:57 - district with I think something like 75
25:59 - schools that has an after school in each
26:02 - School using Code Monkey and that's only
26:04 - grown and not only that that is probably
26:06 - going to grow and then that's gonna sort
26:08 - of seep into the weekly schedule where
26:11 - it's not going to be after school but
26:12 - it's going to be offered and then lastly
26:14 - and I see this internationally a lot I I
26:17 - you know uh just a little bit up north
26:19 - in Canada this is how they do it in many
26:21 - of their provinces which they integrate
26:23 - coding into their math every year they
26:27 - have like a a two-month coding
26:30 - um
26:31 - uh subject within their math course and
26:34 - that's when they do it and that these
26:36 - are all different ideas and and myself
26:38 - and whoever would be your rep in your
26:40 - state we would be happy to discuss this
26:42 - with you and more in depth and that's
26:44 - also I I didn't put this in the in the
26:46 - slide but very very important with Code
26:49 - Monkey is that every school and District
26:52 - gets a dedicated customer success
26:55 - manager to help you with this how many
26:58 - times a week do you want to do this
27:00 - um all of that and that's that's really
27:03 - important point about Code Monkey which
27:04 - cannot be stressed our customer success
27:06 - people are there for you to ensure the
27:09 - we have a the the curriculum that you
27:12 - can Implement to be systematic encoding
27:14 - in in your District or school they
27:17 - ensure that that happens and now sort of
27:19 - just the last thing and this is really
27:22 - important I left a few minutes for this
27:24 - is our admin dashboard so sort of to
27:27 - show it you in uh in in real time
27:30 - um let me just go back
27:33 - this is an example of our admin
27:35 - dashboard so
27:37 - there are so many aspects to this
27:40 - what is important for administrator
27:43 - whether of a district or of a school so
27:45 - we talked about teachers students we
27:47 - talked about the inclusivity we talked
27:50 - about the importance of curriculum but
27:52 - now we talk about you and your job and
27:54 - ensuring this a success so first of all
27:56 - I think it's really important
27:59 - we have added as I mentioned like 70 we
28:02 - add hundreds of thousands of students we
28:04 - have ministries of Education around the
28:06 - world using our program we have SSO
28:09 - class link clever Microsoft Google to
28:12 - really eliminate any type of issue when
28:16 - it comes to rostering so first and
28:18 - foremost this District that I just spoke
28:21 - to they use Google easy that's really
28:24 - really important we want to make sure
28:25 - that the rostering capabilities of our
28:27 - districts are and schools super super
28:29 - simple additionally we have a scope and
28:33 - sequence and I'm happy to share that we
28:35 - talk about curriculum we have a scope
28:37 - and sequence we which goes K to eight we
28:40 - can tell you how to implement the
28:41 - computer science program per grade we
28:44 - can really consult with you on how to do
28:46 - that properly we have PD options
28:48 - available which I've mentioned before
28:49 - for your teachers but we also have data
28:52 - we can tell you how many schools you
28:53 - have
28:54 - your classrooms this is just our initial
28:57 - and we're constantly improving this this
28:59 - is your dashboard you can see the total
29:01 - sites on minutes the active students how
29:03 - many solutions were submitted how much
29:05 - progress the active classrooms you have
29:07 - your subscription details then you can
29:09 - go into more you can see your schools
29:11 - you can see the names of your schools
29:12 - how many students per School how many
29:15 - teachers per school where are your
29:17 - teachers what are their functionalities
29:19 - you can see all of the classrooms so we
29:22 - have usage reports which
29:25 - um you could see it generate but that
29:26 - would just take a little bit more time
29:27 - we have proficiency reports to see not
29:30 - just how much they're using it but what
29:32 - are the grades that they're getting and
29:33 - so on and so forth we provide the data
29:36 - so that you as an administrator if you
29:39 - choose to do Code Monkey you can make an
29:42 - informed decision the following year is
29:44 - you know is this a good program are we
29:46 - actually using it are teachers using it
29:48 - and we look at this and we say Okay
29:50 - three months into this hey uh
29:52 - administrator from you know there this
29:55 - school district the flower School
29:56 - District there's flowers right in front
29:58 - of me as an example like
30:00 - we see that you know you you purchased
30:02 - for 10 schools but you've only added
30:04 - four we look at that and share that with
30:06 - you so the data that we provide you
30:08 - allows you to see and make sure that
30:09 - it's going well we allow you to do SSO
30:12 - to roster very very easily you can add
30:15 - teachers add students we're aligned this
30:18 - is really important we're aligned with
30:19 - csda and iste and we're aligned I think
30:22 - very with so many states like roughly 60
30:25 - 70 percent of U.S states we have aligned
30:28 - our curriculum to those specific States
30:31 - so all of that really makes it for the
30:35 - administrator really really important
30:38 - that you have the proper tools to have a
30:41 - successful launch of Code Monkey year
30:44 - after year after year so
30:48 - um
30:50 - the benefits and I always like to say
30:53 - this because I think it's really
30:54 - important and I'm sorry I came a couple
30:56 - minutes over
30:57 - great for students make it easy engaging
31:00 - and fun for our teachers it's intuitive
31:02 - so many resources plenty of help on the
31:05 - platform and for administrators the
31:08 - rostering usage reports the data
31:10 - everything it's web-based the rostering
31:12 - when it comes to your school when it
31:14 - comes to your District
31:15 - we make it really really simple to be
31:19 - able to launch a successful computer
31:21 - science K-8 computer science program and
31:24 - that's what we're trying to do
31:26 - um I would say our Niche is those that
31:29 - have done nothing and those that have
31:31 - done a little bit of something and are
31:32 - making their way want to improve that's
31:34 - those are the districts that we've
31:36 - really helped if your District already
31:37 - using something and it's going great I'm
31:39 - sure we could do well for you and I'm
31:41 - sure that would be still we still be a
31:42 - good program but I don't know if you
31:45 - know maybe it'd be great but it's not
31:47 - going to necessarily solve any of the
31:48 - issues if you have everything in place
31:49 - if you're looking to improve if you're
31:51 - looking to upgrade if you're looking to
31:53 - implement if you're looking to really
31:55 - systematically approach computer science
31:57 - like you do other courses Code Monkey
32:00 - solves all of that I really appreciate
32:02 - your time I would suggest either you as
32:05 - an administrator or your teachers going
32:06 - on Code Monkey and signing up for a
32:08 - teacher trial if you're interested in an
32:10 - actual subscription here's an email that
32:12 - you can do and we're launching as of
32:15 - today a special offer that if you get a
32:18 - PO in if we send you a quote and you get
32:21 - a PO signed and you can also sign our
32:22 - quotes you can get a free subscription
32:24 - for the rest of the year
32:26 - um
32:27 - and then next year you'll start your
32:29 - actual subscription so I want to thank
32:31 - you all I appreciate it when a couple
32:33 - minutes over time uh Tyler thank you for
32:36 - your time
32:37 - and um I'm gonna stop sharing and are
32:42 - there any questions
32:46 - wait a a minute or so if there's any
32:48 - questions
32:52 - not seeing any in the chat here
32:55 - I'll allow these individuals to talk if
32:58 - they do have something
33:00 - see here
33:04 - all right all right well thank you very
33:07 - much everyone Tyler again thank you for
33:09 - everyone who who came on
33:11 - um we'll put these recordings all on our
33:14 - webinar page which we will send out to
33:16 - you guys in the next week thank you so
33:18 - much for your time have a great day
