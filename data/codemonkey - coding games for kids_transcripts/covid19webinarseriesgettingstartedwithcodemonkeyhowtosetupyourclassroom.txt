00:03 - okay I wouldn't say first of all welcome
00:06 - to everyone that's joining us today for
00:08 - this really important and hopefully
00:12 - you'll find helpful webinar that it's
00:14 - going to help guide you through these
00:16 - you know very unusual times so just
00:20 - wanted to start by thanking everyone
00:22 - that's joining us thank you I know
00:25 - you're probably at home with pets and
00:28 - spouses and kids so no worries if it
00:32 - gets a little hectic my own dog is here
00:34 - if you hear him barking that's because
00:36 - there's a skateboarder down the street
00:38 - but he's really a nice dog so anyway
00:41 - today's webinar is just going to be
00:44 - getting started with Co monkey and
00:45 - giving you all the confidence or to set
00:48 - up your classroom and hit the ground
00:50 - running
00:51 - during this unusual remote learning time
00:55 - that we find ourselves
00:59 - you
01:03 - before we move on too far I want to
01:05 - point out that if you can follow those
01:09 - pleas across all of our social media
01:11 - channels at code monkey st you our
01:15 - twitter handle we also have our
01:18 - instagram and facebook as well as our
01:22 - blog which you can follow this
01:28 - my name is mark Dozier I work at code
01:30 - monkey with customer success and support
01:34 - I've been with a company for about seven
01:37 - months or so joining me today is analyst
01:43 - we also have Talia who's our head of
01:47 - customer success and Zoe who's our
01:50 - marketing manager they're both joining
01:51 - us from Israel they're also here today
01:54 - to help us with some of your question
01:56 - that that may come up so if you have any
01:59 - questions and you'd like to drop them in
02:01 - our chat box they'll be more than happy
02:03 - to help
02:08 - okay so doing the today's webinar we're
02:12 - going to be looking at what is code
02:14 - lucky all about I will walk you through
02:16 - the teachers home page we'll talk about
02:19 - how to give your students access how to
02:22 - add co-teachers will show you how to
02:26 - create a new classroom or if you already
02:27 - have a class from units from even if
02:30 - it's from a trial I'll show you how to
02:32 - upgraded to an existing one then we'll
02:36 - talk about how to follow your students
02:38 - progress we'll get into the two
02:41 - approaches that you may be finding
02:42 - yourself dealing with whether that self
02:45 - pace or administrating code monkey in a
02:48 - structured way I'll show you some of the
02:50 - teacher resources and then of course at
02:53 - the end we'll save some time for Q&A
02:59 - all right so what is code and lucky as
03:05 - you can see there it's made with
03:06 - teachers schools and teachers in mind I
03:09 - taught myself for 15 years I was a
03:11 - technology director and I use code lucky
03:14 - those last two years
03:15 - so that's part that I appreciate it the
03:18 - most you see that it's stand into line
03:21 - so that's the part that a lot of
03:23 - stakeholders appreciate the most and
03:26 - then as a teacher you'll see here that
03:29 - there's no prior coding experience
03:32 - needed to teach so perhaps that's what
03:34 - you take away from the most as well okay
03:38 - so let's just go ahead get started like
03:40 - all right you got the subscription and
03:42 - where do we begin
03:44 - so after logging in you'll notice it's
03:49 - at the left side here you'll see this
03:53 - main menu where you can navigate between
03:55 - the courses there's some teacher
03:57 - resources there's a classroom dashboard
04:00 - I'm going to start with our courses will
04:03 - briefly here
04:10 - so this is course
04:12 - this is where you as a teacher can
04:15 - access the courses themselves
04:23 - you can also think of this as your
04:26 - personal page so there's no need to set
04:28 - up a separate demo account or teacher
04:31 - account from your classroom this
04:33 - automatic that this is automatically
04:35 - done when your subscription is created
04:41 - we usually recommend that tutors also
04:44 - play the course and unlike your students
04:47 - you are able to skip between the
04:49 - challenges now in tomorrow's webinar
04:51 - what we'll do is we'll review all the
04:53 - available courses and which page level
04:55 - each is suited for but today we'll just
04:58 - sort of show you that where to find them
05:00 - and that they are available for you
05:02 - oh by the way all the courses to have
05:05 - lesson plans that will show you where to
05:08 - locate those at the end of the webinar
05:17 - alright so for those of you that are new
05:20 - to code monkey the first thing you want
05:22 - to do is create a classroom
05:25 - so from that left side panel there upper
05:29 - left side I clicked on my classrooms you
05:31 - see here I already have a demo class of
05:34 - class number one
05:36 - once you create these student accounts
05:39 - as part of the classroom then your
05:42 - students are able to join and play now
05:44 - you can either create a new classroom
05:47 - what's underneath here just click on the
05:49 - button give my class with a name like
05:52 - Period three that I create that
05:58 - classroom or perhaps already have a code
06:01 - monkey classroom setup and what I could
06:05 - do in this case I have expire but my
06:08 - teachers found I was loving it there
06:10 - were seeds and horses what I could do is
06:13 - up create an existing trial by coming
06:18 - over here to the actions part and
06:23 - there's an upward arrow called upgrade
06:26 - subscription I click on that it's going
06:29 - to show me the students that are going
06:31 - to move with this subscription in this
06:33 - case I want all for my students to move
06:35 - continue and then I need to choose the
06:39 - subscription that I want to upgrade to
06:41 - and again for the purposes of this demo
06:45 - I only have one other subscription and
06:47 - that is the public remote learning so
06:50 - I'll click on that
06:53 - and I will click on upgrade and just to
06:57 - make sure that I'm sure that I'm sure
06:58 - that I'm sure I will click on confirm
07:01 - upgrade and so now you see perhaps you
07:07 - notice that this change from teacher
07:10 - trial to the remote learning
07:12 - subscription that we're talking about
07:14 - today all right so I'm gonna click on
07:21 - the class last one that I have and this
07:24 - will be what we refer to as our
07:26 - classroom dashboard and you'll notice
07:29 - there are six tabs up top but to really
07:32 - get started we need to focus on the
07:33 - students tab this is where I can manage
07:37 - a student list so currently I have looks
07:41 - like I have four students enrolled in
07:43 - this class and I'm gonna walk you guys
07:45 - through the steps to adding additional
07:47 - students or to create it from scratch of
07:49 - course just adding students at all so
07:53 - what I'll do here is underneath that
07:55 - last student on the roster click on the
07:57 - add students button
08:00 - here you see I have three ways I could
08:03 - do it create a single account so this
08:05 - would be something that I would do if I
08:08 - had us I was working with a small group
08:09 - of students four five six seven in that
08:13 - case I could create a username and
08:15 - password send that information on to the
08:17 - parents or the students another option
08:21 - would be the bulk upload of students so
08:23 - this is where I would create a CSV file
08:25 - with a larger list of students and again
08:29 - I wouldn't need to share those passwords
08:31 - with the parents or the students and
08:33 - then this third option here is share the
08:37 - class code given the situation that you
08:40 - guys are in with the remote learning
08:43 - this might be the most optimal way of
08:47 - having the students join the classroom
08:50 - let you create so I'll show you that
08:56 - okay so here in the in the box here I
08:59 - see my class code as to f 7h e
09:06 - and so this is the code that I would
09:08 - share with students and then have them
09:11 - input this code to join my classroom so
09:14 - what I'll do now is I'll actually demo
09:17 - what it looks like from the student
09:19 - point of view
09:24 - okay so the kids who come to code monkey
09:28 - comm they're gonna click on sign up now
09:34 - who are you a student
09:39 - do you have a classroom code yes my
09:41 - teacher just shared it with me
09:46 - and this is where I enter that code I
09:48 - know I don't have a super awesome memory
09:50 - I just have it written down somewhere
09:51 - else so you have 7h E and then I click
09:59 - on next
10:02 - okay so this is a point where the
10:05 - students going to create a username and
10:07 - a password again this might be where you
10:10 - want to guide those parents to help the
10:13 - younger students do that I believe we
10:16 - will share a document with you that sort
10:18 - of is geared toward parents that you
10:21 - could provide to the parents look for
10:23 - that in our chat box but in this case
10:28 - I'm just going to make myself a username
10:30 - or supersede password and at this point
10:44 - I'll go ahead and click on sign up and
10:49 - you see here I can download a copy of
10:52 - this information which I could have to
10:55 - refer to later which is very important
10:58 - because Sara my teacher won't be around
10:59 - to help me remember my password so I'll
11:04 - go ahead and click on let's play
11:08 - and then as
11:10 - student you choose your avatar and then
11:14 - join the classroom that you're basically
11:16 - yeah I'm already a part of that
11:18 - classroom but now I just sort of click
11:20 - an avatar save it and then get started
11:23 - on whatever my teacher has assigned for
11:25 - me
11:27 - speaking of we're gonna head back so
11:34 - we've got the classroom set up we've got
11:36 - students in our classroom and what we
11:39 - can do now is move to our second step
11:41 - which is assign the courses so this is
11:43 - where I decide which courses each
11:46 - classroom is going to have access to to
11:49 - do that again back over to the left
11:52 - click on courses
11:56 - you
12:03 - actually let me back up a step here so
12:06 - I'm gonna go back to my classrooms click
12:08 - on the classroom so but I want to point
12:10 - out though I made a mistake there but I
12:12 - will assign those classrooms from within
12:14 - the classroom dashboard so it's one of
12:16 - those six tabs that we talked about so
12:18 - next to the students tab I have the
12:20 - courses and at this point this is where
12:23 - I can assign class so if it's grayed out
12:27 - and it's already been assigned but
12:30 - anything with a green button I can go I
12:31 - click on assign I changed my mind I
12:34 - toggle it back to unassigned and this is
12:38 - where I give the assignments to the CDs
12:40 - I just keep in mind coding of intro part
12:45 - 1 is assigned by default so anything
12:47 - else would need to be assigned by you
12:49 - and if you don't assign it well it will
12:51 - happen it's on the student end they will
12:54 - be blocked from accessing the course
13:01 - okay moving back staying within the
13:04 - classroom dashboard I will head over to
13:07 - the progress tab aka probably your new
13:10 - best friend mark can I jump in
13:13 - absolutely
13:14 - sorry I just I just want I want you to
13:17 - show maybe let's also show them that the
13:19 - option to add a co-teacher from the
13:21 - students tab absolutely thank you
13:24 - all right so back over and the students
13:28 - tab here perhaps you notice earlier when
13:30 - I was showing the stupider below the
13:34 - roster you have the option to add a
13:36 - co-teacher
13:37 - and one of the reasons that you may want
13:40 - to look into adding a co-teacher is
13:41 - because you have a code monkey
13:43 - subscription only only one teacher can
13:48 - be actually connected to that account so
13:50 - once you create classrooms then you're
13:53 - able to add colleagues as Co teachers so
13:56 - I know in some schools they're several
14:00 - or multiple users that are looking to
14:01 - implement code monkey but as far as from
14:05 - a school-wide
14:05 - perspective one person has seen as the
14:09 - admin of that account and then that
14:11 - person can branch off and biko teachers
14:15 - now if you're a co-teacher what do you
14:17 - have access to honestly basically the
14:20 - same thing as a main teacher you
14:22 - wouldn't be able to move students around
14:24 - but as a co teacher you can add students
14:27 - to the classroom you can see their
14:29 - progress you can also assign courses as
14:31 - we talked about and so on
14:34 - so basically all the other abilities
14:36 - that you would have over the classroom
14:38 - and then once you once a co teacher is
14:42 - added to a classroom that classroom will
14:44 - show up and the code monkey or the
14:46 - co-teachers code monkey cop
14:51 - you
14:55 - all right so now what I'll do now is
14:58 - we'll head over to back over to the
15:01 - progress tab Thank You Talia by the way
15:04 - sure
15:10 - okay so in this progress cab which I
15:12 - described is your best friend this is a
15:14 - kind of be like your main page that you
15:16 - focus on I'm gonna start over on the
15:18 - left side and I see my student list then
15:23 - going across the top horizontally I have
15:25 - these green numbers and what these green
15:28 - numbers represent are the numbers of the
15:30 - challenges for the purposes of today you
15:33 - see that we are in coding adventure part
15:35 - 1 but you can also move between the
15:41 - courses using this drop-down menu down
15:45 - here so you can just navigate between
15:47 - the courses that you have assigned
15:53 - now underneath the numbers and next to
15:57 - the students you see stars here and the
15:59 - stars are basically our grading system
16:02 - and the way this works is that first
16:04 - star which is the pink star that's gonna
16:08 - be given if the challenge was completed
16:10 - so it's a bare minimum you completed the
16:12 - challenge you grab the video pink star
16:15 - that second star is going to be given so
16:18 - the second star will be the blue stars
16:21 - the second star is going to be given if
16:22 - the user applied a specific coding
16:25 - concept that was specific to that
16:27 - challenge so we were working on loops
16:30 - and you use the loop to solve a
16:32 - challenge that's how you get the second
16:35 - star and to achieve that third star you
16:38 - do those other things which you also
16:39 - write code that is short and to the
16:42 - point
16:44 - perhaps you notice here in our list of
16:47 - challenges that some of them are
16:48 - highlighted in yellow with a sort of
16:51 - yellow circle and these represent our
16:54 - assessment challenges so these are going
16:57 - to be the challenges that are in
16:59 - contrast to our story mode challenges
17:02 - which have pre-built code these have no
17:04 - pre-built code whatsoever so students
17:07 - are going to need to basically start
17:09 - from scratch using what they learn from
17:12 - the regular challenges or what we call
17:15 - the story love challenges now as a
17:18 - teacher if you need access to the
17:21 - solutions to the challenges and this
17:24 - goes for any course that we offer what
17:26 - you would do is just click on the green
17:28 - number so in this case if I click on
17:32 - number eight I'm given a solution to
17:35 - that challenge so it's kind of your
17:37 - cheat sheet there
17:47 - it's also going to point out regarding
17:51 - the stars and the scoring that if you
17:53 - see that within a classroom that a lot
17:58 - of students are getting a pink star on
18:01 - one of the challenges that may be a way
18:03 - to sort of go back and see what needs to
18:05 - be reinforced so just keep an eye on
18:08 - that I also want to point out up here we
18:14 - have what's called super dense and so
18:18 - this is a button where you can basically
18:21 - turn on and off super hints and we'll
18:24 - get into that in just a little bit I
18:26 - just want to point out that that is a
18:27 - feature that is available as well okay
18:34 - so in this next section we want to sort
18:36 - of get into what are going to be the
18:40 - probably two most prominent approaches
18:42 - to remote learning and how to
18:45 - incorporate code monkey into remote
18:48 - learning that's going to be self paced
18:50 - versus a structured way out
18:53 - administrating the lessons so we know
18:56 - that teachers are out there using these
18:57 - different methods to communicate and
18:58 - teach these students again it's a very
19:00 - hectic time so there is no one right way
19:03 - and from our experience conversations
19:07 - and communications with teachers over
19:09 - the years we know that people are making
19:12 - it work either either way but what I do
19:15 - want to do is to sort of show you how
19:18 - you make the most of each approach so
19:23 - we'll start with the self-paced approach
19:26 - so this is going to be for those of you
19:28 - that are going to just let your students
19:30 - independently just progress within a
19:33 - course or maybe some of you are like hey
19:37 - I'm gonna let my students choose which
19:39 - course they like to play so here's just
19:42 - a few things that I want to make sure
19:43 - that you're familiar with before you set
19:46 - them along their way I just again make
19:49 - sure that you assign those courses so it
19:51 - shows you that that's done from the
19:53 - classroom dashboard just
19:56 - if you don't assign the courses and the
19:58 - kids are self-paced what they'll do is
20:01 - they'll have a wall and they won't be
20:02 - able to move on and so you assign the
20:04 - course itself
20:07 - in addition to assigning in the courses
20:09 - again I pointed out those super hints
20:12 - and just to give you a little insight
20:14 - about these super heads these are also I
20:17 - said the dashboard might be your best
20:18 - friend progress tab but this also might
20:20 - be your best friend considering you're
20:22 - not in the classroom with the students
20:24 - so you think of super hands as extra
20:27 - guidance for the students it's going to
20:29 - enable them to progress independently as
20:31 - they go through the coding adventure
20:33 - challenges now the super hands can
20:36 - either be like a helpful tip or in some
20:39 - cases the actual solution to the
20:42 - challenge
20:43 - super hints are going to appear after
20:46 - student attempts to solve a challenge a
20:48 - few times or after a certain amount of
20:50 - time has passed since they started the
20:52 - challenge and what will happen is a
20:54 - lightbulb will appear next of goryeo
20:56 - which is going to be in the lower left
20:58 - hand corner and by clicking on that the
21:01 - student will be able to view the super
21:03 - hand now as a teacher again you can
21:06 - decide whether to turn these heads on or
21:08 - off per classroom and this is done from
21:11 - the progress tab however it is turned on
21:13 - by default
21:18 - now what do you do if you know you got
21:21 - super heads but they're still stuck
21:24 - they're still getting stuck what are
21:26 - some of the other ways that you can
21:27 - approach this and what we would suggest
21:30 - is one thing you can do is have them
21:33 - review the previous challenges and then
21:35 - what you want to do is emphasize to them
21:37 - to read those instructions either from
21:40 - that challenge if they're stuck on or
21:42 - from those previous challenges and again
21:43 - they can always go backwards and look at
21:46 - their previous solutions and the way the
21:50 - courses are designed it's sort of a
21:53 - scaffolding way of learning so if I'm
21:55 - stuck on 21 the best way to help is
21:58 - maybe going back 20 of 19 or 18 you can
22:03 - also get the parents involved and I
22:05 - think this is where that we talked about
22:07 - that letter this is me maybe where you
22:10 - make sure the parents are aware that
22:13 - it's okay to help them because in a
22:15 - normal environment you would be there
22:16 - helping out or their classmates would be
22:18 - there helping them as well and then of
22:20 - course if you're getting them in a sort
22:22 - of not if you're not being inundated
22:24 - with requests for help don't forget as a
22:28 - teacher you do have those solutions
22:30 - available to you from the progress tab
22:37 - okay so there might be a group of you
22:41 - who are actually meeting online
22:43 - regularly with their students and/or
22:45 - you're giving them assignments so what
22:47 - you could do is you can actually use the
22:49 - structured lessons or the structured
22:53 - lesson approach with code monkey and
22:56 - then I'm going to again go through some
22:57 - of the tools that you can do with that
23:00 - once again we're starting with making
23:02 - sure you assign the courses but in
23:06 - addition to that there's a couple of
23:08 - other options that you would have when
23:10 - you want to sort of control the pacing
23:11 - of your classroom
23:16 - so one of those is this limit progress
23:19 - button so within each course you can
23:23 - control your students progress by
23:24 - limiting it to a pace that you prefer
23:27 - and again I can do this by course and I
23:31 - can also do this by class so I can take
23:33 - that first period class and say okay
23:35 - guys let's let's just do 20 challenges
23:42 - per day okay so I type in 20 I click on
23:47 - save and that's going to limit the
23:49 - students until I change that number or I
23:51 - turn this off so I can change the number
23:56 - or I could return it to free play if
24:00 - that's what I decided to do
24:04 - and then in addition to limiting using
24:06 - the limit progress cutting we also have
24:09 - lessons so perhaps you notice one of our
24:12 - tabs is actually the next tab is lessons
24:16 - we'll go ahead and leave
24:20 - so this is what our lessons page looks
24:23 - like and you'll see that this is going
24:26 - to be a great feature that you can use
24:27 - in the classroom when you're using our
24:30 - lesson plans for coding adventure so if
24:33 - you're actually facing their students
24:34 - for an online lesson I would definitely
24:37 - check out this feature and there's also
24:39 - a great tutorial you can find
24:46 - all right I want to quickly mention
24:48 - another tab that's here in a classroom
24:51 - dashboard and that's our gradebook so
24:57 - you'll see here that those stars from
24:59 - our gradebook are going to be converted
25:01 - into values and I can change the values
25:06 - here in the settings so currently I'm
25:09 - showing eights and nines perhaps and
25:12 - tens but I could turn those numbers and
25:15 - to letters I can turn those into
25:19 - percentages if I need to
25:22 - you
25:26 - moving back over to the left side menu I
25:30 - do want to point out some really helpful
25:34 - to to resources so the samaya yep
25:37 - hi again we received a request to show
25:41 - again uh what we call the teachers cheat
25:45 - sheet the Oxus solutions can you show
25:48 - that again
25:49 - absolutely so going back to my
25:52 - classrooms
25:55 - and I'll choose the class in this case I
25:58 - only have one
26:02 - okay so here in the progress tab again
26:07 - for the solutions I can click on any of
26:10 - these numbers and this is true of any of
26:12 - our courses so again I'm only showing
26:14 - you coding adventure part 1 but any of
26:17 - course that you assign and so for
26:19 - example if I click on challenge 7
26:21 - encoding integer part 1
26:26 - this will give me a possible three star
26:29 - solution for that challenge
26:36 - thank you thanks for the question
26:45 - all right so we were beginning to talk
26:47 - about those teacher resources and this
26:51 - is something that you will probably find
26:53 - yourself leaning on a lot and you sort
26:55 - of get into the basics at the beginning
26:59 - of code monkey so you have access to our
27:05 - teaching with commitment to a course
27:07 - care and this course is going to provide
27:09 - you with practical training useful
27:12 - explanations and just some general tips
27:15 - relating to part one including adventure
27:17 - the course itself is about 75 minutes
27:19 - long but it's a lot of teachers have
27:22 - given us feedback that this has been a
27:24 - real huge help for them also on this
27:29 - same page you'll see that I wasn't
27:31 - making it up there are lesson plans
27:33 - available for every each and every
27:37 - course that we have
27:43 - busting plants galore
27:44 - [Music]
27:46 - so they got in this alone also you'll
27:51 - find on this page our teacher resources
27:53 - page some how-to guides so you're
27:57 - looking at the top here we have a
27:59 - beginner's guide to code monkey there's
28:01 - a video guide my favorite the video
28:04 - tutorials I like to see it more than I
28:07 - like to read it
28:11 - and you see our library and by the way
28:14 - this library is forever expanding so
28:17 - always going to look out for more and
28:20 - then our last tab over here are these
28:23 - classroom resources and here's where you
28:26 - can find certificates that can be shared
28:31 - posters there's other fund materials you
28:34 - can share with your students coloring
28:38 - pages for maybe some of the younger
28:41 - users as well
28:45 - and then lastly I will point out in
28:49 - addition to these resources you can
28:52 - always head over to our Help Center
28:55 - that's to be accessed from the bottom
28:57 - left side of the menu here
29:00 - give you a brief look at that real quick
29:05 - so and we're always adding more help
29:08 - articles that you can search for
29:09 - yourself or if you find that your answer
29:12 - your question is not that answered
29:14 - through any of these articles here
29:19 - you can always just contact our support
29:26 - all right so just to kind of go back and
29:29 - take a look at the ground that we've
29:31 - covered or hopefully covered it well we
29:34 - talked about what code monkey was and
29:36 - how it's sort of a resource for K
29:38 - through eight showed you the teachers
29:41 - home page how to create a classroom then
29:45 - add students at code teachers to that
29:47 - classroom we also talked about upgrading
29:51 - an existing or upgrading another
29:53 - classroom into this remote learning
29:56 - subscription to make sure that the
29:58 - students have all that access all the
29:59 - courses we shows you the progress page
30:02 - where you can not only follow their
30:04 - progress but you can access the
30:09 - solutions for yourself you can also
30:11 - access the solutions to the access to
30:15 - solutions that the students have
30:16 - submitted we talked a little bit about
30:19 - self-paced versus structured and then
30:22 - which tools you would use which buttons
30:24 - you would click to sort of make them
30:26 - most of whichever approach you decided
30:28 - and then we showed you the teacher
30:31 - resources page which is where you'll
30:34 - find a lot of things that we did not
30:35 - cover here today or even similar things
30:36 - did cover always a lot of resources in
30:40 - our that can sort of guide you through
30:43 - this so with all those being done we
30:47 - will now open it up to your questions
30:50 - as promised oh I also should point out
30:54 - tomorrow we will also have webinars
31:01 - available tomorrow will be more teacher
31:05 - code words alright let me back up there
31:07 - tomorrow be more geared toward the
31:10 - courses themselves we'll get into which
31:14 - one and which courses apply it to which
31:18 - age groups and we'll talk more about
31:20 - sort of teaching the courses themselves
31:23 - all right now we'll back up to the Q&A
31:27 - session so if there are any questions in
31:29 - the chat we'll take a look at those
31:44 - mark can you see the question from
31:46 - vasila in the Q&A box I'm just blowing
31:50 - up there okay so the question is please
31:56 - tell us about adding bulk students from
31:58 - the spreadsheet okay that's a great
32:00 - question
32:00 - I can actually go back
32:09 - so this was option two
32:11 - when they came to add an adding students
32:20 - you
32:25 - okay so again I start with that add
32:27 - students button and then we have to bulk
32:30 - upload now with the bulk upload you
32:34 - basically need a two column CSV file
32:36 - column one you're gonna have student
32:38 - display names you'll see some of the
32:40 - rules and conventions that we require
32:43 - there here on this screen and the column
32:46 - two is gonna have the passwords so
32:47 - there's no headings or titles I'm just
32:50 - going to use column a will be student
32:53 - names or student display names and then
32:56 - column B will be our passwords and then
32:59 - you can also download our example file
33:02 - but once you do that you can upload the
33:08 - file so I have like say 30 students I
33:12 - have 30 usernames and 30 passwords click
33:18 - upload and then again to protect student
33:22 - privacy because it says here usually we
33:25 - recommend that you do not use their
33:27 - actual names so for example nickname or
33:31 - first name dot last initial
33:36 - you
33:41 - okay can you review again we have
33:44 - another question for Karen can you
33:48 - review again how students access their
33:50 - account could ever buy them with our own
33:54 - unique code or is it a class code okay
33:56 - it's a great question so let me get back
34:00 - again it would be just to answer this
34:04 - second part of that it is a class code
34:06 - so students are going to use the class
34:08 - code that's generated let's show you
34:17 - okay so if I go back here
34:21 - Oh what so the classical can actually
34:24 - found in a couple of ways and I just
34:25 - retaught myself that so here under the
34:28 - my classrooms dashboard I see here on
34:31 - the actions that I have a classroom
34:33 - class code of two f 7h e but perhaps
34:37 - you'll also notice that from within the
34:39 - classroom dashboard
34:43 - so this is specific to classroom one
34:51 - under the students tab there's also the
34:57 - classroom code is there as well now
34:59 - again if I'm a student who does not have
35:02 - coding lucky account what I would do and
35:05 - let me head back over there and so let's
35:16 - just go sign up down okay so okay it's
35:19 - starting from the beginning when I click
35:21 - on student do you have a classroom code
35:25 - yes I do and then what I would do is
35:28 - type in that classroom code that was
35:31 - given to me
35:35 - so here I'll just join us another
35:36 - student and again this is where the
35:44 - student or the student with the help of
35:46 - their parents could create a username
35:49 - and a password and then sign up for the
35:52 - class
35:53 - you
35:56 - okay the other follow-up question to
35:59 - that was how are their password
36:01 - generated
36:06 - tell you to do you mind stepping in on
36:08 - that one yeah I think I mean uh right so
36:13 - if if you as a teacher decided to create
36:16 - your student with their accounts and you
36:20 - might you might want to do that for the
36:22 - younger ones then you have two options
36:25 - as Mark showed you you could just create
36:27 - an individual students account so that's
36:29 - great if you have just a few and we also
36:32 - have the bulk upload which just using a
36:35 - CSV file and it's really it's quite
36:38 - straightforward once you click on that
36:40 - option option you'll see some great
36:43 - detailed instructions on how to do that
36:45 - but we'll provide in the CSV file
36:49 - student display names and the passwords
36:52 - and the system will create for you the
36:56 - students usernames which they will use
37:00 - to log in to code monkey just because
37:02 - usernames on code monkey are unique so
37:06 - the system would create them for you
37:09 - you'll get the list and you'll be able
37:10 - to share it with your students so once
37:12 - you create their accounts you'll be the
37:14 - one who will create their passwords by
37:18 - the way as you can see from the screen
37:20 - that mark is showing now at any points
37:22 - you can come here and just reset the
37:23 - password by clicking on the reset
37:25 - password or just changing it to a
37:28 - different password but of course if your
37:30 - students join themselves either by
37:33 - creating their own account or by using
37:36 - using the let's say their Google account
37:38 - clever class link so using a single
37:41 - sign-on then of course that's the the
37:44 - way that they will log in they won't
37:46 - need to put any password and of course
37:48 - that's that those are passwords that are
37:50 - private they won't show also for the
37:52 - teacher I hope that explanation helped
37:59 - that's a great explanation thank you are
38:07 - there any other outstanding questions
38:10 - yes you'll be a few of you had some
38:12 - questions and we said that we'll get
38:14 - back to you after the webinar so promise
38:17 - that we'll do that
38:19 - [Music]
38:20 - okay well with that being said again I
38:24 - do want to tell everyone how much we
38:26 - appreciate you taking time out today and
38:29 - trying to bring code monkey to their
38:32 - students and again any questions that
38:35 - you feel we're not addressed here today
38:38 - you can always reach out to us at
38:40 - support or using the Help Center
38:43 - articles that being said I hope everyone
38:47 - has a great rest of their day stay
38:49 - healthy and stay safe guys
38:51 - talk to you soon goodbye
