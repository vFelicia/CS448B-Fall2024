00:04 - welcome to not my cup of tea
00:07 - let's learn about not
00:10 - not is a boolean operator on a single
00:14 - boolean
00:15 - it is used before a boolean
00:18 - not changes the boolean value
00:21 - so true becomes false and false becomes
00:24 - true
00:26 - here's an example
00:27 - of an if statement so if not banana
00:32 - green
00:33 - so that means if banana is green if
00:36 - banana green turn returns a true
00:38 - then not
00:40 - makes the entire condition false
00:44 - on the other hand if banana green was
00:48 - false
00:50 - then not would make the condition true
00:53 - and the indented code would run
00:56 - in this case it would say banana must be
00:58 - yellow
01:01 - here's a table with some more
01:02 - information
01:04 - again we have the if
01:06 - not banana green
01:08 - and if we just look at the banana green
01:11 - bullion
01:12 - it could either be true or false
01:15 - but the not
01:17 - banana green would be the opposite
01:21 - you're only going to get that true
01:22 - condition when banana green
01:24 - is false because the knot
01:28 - changes it to true
01:30 - let's look at an example
01:33 - here's a challenge where the monkey
01:36 - wants to go and eat some bananas
01:38 - but we got a couple of rotten ones here
01:42 - and i don't think the monkey wants that
01:44 - those ones
01:45 - so um we only want to pick up
01:48 - the ripe ones
01:50 - so if we look at the code we have a for
01:53 - loop so we're going to cycle through all
01:56 - of those bananas
01:58 - and we when we look at each one we're
02:00 - going to say if
02:03 - let's see the code says if b rotten
02:06 - go to b
02:09 - hmm that won't that is that going to
02:11 - make the monkey go to the yellow bananas
02:14 - no it's going to make it go the rotten
02:16 - ones so we need we want the opposite
02:20 - we want
02:22 - if
02:23 - not
02:24 - rotten it's not rotten go to be
02:29 - let's skip over those rotten ones so
02:32 - let's see if this works
02:37 - okay it skipped over them
02:40 - [Music]
02:43 - now it's your turn to use not
02:46 - good luck
02:47 - [Music]
02:52 - you
