00:04 - welcome to if it snows let's learn about
00:07 - if
00:09 - if statements run commands only if a
00:12 - condition is met
00:13 - it's very similar how you normally use
00:16 - if
00:17 - for example you might say
00:19 - if it's raining i'll bring an umbrella
00:23 - here's how you write the if statement
00:26 - if
00:27 - space condition
00:29 - so if the condition is met meaning it's
00:31 - true
00:32 - the indented commands will run
00:35 - if the condition is not true
00:38 - or is not met
00:40 - we're going to skip all the commands
00:43 - that are indented
00:44 - and will run the first command outside
00:48 - of the if
00:49 - for example
00:51 - if near pile near pile is the condition
00:55 - so if that condition is true
00:58 - we will
00:59 - drop
01:00 - if the condition is not true when the
01:02 - computer reaches the if
01:04 - then it will skip to the line outside of
01:07 - the if statement
01:09 - let's look at a
01:10 - challenge so here's a challenge
01:14 - where we have the monkey the goat and
01:16 - the banana
01:18 - now the goat
01:20 - you can see in the if statement if the
01:22 - banana is frozen
01:24 - we want the goat to go to the banana and
01:27 - then hit it
01:29 - and then
01:32 - for the
01:33 - monkey
01:35 - the monkey could say yum
01:37 - but the monkey could just let's say go
01:41 - to
01:42 - the banana
01:45 - okay so
01:46 - if the banana is frozen we want the goat
01:49 - to do these things but if the banana is
01:52 - not frozen
01:54 - we should just skip to
01:56 - go to banana
01:59 - so this allows this this program will be
02:02 - successful
02:03 - when the banana's frozen but also when
02:06 - the banana is not frozen
02:09 - okay let's go ahead and run it
02:12 - okay we skipped straight to the go to
02:14 - banana because the banana was not frozen
02:18 - let's look at another example
02:22 - here's an interesting challenge where we
02:24 - have some bananas that are frozen
02:28 - and some that aren't and the goat needs
02:30 - to decide
02:31 - whether it needs to go to a banana
02:34 - because it's frozen or it doesn't need
02:36 - to go the monkey could just
02:39 - go directly to the banana
02:41 - so we have this code where
02:43 - we're going through a for loop so we're
02:45 - going to go and
02:47 - work on
02:48 - one banana at a time
02:51 - if that given banana's frozen
02:54 - what do we want to do let's see so if
02:57 - the banana's frozen
03:00 - we want
03:01 - the goat
03:03 - to go to
03:05 - that banana so we're going to say b
03:08 - whatever banana we're currently working
03:10 - on in the loop
03:12 - and
03:13 - then we want the goat
03:16 - to
03:18 - basically hit that banana
03:21 - and then
03:23 - um
03:28 - and then
03:28 - basically we want
03:31 - monkey
03:32 - to go to the banana the bee
03:35 - so the great thing about this is
03:38 - if the banana is not frozen
03:41 - it's just gonna skip to go to b
03:44 - but if the banana is frozen
03:47 - it'll have the goat go to b and then hit
03:50 - it and then we'll still have the monkey
03:53 - go to the b
03:54 - so let's see how this works
03:59 - okay so we're gonna go to the
04:02 - all right
04:03 - and then
04:08 - okay now the monkey can just go directly
04:11 - okay the
04:12 - goat knows it needs to hit it
04:15 - and then the monkey goes to it
04:19 - and then the last one monkey could just
04:21 - directly go to it
04:27 - now it's your turn to use if good luck
