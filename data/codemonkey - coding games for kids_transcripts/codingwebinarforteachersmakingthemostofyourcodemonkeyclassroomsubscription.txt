07:30 - designed to answer your questions and
07:33 - then
07:34 - we're just here to

07:40 - some features and
07:43 - we really love seeing
07:45 - everyone and all of you here
07:48 - so
07:49 - uh just so you can
07:50 - just so you know you can always follow
07:52 - us at
07:53 - codemonkey.sdu on our twitter facebook
07:56 - instagram and also on linkedin
07:59 - and then
08:00 - uh we also have our cod monk monkey blog
08:04 - so i would recommend following that as
08:07 - well and there's a lot of tips and
08:09 - tricks for teachers over there uh
08:11 - sometimes we'll just share some
08:13 - different content so
08:16 - we can dive into that later um but
08:19 - if you guys like to check out any of our
08:21 - social platforms then
08:24 - that would be great um
08:27 - you're also
08:29 - able to ask and if you have any
08:31 - questions that weren't answered during
08:33 - this webinar today then you're able to
08:35 - ask them through any of those uh
08:38 - platforms
08:40 - so
08:41 - let's take a second to meet the team
08:44 - uh so i'm maya maya miller i'm the
08:47 - customer success manager
08:49 - what i do is i help
08:53 - teachers schools districts
08:56 - and our uh partners
08:58 - to
08:59 - uh
09:00 - on board to code monkey
09:03 - implement them and reach their goals and
09:05 - throughout the school year i talk to a
09:09 - lot of teachers throughout my start my
09:12 - daily routine and i get a lot of
09:14 - really interesting tips and tricks some
09:16 - which i'm gonna share from you and share
09:18 - with you today not all of those tips and
09:21 - tricks are necessarily things that we
09:24 - thought of when
09:25 - we created the platform so it's always
09:28 - great to get feedback from you on how
09:31 - you use the platform eventually in your
09:34 - classroom
09:35 - we also have
09:36 - uh
09:38 - um
09:39 - leave not first kovitz here today she is
09:42 - the content developer and pedagogy
09:44 - manager and she is actually the one that
09:47 - works her magic and creates all of code
09:50 - monkey so
09:51 - pretty amazing
09:53 - and
09:54 - molly
09:56 - would you like to present yourself or
09:59 - okay
10:01 - i don't know if she's
10:03 - able to but i will say molly is our
10:05 - director of sales
10:07 - some of you may know her so
10:14 - so
10:15 - our
10:16 - objectives today in this webinar is to
10:20 - um
10:22 - show you how
10:24 - you can create access the classroom and
10:27 - how your students can access the
10:28 - classroom how you can create the
10:30 - classroom for them
10:31 - how to add co-teachers how to
10:34 - limit students progress and also how to
10:37 - track it and i will show you the lessons
10:39 - feature and the gradebook and
10:41 - proficiency reports and we'll also have
10:44 - a q a in the end so
10:46 - just a little something that i like to
10:48 - say is that i see the code monkey
10:51 - platform
10:53 - in a way sort of like a restaurant right
10:56 - because uh when you go to a restaurant
11:00 - the first the first thing that you would
11:02 - do is
11:03 - take your customers and take them to
11:05 - their table this is basically the
11:08 - student access and getting the students
11:11 - into the classrooms and then you have to
11:14 - cater them with some sort of service and
11:17 - you're also
11:19 - you're able to do it yourself as a
11:20 - teacher or add a co-teacher
11:24 - catering them with a service is just
11:25 - like
11:27 - showing them
11:28 - the um sharing with them the content the
11:31 - club monkey has so allowing them to pay
11:34 - and limit their progress and then
11:36 - afterwards after the food is served then
11:38 - you would ask how is the food was it
11:40 - good you would see if they ate
11:43 - everything on their plate or not this is
11:46 - part of the
11:48 - progress tracking that i will share with
11:50 - you today so
11:51 - for me it's just like
11:53 - a kind of
11:54 - cute way to remember uh things i hope it
11:57 - helps you too
11:59 - um
12:00 - so
12:01 - just in general uh i'm gonna cover this
12:04 - really briefly so co monkey is a leading
12:07 - fun and intuitive curriculum for kids to
12:11 - learn coding uh through the game and
12:14 - project-based courses students as young
12:16 - as seven use real programming languages
12:19 - to solve puzzles and build games and
12:22 - apps so the majority of code monkey's
12:25 - courses do not require prior coding
12:27 - experience uh in order to teach them
12:30 - which is amazing it's a very very
12:32 - teacher friendly platform and
12:35 - all of the courses are designed for
12:37 - school extracurricular and home use so
12:40 - our mission i would say is to provide an
12:44 - inclusive path for youngsters into the
12:47 - ever expanding world of code
12:49 - um code monkey is a game-based learning
12:53 - environment where children
12:55 - learn to code in real programming
12:57 - languages ever since codeman
13:01 - so you are
13:02 - uh
13:03 - you will be able to find
13:06 - this webinar and also many other
13:08 - webinars that are
13:10 - [Music]
13:12 - teacher and student geared
13:15 - right here if you follow this link
13:18 - www dot
13:22 - webinars
13:24 - so this
13:25 - once we finish
13:27 - once we end this webinar today we will
13:29 - be sending you
13:31 - a feedback survey
13:32 - which will also have a link to this
13:34 - webinar and about
13:37 - a week
13:38 - after
13:40 - i believe that we will already have this
13:42 - webinar
13:43 - on site
13:45 - so
13:46 - let's dive in directly to the platform
13:51 - or you know what
13:54 - let's start here
13:56 - can you see the login screen right now
14:02 - want to make sure
14:04 - no we see the
14:06 - courses page man
14:08 - okay
14:11 - okay
14:13 - so this is the common key login screen
14:16 - this is where you would probably start
14:19 - your way with codemonkey uh
14:22 - we recommend using one of the ssos if
14:25 - you're using
14:27 - codemonkey with google classroom then
14:30 - you would go with the google sso if
14:33 - you're using it with clever then you
14:35 - would use
14:36 - the clever sso and
14:39 - this is
14:42 - just
14:43 - the main uh
14:46 - screen
14:47 - and once you do log in
14:50 - this
14:51 - is the page that you will see uh you
14:54 - will get to the courses page
14:57 - this is a teacher account that i created
15:01 - especially for this webinar but
15:03 - this is
15:05 - what's unique about this page is that
15:07 - the students and the teachers
15:09 - it gives us
15:10 - they have the same
15:12 - main page so
15:14 - you
15:14 - as a teacher you're seeing this and
15:16 - you're also able to play the courses but
15:18 - this you're also seeing cool monkey the
15:20 - way that your students will see code
15:22 - monkey
15:24 - um okay
15:26 - so
15:28 - on the courses page you
15:30 - uh you can see that
15:32 - the courses are
15:34 - tagged by colors and
15:36 - there's novice beginner intermediate
15:40 - advent and advanced courses uh each
15:44 - course uh would be suitable for a
15:46 - different stage or a different grade
15:49 - and
15:50 - you can also see when you click on a
15:53 - certain course an explanation
15:57 - i mean a you can see the name of the
15:59 - course b
16:00 - whether it was started or not and then
16:02 - an explanation about what they would see
16:05 - in this course
16:07 - so when a student logs in for the first
16:09 - time they would see here start coding
16:11 - but once they have
16:14 - played their first challenge
16:16 - then it will
16:18 - turn into continue quoting and
16:20 - when they click it it will take them
16:22 - exactly to the
16:25 - point where they stopped last
16:41 - okay
16:42 - so
16:44 - on the
16:46 - left hand
16:47 - you can see that you have
16:48 - this menu that will help you to navigate
16:51 - throughout the platform and you also
16:53 - have another menu on the right hand
16:56 - that will take you to it will be able to
17:01 - change language from there you can go to
17:05 - your classrooms which is this page that
17:07 - we're on right now and you can go to
17:10 - your account to change account settings
17:13 - and you're also able to go to the help
17:15 - center or blog and contact us
17:19 - with this
17:21 - right hand menu
17:23 - so
17:24 - under my classrooms
17:27 - you can you
17:29 - once you
17:32 - populate your subscription with
17:34 - classrooms then you will be able to see
17:36 - the classroom list it also provides you
17:39 - with uh a summary of this like an
17:42 - overview summary of
17:45 - where where your subscription stands uh
17:49 - like student population wise so we can
17:52 - see that this subscription has five
17:54 - classrooms
17:56 - among all those classrooms there's 36
17:58 - students some of the classrooms are
18:00 - populated and some aren't and you can
18:03 - see which subscription it it's
18:05 - associated with you can see that one
18:08 - classroom is associated with and
18:12 - subscription that has been expired
18:14 - this
18:15 - i will show you later i want to use this
18:17 - to show you how we move from year to
18:20 - year uh in code monkey and class code is
18:24 - one of the ways
18:26 - that you can invite students into your
18:29 - classroom
18:31 - and from
18:32 - this my classrooms page you're able to
18:35 - edit the classroom name
18:37 - and the classroom grade as a teacher
18:41 - you are also able to archive classrooms
18:44 - so that's just
18:45 - by clicking the archive button here so
18:48 - let's just click archive
18:49 - and
18:50 - and it will not archive immediately it
18:53 - will make sure that you are that you're
18:55 - sure and then once i have
18:58 - archived it
19:00 - let's say i archive the classroom by
19:02 - mistake or i wanted to archive just one
19:06 - student from that classroom and that the
19:07 - whole classroom i know this is a
19:09 - repeating question that we get uh once
19:11 - in a while
19:12 - so
19:13 - you can on the same page on as
19:16 - uh the classroom list there's also the
19:19 - archive and you can easily restore the
19:21 - classroom by just clicking restore
19:24 - classroom
19:28 - okay
19:32 - so
19:33 - when
19:34 - your first step with chrome monkey would
19:36 - be to create a new classroom right so
19:40 - we have several ways that you can create
19:42 - a classroom with you can create a
19:44 - classroom
19:45 - [Music]
19:46 - just
19:51 - name it here and associate it with the
19:53 - subscription the teacher trial uh is
19:57 - some of you may have uh
19:59 - wanted to dab around code monkey so you
20:01 - had a teacher trial before so make sure
20:03 - that you're adding the classroom to the
20:06 - correct
20:07 - and active subscription
20:10 - and another way that you can create a
20:12 - classroom is import from google so right
20:15 - now i am not connected to my google
20:18 - classroom account but if i was
20:21 - then it would once i choose the check
20:24 - box import from google then a drop down
20:27 - menu will appear here and it will show
20:30 - me all of the classrooms that are um
20:34 - classrooms that i manage with google and
20:37 - the important thing to notice is uh just
20:40 - make sure that your
20:42 - login email to code monkey is the same
20:44 - as your login email to your
20:48 - google classroom
20:49 - and then
20:50 - maya just just one comment you um if you
20:54 - log in with clever it will say import
20:56 - form clever and right will import all
20:59 - your classes from cleveland
21:01 - okay that's that's correct thank you
21:03 - leave that
21:05 - and
21:06 - once classrooms are uh imported from
21:10 - either clever or google when we get into
21:13 - the specific classroom
21:16 - there will be an icon here right below
21:18 - the drop down menu that enables you to
21:21 - navigate between classrooms easily
21:23 - without having to go back to the my
21:25 - classrooms page so there will be uh
21:29 - a button here that looks like with the
21:31 - branding of either google or
21:35 - clever and once you click that button it
21:38 - will automatically sync
21:40 - the classroom with whatever
21:42 - um students or changes that you had on
21:47 - your google or clever classroom
21:51 - so
21:53 - by
21:54 - clicking by choosing a
21:56 - classroom i
21:58 - it will take actually
22:00 - sorry i want it
22:08 - okay
22:10 - so
22:10 - once you chose the classroom
22:13 - you we move from the
22:16 - like the main hall of the teacher
22:18 - dashboards to the to the dashboard of
22:21 - the specific classroom on the dashboard
22:23 - of the specific classroom we have those
22:25 - tabs and each tab has a world of
22:28 - possibilities and again the drop down
22:31 - menu is always here on the top right
22:34 - hand side you can
22:37 - change classroom easily
22:39 - you don't have to go back to the my
22:41 - classrooms every time because
22:43 - we know it can be
22:45 - exhausting
22:46 - so
22:48 - once you chose uh the specific classroom
22:51 - we get to the progress tab on the
22:54 - progress tab we're able to
22:56 - um
22:57 - monitor and control the progress of our
22:59 - students uh so i can
23:02 - currently we're looking at the coding
23:04 - adventure part one course of this
23:07 - classroom you can see
23:09 - uh the names of the students
23:11 - and
23:12 - we are you're able to
23:15 - sort in a way that you're most
23:17 - comfortable so you can either sort by
23:18 - name like it is sort of right now from
23:22 - by
23:23 - display name or by progress and then it
23:26 - will show you
23:28 - uh the mo the ones who made the most
23:30 - progress at the top and then
23:32 - going down to those who have less
23:34 - progress
23:35 - and
23:37 - the
23:38 - the star system
23:42 - as you can see here in the
23:45 - on the top
23:47 - a yellow star means three stars this
23:49 - means that the student was able to solve
23:52 - the the challenge in the best most
23:55 - elegant and shortest way
23:57 - uh
23:58 - a blue star means that he he
24:02 - submitted a two-star solution which
24:03 - means that they
24:05 - uh were able to reach the bananas but
24:07 - maybe there was like a step that was
24:09 - making it uh that could have been
24:12 - uh
24:13 - saved and once
24:15 - signs and that this they have struggled
24:18 - with this
24:19 - and
24:20 - an exclamation mark
24:22 - means a failed solution so they weren't
24:25 - able to solve the challenge at all
24:27 - and assessment challenges this is
24:30 - actually
24:34 - first look
24:36 - uh i wanted to show you
24:38 - that we currently
24:41 - we currently have assessment challenges
24:44 - here marked as
24:47 - with a
24:48 - yellow circle but we are working on
24:51 - special assessment challenges that will
24:53 - be separated from this which is
24:55 - something that i know a lot of teachers
24:57 - are really excited about
24:59 - um so on the progress table you're also
25:01 - able to limit progress as you can see
25:03 - here uh this classroom's progress was
25:06 - limited until
25:08 - to challenge 24 the
25:11 - one of the assessment challenges it's
25:14 - it's a choice you can limit by course
25:16 - you can limit by assessment challenges
25:19 - and
25:21 - and
25:22 - from the
25:24 - progress table you're also able to turn
25:26 - on
25:27 - turn on and off super hints for your
25:29 - students if you feel
25:31 - that your students are struggling for
25:33 - example
25:34 - if we
25:35 - see uh hi joanne
25:38 - so if we see that uh this is a great
25:40 - visual indication to see if our students
25:42 - struggled in a certain point so if i
25:45 - would see several students have blue or
25:47 - red stars in a certain challenge then i
25:50 - know maybe it's time to turn on super
25:52 - hints for them or maybe i want to
25:54 - revisit that challenge and see
25:58 - why they were struggling
26:01 - um
26:04 - okay
26:05 - wait so i think i jumped a little bit
26:08 - ahead i also wanted to
26:11 - before we jump into the classroom i
26:13 - wanted to say that if you are not
26:15 - importing with google classroom or
26:18 - clever or whatever
26:20 - uh
26:21 - free
26:22 - pre-made uh
26:23 - classroom then once you've created a
26:26 - classroom uh let's go to one of my empty
26:28 - classrooms
26:34 - this thing's always tend to happen when
26:35 - you're in a
26:36 - webinar sometimes uh
26:40 - one class wouldn't work let's see if
26:42 - this works
26:43 - no okay
26:44 - so if this classroom wasn't populated
26:48 - then we would not see the list of the
26:51 - students
26:53 - which
26:54 - means that we need to add students so
26:59 - once you click the plus and ends and add
27:02 - students the pop-up window
27:06 - and you will be able to add a single
27:08 - account or create multiple accounts
27:11 - and a single account is pretty obvious
27:14 - display name
27:15 - using password
27:19 - uh create multiple accounts so to do
27:22 - that you would need to download
27:26 - this
27:27 - and afterwards
27:32 - enter the info into that example file
27:34 - there are examples on the file so you
27:37 - won't have to um
27:38 - [Music]
27:41 - imagine uh how you have to fill this csv
27:45 - and then upload that csv into the
27:48 - platform and once you've uploaded it
27:51 - then the students will be populated in
27:54 - the classroom and
27:56 - uh
27:57 - you're getting uh first look this is the
27:59 - first webinar where we're presenting
28:01 - this so it's exciting uh you are also
28:04 - able to
28:06 - share a class code with your students a
28:09 - class code means so for example the
28:12 - classroom called adventures encoding has
28:15 - this unique class code that i can
28:18 - refresh and change
28:20 - and
28:21 - by clicking the regenerate
28:24 - button so by sharing a class code i
28:28 - can restrict or limit and how students
28:31 - will join because i know that some of
28:34 - the
28:35 - creators but
28:37 - mainly prereaders but not only uh
28:40 - could
28:41 - sometimes get confused then because you
28:45 - remember the login screen that i showed
28:47 - you at first so there are many sso
28:50 - systems so if you choose
28:52 - for example google or clever or
28:55 - classlink or whatever
28:57 - then it will present to those students
29:00 - only that option and it will prevent
29:03 - them from getting confused while they
29:06 - are
29:07 - blog signing in for the first time
29:11 - uh so once you shared the class code
29:14 - with the students they will you're
29:17 - basically
29:18 - um passing on that process to them
29:21 - you've shared the class talk with them
29:23 - and now they have to just
29:25 - click the
29:27 - link that you've shared with them and
29:32 - populate themselves into the classroom
29:36 - [Music]
29:39 - when can you change this after the code
29:42 - was already made so again if you
29:45 - even if the if for example you're
29:47 - actually seeing the
29:49 - uh
29:50 - perfect example right now this is a
29:52 - classroom which is already populated but
29:54 - i can still regenerate the class code
29:56 - again and again
29:58 - endlessly i think if i'm not mistaken so
30:02 - you're always able to change the
30:03 - classroom code and if
30:07 - by any chance
30:08 - the classroom code
30:10 - reached a student that is not meant to
30:12 - be in this classroom then you're always
30:14 - able to move this student to a different
30:16 - classroom the thing is that you're only
30:19 - able to move students within classrooms
30:21 - in your subscription and if i'm not
30:24 - mistaken
30:25 - only classrooms that you manage
30:29 - so
30:33 - and another great feature is
30:36 - the student log inputs right here at the
30:39 - top and
30:41 - so the student student logging cards are
30:44 - basically just uh individual cards for
30:47 - students that have their name and their
30:49 - just their credentials their login
30:51 - information this is really helpful if
30:53 - you're teaching a hybrid model or if
30:57 - you're teaching um
30:58 - [Music]
31:00 - remotely and you can i it does create a
31:03 - little bit work for the teacher because
31:05 - after you
31:06 - printed the login cards you have to
31:09 - share them with a specific student so it
31:11 - would either be print and cut
31:14 - or
31:16 - screenshot and share and but it does
31:19 - really help a lot of students log in
31:21 - correctly and that saves a lot of work
31:24 - later on
31:26 - okay so let's move on to
31:30 - the next step
31:32 - on the courses tab
31:34 - you're able to see uh the the same
31:37 - courses as we saw here
31:40 - but now we're seeing them with uh
31:42 - a little bit more information
31:45 - so we see which grades this course is
31:49 - suitable for how many lesson plans it
31:52 - has and what um
31:55 - advice it would work best on
31:58 - from the courses page you're able to
32:00 - assign
32:02 - or unassign
32:04 - courses
32:06 - from the classroom so i would assign by
32:08 - clicking it and it becomes yellow which
32:10 - means the sign and to unassign i just
32:13 - click the arrow and i'm assigned pretty
32:15 - intuitive
32:16 - and for every course if you click the
32:18 - read more
32:19 - it will give you an explanation on what
32:22 - are the coding concepts
32:23 - that are uh covered in this lesson and
32:27 - you have a
32:29 - link here that would take you to the
32:31 - lesson plan i will
32:33 - eat
32:34 - the lesson plans are
32:38 - let's let's just give it a second to
32:40 - vlog
32:43 - so the lesson plans is a presentation
32:46 - a pre-made presentation by uh by league
32:49 - nut
32:51 - that will help you
32:53 - teach the course in the classroom so you
32:56 - we basically did all the work and you
32:59 - can just rip
33:01 - rip up the fruits
33:03 - by using this presentation when you use
33:05 - uh
33:06 - in front of the students when you use
33:08 - code monkey in the classrooms or in zoom
33:10 - you can share your screen
33:14 - and
33:16 - now
33:18 - is there anything else i want to say
33:23 - and again you can see that it's color
33:25 - coded by uh
33:27 - how how difficult uh
33:30 - the
33:31 - the course is
33:38 - so on the gradebook
33:40 - the gradebook is another
33:42 - pretty great feature uh so on the
33:45 - gradebook you are able to see
33:48 - some data about uh
33:51 - about your specific classroom in a
33:54 - specific course you're able to navigate
33:56 - between courses here
33:58 - and between classrooms here
34:01 - you will be able to see
34:03 - uh
34:04 - the the
34:08 - the star
34:09 - and the star system translated into
34:12 - numbers from 1 to 10
34:14 - and
34:15 - it's like
34:18 - just grading them and you're able to
34:21 - change it from numbers to letters or to
34:24 - percents
34:25 - and so the percent is
34:29 - how
34:30 - how how successful were they in
34:33 - completing this
34:35 - course
34:36 - and you're also able to choose if you
34:39 - want to see
34:40 - the overall grade
34:43 - for a different
34:46 - okay this class hasn't covered all of
34:48 - that but
34:49 - uh you're able to change the
34:52 - the concept
34:54 - and
34:54 - this uh chart is also exp
34:58 - if you click export it would download as
35:01 - a
35:02 - it would be downloaded to your computer
35:05 - and euro can download certificates from
35:08 - here which is a great way
35:11 - to
35:14 - ramp up the excitement in the classroom
35:16 - so once you've finished
35:18 - uh coding adventure part one you can
35:20 - download certificates and the
35:22 - certificates would be done would be
35:24 - uh
35:26 - let's show you what they would look like
35:31 - so the certificates
35:32 - would be
35:35 - downloaded into your computer with the
35:38 - name of the student imprinted in the
35:41 - same font as codemonkey and
35:43 - [Music]
35:45 - let's see if i can see it here
35:47 - [Music]
35:50 - okay so let's see answer okay
35:56 - so this is an example for a certificate
35:58 - if you download it through the teacher
36:00 - resources then it's without a name but
36:02 - if you download it with the teacher
36:04 - resources so it will include an issue
36:07 - date student name
36:09 - and the signature or the founder of
36:11 - codemonkey
36:14 - so
36:20 - before we move on to the teacher
36:22 - resources officially i just wanted to
36:25 - show you briefly the showroom the
36:28 - showroom is where you would be able to
36:30 - see
36:31 - uh games that were created by your
36:33 - students
36:35 - and
36:36 - once you
36:38 - once you reach the point where the
36:40 - students are using the
36:43 - the
36:44 - more advanced quad monkey courses
36:50 - you're also able to enable or disable
36:53 - the discover
36:55 - so once right now the discovery is
36:58 - enabled so that's why it says the button
37:01 - says disable discover and once i click
37:03 - it it says
37:06 - that it will hide
37:08 - the discover from my students i really
37:11 - recommend uh
37:15 - maybe
37:16 - disabling discover for the first
37:19 - uh
37:20 - for the first month at least and
37:24 - it's just it's a personal recommendation
37:26 - it's not an official recommendation from
37:27 - code monkey but
37:29 - i think the discovery is a really
37:33 - students could get distracted by it and
37:36 - instead of doing the assigned courses
37:39 - then they might
37:41 - move to the discover so i would
37:43 - recommend once you have
37:47 - once you have created a classroom added
37:50 - students and then assigned courses the
37:53 - next step
37:54 - i think would be to disable this cover
37:57 - and then enable it as you go on but it's
37:59 - at your desk at your description
38:03 - so when we let's move on to the teacher
38:05 - resources
38:08 - so under the teacher resources
38:10 - uh
38:11 - you
38:12 - have always available the webinars this
38:15 - webinar also is going to be on the
38:17 - webinar page so whenever you want to
38:19 - revisit anything you can do it from here
38:23 - you can see uh the lesson plans
38:26 - uh on so
38:28 - the teacher resources would be
38:31 - obviously where you get all of your
38:32 - resources and the resources are
38:35 - directed for online activities offline
38:38 - activities and preparation for the
38:40 - classroom so
38:42 - if you're interested in preparation for
38:44 - the classroom then i would recommend
38:47 - looking at the lesson plans that are
38:49 - available for code mckee junior for
38:51 - beaver retriever recording adventure
38:54 - game builder banana tales
38:58 - pony chat
38:59 - and challenge builder
39:01 - and also for the
39:04 - preparation for classroom you can
39:07 - check out the very cool new feature
39:09 - coding concepts it's relevant only for
39:12 - coding adventure
39:14 - and but you're able to see
39:16 - brief uh videos that you're also
39:19 - i would recommend showing in the
39:20 - classroom uh later on and
39:24 - that will explain the specific coding
39:27 - concepts that will be taught in that
39:29 - course
39:30 - if you're interested in offline
39:32 - and one more preparation for the
39:34 - classroom you can see the solutions for
39:37 - every
39:39 - challenge in every course in code monkey
39:41 - all of the solutions are here all you
39:43 - need to do is click
39:45 - the
39:46 - the link in the correct course and then
39:48 - it will show you the
39:50 - the most
39:51 - eloquent way to solve the challenge and
39:54 - this is what you would be
39:56 - um
39:57 - directing your classroom towards
40:00 - if you're interested in offline
40:01 - activities then we have the media and
40:04 - graphics and you can find certificates
40:06 - here you can find
40:08 - coloring pages and posters you can print
40:13 - and hang in the classroom
40:15 - and
40:21 - what else did i want to say
40:24 - and
40:25 - if you click the teaching with coding
40:28 - adventure
40:29 - then it would take you
40:37 - [Music]
40:40 - there's a lot of windows open right now
40:42 - and i'm presenting my screen so it may
40:44 - take a second okay great
40:46 - so it will take you to the teaching with
40:50 - coding your page which has a lot of
40:52 - information about the
40:56 - about the different uh
40:58 - coding concepts that are covered and
41:00 - also a course overview
41:02 - and brief introduction to the platform
41:06 - uh so before i i know i do want to
41:09 - respect everyone's time and i know that
41:11 - the webinar is due to finish in a couple
41:13 - of minutes so i just want to uh briefly
41:17 - review uh where you can access
41:20 - the help center so you help center logo
41:24 - is always here on the left in the bottom
41:26 - left hand you're also able to contact us
41:30 - again
41:31 - as i mentioned at the beginning through
41:32 - here
41:36 - and
41:40 - okay
41:42 - let's just see
41:44 - the help center structure for a minute
41:46 - because i want you to be
41:48 - able to find your way
41:50 - once you use it for the first time so
41:52 - the help center
41:53 - is divided
41:56 - by
41:57 - articles for teachers
41:59 - articles for admins and articles for
42:02 - teachers and admins so this would be
42:05 - things relating to classroom classroom
42:07 - dashboard management articles for
42:09 - students which is basically
42:14 - text explanations on
42:16 - how to log in as a student
42:19 - and then frequently ask questions and
42:22 - dive deeper articles about
42:24 - the courses
42:29 - and
42:31 - okay so let's
42:36 - let's do a brief q a before we finish so
42:40 - we see that we have
42:42 - one question
42:43 - from
42:44 - jennifer hi jennifer
42:46 - let me just read it for a second
42:50 - okay because it's a sorry
42:53 - [Music]
42:59 - maya i will um i will check the health
43:01 - center and we'll get back to jennifer
43:03 - with the
43:04 - with the issue with it it means that
43:06 - they
43:07 - instead of using the class code they try
43:09 - to sign up maybe there weren't enough
43:12 - seats on your
43:15 - account so
43:17 - they couldn't join with the class code
43:18 - or maybe they entered the wrong class
43:21 - code so they tried to sign up students
43:24 - and then they had to enter their age and
43:26 - if their age is
43:27 - 13 or less which i assume it is then
43:30 - they get this message that they are not
43:32 - um old enough to join so but i will
43:35 - check the your um
43:38 - um your conversation uh on the help desk
43:41 - and now on the support and then i will
43:43 - get back to you right after this webinar
43:49 - thank you
43:51 - jennifer says thank you as well if
43:53 - anybody has any questions then
43:55 - if you could please
43:57 - either raise your hand or write them in
44:00 - the chat
44:11 - let's give people a second to write
44:14 - something if they need to
44:31 - okay so
44:33 - if nobody has
44:34 - any further questions then i think uh we
44:37 - can wrap this webinar up and i'll just
44:40 - remind everybody that this webinar was
44:43 - recorded and it will be will be live on
44:46 - our website uh within a week or so you
44:49 - will be able to access it through the
44:51 - teacher resources
44:53 - and
44:55 - let's just show you through the teacher
44:57 - resources if you click the
44:59 - visit webinar page
45:02 - you're also able to find on the webinar
45:04 - page a lot of uh
45:07 - um previously recorded webinars that are
45:10 - uh dealing with either specific subjects
45:13 - or general uh
45:16 - getting started with teacher getting
45:18 - started with code monkey for teachers
45:20 - explanations and also for students and
45:25 - and
45:26 - i
45:27 - want to thank everybody again for
45:29 - joining us today
45:31 - thank you for taking the time and please
45:34 - if any any of the questions are remained
45:36 - unanswered then
45:39 - you can always
45:42 - talk to us through the help center or by
45:44 - using the chat bot that for some reason
45:47 - i can't see it right now but it's always
45:49 - on the bottom right hand right here and
45:52 - there's a chat bot and you can write to
45:55 - our support center we enter within a day
45:57 - or two maximum
45:59 - so thank you for joining today i'm very
46:02 - happy
46:03 - to meet all of you and have a great rest
46:06 - of your day
