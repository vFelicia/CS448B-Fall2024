00:00 - a lot of our students when they start in
00:01 - Middle School don't know what coding is
00:04 - or often think it's very difficult or
00:06 - something that they won't be able to
00:07 - learn but I think Code Monkey does a
00:09 - very great job at breaking it down and
00:12 - making coding seem easy and not so scary
00:15 - our teachers really love the resources
00:17 - and features in Code Monkey I know they
00:19 - really appreciate the student progress
00:21 - chart they can see at a glance how many
00:24 - levels students have completed and know
00:26 - if they're needing Assistance or
00:28 - reteaching students are excited to log
00:31 - on and get farther into the program they
00:33 - like the instant feedback and the
00:35 - step-by-step instruction and a lot of
00:38 - them have made it kind of like a
00:40 - competition in their classroom so
00:42 - they'll see who can get Farther Along
00:44 - schools that are not using Code Monkey
00:46 - are missing out Code Monkey is a program
00:48 - that is loved by both teachers and
00:50 - students and I feel like it's hard to
00:52 - come across a program that is loved by
00:54 - both they have Hands-On learning they
00:56 - learn problem solving skills creativity
00:59 - and real world application
