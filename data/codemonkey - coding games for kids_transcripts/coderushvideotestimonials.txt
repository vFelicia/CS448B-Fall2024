00:04 - the coderush competition is such a cool
00:07 - way to engage the students in coding so
00:10 - I would totally encourage you to sign up
00:12 - at the collage competition when it
00:13 - starts because my students were so
00:15 - excited to code it so I started to use
00:21 - code monkey towards the end of last
00:25 - winter the beginning of spring so we
00:27 - started the competition with two teams I
00:30 - didn't think I would have two teams to
00:33 - enter
00:33 - [Music]
00:37 - I really like the different challenges
00:40 - that code monkey awkard I felt that it
00:42 - was very basic at the beginning and the
00:46 - kids were able to build on the skills
00:47 - that they learned as they went through
00:49 - the competition and it was fun like to
00:53 - see what everybody's up to and to catch
00:55 - up the kids loved different challenges
01:04 - they thought that they were amazing they
01:06 - could not wait until different levels
01:09 - opened up in the competition each week
01:11 - and some kids as soon as they got home
01:13 - from school they would spend hours on
01:15 - money like someone else said even a cup
01:20 - of coding master might have trouble on
01:24 - it and that's ok because that is natural
01:28 - they helped each other not just within
01:30 - the team but they helped the other team
01:32 - as well I was very proud of all of these
