00:07 - so um
00:10 - oh sorry so thank you Zach and thanks
00:13 - everyone for uh coming uh that's my
00:16 - favorite time of the year they are of
00:17 - codeweek Computer Science Education week
00:19 - so
00:21 - um
00:21 - a little bit by myself and my background
00:24 - so I was born in Israel
00:26 - uh uh in 82 and both my parents actually
00:29 - are software Engineers
00:32 - um so me and my young brother the uh
00:35 - other Code Monkey co-founder uh started
00:38 - coding at a very young age naturally we
00:41 - were growing up with the first Apple
00:43 - computers at home
00:45 - um I think by the age of 10 we were
00:47 - creating our own computer games uh for
00:49 - fun
00:52 - um so that was my uh background in
00:56 - computer science my entry into the
00:58 - coding World
01:00 - um
01:01 - then when I was 19 I started
01:04 - [Music]
01:04 - um
01:06 - um volunteering and education
01:09 - um uh and I started my own coding
01:11 - courses for children the year was 2001.
01:16 - um so that's when I got into my first
01:19 - stage of Education
01:22 - um and that's also when the first
01:23 - inspiration for a cold monkey came from
01:25 - from those classes that I created my
01:27 - lesson plans that uh I created little
01:30 - games for the lessons computer games
01:32 - that children my students had to
01:34 - progress through the game
01:36 - uh by writing code and those games are
01:39 - very very basic like no Graphics at all
01:42 - very basic graphic uh but that was the
01:46 - first inspiration for Code Monkey wow
01:49 - um you know not to give away your age
01:52 - Jonathan but when you started
01:54 - not so long ago but a little bit time
01:57 - ago yeah
01:59 - um now you know thankfully we're at a
02:02 - ploy Place globally where it's more
02:05 - accepted for children to code and to
02:08 - teach coding whether you're in the
02:10 - United States Canada uh India Australia
02:13 - wherever you may be and wherever all
02:15 - these people who are joining us on this
02:16 - webinar
02:18 - um why did you think to teach coding did
02:20 - you know was important back then
02:22 - you know like is it something that you I
02:25 - mean I know it's something you did but
02:28 - why did you feel that it was important
02:29 - to teach coding and maybe and why not
02:31 - math or other subjects
02:35 - it's a good question
02:37 - I started coding in one in a similar
02:40 - course like when I was nine I think my
02:42 - mother signed me up for a like a coding
02:45 - summer class
02:48 - um
02:49 - so I knew from my experience that it's
02:52 - easy to start coding early and that it's
02:54 - it could be a lot of fun it's a fun
02:56 - skill to have
02:59 - um
03:00 - and I was already working as a coder at
03:02 - the time I started during my last year
03:05 - in high school uh having a part-time job
03:07 - in software development it was you know
03:09 - very lucrative uh for for 17 or 17 year
03:14 - old kid and I just thought I was working
03:16 - back then in a like a
03:18 - uh with children from underserved
03:22 - communities like uh immigrant families
03:24 - in Israel
03:26 - um and I just thought this is a great
03:29 - skill I could give those children that
03:32 - I'm working with as an enabler for
03:35 - social Mobility
03:37 - um
03:37 - uh and it actually worked like they they
03:39 - learned very quickly and some of them
03:41 - later chose to to this as a career path
03:47 - um that was the thinking wow very really
03:50 - really interesting so be before we jump
03:52 - into sort of that answer and then go
03:55 - into the start of Code Monkey and how
03:57 - that began
03:59 - um you're a software developer you still
04:02 - have those skill sets what what made
04:05 - what pushed you towards the education
04:09 - world you know you could have been in
04:12 - financial you could have been a sorry
04:13 - for developer in sports and as and
04:16 - especially as we know like there's you
04:18 - know there's so many ways that the you
04:21 - know children today as they learn is
04:23 - that adults can get into different
04:25 - Industries what about education
04:28 - um made you like why did you come into
04:30 - this industry of all other Industries
04:32 - when you had the skill sets to do so
04:35 - good question uh
04:40 - so I think I wasn't planning to like
04:43 - like I said my the house I grew up in
04:45 - was all around software and Tech and
04:48 - Entrepreneurship and nobody was
04:51 - um talking about education as an
04:54 - occupation where I grew up
04:57 - but then I sort of stumbled upon the
04:59 - world of Education in Israel when you
05:00 - when you finish high school you have to
05:02 - go to the Army or either you go to the
05:03 - Army or you do like um social
05:06 - volunteering in hospitals or or
05:09 - education in underserved communities
05:12 - so I did that
05:15 - um
05:16 - and it's really hard once you've started
05:19 - working in education working with
05:21 - children
05:22 - uh connecting with them spending time
05:25 - with them affecting their lives it's
05:27 - really hard to to go back to like a
05:30 - plain office job I think like you really
05:33 - want to continue having this exciting
05:39 - um I don't know influence important
05:41 - influence on others people's lives and
05:43 - and also just having this
05:47 - um
05:49 - this type of like special unique
05:52 - challenge of finding ways of uh giving
05:56 - skills to to young people
05:59 - wow yeah and it's and it's very uh
06:01 - commendable you know one of the things
06:03 - which you know we we bring up a lot is
06:06 - is the skill of coding being able to
06:09 - code in software development is as you
06:12 - mentioned could be quite a lucrative
06:13 - career you could really get great jobs
06:15 - in so many different places
06:17 - and uh to take the time and you know
06:21 - sacrifice you know whether you know not
06:24 - to go into full details but the
06:25 - sacrifice and go into education is quite
06:27 - is quite commendable and and it's paid
06:30 - off given that code monkey has grown all
06:32 - over the world so uh you mentioned how
06:35 - you you taught young students After High
06:38 - School uh young children
06:41 - um coding so maybe you could elaborate
06:44 - on that and talk a little bit about how
06:46 - that
06:47 - led to starting code monkey and sort of
06:51 - that Journey uh and all the different
06:53 - parts there because I know there there's
06:55 - there's a lot there so whatever you feel
06:57 - is uh great for the kids here and
06:59 - teachers to learn
07:01 - so there was a journey
07:04 - uh and I guess I'll start with the end
07:06 - like that the final conclusion from the
07:09 - journey is that timing is everything I
07:11 - guess because after I started those
07:13 - courses uh the year was 2001 and I
07:16 - wanted to create something like Code
07:17 - Monkey right after that like in 2002 but
07:21 - I ended up starting Code Monkey
07:22 - successfully only 12 years later or 13
07:26 - years later in 2014.
07:30 - um and in between I had to do like I had
07:34 - to sort of wait for the
07:36 - for the opportunity to to mature I guess
07:40 - so
07:41 - I started I went to University I got my
07:44 - computer science degree I started code
07:45 - monkey as a
07:47 - like an academic project
07:50 - um
07:52 - but that wasn't I think a good platform
07:54 - for uh from Israel to to reach a large
07:58 - scale and to create like a good enough
08:00 - product
08:02 - so I had to wait to graduate from
08:05 - University and then I
08:07 - um I tried to start Code Monkey for the
08:09 - first time in 2007.
08:12 - uh with the third Code Monkey founder is
08:15 - shy
08:16 - um
08:17 - but it was just too early like teaching
08:19 - kids to code wasn't a big thing back
08:21 - then education technology is one big
08:23 - thing like No Angel Investors we see
08:26 - like Venture Capital firms nobody wanted
08:28 - to invest in educational technology and
08:30 - specifically in technology for teaching
08:33 - kids to code like everyone said wow this
08:35 - is I would love to have such a product
08:36 - for my kids but this is not a good
08:39 - business to invest in because because
08:41 - not a lot of people uh
08:45 - would want to buy this like just like a
08:47 - small niche of maybe parents who are
08:49 - themselves into computer science and
08:51 - things like that so we failed back then
08:54 - in 2007 and only in 2013 uh
09:00 - the an edtech incubator was started in
09:03 - Israel because attic became I think
09:04 - educational technology became a thing in
09:06 - the in the Venture Capital Community and
09:09 - specifically teaching kids to code uh
09:12 - became a huge Trend back then the big
09:16 - nonprofit code that are responsible for
09:18 - the hour of code week Computer Science
09:20 - Education week was founded by an ex I
09:23 - think Microsoft executive was funded by
09:27 - by Google and Microsoft and all those
09:29 - for them it was simply because they were
09:32 - struggling with the shortage in in
09:34 - software developers so they wanted to to
09:37 - increase awareness to the importance of
09:39 - teaching computer science in school
09:41 - so then when we started Code Monkey in
09:44 - 2014
09:46 - uh success came uh very quickly
09:55 - I think you muted
09:56 - at least I don't hear
09:58 - thank you
10:00 - um I guess you know you touched on some
10:02 - of this but maybe you could talk a bit
10:06 - about some of the challenges you faced
10:10 - in terms of starting Code Monkey not
10:13 - just in terms of the market but you know
10:15 - you you have that backer and you were
10:17 - coding you were building something you
10:19 - were from Israel you're trying to grow
10:21 - this like talk about uh you know it's
10:24 - important for teachers and students to
10:26 - learn about you know now we're at a
10:29 - different place you have millions of
10:31 - kids using it and and schools and that's
10:33 - fantastic uh but wasn't always like that
10:36 - right at the beginning that's for sure
10:37 - how to what were some of those
10:39 - challenges you overcome how did you
10:41 - maintain that that ability to you know
10:44 - you know overcome those challenges as
10:46 - opposed to just saying you know what I
10:48 - could just go work for a company so
10:50 - there's sort of those two things you
10:51 - know challenges I know what enabled you
10:53 - to ensure that those challenges were
10:55 - overcome
10:56 - yeah
10:58 - um so
11:00 - that's a big question
11:02 - um I guess when starting a startup
11:05 - company
11:07 - um I Heard once they've done a research
11:09 - one it's it's like a caterpillar that
11:11 - has many different legs but all the legs
11:13 - have to take steps at the same time more
11:16 - or less so
11:18 - so like first we created like a
11:20 - prototype of the product
11:22 - um and that was really simple at
11:25 - creating a very small game that children
11:27 - liked and children and actually learned
11:30 - to code while playing it so that was the
11:33 - fun part
11:35 - um and the easy part so to speak because
11:37 - uh we got accepted into this incubator
11:40 - we received like a small investment from
11:42 - the incubator we kept our jobs like
11:45 - part-time jobs and in our the three
11:47 - co-founders we were all coders ourselves
11:49 - so we just created the game ourselves uh
11:52 - tried it in classrooms in schools in
11:54 - Israel
11:56 - um that was the easy part the hard part
11:58 - I guess is getting noticed
12:02 - um
12:02 - by potential users teachers potential
12:06 - Partners resellers schools governments
12:09 - and getting the attention of investors
12:13 - because Beyond just creating a small
12:15 - prototype coding it yourself everything
12:18 - else costs a lot of money like
12:21 - Marketing sales
12:24 - all of that
12:26 - um
12:27 - so yeah it was really just like always
12:30 - finding like the next step
12:33 - I remember for example the first large
12:36 - exposure that we received from users
12:38 - from teachers and students and families
12:40 - would through the computer science
12:41 - education week the hour of code uh we we
12:45 - shared this prototype that we had with
12:47 - code.org the foundation running uh the
12:51 - hour of code and they put it on their
12:53 - website and I remember around this time
12:55 - of the year uh eight years ago we just
12:59 - like overnight received like millions of
13:01 - users
13:02 - [Music]
13:03 - um
13:03 - um
13:05 - um yeah so that was one like jumping
13:08 - board for the exposure part and we had
13:11 - similar stories on how like one investor
13:14 - led to him the next investor larger
13:17 - investor than a strategic investor that
13:18 - also played as a distributor in a
13:20 - certain market and and so on so it's
13:23 - always about finding the next step in
13:26 - each one of those
13:28 - um
13:28 - each one of those uh challenges that
13:32 - you're trying to coordinate like
13:33 - exposure Marketing sales funding and of
13:36 - course uh product development right
13:40 - um and just because I have a question
13:42 - right here which I think ties nicely in
13:44 - it talked about challenges and then
13:45 - overcoming those
13:47 - um and you mentioned uh code.org and
13:50 - having millions of users due to the hour
13:52 - of code week that's one example can you
13:55 - maybe share a specific moment
13:59 - um in since 2014 with code monkey that
14:04 - was uh one of like the very happy
14:07 - moments in your in your you know
14:11 - startup process and even now so just
14:14 - something that you know all these kids
14:16 - everyone goes you know teachers they
14:18 - work so hard they have their own
14:20 - challenges and then they come out with
14:21 - like a great test that they studied on
14:22 - so like what is what is your example of
14:25 - that
14:26 - of a happy moment yeah
14:29 - uh well that night when we received like
14:32 - millions of you right so that's a good
14:34 - example that was an amazing week I
14:37 - remember that we almost didn't get any
14:39 - sleep that week we were busy uh
14:42 - maintaining the server so it doesn't
14:44 - crash we weren't expecting this huge
14:47 - traffic uh users
14:50 - um that was one
14:53 - [Music]
14:55 - uh other other
14:57 - interesting moments sleep
15:01 - I remember a specific meeting with uh we
15:04 - had like an angel investor putting a
15:06 - small amount of money uh a guy from
15:08 - Israel who's also a tech entrepreneur
15:11 - um and he told me I have a visitor from
15:14 - Japan he's my distributor for my stock
15:16 - company was creating like long-range
15:18 - Wi-Fi routers he said my distributor in
15:21 - Japan is now in Israel I told you about
15:23 - you I told him about your company I
15:25 - think you should meet him and we sat
15:27 - down uh in the beach bar until I believe
15:30 - I remember it was Midday
15:32 - and I told him about the code monkey and
15:35 - like just interrupted me like in the
15:37 - middle of my pitch banged his his glass
15:40 - of beer on the table and said I want in
15:43 - I wanna I Wanna Be The Exclusive
15:45 - distributor in Japan and I want to
15:46 - invest I don't care about the terms
15:49 - like when you're fundraising let me know
15:52 - I'll be the first investor in the next
15:54 - round so I remember that was a happy
15:55 - moment well it is that's great it's
15:59 - great here it's it is unbelievable
16:00 - myself working at Code Monkey just
16:02 - seeing the global reach and how many
16:05 - places we've traveled to it and how many
16:07 - times we see pictures right now for
16:10 - those for those of you who don't know
16:11 - there's uh there's a contest for those
16:14 - who are using hour of code you could
16:16 - take a picture of your children using it
16:18 - and and tweets uh Code Monkey we're
16:21 - giving away a free home license as well
16:23 - as uh a gift card for the best picture
16:26 - for those who are enjoying Code Monkey
16:28 - so definitely uh um maybe uh Angie can
16:31 - put that in uh in in the end or when
16:34 - we'll we'll send it as a follow-up
16:36 - um Jonathan gonna take a break from some
16:38 - of my questions because in the Q a we've
16:42 - had a couple and it seems like a good
16:43 - place to uh to answer those so
16:46 - one person asked about
16:49 - um would you please give your thoughts
16:51 - on the quickest approach to learn how to
16:55 - code
16:56 - so
16:57 - I would say maybe not quickest but
16:59 - what's a great way to learn code and
17:01 - obviously you'll probably talk about
17:02 - code monkey and why Code Monkey is a
17:06 - great way to learn how to code
17:08 - yeah so so actually I have one important
17:11 - like Nuance to to address whenever uh I
17:15 - guess that question I remember before I
17:18 - started Code Monkey successfully between
17:20 - the first failed the time and the second
17:22 - successful attempt I was working in the
17:23 - software developer
17:25 - um
17:26 - and then like a lot of people were
17:28 - looking to transition from other careers
17:30 - into software development it was the
17:33 - 2000 and
17:35 - uh for like the the tech boom one of the
17:38 - you know Tech rooms
17:41 - um and then uh so you had all those ads
17:43 - online telling you like targeting
17:46 - grown-ups saying learn to code in seven
17:48 - days learn to code in in uh you know uh
17:52 - 24 hours learning to code uh become a
17:55 - software developer in one month and then
17:57 - I remember reading an article saying
17:59 - like
18:00 - learned to code in like 14 years like
18:03 - the truth about how long it takes to
18:05 - really become a you know a decent
18:08 - software developer and they were talking
18:09 - about like the good software developer
18:11 - they started early and it really takes
18:13 - you to with any I guess skill or job
18:18 - craft uh like to become really good at
18:21 - something to become employable and to
18:23 - become like good at what you do we take
18:25 - Serious
18:25 - [Music]
18:26 - um
18:27 - so I guess I will change the question a
18:32 - little bit is what is the quickest way
18:33 - to get like a
18:35 - an initial successful Taste of coding
18:37 - like an exposure to
18:40 - to programmatic thinking
18:43 - um
18:44 - and I think the best way to do that is
18:46 - actually through the hour of code week
18:48 - and all of those different small
18:50 - activities that use the gamified way
18:54 - short gamified course to give young
18:57 - children really a taste of what coding
19:00 - is and it can be using a real
19:02 - programming language like you do on on
19:04 - some of the Code Monkey Arrow code
19:06 - activities or it can be just those
19:08 - scratch style building blocks drag and
19:11 - drop things actually my daughter is now
19:13 - five so I started doing that with her
19:15 - using Code Monkey Junior uh
19:18 - yeah I think it's not the coincidence
19:21 - that those games and the arrow code weak
19:23 - became very popular because I think it's
19:25 - a great way to get quickly into coding
19:28 - not to become a coder quickly but to get
19:31 - into coding yeah it's a it's a great
19:33 - that's a great difference
19:36 - um
19:37 - someone and I and I guess you know using
19:40 - Code Monkey is that has all those
19:42 - aspects as gamified coding and a really
19:46 - just very simple way to to jump into
19:49 - into uh coding maybe not becoming the
19:53 - coding coder in the quickest way again
19:55 - that's not uh the what we we're trying
19:58 - we're trying to get them in and and
19:59 - really get them uh those basic skills so
20:04 - what's what's uh special about
20:08 - Code Monkey
20:09 - in terms of whether it is that jumping
20:13 - in the being ease of it or actually
20:15 - after being in Code Monkey for x amount
20:17 - of years and using it for a while you
20:19 - come out with with what so sort of the
20:22 - going and what makes Code Monkey
20:24 - different from uh maybe other programs
20:27 - not in specific where our code week
20:30 - everyone's all the coding companies are
20:32 - doing great work
20:35 - I think oh they're really there are so
20:38 - many excellent
20:40 - products we're teaching kids to code
20:44 - um and each which one is a bit different
20:47 - but
20:48 - [Music]
20:48 - um
20:50 - I wouldn't say that Code Monkey like
20:54 - something unique that no other products
20:56 - have but I I I I would say I will say
20:59 - that for Code Monkey
21:02 - um
21:02 - I think the priority
21:06 - um was always
21:08 - the top priority was creating an
21:12 - engaging experience for the learners for
21:14 - the for the young students
21:17 - and that was achieved through many
21:20 - different aspects of the product uh we
21:23 - always it's always crucial for us to
21:25 - keep the the courses very intuitive and
21:29 - self-paced so that students uh can learn
21:33 - on their own at their own pace uh to
21:36 - keep the courses like to create the game
21:39 - a very like full-blown game experience
21:42 - like not a gamified course but an actual
21:45 - game
21:46 - and this doesn't mean that it needs to
21:48 - be like a very fancy game in a 3D World
21:50 - with a lot of visual effects and noises
21:52 - and sound of the contrary the the
21:54 - simpler the game is there was a research
21:57 - on that recently in Israel and the
21:59 - simpler the game is the better the
22:01 - learning outcomes are but the game does
22:03 - need to be a full-blown game like it
22:05 - needs to be and there needs to be
22:07 - characters you need to be a plot
22:10 - um the kids need to be like they need to
22:14 - get like sort of immersed in this in
22:16 - this game world
22:18 - so it was intuitiveness the the
22:20 - full-blown game experience
22:22 - um and then of course the pedagogy uh
22:26 - this is the most important thing when
22:27 - creating educational content so it's
22:30 - really like
22:31 - being mindful of a lot of and many many
22:35 - like small details and planning how you
22:38 - break the complex concept into simpler
22:42 - concept and creating this sequence where
22:45 - you build the uh the understanding of
22:49 - each concept like one on top of the
22:51 - other
22:52 - wow that's great and I highly suggest uh
22:55 - I'm sure many of you who are attending
22:57 - this webinar have already tried Code
22:58 - Monkey if not definitely go on
23:00 - codemonkey.com to register for uh free
23:02 - trial it's great so one more question
23:04 - before I get back into my list of
23:07 - questions Jonathan someone asked
23:10 - um May I know why it's called code
23:12 - monkey and the significance of its name
23:15 - yeah the name was very significant it's
23:18 - a catchy name and uh also a catchy logo
23:21 - I think
23:24 - um
23:24 - and
23:26 - um
23:27 - so we sort of borrowed the term Code
23:30 - Monkey uh it's not a term that that we
23:32 - created it was an existing term in the
23:34 - tech word
23:35 - uh
23:37 - uh it's sort of like a funny decoratory
23:39 - term for the junior coders on each
23:42 - software development team like the the
23:44 - most Junior coder coders you refer to
23:47 - them like as an internal joke is code
23:49 - monkeys and whenever you know you you
23:51 - break a large software project into many
23:54 - small pieces you give the the simpler
23:56 - task to the code monkeys like to the
23:58 - junior coders
24:01 - um so yeah so it's actually a decoratory
24:02 - term but there's nobody outside the tech
24:04 - world knows it so we thought we could
24:06 - just use it as a create a character a
24:09 - monkey character and that was actually
24:11 - my brother though the CTO the other
24:14 - co-founder of Code Monkey he came up
24:16 - with the name and the game concept of
24:18 - monkey collecting bananas
24:20 - wow yeah
24:22 - um it's exciting and you know it's Let's
24:25 - uh you talk to Brett at the beginning
24:26 - about getting noticed right you know you
24:28 - created a great program but to get
24:30 - noticed is sometimes Harden requires
24:32 - more than just having a great product
24:34 - that also requires the marketing and how
24:36 - you show so definitely that's been been
24:39 - important
24:40 - I Remember by the way this slide to your
24:42 - earlier question about a happy moment so
24:43 - when I moved from Tel Aviv to New York
24:45 - when Code Monkey reached that stage it
24:48 - was time to move to the United States
24:49 - and start the U.S office so I was
24:51 - getting a lot of reaction in New York
24:53 - like when I was telling people like just
24:55 - visiting a doctor or whatever uh what
24:57 - are you doing oh I started Coleman can
24:59 - say yeah Code Monkey I think I heard of
25:01 - it I think I know it and often I was
25:03 - thinking there's no way this person
25:05 - really knows Code Monkey but but I know
25:07 - the term sounds familiar so it made us
25:09 - sort of being perceived as bigger than
25:11 - than we really were at the time right
25:14 - wherever that's that is
25:17 - it's pretty uh pretty amazing
25:20 - um Okay so
25:23 - you know we we've talked about a number
25:25 - of number of items here about what was
25:28 - how you uh your background and code
25:31 - monkey's background so want to talk a
25:34 - little bit you know Code Monkey started
25:35 - you know eight years ago eight nine
25:38 - years ago what has changed and what has
25:42 - remained the same whether it's uh talk
25:45 - about the platform you could talk about
25:47 - maybe the the company itself but uh you
25:52 - know there's uh it's like a it's a
25:54 - company but it's a live company and
25:56 - there's things going on so what has
25:58 - changed and what has remained the same
26:01 - so we'll remain the same is you know our
26:05 - day-to-day of creating
26:07 - game-based coding courses for children
26:10 - and we pretty much do it the same way
26:12 - that we did it back then we create like
26:14 - a small initial version of a course we
26:16 - tried with children we we write down you
26:20 - know feedback from the user testing then
26:24 - we create a full version of the course
26:26 - release it get feedbacks from students
26:28 - teach your parents improve the course uh
26:31 - this hasn't changed and we you do it
26:34 - through the pedagogy a pedagogical
26:35 - experts software developers animators
26:37 - musicians so they stayed the same and
26:40 - I'm glad it did this is my favorite part
26:43 - of the of our work creating the courses
26:47 - and using them with children and getting
26:49 - the feedback and improving the courses
26:51 - uh what did change is the business side
26:56 - so back then as a startup company your
26:59 - main concern is
27:02 - reaching significant like success
27:06 - Milestones it would allow fundraising
27:08 - additional
27:09 - money from investor before you run out
27:12 - of the money that you raised previously
27:14 - and this was I'm glad we're beyond that
27:18 - stage because this is pretty
27:21 - um nerve-wracking
27:24 - um
27:25 - and and you you get it wears you out
27:29 - like this this sort of Chase
27:32 - um uh always chasing after a more invest
27:35 - investments before the money Runs Out
27:37 - and now that the companies were
27:40 - established and profitable uh so the
27:43 - business
27:45 - um the business challenge is is
27:47 - something I enjoy
27:49 - way more than the business Channel and
27:51 - the startup stage and it's just the
27:52 - challenge of
27:54 - sort of optimizing the business uh
27:56 - steadily growing it
27:58 - uh becoming better at planning becoming
28:01 - better at planning making business plan
28:03 - executing business plans becoming better
28:05 - at hiring the right people building the
28:08 - accurate teams managing them
28:12 - um
28:13 - better
28:15 - um yeah so it's really now about sort of
28:18 - optimizing the
28:21 - uh as uh as like sort of business
28:23 - professionals
28:25 - right yeah that's uh the right Partners
28:28 - as you know Zach right is something that
28:29 - we really be better in like you know
28:32 - yeah right Partners in each country and
28:34 - yeah yeah it's uh it's also interesting
28:38 - to really see
28:41 - um you know so many so many students who
28:45 - get to benefit from the program and that
28:48 - that focus and and you know keeping to
28:53 - the idea of from the beginning we were
28:56 - making gamified engaging coding courses
28:59 - for kids and we are still doing that and
29:02 - yeah so that's that's it's very hard to
29:04 - continue to do and but you know I can
29:07 - from my own experience it's it's true
29:09 - what's happening
29:11 - um so just looking a little bit to the
29:14 - Future
29:15 - you know we we've for those who don't
29:17 - know and it's it's I I highly suggest
29:19 - you all try out we've launched two new
29:23 - courses in digital literacy uh these are
29:27 - our first
29:29 - non-coding courses we have uh one on
29:32 - digital use
29:33 - um and digital citizenship we launched
29:35 - them this year a few months ago and
29:37 - they're being highly used they're
29:39 - they're beloved they're a new course but
29:42 - it's something that's completely
29:43 - different that we've done in the sense
29:45 - that they're not coding they're gamified
29:47 - learning programs but not coding so
29:51 - um where do you see Code Monkey in five
29:53 - years you know knowing you know we've
29:55 - launched these two courses but any type
29:58 - of vision or anything whether it's the
30:00 - courses or you know
30:02 - um anything like that that you could
30:04 - speak on would be great
30:07 - so I see cold monkey continue to
30:11 - [Music]
30:12 - um
30:13 - to grow on the path that we chose the
30:15 - recent few years of sort of
30:17 - transitioning from being
30:19 - um
30:19 - a courses company like specific courses
30:23 - coding courses to becoming a curriculum
30:26 - provider
30:28 - and that means covering Entire Computer
30:31 - Science curriculum according to
30:32 - different standards in different parts
30:34 - of the world so that's not only coding
30:36 - like you said it can include other
30:38 - subjects in computer science
30:41 - and to cover the entire pathway from
30:45 - kindergarten to eighth grade
30:48 - um
30:49 - and also to provide for all the
30:53 - different needs in uh
30:56 - required for for
30:58 - implementing computer science uh
31:01 - curriculum so that's not only the coding
31:04 - courses for the children that we've
31:05 - always been doing but uh also more about
31:10 - teacher resources teacher tools
31:13 - professional development for teachers
31:15 - customer success method that we improve
31:19 - every year
31:20 - to make sure that implementation is
31:22 - successful assessment quizzes
31:26 - um yeah all those other very crucial
31:29 - pillars that uh a curriculum solution uh
31:32 - relies on
31:34 - great
31:36 - um thank you do you
31:39 - with working on teacher tools and
31:44 - um the platform for teachers
31:47 - how do you feel the teacher's experience
31:51 - has been using Code Monkey
31:55 - um if they do have a background or
31:58 - don'ts
32:01 - so it was always uh actually the the
32:05 - problem that we were solving and still
32:07 - are is how to enable
32:11 - quick scaling of Computer Science
32:13 - Education despite the
32:15 - constant lack or shortage of computer
32:18 - science teachers in K-8 or in winning
32:21 - K-12
32:23 - and I don't expect that to change soon
32:26 - because
32:28 - [Music]
32:28 - um
32:29 - but if you have computer science skills
32:32 - often you would choose
32:35 - um like a computer science in Tech I
32:39 - think that's the reason why it's always
32:41 - hard to find like computer science
32:43 - teachers with coding background
32:47 - [Music]
32:48 - um
32:49 - so so our challenge was always to sort
32:53 - of
32:54 - um bridge that Gap and to create a
32:57 - curriculum solution that would not
32:59 - require coding background from the
33:01 - teachers so we're sort of also teaching
33:04 - the teachers or helping the teacher like
33:06 - allowing the teacher to learn with their
33:08 - students as they go along
33:11 - yeah so so being successful with
33:15 - teaching with code monk you definitely
33:16 - don't need to have Computer Science
33:19 - Background the entire ID behind Code
33:22 - Monkey was to create a curriculum that
33:24 - would not require coding background from
33:26 - the teachers right we have
33:29 - um one of the uh attendees of this
33:33 - webinar uh she wrote in the Q a but
33:36 - really page best off-road teachers I
33:38 - know love Code Monkey most of us didn't
33:40 - know anything about coding before using
33:42 - we're learning along with our students
33:47 - yeah yeah and I think that's fun I think
33:49 - it's a it's an interesting it's
33:50 - something that's changing now in the
33:52 - education world with the internet and
33:53 - all like children they can learn things
33:55 - on their own on YouTube and and you know
33:58 - uh teachers are no longer expected to
34:01 - become the source of knowledge and it's
34:04 - more and more common to see classrooms
34:06 - and courses in school where teachers
34:07 - learn something new with their students
34:10 - and I think this is actually like this
34:13 - is sometimes
34:15 - um
34:17 - I don't know a better experience or like
34:19 - I think everybody's having more fun that
34:21 - way
34:23 - um
34:23 - yeah not not just with computer science
34:25 - right no that is interesting
34:29 - um have just a couple more questions
34:30 - here so uh if anyone of the attendees
34:34 - has any questions please make sure you
34:36 - write them
34:37 - um in the uh Q and A and where uh Angie
34:42 - is also answering any of the more
34:43 - technical questions uh so uh thank you
34:46 - very much Angie so
34:49 - um you've been you've been doing you've
34:51 - been at Code Monkey for some time now uh
34:54 - and
34:55 - um
34:56 - there's the happy times and challenging
34:59 - times
35:00 - um I guess this is for for everyone here
35:02 - myself included but how do you maintain
35:05 - the passion towards working at uh Code
35:07 - Monkey towards the same goal after so
35:10 - long right it's uh you've been in a
35:13 - almost decade-long marathon and uh yeah
35:16 - not everyone has that ability so what
35:18 - what enables you to be able to continue
35:21 - the work that you're that you're doing
35:24 - so I think what helps me
35:28 - um
35:29 - actually two things one of them is he
35:33 - goes back to my answer on your previous
35:35 - question that I'm learning
35:37 - to become
35:40 - I'm learning business I'm learning
35:41 - business management this is something I
35:44 - didn't have experience in and it's an
35:45 - interesting challenge in managing a
35:48 - company managing teams
35:50 - um it's about you know like working with
35:52 - people it is a by the way has some
35:55 - similarities to working working in
35:57 - education I feel uh sometimes I feel
36:00 - like my my employees are like my
36:01 - students uh in different ways
36:05 - and I like that challenge and I like
36:08 - becoming better uh
36:11 - um in management I guess
36:15 - um but on the computer science side and
36:17 - what's what what keeps this job
36:20 - interesting is that the market is still
36:25 - evolving rapidly uh it's not like math
36:28 - or English that has been taught like for
36:31 - you know thousands of years computer
36:32 - science is still a new subject it's
36:34 - still not a mandatory subject in most
36:37 - part of the world and to see how the
36:39 - market is maturing and computer science
36:42 - is being adopted in a more serious way
36:46 - gradually all over the world
36:49 - um
36:50 - it makes it more interesting and creates
36:52 - new challenges remember when we were
36:54 - beginning we're not getting questions
36:56 - about like now we're getting like
36:58 - tougher questions from clients about
36:59 - like what exactly do you teach in
37:01 - computer science how exactly do you
37:02 - teach how exactly do you assess learning
37:05 - outcomes like in the initial days nobody
37:08 - cared like they were just doing like
37:09 - just just give me some
37:11 - fun coding activity for my students for
37:14 - the article week and that's all I need
37:16 - and now it's becoming the demand the
37:18 - requirement are becoming more
37:20 - sophisticated so so you know it keeps
37:23 - things interesting
37:25 - so I on that where do you see coding in
37:30 - schools coding in after schools like
37:34 - it's it's clearly being uh put into
37:37 - curriculum globally uh do you see coding
37:41 - ever becoming something like math or
37:45 - science or a language where it's a daily
37:47 - subject or something that's in the
37:49 - weekly schedule
37:52 - uh yeah that it's definitely the trend
37:55 - is obvious if you look you know code.org
37:57 - they post statistics on that and if you
37:59 - look just as a
38:01 - on the American education system uh as
38:04 - an example and also it's probably one of
38:06 - the largest K-12 systems in the world uh
38:10 - the trend is obvious like more schools
38:13 - are offering it more students are taking
38:15 - it more teachers are teaching it more
38:17 - states are requiring schools to teach it
38:20 - or to at least offer it as an uh
38:23 - um there's an elective
38:26 - um
38:27 - yeah so so the trend is definitely there
38:30 - and it's and it's very steady
38:34 - so
38:36 - um there obviously the the uh coding is
38:41 - where we focus and we moved into digital
38:44 - digital literacy um to a certain extent
38:48 - as coding grows what other what other
38:51 - what do you feel is very important for
38:54 - young students to learn and for teachers
38:56 - to focus on
38:58 - um in technology education as well you
39:01 - know coding is important for all the
39:03 - reasons whether it's getting a job
39:05 - understanding how technology works all
39:07 - the things you mentioned but you know we
39:09 - have people here where well what's
39:12 - important for the Educators to focus on
39:14 - and for the youngers children to or
39:18 - children and students and adolescents to
39:21 - learn about in terms of Technology
39:25 - so actually I'm very excited about the
39:27 - the recent course that we launched on on
39:31 - digital citizenship
39:34 - because
39:36 - um you know uh parents and teachers
39:39 - nowadays they tend to think like today's
39:42 - children were born with iPhones so we we
39:45 - think and they can do anything on them
39:47 - so we think they don't need to be taught
39:49 - how to use a computer how to use the
39:50 - internet because they just know it
39:52 - uh uh but that is not true so you know
39:57 - they intuitively know how to post
39:59 - something on a social network or how to
40:02 - watch a video on YouTube and to comment
40:05 - uh
40:06 - um but the World Wide Web is a
40:10 - complicated uh platform uh
40:15 - um and it's also uh kind of risky uh
40:20 - especially for children not only for
40:21 - children but there are so many things
40:23 - that you should watch out for and I'm in
40:27 - no way I don't wanna like I encourage
40:29 - parents and teachers to to let the
40:31 - children
40:32 - enjoy everything that they can from
40:35 - using the internet and computers all the
40:37 - great educational content that they
40:39 - consume and social the positive social
40:41 - interaction
40:42 - self-exploration and a lot of great
40:45 - things that can be done and those
40:47 - devices and on the internet but like I
40:49 - said this this though things are now
40:51 - risk-free and children nowadays like
40:55 - adults they don't the fact that they
40:57 - know how to use the internet it doesn't
40:59 - mean that they understand how it works
41:01 - and they don't understand how it works
41:03 - they also probably are not aware of the
41:06 - risks so I think
41:09 - um yeah it's it's a good thing to focus
41:11 - on at a quite early stage
41:15 - um is is the the things that we teach on
41:18 - the digital literacy course
41:20 - how to be safe how to use the internet
41:24 - safely
41:25 - for yourself and also you know not
41:27 - hurting others
41:30 - um because you know it's a powerful tool
41:31 - but like any powerful tool it can be it
41:35 - can be also uh create damage if you're
41:38 - not using it correctly for yourself and
41:39 - for other people
41:41 - right that's that's it's great to know
41:44 - um and uh yeah we highly encourage all
41:48 - of you to try out our new digitals uh
41:51 - digital literacy courses definitely give
41:53 - us any type of feedback Angie is our
41:55 - customer success manager who gets all
41:57 - that feedback and it helps us improve
42:00 - um the courses we have two more uh one
42:05 - comment and then uh one more question
42:08 - so I'll ask the question and then I'll
42:11 - then mention the comment is uh how does
42:14 - Code Monkey contribute to learning stem
42:17 - subjects
42:22 - so we just made sure like when creating
42:25 - the code monkey games
42:27 - uh to include other stem Concepts in it
42:31 - like distances numbers negative numbers
42:33 - angles degrees
42:37 - um in the more advanced courses things
42:39 - like velocity acceleration gravity
42:41 - so
42:43 - um it's uh
42:46 - it's very easy to use coding and Code
42:49 - Monkey it's sort of a playground to
42:50 - practice those math and physics Concepts
42:53 - and Engineering but even in the courses
42:56 - that don't uh deal with stem concept
43:00 - directly the
43:02 - the actual
43:04 - challenge of coding
43:08 - um is well known to to be fostering
43:12 - other sort of 21st century skills even
43:15 - if you're just coding
43:17 - like I don't know like a small game that
43:19 - has nothing to do with stem
43:22 - um the the action of coding the the
43:25 - mental challenges involved with it are
43:28 - very helpful in developing
43:30 - skill that are useful for any other
43:31 - subject and specifically stem like you
43:33 - know critical thinking problem solving
43:35 - collaboration
43:37 - um things like that
43:39 - no that's that's that's great and and I
43:42 - think that's something that we see
43:44 - more and more
43:47 - um and hopefully as as you mentioned as
43:49 - as this Market Global Market changes
43:52 - that people will see coding not just as
43:55 - a subject unto itself that's important
43:57 - to learn but how you know whether it's
44:00 - the computational thinking or the math
44:04 - that you learn or the you know I know
44:07 - globally like outside and in certain
44:09 - non-english speaking countries they'll
44:11 - use Code Monkey in English so that they
44:14 - can practice their English there's so
44:16 - many different ways that it impacts
44:19 - um the
44:21 - um impacts other subject areas in their
44:24 - learning and I just want to you know
44:27 - take that and what you mentioned and
44:28 - said uh from from Nicole who I
44:31 - personally work with in the United
44:32 - States she wrote uh this isn't a
44:35 - question it's a thank you I'm looking
44:37 - forward to seeing how working with Code
44:38 - Monkey impacts my students outlook on
44:41 - coding related interest this is my third
44:43 - year using Code Monkey school-wide your
44:46 - programs allow us to grow and progress
44:48 - from block based to Tech space it's a
44:51 - wonderful program and so thank you very
44:53 - much Nicole for that
44:55 - um and and I think it really ties into
44:57 - everything that uh Jonathan said
45:01 - um Jonathan maybe you could give some
45:04 - closing remarks about Code Monkey about
45:06 - the hour of code
45:09 - um and then in the meantime if anyone
45:11 - asks any more questions otherwise uh we
45:13 - can then wrap up and uh we'll send
45:16 - everyone I put some links there that's
45:18 - codemonkey.com that will lead you to our
45:20 - page our website to see any of the
45:23 - information that you'd like you can sign
45:24 - up for free uh 30-day trial if you sign
45:28 - up this week we've changed the
45:30 - parameters of the trial where you can
45:32 - get unlimited students so you can get
45:34 - your old school on it and then also if
45:36 - you go on the second one that's hour of
45:38 - code those are the activities you'll see
45:40 - Code Monkey is one of the first
45:42 - activities on the hour of code page this
45:45 - is out of many many different programs
45:47 - so that's just some of the back office
45:51 - but uh yeah maybe some closing remarks
45:53 - Jonathan
45:54 - for me yeah so it's the hour of code
45:57 - week and I happen to be wearing my Nike
46:00 - uh what do you call that sweatshirt I
46:03 - remember Nike I used to study slogan
46:05 - just do it do you remember that probably
46:07 - in the 90s of course so yeah I would
46:10 - just probably conclude that is the hour
46:12 - of code week just do it just you know
46:14 - choose one of the many different free
46:16 - hour of code activities uh book a time
46:20 - with your students in a classroom with
46:23 - computers or iPads or Chromebooks and
46:25 - just do it just give them these first
46:27 - taste of coding and see where it takes
46:29 - your classroom right that's a great
46:33 - ending uh Jonathan thank you so much for
46:35 - your time uh people from all over the
46:38 - world teachers and students alike uh
