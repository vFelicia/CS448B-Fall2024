01:22 - not had the pleasure of meeting yet
01:24 - my name is mark dozier i am part of the
01:27 - customer success team at code monkey
01:30 - i joined the group at the start of the
01:31 - school year prior to that i spent
01:33 - the last 16 years as an educator i
01:36 - started as a fifth grade teacher here in
01:39 - texas a fifth grade science teacher
01:41 - before moving on to chicago where i
01:42 - worked as a technology director
01:45 - as well as a computer science teacher
01:47 - there
01:49 - i did mention that i had friends with me
01:50 - today so i
01:52 - do want to introduce or allow two of my
01:54 - amazing colleagues
01:56 - to introduce themselves
02:06 - hi everyone uh my name is lena saleh i
02:09 - am the professional development and
02:11 - sales manager here at code monkey you
02:13 - can reach me at lena.s at codemonkey.com
02:15 - or you can live tweet
02:17 - at me today at lena or sorry at lena
02:20 - codemonkey
02:21 - just a little bit of background about me
02:23 - i'm a former educator as well
02:25 - i spent over 10 years in the classroom
02:27 - and now i'm just very passionate about
02:29 - delivering computer science to students
02:33 - all right thank you lena
02:38 - hey i'm jay bloodworth i am the
02:41 - curriculum developer here at codemonkey
02:43 - um like mark i'm pretty new to the
02:45 - company i've been here for
02:47 - about six months now um but have had a
02:49 - good time before that
02:51 - i worked for 20 years as a middle school
02:53 - teacher here in south carolina
02:55 - mostly math but also a computer science
02:57 - course
02:58 - that i designed myself so that's kind of
03:00 - the role i'm in now
03:02 - writing the computer science curriculum
03:03 - for good monkey
03:06 - all right thanks lena and jay and i
03:08 - think i speak for all of us when i say
03:09 - that it's
03:11 - it's my hope that when speaking with you
03:13 - all today that we're going to be able to
03:14 - provide everybody with the confidence
03:16 - that you're going to need to effectively
03:18 - teach our game creation courses
03:20 - and then by accomplishing that the goal
03:23 - is you're going to allow your students
03:24 - to really take off and show
03:26 - how creative they can be so with that
03:29 - let's get ready to write code catch
03:31 - bananas and sing the world
03:34 - all right so taking a look at our
03:36 - objectives you can see the areas that we
03:38 - are going to cover today
03:40 - we will explain what is included in the
03:43 - game builder package
03:44 - i'm also going to define what we mean by
03:46 - game creation
03:47 - i will explain why we use it after
03:49 - coding adventure
03:52 - then we'll get into the first parts of
03:54 - platformer which is one of those game
03:55 - creation courses
03:57 - we'll also explain uh what game builder
04:00 - is and when you should use it
04:02 - then we'll show you guys some examples
04:05 - from students
04:07 - that could be found in our discover tab
04:09 - and then as always of course
04:11 - we will leave time at the end for your
04:13 - questions
04:14 - in our q a session
04:18 - so which courses are we referring to
04:21 - when we say
04:22 - game creation game builder what which
04:25 - which courses are part of that game
04:26 - builder package
04:29 - so here you see that game creation is
04:31 - composed of
04:32 - three tutorial based courses uh
04:35 - platformer which we'll cover today
04:37 - frogger and then sprite animations
04:40 - and then over to the far right you see
04:42 - game builder which is a standalone
04:43 - platform
04:44 - it's a sort of a sandbox style uh where
04:47 - the kids can just create from the ground
04:48 - up
04:50 - now with platformer your students are
04:52 - going to learn the fundamentals of game
04:53 - creation
04:54 - by building a game that's very similar
04:56 - to super mario bros
04:58 - they're going to be introduced to game
05:00 - mechanics
05:01 - such as keyboard events and timers
05:06 - in the frog course students will learn
05:08 - how to program a touchscreen game
05:10 - as they build a game that's very similar
05:12 - to that arcade classic frogger
05:14 - uh the course will also teach them how
05:16 - to program a game that utilizes the
05:18 - swiping motion that you're going to find
05:20 - in a mobile or tablet setting
05:22 - and then with the sprite animation
05:23 - course uh your students are going to
05:25 - learn how to create
05:26 - and basically bring to life uh sprites
05:28 - that can be used
05:30 - in the games that they create and then
05:32 - all this culminates with our game
05:34 - builder
05:35 - platform and that'll be the place where
05:36 - your students are going to take those
05:38 - game creation basics
05:40 - and then hopefully wow you with their
05:42 - own uh games that they've made
05:48 - all right so what is game creation so
05:51 - perhaps you've noticed
05:52 - in my course description that i use the
05:54 - word create a lot i use it very
05:56 - liberally
05:57 - and having taught you know elementary
05:59 - and middle school computer science
06:01 - i think we all can agree that it's
06:03 - really important to have that component
06:06 - and also from a buy-in view so it's not
06:08 - just
06:09 - teacher says do this i do this but now
06:11 - we're getting into i learned this let me
06:13 - show you that
06:14 - so to do this in game creation what we
06:18 - need to do
06:19 - is we need to give them a peek under the
06:20 - hood okay so
06:22 - we want to introduce them to the
06:23 - building blocks and these game mechanics
06:26 - then bring them to a point where they're
06:28 - ready to pair that knowledge
06:29 - with their creativity uh in the game
06:32 - builder platform
06:36 - so why do we use it after we complete
06:40 - coding adventure
06:41 - so this is done because coding adventure
06:44 - is going to establish a really strong
06:47 - foundation for them it's going to be a
06:49 - base level that will allow them greater
06:51 - success
06:52 - in game creation also there's going to
06:55 - be concepts that are introduced at the
06:56 - end of coding adventure
06:58 - that are expanded upon at the very
06:59 - beginning of game creation
07:05 - all right so as i mentioned earlier we
07:07 - will get into game creation
07:10 - by starting with the first lesson of
07:11 - platformer now
07:13 - technically speaking you can start with
07:15 - any of the game any of those three game
07:17 - creation courses
07:18 - but i chose platformer today primarily
07:20 - for as i said earlier the similarities
07:23 - to the super mario brothers games uh and
07:26 - your students are
07:27 - actually going to instantly recognize
07:29 - the connections between the two
07:30 - so it's a good jumping off point
07:36 - now in case some of you are unfamiliar
07:38 - with where the lesson plans
07:40 - can be found i'm going to point out that
07:42 - you can find them under the teacher
07:44 - resources
07:49 - so here this is your teacher home page
07:51 - under the teacher resources i have
07:52 - lesson plans
07:55 - and if i scroll down i find the game
07:56 - builder package
07:58 - and you see here platformer is the first
08:00 - one there
08:05 - also with these lessons you'll see
08:08 - they're very similar to coding adventure
08:10 - and that in the way that they're
08:11 - structured uh so the lessons are
08:13 - basically broken up into three parts
08:17 - so you'll start with your introduction
08:20 - and it usually includes
08:21 - objectives and components so the
08:23 - components to think of those as the
08:25 - concepts that are going to be learned
08:27 - part two let's scroll down a little bit
08:31 - more
08:35 - so part two will put the play time this
08:37 - is where the students will actually
08:39 - explore the lesson
08:40 - and then of course we end with part
08:42 - three with our debrief
08:45 - so in platformer i want to point out
08:46 - that you will have seven lessons
08:49 - and each of them is designed for about
08:51 - uh 45 minutes
08:58 - all right so to jump jump start this
09:00 - platform of course we're going to use a
09:01 - very cool and engaging
09:03 - unplugged activity and unplugged
09:05 - activities hopefully you know by now
09:07 - are these critical pieces in each of our
09:09 - code monkey lessons
09:11 - and at their core they allow you as a
09:13 - teacher to break down
09:14 - what can sometimes be a difficult
09:16 - concept into something that's uh
09:18 - you know relatable and easy to
09:20 - understand so this particular
09:22 - unplugged activity that we're going to
09:23 - show you guys today is going to serve as
09:25 - an introduction to a major concept
09:28 - that you're going to find throughout
09:29 - game design and that concept
09:31 - is this concept of event driven
09:34 - programming
09:38 - so i know it may look a little
09:39 - complicated but honestly
09:42 - what i can tell you is it's not on the
09:44 - left what you're looking at
09:46 - is the way that students are sort of
09:47 - used to thinking about coding
09:49 - at least up to this point uh so you know
09:52 - you have lines of code
09:53 - and they're going to be executed in
09:54 - order now on the right which we're
09:56 - seeing is this
09:58 - new concept of event driven programming
10:01 - and the idea here is that a computer
10:03 - program
10:05 - as we know is a set of instructions
10:06 - telling the computer how to process
10:08 - input
10:09 - and deliver a certain output an
10:11 - important part of that program is
10:12 - telling the computer
10:13 - when to perform a certain task
10:16 - so events are a way to trigger
10:19 - certain instructions so let's dive into
10:24 - the unplug activity
10:28 - so as you can see here the materials and
10:31 - preparation needed
10:32 - are going to be pretty minimal you'll
10:34 - need two sets of colored index cards
10:37 - uh the first color and in our example
10:39 - here we're using the color red
10:41 - will be our designated event cards
10:44 - and on each event card you're going to
10:46 - write down one of three events
10:48 - such as cross arms
10:52 - clap hands or pat your head
10:55 - the other color is going to be for your
10:57 - handler pile
10:59 - now each of these cards is going to need
11:01 - a conditional statement such as
11:03 - when someone crosses their arms i'm
11:05 - going to take a knee
11:06 - or when someone claps their hands i will
11:09 - say
11:10 - jumanji now to help you guys understand
11:14 - how this is going to work um i actually
11:16 - do have a video that was filmed at our
11:18 - code monkey
11:20 - studios so let's get to that
11:40 - okay
11:42 - [Music]
11:48 - all right so i don't know if those guys
11:49 - are going to be winning any oscars
11:50 - anytime
11:51 - soon but they did a great job um so what
11:54 - what they've done here is you have to
11:55 - start by distributing those cards face
11:57 - down
11:57 - and then you form two lines uh one
11:59 - line's for events
12:01 - the other line is for handlers next you
12:04 - want to go down on the line one at a
12:05 - time
12:06 - having each student perform the
12:09 - action that is on their card or the
12:10 - command that's on their card
12:12 - then your handlers are going to react
12:15 - based on the behavior
12:17 - that they saw on the events line and
12:19 - then maybe after one time down the line
12:21 - you can switch roles uh events will
12:23 - trade with handlers
12:25 - there's also an opportunity here to have
12:27 - the students maybe rewrite the code just
12:29 - to see
12:30 - how you know maybe the first time when a
12:32 - person folded their arms
12:34 - i jumped up but now someone rewrote the
12:37 - code
12:37 - and now i'm going to turn off the lights
12:40 - or something like that
12:45 - now if you see any holdouts if you still
12:48 - have holdouts
12:49 - as far as buy-ins with the students even
12:51 - after that activity
12:53 - and i promise you if you show them this
12:55 - um
12:56 - this activity which is actually taken
12:57 - directly from the lesson plan it's a
12:59 - short video
13:00 - uh and we kind of use it to show
13:02 - students the possibilities we're going
13:04 - to show them
13:05 - what it is we hope to get from this
13:07 - platformer course
13:08 - so i'll go ahead and play a little bit
13:10 - for you guys
13:11 - and this will be something that you show
13:12 - the kids and again this is directly from
13:15 - the lesson plan so it's easily
13:17 - accessible for you as a teacher
13:24 - alright so watch out for the tigers and
13:27 - chocolates
13:30 - [Music]
13:32 - i see a tiger
13:36 - i'm also old school and i need more of a
13:39 - playstation controller
13:42 - [Music]
13:46 - all right so there uh what we saw
13:50 - was a lot of those elements are going to
13:52 - come into play we saw a timer
13:53 - there was objects there were good guys
13:56 - bad guys
13:57 - um in the times where we've shown this
14:00 - we've taken our visits to schools
14:02 - this is really what gets the students
14:04 - going so
14:06 - the job for you is to get them calmed
14:07 - down and get ready for the beginning of
14:09 - the
14:09 - lesson uh and with that i'm going to
14:11 - turn it back over to jay
14:13 - who's going to guide us through lesson
14:16 - one
14:16 - of this platformer course
14:20 - all right yep let me get out set up so
14:22 - you can see my screen and we'll get
14:23 - going with this
14:26 - all right it should be there for you now
14:29 - um
14:29 - so this is lesson one which is going to
14:31 - encompass uh the first five exercises
14:34 - of the platformer course and i want to
14:37 - go through these
14:38 - fairly quickly introduce you to what the
14:41 - screen looks like and all the elements
14:42 - that we're using here
14:44 - um but also explain a little bit of the
14:46 - computer science and coding times that
14:49 - um find what they're doing what your
14:51 - students will be doing
14:52 - so let's look at the screen um we've got
14:55 - basically three columns here
14:57 - the column left is where the
14:59 - instructions are
15:00 - and then at the bottom it has a little
15:01 - checklist where the steps are broken
15:04 - down
15:05 - some of these exercises have multiple
15:07 - parts and
15:08 - the students can check them off as they
15:11 - do them
15:12 - uh on the in the middle is where the
15:14 - students will actually write their code
15:16 - we're going to focus in this discussion
15:18 - on just the code area up here
15:20 - there are these buttons down here that
15:21 - can be used to as shortcuts for typing
15:24 - but we're going gonna do it old school
15:25 - today and just type in the
15:27 - uh doors by hand then on the right we
15:31 - have
15:31 - the game screen at the top um that's
15:34 - where we'll actually play the game when
15:35 - we press the run
15:36 - button but also where we can design the
15:39 - game by moving around the elements
15:40 - and adding things and
15:43 - things like that at the bottom there are
15:46 - some tabs for controlling different
15:48 - aspects of the game
15:49 - adding new sprites adding widgets sounds
15:52 - and modifying the game um for this
15:56 - for these five lessons exercises we're
15:58 - only going to see
15:59 - uh the sprite tab but later on the
16:02 - course
16:03 - we'll have opportunities to work on the
16:04 - other tabs as well
16:07 - so let's go and get started with um the
16:10 - first
16:11 - exercise um as was mentioned
16:14 - um these elements that make up the game
16:16 - are called sprites
16:18 - uh sprites are basically just a little
16:19 - pictures little characters and objects
16:21 - in the screen
16:22 - that interact um so
16:26 - the background here is not considered a
16:28 - sprite because it doesn't really
16:29 - interact with anything
16:30 - later on we're going to encounter tiles
16:32 - they're not sprites
16:33 - but sprites are the parts of the game
16:35 - that do things
16:37 - so in the simple version of the game
16:38 - we're starting with the sprites are the
16:40 - monkey and banana
16:42 - later on as you saw will add chocolate
16:44 - and a tiger and some other little
16:46 - power-ups and things
16:47 - right now just the monkey in the banana
16:51 - the thing to understand about coding
16:53 - games is that when you
16:55 - write code it is always associated with
16:58 - a particular sprite
17:00 - so right now in this exercise and the
17:03 - next ones we're going to be writing code
17:05 - that is attached to the monkey sprite
17:07 - you can see that the editor up here has
17:09 - the monkey
17:10 - showing that that's what we're editing
17:13 - so let's look at what this code
17:14 - uh does or needs to do um so
17:18 - mark talk to you about event handlers
17:20 - event handlers are used for responding
17:21 - to events
17:22 - events are things like pressing a
17:25 - keyboard key clicking a mouse things
17:27 - that happen
17:28 - in in and outside of the games world
17:32 - so here we're creating an event handler
17:35 - for the monkey sprite
17:37 - called own key on key is built into
17:41 - the game builder platform is a special
17:44 - property of a sprite and if the sprite
17:47 - has that property
17:49 - then that code will be executed
17:52 - when a keyboard key is pressed now let's
17:55 - talk about this axle for a second
17:57 - this at symbol is special notation
18:00 - in the coffee script language we're
18:02 - using that says
18:04 - this property its own key is part of the
18:07 - monkey sprite
18:08 - this is the monkey's own key function
18:12 - later on in the course you may have to
18:13 - refer to other sprites
18:15 - inside of the monkey's code and there's
18:17 - different notation for that but for
18:18 - referring to the monkey's own code
18:21 - it's the at symbol so the on key
18:23 - property of the monkey
18:24 - is set equal to and this notation here
18:27 - with the parentheses in the arrow that
18:29 - creates a function
18:32 - and this function takes an argument an
18:35 - input called key which is going to
18:36 - represent the actual keyboard key that
18:39 - is
18:40 - we're not pressed actually going to use
18:42 - that argument in this first exercise
18:44 - we'll use it in the next two
18:47 - so when the keyboard keeps pressed we
18:48 - want to do something what we want to do
18:50 - well if we read the instructions
18:52 - we want to use this function that caught
18:55 - called step one that's going to make the
18:57 - monkey
18:59 - take one step forward again
19:02 - the accidental means this belongs to the
19:05 - monkey who is the monkey that's doing
19:06 - the stepping not the banana or anything
19:08 - else
19:10 - and one step may not seem like much but
19:13 - this code's gonna execute over and over
19:15 - again as long as you hold down the key
19:18 - and so that will move the monkey quickly
19:20 - enough
19:21 - so i've done what they said to do i can
19:24 - check it
19:25 - it's happy i'm gonna press run just to
19:27 - see what happens
19:30 - so here's the one key now if i press any
19:32 - key on my keyboard at all the monkey
19:33 - steps forward as long as i hold the key
19:36 - down
19:38 - and oh happy day he found the banana
19:41 - so we have solved extras of one
19:45 - moving on to exercise two
19:49 - so one of the things we'll see is the
19:51 - exercises build on each other
19:53 - so everything we talked about before is
19:55 - still here
19:56 - with a little bit more because just
19:59 - having the monkey only be able to move
20:00 - forward that's not much of a game we
20:02 - want to have some ability to control
20:04 - what the monkey is doing so now we're
20:07 - actually going to use this input
20:09 - remember i said key is a code that
20:12 - represents
20:13 - the keyboard key that was pressed
20:16 - and so in this line of code they've
20:18 - already given us we're using an
20:20 - if statement to test to see if that key
20:22 - if that keyboard key that was pressed
20:24 - is equal to keyboard.left is a symbol
20:28 - that stands for the left
20:30 - arrow key on the keyboard the double
20:32 - equals is important
20:34 - the double equals is what you should
20:35 - check to see if two things are equal
20:37 - okay if you use just a single equals the
20:39 - program would not work
20:42 - so if the key is the left keyboard key
20:45 - then we're gonna step negative one hmm
20:49 - well this is not too hard to understand
20:51 - since stepping one moves the monkey to
20:53 - the right
20:54 - stepping negative one moves the monkey
20:56 - to the left we want the monkey
20:58 - to be able to move in both directions so
21:00 - let's add the possibility for him to
21:02 - move to the right again so that's going
21:03 - to be f
21:04 - key double equals
21:08 - keyboard right
21:12 - obviously and then we'll use the same
21:15 - thing we used before
21:16 - step one because that moves the monkey
21:19 - to the right
21:21 - and let's check that it's happy with us
21:24 - we'll press run
21:26 - we can see the monkey can move both to
21:27 - the right and to the left
21:31 - and there he managed to make make his
21:33 - way to banana once again
21:35 - all right
21:39 - lesson exercise number three well mark
21:42 - told you that
21:42 - um this is a super mario type game and
21:46 - uh mario's one of mario's biggest tricks
21:49 - is he can jump
21:50 - so we want our monkey to be able to jump
21:52 - so we can get to his been
21:53 - hanging in the air for us so we got our
21:56 - old code from before
21:57 - move to the left or if the keyboard key
22:00 - is the one to the left
22:01 - move backwards if it's the right arrow
22:03 - key move
22:05 - forwards to the right and if it's the up
22:07 - key
22:08 - this isn't right we don't want the up
22:10 - key to move the monkey
22:12 - to the right which is what step one does
22:14 - we want the up key to make the monkey
22:16 - jump so let's change this
22:21 - to this new function jump
22:27 - now notice that this time there's these
22:30 - parentheses
22:31 - empty set of parentheses open print fees
22:33 - and immediately close parentheses right
22:34 - after jump
22:36 - that's because the jump function doesn't
22:38 - take any inputs so the step function
22:40 - takes an input how many steps to take
22:43 - the jump function doesn't and in coffee
22:45 - script if a function doesn't take any
22:47 - inputs
22:48 - you have to use these open and close
22:50 - parentheses right after it
22:52 - but that's all we need to do to modify
22:54 - the code here so we'll check it
22:56 - and we'll run it and then the monkey
22:59 - comes over here
23:00 - and he jumps up and he got the banana
23:07 - all right um these next two exercises
23:11 - are not really based on coding um in
23:14 - addition to the sprites in the game
23:15 - world we can make it more interesting by
23:17 - adding
23:18 - tiles to the game world um to create
23:21 - stair steps and challenges and things
23:23 - for the monkey to move around
23:24 - on to do that nothing in the code window
23:27 - instead we're going to come over here to
23:28 - the
23:29 - game window and use the paintbrush icon
23:33 - and we can choose any of these tiles we
23:34 - like i'll keep using the same one
23:38 - and then just paint some extra tiles on
23:42 - the screen
23:44 - to make it easier for the monkey to get
23:45 - up there to the banana so
23:47 - i've already done that i should be ready
23:49 - to go let's run the game
23:52 - and the monkey should be able to climb
23:54 - up there these new steps
23:57 - and get the banana one more time
24:00 - all right and then one more quick
24:02 - challenge before we finish
24:04 - up with this um in addition to the paint
24:06 - brush there is an eraser
24:10 - tool here so we see there's an obstacle
24:12 - we have all these tiles we can put in
24:14 - the monkey's way
24:15 - so to make this challenge solvable we
24:17 - need to erase these
24:19 - now obviously in designing an actual
24:22 - game you wouldn't
24:24 - add tiles just so you could erase them
24:26 - later but you make mistakes near
24:28 - dividing or putting
24:29 - towels on the screen for the eraser tool
24:31 - is used for
24:32 - removing those so now the monkey has a
24:35 - path
24:36 - we press run
24:41 - and he's got the banana
24:45 - so uh we have gone through those pretty
24:47 - quickly um
24:49 - if you're doing this in the classroom
24:50 - it's probably gonna take your students a
24:51 - little bit longer
24:52 - but if they will read the instructions
24:54 - you see that's pretty much
24:56 - step by step and they should be able to
24:59 - get through
25:00 - uh these exercises almost as quickly as
25:04 - i let you do them but
25:05 - let them take the time to kind of learn
25:07 - and digest the computer science
25:09 - as they're playing so with that i'm
25:11 - going to turn it back
25:12 - over to mark and let him continue the
25:15 - presentation
25:21 - all right thanks again jay um
25:24 - so with the time that we have remaining
25:25 - i want to get to the part uh the meats
25:27 - and potatoes of game creation this is
25:29 - the part that
25:30 - i know many of you are already consider
25:32 - yourself the most popular teacher in
25:34 - your school
25:34 - based on the nature of what you teach uh
25:37 - but if you're not already you for sure
25:39 - will be the most popular teacher
25:41 - once you begin the game builder part
25:45 - of our course so
25:48 - game builder needs to be assigned to
25:49 - your students for them to access it
25:52 - so if you have a question on how to do
25:53 - that just make sure you leave us a
25:54 - comment uh
25:56 - in the chat and then someone will answer
25:58 - that for you
26:02 - all right so let's imagine for a minute
26:04 - you've completed the entire platformer
26:06 - course
26:07 - so what have you actually done what
26:08 - you've done is you started by using the
26:11 - lesson plan video
26:12 - to kind of hype them up and show them
26:14 - what it is that they can make you're
26:15 - showing them the possibilities
26:17 - then through those exercises the ones
26:20 - that jay just walked us through
26:22 - they've learned how to make those games
26:25 - and by
26:25 - this point when they reach game builder
26:28 - they're going to be able to showcase
26:29 - what they've learned
26:30 - and then again combine it with
26:32 - creativity
26:33 - so as our teacher i find that this is a
26:36 - perfect way
26:38 - to assess their progress another reason
26:40 - that you're going to find that this is
26:41 - the
26:42 - ideal next step after coding adventure
26:45 - is
26:46 - for those of you that like to see
26:48 - collaboration and creativity
26:50 - in your classroom then get ready because
26:53 - it's going to go through the roof once
26:54 - you introduce
26:55 - game builder and then honestly if you
26:58 - forget
26:59 - all those other bullet points there just
27:01 - know that
27:02 - your students are going to love game
27:03 - builder because it's just plain and
27:05 - simple
27:06 - a lot of fun
27:10 - so this is a good question when should
27:12 - you assign it
27:13 - and to get the most out of game builder
27:15 - i strongly suggest that you complete at
27:17 - least
27:18 - one of the game creation courses if not
27:19 - more you definitely want to set your
27:21 - students up
27:22 - for success and we believe that this is
27:25 - the best way
27:26 - to ensure that
27:33 - all right so you may be wondering uh
27:35 - where you can find game builder
27:37 - so for those of you that have not
27:38 - accessed it already uh from your teacher
27:40 - homepage you would scroll below your
27:42 - classrooms
27:46 - and then you'll find the platform
27:50 - under in the creativity section and here
27:52 - it is game builder
27:54 - create your own games so you'll start by
27:57 - clicking on
27:59 - create games and then you'll see the
28:01 - green start coding button here
28:07 - so here i see a couple of options or a
28:09 - few options actually for a game template
28:12 - but what i'm going to do is i'm going to
28:13 - choose the default platform
28:16 - because i chose i'm going to choose
28:17 - default because the other five actually
28:19 - have pre-written
28:20 - code in them so it's a small amount but
28:22 - it is there
28:24 - and if i really want to dive in i really
28:26 - want to drive home the assessment aspect
28:28 - of this platform that we have
28:29 - i think it's best to have these students
28:31 - start with a blank slate
28:34 - so let's go ahead and start
28:40 - okay so the first thing i want to do
28:41 - when i get to the game builder is always
28:43 - just take a look at the layout here it's
28:45 - pretty minimal right
28:46 - uh the left side of the screen is going
28:48 - to be divided with our code editor
28:50 - uh taking up the most real estate and
28:52 - then we have some buttons and tabs
28:53 - sitting just below that
28:55 - still on the left side now you can find
28:57 - the stage on the upper right
28:59 - and our design and object tabs in the
29:01 - lower array
29:03 - now staying on the right side of the
29:05 - screen i want to point out something
29:06 - that's a relatively
29:08 - new feature that's going to be so
29:11 - helpful to everybody that's listening
29:13 - today
29:13 - i know the term game changer can be
29:16 - overused
29:17 - but this is like a literal game changer
29:19 - right so here
29:21 - next to my avatar what i have are
29:24 - reference cards
29:25 - now these reference cards will allow
29:27 - students to refer back to the concepts
29:29 - that they've learned in the course
29:31 - and they'll also be able to see example
29:32 - code so i'll actually show you how that
29:34 - looks
29:34 - here
29:38 - so again you know we're saying here's a
29:40 - blank slate but we don't want to leave
29:42 - them out to dry
29:43 - so here are some of your training rules
29:45 - if you will
29:47 - you can also search for uh content
29:51 - in our search bar here with the
29:52 - reference cards
29:55 - and then the last thing i want to point
29:57 - out here on the screen
29:59 - is our save and share buttons you
30:01 - definitely want to make sure that your
30:02 - students are aware
30:04 - of the save button to maintain their
30:05 - progress so those are next to the green
30:07 - run button at the top of the screen
30:10 - um okay so let's see how this process
30:13 - works
30:13 - so right here i'm being asked to add a
30:16 - sprite or widget
30:18 - uh to start the game coding so i'll do
30:20 - just that and i'll keep it simple for
30:23 - the purposes of this webinar we'll just
30:25 - do monkey
30:27 - and we will add a banana as well so
30:30 - two sprites
30:37 - and again um jay went over some really
30:40 - good information
30:41 - but maybe i didn't keep a technology
30:43 - notebook or maybe i didn't write this
30:45 - down
30:46 - what i can do is refer to the reference
30:47 - cards to sort of kickstart
30:49 - uh what it is that i want to do so i
30:52 - remember he said something about an
30:53 - on key and then when i search for it i
30:56 - get the definition
30:58 - as well as an example
31:01 - so i'm actually going to give myself a
31:04 - shortcut
31:05 - copy the example paste it
31:10 - and then again this is a very
31:11 - rudimentary game uh but just to give you
31:13 - an idea how this would look
31:16 - so there it is i kind of i'm i'm on my
31:18 - way here a little bit right
31:21 - okay so i talked about saving and
31:24 - sharing
31:25 - and i do want to walk you guys through
31:26 - the process of sharing a game that
31:29 - you've created
31:32 - i'll click on the share button here
31:42 - so when a student decides to share or
31:43 - create a game they're going to encounter
31:45 - this pop-up window
31:46 - that has a couple of options so you see
31:48 - i can just make it private
31:50 - you know my game is very early on in the
31:52 - early stages i don't need to share with
31:53 - anybody
31:54 - i could also share it with my classroom
31:56 - and that would be my code monkey
31:58 - classroom so only those 20 to 25
32:00 - students will be able to see that
32:02 - i can also get a link and that link
32:05 - could be copied and pasted into her
32:06 - browser
32:07 - i could possibly email it to my parents
32:10 - i think some schools have embedded it in
32:12 - their school home page
32:14 - but that's an option as well but also
32:18 - at the bottom here i see the option to
32:21 - publish it
32:23 - so with this i'll go ahead and click on
32:27 - that
32:28 - so i want you guys to keep in mind that
32:29 - any game that's shared
32:31 - will be vetted by us uh to make sure
32:34 - that they meet our community standards
32:38 - so you can sort of see here um sort of
32:41 - the guidelines that the students are
32:42 - going to be held to
32:44 - uh before their game is actually posted
32:46 - online
32:53 - all right so to view the games that have
32:55 - been shared um
32:56 - throughout the cold monkey global
32:57 - community we're going to use the the
33:00 - discover tab uh which is located on the
33:02 - home page
33:04 - so you see it there next to my
33:08 - challenges
33:10 - i'm going to take you there as well
33:17 - backing up a little bit before steven
33:18 - publishes the game you want to make sure
33:20 - they give it a name
33:21 - so we'll call this uh webinar
33:25 - and then the instructions in the
33:27 - description is pretty optional
33:28 - it's optional right now but again
33:30 - getting back to what we talked about
33:32 - assessing
33:33 - uh you can tie in literacy you can tie
33:35 - in the fact that hey
33:37 - it's just comprehension right if i can
33:38 - explain how to do something if i can
33:40 - clearly give directions
33:42 - uh then i i've showed that i have a
33:44 - mastery over this content
33:46 - so in my case i'm just gonna say feed
33:50 - the monkey employ
33:53 - the bad guys and then i click publish
34:01 - okay so we were getting into the
34:03 - discover tab again it's right next to my
34:06 - challenges
34:09 - so here when you get to the discover tab
34:12 - uh you'll see all the games that have
34:13 - made it through that vetting process
34:15 - that i just described
34:16 - and in addition to playing the games as
34:18 - they are
34:20 - so let's just kind of show you a little
34:22 - bit of those
34:24 - so in addition to playing the games as
34:26 - they are you also have the option to
34:27 - remix games
34:29 - which will sort of allow you to add your
34:30 - own slant to the games
34:35 - i also want to point out uh there's sort
34:37 - of a social element to this as well
34:39 - you can see how many times this game has
34:41 - been played
34:43 - you can see how many times people have
34:44 - liked it and we
34:46 - think about the population that we're
34:47 - teaching and those students in those age
34:50 - levels
34:51 - that's kind of you know where they are
34:53 - in their environment these days
34:54 - so that's another great piece that i
34:56 - like to point out
35:03 - all right so as we wrap up today i want
35:05 - to take a look back at the ground that
35:07 - we've covered
35:08 - um we've discussed our game builder
35:10 - package which courses
35:11 - make up that package we explain when to
35:14 - assign it
35:16 - jay walked us through that first lesson
35:17 - of platformer
35:19 - after that we took a look at creating
35:21 - our own games using game builder
35:24 - and then finally we looked at the
35:25 - discover tab to see
35:27 - where to find games that have been
35:28 - published by code monkey users
35:30 - from across the globe
35:34 - all right so i think that that is a
35:36 - great place to stop
35:38 - and open the floor to everyone that's
35:40 - here so with that let's go ahead and
35:42 - begin our q a
35:48 - so we had one question will this webinar
35:51 - be offered again
35:52 - at this time we do not have a scheduled
35:54 - date but we will be sending out the
35:56 - webinar
35:57 - after today's live viewing of it so to
36:00 - make sure that you also have that on
36:01 - hand for any note taking or anything
36:03 - that you need to take as far as that
36:04 - goes
36:09 - thank you leno if you have any other
36:12 - questions
36:18 - all right so if we don't have any other
36:20 - questions i want to thank everybody for
36:21 - their time
36:23 - uh and again like i said uh pdc
36:26 - pd information certificates will be
36:28 - emailed out to you guys as well as a
36:30 - recording
36:39 - thank you everybody
36:46 - and remember to write code catch bananas
36:48 - and save the world we'll see you guys
36:50 - next time
36:51 - thank you
