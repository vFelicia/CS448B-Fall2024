03:58 - have been
03:59 - maybe learning about us in school we are
04:01 - a fully
04:02 - gamified coding platform really designed
04:04 - to put both students and teachers in the
04:06 - driver's seat
04:07 - it's really fun to play and we really
04:10 - want our students to learn a deep dive
04:12 - into the coding foundation
04:14 - so if you're not sure about that you can
04:15 - always
04:17 - visit us at our webpage at
04:19 - www.codemonkey.com
04:21 - and sign up for a free trial for both
04:22 - your students or if you're

04:27 - we're going to do a
04:28 - live q a here at the end
04:33 - so the first thing we're going to go
04:34 - ahead and get started with jonathan and
04:36 - his
04:37 - first question from someone from the
04:39 - audience is
04:43 - is um jonathan if you could tell us
04:47 - what was your first job right out of
04:50 - college
04:52 - well um actually it was a job
04:57 - i had actually from
05:00 - since before college and during college
05:03 - as a software developer
05:05 - uh in a
05:11 - you know in a medium sized software firm
05:13 - here in israel so i actually started
05:14 - working for them right when graduating
05:16 - from high school
05:18 - um and
05:21 - it was actually my only job as a
05:24 - software developer
05:26 - before i started code monkey so
05:29 - all the way from the end of high school
05:31 - until i started cold monkey around 10
05:33 - years later
05:34 - okay great and jonathan do you want to
05:36 - tell us um
05:38 - exactly where you're joining us from
05:40 - because i bet many of our
05:41 - audience isn't sure where you are
05:43 - joining us from or where code monkey is
05:44 - based
05:46 - right yeah good good question yeah so
05:48 - i'm joining from tel aviv israel
05:50 - uh this is where we started code monkey
05:55 - uh israel is
05:58 - famous for its vibrant startup scene and
06:00 - code monkey is
06:01 - is another israeli startup company
06:04 - uh we do have offices in the u.s where i
06:07 - spent
06:08 - a year and a half while building the
06:10 - company
06:11 - um but now i'm back in tel aviv
06:15 - israel all right great and i see some
06:18 - questions rolling in so we got some
06:19 - great questions that we'll have
06:20 - um this is our um question from the
06:23 - audience this is from miss burroughs
06:25 - she's joining us from
06:26 - jericho new york what was the first
06:28 - thing that you coded
06:31 - it was um a computer game
06:35 - like many like many software developers
06:39 - started early uh in the 90s
06:42 - 1990s also for myself
06:47 - the motivation uh for
06:50 - starting to to learn to code early was
06:53 - wanting to create my own computer games
06:54 - and share them with my classmates so
06:56 - that's what i did
06:58 - uh it was like kind of a quest game
07:01 - which were
07:02 - it's a genre that was popular in the 90s
07:04 - and but the quest
07:06 - was happening in the houses of my my
07:09 - classroom buddies sort of so we had to
07:11 - go
07:12 - around their rooms and and
07:15 - and houses in the computer game and
07:19 - find all kind of treasures and hints and
07:23 - so mysteries and stuff
07:25 - oh very cool
07:28 - all right so let's go ahead with our
07:30 - next question and so
07:32 - where um what was the first programming
07:35 - language
07:36 - that you learned
07:39 - so that was called uh logo
07:43 - it actually provided a lot of
07:46 - inspiration also later for code monkey
07:49 - so logo is a programming language that
07:51 - was developed
07:52 - in the 70s in mit
07:56 - for the purpose of teaching kids to code
07:58 - so it's a special programming language
08:00 - that was designed to make it easy for
08:03 - children back then in the 70s and 80s
08:06 - to experiment with coding so computers
08:08 - back then were very basic they were only
08:10 - black and white screens and no advanced
08:13 - graphics and internet like you have
08:15 - today
08:16 - so basically what you would do on logo
08:18 - is write small programs like you see
08:20 - here on the screen
08:22 - that would just draw uh those
08:25 - simple geometric shapes on screen so
08:29 - i'm sure that's for kids today and for
08:30 - people today this looks far from
08:32 - exciting but
08:34 - uh you have to remember this was the 80s
08:36 - so
08:38 - anything happening on a computer was
08:40 - exciting for us back then
08:42 - and that was the way to learn to code
08:45 - for kids
08:46 - in those days okay
08:49 - great and another one from the audience
08:52 - this is mrs
08:53 - she she is joining us from richmond
08:55 - canada
08:56 - um and ms she have something in common
08:59 - zack is actually from canada himself as
09:01 - well um where did the idea
09:04 - for code monkey come from
09:07 - so like i said i started early both my
09:10 - parents are are were you were software
09:13 - engineers so
09:14 - they they put me on like us coding
09:16 - summer camp
09:17 - when i was like eight years old in here
09:21 - um and so i started early and then when
09:24 - i graduated high school i started my own
09:26 - coding courses for
09:28 - children in israel
09:31 - uh and it was like you know this sort of
09:34 - like uh
09:37 - community center uh in a town
09:40 - in the south of israel um
09:44 - and a lot of those kids uh were coming
09:47 - from
09:49 - like limited resources background sort
09:52 - of
09:55 - underprivileged communities and
09:58 - i created these these coding courses for
10:00 - for them which i gave them personally in
10:02 - class but before each class i created
10:04 - like those
10:05 - game like puzzles or challenges that you
10:08 - need to solve
10:09 - using code and i was still using the
10:11 - same programming language that i used
10:13 - for learning logo from mit but it had
10:16 - feature graphics already it was the year
10:18 - 2000
10:19 - 2001 and i was amazed to see how quickly
10:23 - kids
10:24 - can learn to code that way and how
10:28 - uh effective and how um
10:32 - teaching kids to code could be as a
10:34 - neighbor for
10:35 - like future career and uh
10:39 - and things like that so so that was that
10:42 - was that
10:43 - the main you know inspiration for
10:46 - starting code monkey as a company 10
10:47 - years later
10:54 - i realized i was muted sorry about that
10:56 - um so the idea for code monkey came from
10:58 - when you were working with
11:00 - students younger students and at-risk
11:03 - students
11:04 - so that's really great a good question
11:07 - i'm just going to skip around for just a
11:09 - second because another person had asked
11:10 - this question
11:12 - why did you choose a monkey for code
11:14 - monkey
11:15 - did you do any market research or are
11:18 - you just a super big fan
11:19 - of monkeys so
11:23 - that's a great question so actually the
11:27 - the the the specific concept of using uh
11:30 - monkey catching bananas and calling the
11:32 - game code monkey and the comedy called
11:33 - monkey
11:34 - this side specifically wasn't mine it
11:36 - was my brothers i started called monkey
11:38 - with my young brother
11:39 - who was the main game developer and the
11:42 - cto
11:43 - of the company uh and he came up with
11:46 - this idea because
11:48 - it's kind of a it's kind of like an
11:50 - internal joke so
11:51 - among pro uh stuff teams of software
11:54 - developers uh
11:56 - the term code monkey is used uh
12:00 - sort of like as a joke as a term to to
12:03 - describe the
12:05 - the most beginner coder in the group the
12:07 - one that you
12:08 - give the most simple coding tasks to so
12:10 - he's like the code monkey he's doing the
12:12 - the simple work uh like a friendly joke
12:16 - among coders so the the term already
12:19 - existed code monkey and we just decided
12:21 - to use it as
12:22 - as the theme and the title for for our
12:25 - game and company
12:30 - great um this one is from the audience
12:33 - this one is from
12:34 - miss c rodella she's joining us from
12:38 - chatham
12:38 - new jersey so sorry if i put your your
12:40 - name there um what is code monkey
12:42 - currently
12:43 - working on
12:47 - oh wow a lot of stuff so today
12:50 - code monkey is being used by a player
12:54 - 20 million students all over the world
12:56 - in israel in the usa
12:58 - in china
13:01 - in australia almost any country in the
13:04 - world
13:05 - um a lot of things we've been working on
13:08 - recently
13:10 - are solving needs that came as a result
13:12 - of
13:13 - frequent kobe 19 closures so a lot of
13:17 - features that would allow
13:19 - an easier experience for teaching
13:21 - remotely
13:22 - and for self-learning from home
13:26 - so a lot of the work naturally recently
13:30 - is focused around those special needs
13:33 - presented
13:34 - by the the corona pandemic
13:39 - okay great all right our next question
13:43 - is what is what was the most
13:46 - challenging part of starting your own
13:48 - company and
13:50 - what has been the most meaningful um
13:57 - so the most challenging part
14:00 - i guess uh was to convince
14:04 - because you need money to start a
14:06 - company like code monk
14:07 - developer osmani graphic designers web
14:11 - servers and all of that cloud servers
14:14 - marketing offices so you need money and
14:17 - uh
14:17 - so you need to sort of persuade i need
14:19 - to persuade
14:20 - uh investors uh
14:24 - that teaching kids to code or creating
14:26 - creating tools for teaching kids to code
14:28 - could become
14:29 - also a sustainable business like
14:31 - everyone agreed that it would be a very
14:33 - good product and children would
14:35 - enjoy it and teacher would enjoy it but
14:36 - the most challenging part was to
14:38 - convince
14:39 - investor that it could also create a
14:41 - good business
14:45 - so that was the most challenging part
14:48 - um and the most meaningful part
14:53 - when started the company so our first
14:56 - big success story was in our home
14:58 - country in israel
15:00 - so code monkey was adopted by by the
15:02 - national ministry of education here in
15:04 - israel
15:05 - and they used it to create like a
15:07 - national coding olympics
15:09 - between teams of students from from
15:11 - schools all over the country
15:13 - and what was very meaningful and
15:15 - exciting to see there
15:16 - uh that this many of the schools that
15:20 - did
15:20 - best on code monkey were actually
15:22 - schools from
15:23 - very far away villages in israel
15:26 - that again were school that are serving
15:29 - a
15:32 - community like low resources community a
15:34 - lot of students that didn't even have
15:36 - computers or internet connection at home
15:38 - they would go to school to school
15:41 - in the afternoon with their parents or
15:43 - volunteering teachers to
15:45 - to to develop their coding skills and
15:49 - and and compete in this national coding
15:53 - olympics
15:56 - great okay let's check out
16:00 - our next question why is
16:04 - coding important for future employment
16:10 - um so beyond
16:14 - you know the the increasing the the
16:18 - always increasing demand for software
16:21 - developer like
16:22 - you see more and more needing in
16:24 - software developers in the industry like
16:26 - the industries the software industry is
16:28 - growing every year
16:29 - uh learning to code is important for
16:32 - future employment because
16:34 - uh nowadays even if you don't pursue a
16:37 - career in coding
16:39 - almost anything you do uh
16:42 - interacts with with code either
16:46 - if you're working in marketing for
16:48 - example which used to be
16:51 - uh mainly offline but now most of the
16:54 - marketing budgets are spent online on
16:56 - online marketing
16:57 - and uh it doesn't mean that you have to
17:00 - write code yourself in order to work in
17:02 - marketing today but
17:03 - but if you don't understand how code
17:05 - work and how the internet works and how
17:06 - websites work
17:08 - it would be very hard for you to to be
17:11 - to excel
17:12 - in something like that and the same goes
17:14 - for research
17:16 - academia finance
17:20 - health medicine um
17:23 - [Music]
17:24 - there isn't a field today that is not
17:28 - interacting with with software
17:30 - constantly so
17:32 - so even if you don't plan to become a
17:34 - coder being able to
17:36 - understand how computers work and how
17:38 - computer programs operate
17:40 - uh would give you a very important
17:43 - advantage no matter what you choose as
17:46 - your future career
17:48 - great and this one is also from the
17:51 - audience as well this is mrs
17:52 - edison she is joining us for sorry
17:56 - she's joining us from new jersey what
17:58 - courses would you advise
18:00 - students to take in high school and in
18:02 - college
18:05 - oh wow so uh so actually my
18:08 - my best advice would be to take courses
18:12 - that really excite you and that are
18:15 - really interesting for you
18:17 - uh so as as much as i think learning to
18:21 - code
18:21 - is fun and important if if
18:25 - students if a certain student doesn't
18:27 - feel that way
18:28 - then i wouldn't recommend taking that as
18:30 - a high school course
18:31 - i think uh the most important thing is
18:33 - is to learn
18:35 - you know follow sort of your inner inner
18:37 - motivation and inner
18:39 - natural uh interest
18:46 - that would be my advice
18:50 - okay great um so can you tell us
18:54 - some of the other jobs that are um
18:56 - associated with codemonkey and
18:58 - can you tell us also your role within
19:00 - the organization
19:03 - yeah so my role today i'm the ceo i'm
19:06 - managing the organization so i
19:08 - i don't get to do any coding myself
19:10 - anymore which is a pity because i always
19:12 - enjoy that very much but uh
19:16 - yeah today today
19:20 - i'm doing strictly with managing the
19:23 - company and managing other employees and
19:25 - teams and
19:26 - uh setting goals and strategy
19:30 - uh and things like that
19:33 - um but other roles in the company so
19:36 - obviously we have a
19:38 - product team which consists mainly of
19:40 - software developers they
19:42 - develop and maintain the code monkey
19:43 - platform they develop the different
19:45 - games and courses
19:46 - we have the pedagogy team which is in
19:49 - charge of
19:50 - creating the coding courses on top of
19:53 - the coding platform
19:56 - so those are like computer science
19:57 - teachers usually
20:00 - we have the marketing team sales team
20:04 - and the customer success team uh which
20:07 - is doing
20:08 - uh maybe the most important job which is
20:10 - to make sure that
20:11 - schools and and families that chose to
20:14 - purchase
20:15 - uh code monkey subscription and use code
20:17 - monkey as their
20:18 - computer science education platform uh
20:22 - actually are actually successful in
20:24 - implementing
20:25 - uh our technology and content
20:29 - in their homes or or classrooms
20:34 - great all right so i
20:38 - am just having an issue here with my
20:41 - screen so sorry about that you guys
20:46 - okay
20:49 - all right so we are going to um
20:55 - ask another question here in five years
20:58 - where do you hope code monkey is
21:04 - um good question um
21:06 - [Music]
21:11 - well basically we want to continue what
21:14 - we're doing uh
21:16 - now but sort of to ex extend the
21:20 - curriculum
21:21 - uh we see a trend globally of computer
21:24 - science gradually becoming
21:26 - uh transitioning from being sort of uh
21:30 - an extracurricular optional course to
21:33 - gradually become part part of the core
21:35 - curriculum
21:37 - so as that happens i hope to see code
21:40 - monkey
21:42 - mature uh accordingly
21:45 - uh from sort of just uh
21:48 - uh like specific
21:52 - courses company a company that provides
21:55 - specific courses in computer science to
21:56 - a company that provides
21:58 - a full computer science curriculum for
22:01 - k-12
22:02 - uh including all the aspects that are
22:05 - required
22:06 - uh from from a full curriculum solution
22:09 - so that means also teacher training
22:11 - assessment
22:13 - and also of course a full pathway of
22:15 - courses from kindergarten
22:18 - all the way to 12th grade
22:30 - all right great i'm just pulling up
22:32 - another
22:33 - question here um if you could tell
22:37 - your younger self thing
22:40 - what would it be and if you could tell
22:42 - your future self one thing what would it
22:44 - be
22:46 - oh those are tough ones um
22:49 - my younger self what would it be um
23:01 - probably um
23:06 - to be uh patients
23:10 - more patients i i guess uh i remember
23:12 - when we
23:13 - wanted to start code monkey the first
23:15 - time it was too early it was the year
23:16 - 2007
23:18 - and nobody really cared that much about
23:21 - computer science education for our young
23:23 - kids and we just failed
23:24 - miserably uh and
23:27 - and about like seven years later coding
23:30 - for kids became a trend and and then we
23:32 - we
23:33 - managed to start the company
23:34 - successfully but in between
23:36 - the waiting was kind of frustrating for
23:38 - me because i always knew that's what i
23:40 - wanted to do
23:40 - so uh in retrospective you know if
23:44 - someone would have told me
23:45 - don't worry the time will come like uh
23:48 - just be patient uh
23:50 - i guess it would have been an easier
23:53 - experience for me
23:55 - um and
23:59 - um what can i tell my future self
24:03 - um i guess
24:06 - uh to always stop once in a while
24:10 - what you're doing and then try to to
24:12 - remember
24:14 - uh why did you start doing it in the
24:16 - first place like what was your initial
24:18 - motivation
24:19 - uh because it's easy sort of to lose
24:22 - track
24:23 - once you you get busy uh trying to
24:27 - achieve your different goals
24:28 - to lose track of your initial motivation
24:31 - why did you start this in the first
24:33 - place
24:34 - uh so i would sort of remind my future
24:37 - self
24:38 - uh why why why did we start this in the
24:41 - in the first place
24:44 - okay those are all really good um
24:47 - feedback
24:49 - and tips for our students um
24:52 - another question i'm gonna we have one
24:54 - question here now we're gonna open it up
24:56 - for q a
24:57 - for um our students and for our teachers
25:01 - and so because we're out of our own
25:03 - questions here and we want to
25:04 - leave time for your questions as well um
25:07 - one question that i know you already
25:09 - answered privately in the
25:10 - in our q a here is when was code monkey
25:14 - made
25:17 - so the first version was created
25:20 - late 2014
25:25 - it was really ridiculous we didn't have
25:27 - an animator in the team yet so my
25:29 - brother the
25:30 - the game designer the coder he did uh he
25:32 - drew the characters himself
25:35 - uh it was really amateur
25:38 - looking but but it has a charm you know
25:40 - like a sort of a
25:42 - homemade version of of code monkey
25:48 - very cool um what is your favorite part
25:52 - and this comes from paige bestop and her
25:55 - um
25:56 - in her classroom what is your favorite
25:58 - part of code monkey
26:00 - of the game or um
26:04 - i'm not exactly sure i know that
26:08 - i know that paige also raised her hand
26:10 - so maybe we can ask
26:12 - paige and have her answer that question
26:16 - find her oh there's quite a few of her
26:19 - there so paige if you want to raise your
26:21 - hand
26:22 - i can allow you to speak there so maybe
26:25 - we take another question why she's doing
26:27 - that um
26:28 - do you enjoy coding lion joke
26:31 - yeah i enjoyed coding very much i don't
26:34 - get to do this
26:35 - as much anymore but actually now my
26:38 - favorite part
26:40 - in my job in code monkey is meeting
26:42 - students like visiting
26:45 - classrooms that are using code monkey
26:49 - it's harder now with all the
26:51 - restrictions on travel and
26:53 - and schools in general but when we were
26:56 - still able to do that that was my
26:57 - favorite part meeting students that are
26:59 - in teacher that are using code monkey
27:01 - and
27:02 - hearing their feedback and their
27:03 - experience and the best ideas always
27:06 - come from teachers
27:07 - and their students great
27:11 - we have a question from samantha and she
27:14 - wanted to know
27:14 - how many people work for code monkey
27:20 - um that's a
27:23 - good question so um
27:27 - it's a small company actually um
27:32 - it's we have like full-time employees we
27:35 - have around
27:37 - 15 in israel uh creating the product and
27:40 - the platform and doing all the back
27:42 - office stuff and
27:43 - roughly another five in the us uh
27:46 - and actually code monkey became very big
27:49 - in in
27:49 - china recently the last two or three
27:52 - years
27:53 - so that's pretty amazing code
27:55 - [Music]
27:57 - code monkey classes in china are growing
28:00 - extremely fast and over
28:02 - there there are around
28:06 - 70 almost 100 full-time employees
28:11 - working in delivering code monkey
28:13 - courses
28:14 - to to after school students in china
28:19 - it's a lot of teachers which is a lot of
28:21 - people working
28:22 - there on that side of the that side of
28:24 - the world so it's great to see
28:25 - us being or that we are working with
28:28 - students all across the world
28:30 - we have another question here
28:33 - which of the code monkey courses are
28:37 - your favorite my personal favorite is
28:40 - dota does math but that's just my
28:42 - personal favorite so what is your
28:43 - favorite
28:45 - um my favorite will always be
28:48 - coding adventure part 1 because that
28:52 - course that i was still
28:56 - mostly personally involved in creating
28:58 - every
28:59 - small detail up because we were still
29:01 - just a very small company just like
29:02 - three or four people
29:04 - uh but it's just because my you know my
29:07 - personal
29:08 - uh part in creating that course i think
29:10 - all the courses are great
29:12 - and they're actually getting better and
29:14 - better as you go along
29:17 - great um another question is have you
29:20 - ever considered
29:21 - um making swag like t-shirts and things
29:24 - like that
29:26 - oh we have tons of swag it's just hard
29:28 - to get the swag across now with no
29:29 - conferences because of the
29:31 - the uh because of kobe uh
29:34 - but i'm sure that that's soon enough
29:38 - we'll be back on on the different
29:40 - easties and
29:41 - uh other other k-12 conferences
29:44 - and and we're all invited to visit our
29:47 - booth and and grab
29:48 - some t-shirts and and
29:51 - [Music]
29:52 - uh peens stickers we have them all
29:57 - back there we do we have quite quite a
30:00 - bit of that for
30:01 - our um for our teachers
30:05 - um so we already asked you this question
30:07 - is code monkey worldwide and we will say
30:09 - that code monkey is worldwide we do
30:12 - have about how many users you say
30:14 - jonathan now 20 million users
30:17 - 20 million worldwide yeah okay great
30:23 - so we do have quite a few uh users
30:27 - worldwide
30:28 - um so outside of coding and
30:31 - what you do at code monkey what are some
30:33 - of your favorite activities to do
30:35 - outside of code monkey
30:39 - um sorry can you repeat it like like
30:42 - what are some of your hobbies that you
30:44 - do outside of just
30:45 - owning and being in the monkey company
30:49 - well i became a father
30:51 - a few years ago so i think my my
30:54 - my favorite thing to do now is spending
30:56 - time with my daughter she
30:58 - she turned three recently she's amazing
31:01 - uh but inside of that i like
31:04 - snowboarding
31:05 - i play tennis and i started
31:08 - boxing recently oh very nice
31:13 - do any of the students or teachers have
31:16 - a question that they would like
31:18 - to ask that we can unmute you and you
31:21 - can
31:21 - join us and ask jonathan a question i
31:24 - know that we had
31:25 - a question um
31:29 - about how do you feel about the success
31:31 - of the hour of code
31:36 - um so the success of the hour of code
31:41 - that's an amazing thing and without the
31:43 - success of the hour of code and code.org
31:45 - the
31:47 - code monkey couldn't have been as
31:48 - successful
31:50 - it's just important to me that um
31:55 - the hour of code will be treated
31:58 - as a first step sort of means to an and
32:01 - not
32:02 - the ultimate uh sort of result of
32:05 - computer science education or the strand
32:07 - of teaching kids to code
32:09 - because the hour of code is is is
32:11 - amazing uh as
32:14 - an exposure event exposing teachers and
32:17 - students
32:18 - to coding but but it's important to go
32:21 - beyond that to go beyond just
32:23 - an hour of code and really try to
32:26 - to implement at least a semester-long
32:29 - course
32:32 - in a classroom great
32:36 - and another question and we do love the
32:38 - hour of code that's how i started coding
32:40 - myself
32:41 - how long did it take you to get
32:44 - good at coding and how many hours do you
32:47 - think you invested on your own time to
32:50 - learn
32:52 - huh that's that's a trick question
32:54 - because if you ask my brother i never
32:56 - got good at programming so uh
32:58 - [Music]
32:59 - that's why he's a cdo but uh
33:01 - [Music]
33:03 - do you want to tell them what a cto is
33:04 - because i i don't know a lot of the
33:06 - students know
33:07 - it's the the acronyms chief technology
33:10 - officer but he's like the the chief
33:12 - coder
33:13 - um yeah but but
33:17 - yeah to get real good at coding
33:20 - uh i remember reading an article once
33:23 - there used to be when
33:24 - when coding became like a very desirable
33:29 - sort of job skill so a lot of
33:32 - businesses started advertising
33:35 - courses saying become a developer in
33:38 - just
33:39 - uh two months or in just uh i don't know
33:42 - 60 you know two weeks or crazy promises
33:46 - like that
33:47 - become an expert coder in in just one
33:49 - semester
33:51 - and then i read an article saying the
33:53 - truth is to become a really good coder
33:55 - it's like
33:56 - it takes like 10 years like you need to
33:58 - learn and then you need to get a job and
34:00 - you need to learn from your
34:02 - the more ex the more experienced coders
34:04 - around you and you need to learn from
34:05 - mistakes and to see projects succeed and
34:07 - projects failing
34:10 - that job experience is is something that
34:13 - you cannot replace and
34:14 - you cannot fast forward it so
34:17 - [Music]
34:19 - it's like a lifelong
34:23 - craft that that you master and you
34:25 - become better and better in
34:28 - do you think that is that why you're so
34:31 - passionate about having students learn
34:33 - how to code at a
34:34 - much younger age or do you find
34:37 - that it doesn't matter at what age they
34:39 - begin coding
34:41 - um it does matter
34:44 - i remember in college i had a much
34:47 - easier time i started computer science
34:49 - major in computer science also in
34:50 - college and i thought it was much easier
34:52 - for me
34:52 - and for other students that had the
34:55 - early start
34:56 - then than it was for other brilliant
34:58 - students that were coding in college for
35:00 - the first time so it's like learning
35:02 - a language that the earlier you start
35:04 - the easier it is
35:05 - for you
35:09 - great okay so it seems that nobody's
35:13 - raising their hand to jump on here to
35:15 - ask us questions so we'll round out here
35:18 - with um
35:19 - just one more question
35:22 - and that would be
35:26 - [Music]
35:28 - um
35:31 - i don't know i was just sorry i just
35:33 - forgot i was gonna say
35:34 - um why did you guys choose to use
35:38 - coffeescript as the main language for
35:40 - coding adventure
35:42 - um i thought i still think it's the best
35:47 - gateway language because it's very
35:50 - it's a very user friendly like coder
35:53 - friendly language
35:54 - the syntax is very clean very
35:57 - compact uh no semicolons and other
36:01 - crazy characters that you need to to
36:04 - insert every line
36:05 - uh so it's very coder friendly very easy
36:09 - to learn on one hand and on the other
36:10 - end it's
36:11 - super useful because it's actually a
36:14 - version of
36:15 - javascript which is the most uh
36:18 - useful language uh in the world today
36:21 - because it's sort of like the
36:22 - programming language of the internet of
36:24 - the
36:24 - web browsers on every phone every tablet
36:27 - every
36:28 - laptop or computer so it's like the best
36:32 - of both world it's both
36:33 - very easy to use and very powerful so
36:36 - that's why we chose it
36:38 - great all right um
36:42 - well we just want to thank everybody so
36:45 - much for joining us and dealing with our
36:47 - technical difficulties we do have
36:48 - another webinar
36:49 - this wednesday with our other co-founder
36:52 - and that is
36:53 - idoshore and that's jonathan's brother
36:56 - so he'll tell his story and answer a few
36:58 - questions from his own perspective
37:00 - and we just want to thank jonathan so
37:02 - much for taking time out of his day and
37:04 - it's very late in israel so we're happy
37:06 - that he was able to join us

37:12 - joining us during
37:13 - this week's event and we hope that you
37:17 - spend some time this week
37:19 - exploring some coding courses and
37:20 - hopefully exploring the code monkey
37:22 - courses and our newest course our space
37:24 - monkey
37:25 - space adventure course as well and again
37:27 - we just want to thank you from everybody
37:29 - on the code monkey team for joining us
