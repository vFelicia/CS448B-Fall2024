10:31 - today's event
10:33 - so if you're ready let's go ahead and
10:35 - write code catch bananas and save the
10:38 - world
10:39 - we always like to first start off by
10:41 - introducing our team and who's joining
10:43 - us today and so my name is lena salle
10:46 - i'm the professional development and a
10:48 - sales manager here at code monkey i help
10:51 - organize these types of events previous
10:53 - to that i was a teacher
10:55 - and
10:56 - i a fun fact about me is i have seven
10:59 - siblings that's a lot of siblings
11:01 - all right so we also have today joining
11:04 - us is our panelist
11:06 - and so we start with yoaf and joab is
11:08 - our full stack developer and you'll
11:10 - learn a little bit about what a full
11:11 - stack developer is and what they do and
11:14 - so we're thankful that he's joining us
11:16 - um he
11:18 - has been with codemonkey for three years
11:19 - and prior to that he did a lot of game
11:22 - development before joining code monkey
11:24 - and a fun fact about him is that he
11:27 - loves to play the drums
11:29 - we also have uh brett espelson he is our
11:33 - vp of us sales
11:35 - um and he has been with code monkey for
11:37 - a
11:38 - little over two years almost three years
11:40 - now and a fun fact about him is that he
11:44 - is really really tall and loves to play
11:47 - basketball
11:49 - we also have maya she is our customer
11:51 - success manager and maya is joining us
11:55 - from israel as well as our piano as most
11:57 - of our panels besides myself and brett
12:00 - and maya is really a fun fact about her
12:04 - is she's new to the code monkey team and
12:06 - we're really excited to have her and a
12:08 - fun fact about her is that she loves art
12:10 - and is really um very passionate about
12:13 - art in the international culture
12:18 - okay so why do we do a panel on the
12:21 - women in stem well did you know that
12:25 - only 29
12:27 - of women comprise the stem workforce and
12:30 - 52 of those are college educated women
12:35 - 19 of that of women are in board
12:39 - positions that means that they are the
12:41 - decision makers at the top of the
12:42 - company
12:44 - and that was that number is up from
12:47 - previous year so we have been seeing
12:49 - more women making concentrated efforts
12:52 - and becoming higher ups in the stem
12:54 - world so that's really exciting
12:56 - but still a relatively low number is
12:59 - that only three percent of women in the
13:01 - stem fields are ceos that means that
13:04 - they are the
13:05 - chief executive officers that basically
13:07 - means that they run those companies
13:10 - so we really wanted to focus on the
13:12 - women in code monkey
13:15 - and
13:16 - and just to be able to meet the team and
13:18 - kind of
13:20 - learn a little bit more about them
13:22 - so our code monkey team is really
13:25 - majority led by women and so i'm so
13:27 - excited to get for each of you guys to
13:30 - meet them so now let's meet our
13:31 - superstars of today's event
13:34 - and that is our team of the code monkey
13:36 - women in stem so i'm going to go ahead
13:38 - and let them introduce themselves to you
13:45 - hi my name is nat i've been working at
13:48 - cold monkey for five and a half years
13:50 - now
13:51 - i am married and i have four boys from
13:53 - the ages 18 to nine
13:56 - fun fact about myself is that i went to
13:58 - over 50 concerts of the same famous
14:01 - israeli singer in the past 25 years
14:11 - hi can you hear me
14:14 - we can hear you
14:15 - okay
14:16 - hi i'm uh sanda and i've been working at
14:19 - a code monkey
14:21 - as a developer for
14:24 - three years
14:26 - a little more over three years
14:28 - and um i live in tel aviv and i am an
14:33 - animal activist um
14:36 - i uh feed
14:38 - uh over 50 stray cats and i um also
14:43 - attempt to save other kinds of animals
14:45 - last weekend it was a bat and this
14:48 - weekend it was a mouse
14:51 - that's a lot of animals
14:53 - [Laughter]
14:56 - it's great to see your work outside of
14:57 - just code monkey
15:01 - hi
15:02 - my name is adi
15:04 - and i'm working in code monkey for
15:06 - about three years now um a fun fact
15:09 - about me is that i love rubik's cubes
15:12 - and that i have about 15 different ones
15:15 - at my work desk
15:18 - true and he's even led some events for
15:20 - us to teach us how to do rubik's cubes
15:23 - so
15:24 - if you need expert advice she's your
15:26 - go-to person
15:28 - all right so we're going to go ahead and
15:30 - what will we exactly cover today today
15:32 - we're going to explore
15:33 - um through a live panel discussion what
15:36 - it's like to be a woman in stem and
15:39 - we're going to take live q a questions
15:41 - from you the audience and some questions
15:43 - that have already been pre-registered so
15:45 - um go ahead if you do have any questions
15:47 - for our panelists please go ahead and
15:50 - throw those in the q a box as we want to
15:52 - hear from you
15:54 - alright so let's get ready to kick
15:57 - today's off today's event off so we're
15:59 - going to start off with our first
16:00 - question if each of these ladies
16:02 - mentioned what their roles were or you
16:04 - saw on the slide what each of their
16:06 - roles were we're going to dive in to
16:09 - dive a bit deeper into exactly what does
16:11 - that mean so you guys all have a little
16:13 - of insight into each of their roles so
16:16 - we're going to start off with our first
16:17 - question here what and this is for sanda
16:20 - what is a full stack developer and what
16:23 - does a full stack developer do
16:28 - okay basically a full stack developer is
16:31 - a developer that works on both
16:34 - the back end as well as the front end of
16:36 - the program at code monkey for example
16:39 - our work is divided into features
16:42 - so almost every feature can be divided
16:44 - into a back-end part and a front-end
16:46 - part the back end is
16:48 - uh refers to usually the server side
16:51 - code which includes connections to the
16:53 - database calculations and system-wide
16:55 - logic
16:57 - while the front-end um refers to the the
17:00 - user interface and design
17:03 - so in the past
17:05 - there are often back-end developers and
17:07 - front-end developers
17:09 - that were different not the same person
17:12 - they were different people with
17:13 - different skills
17:15 - and in more recent years it's more and
17:17 - more common for one person to do both
17:20 - and then be able to be completely
17:22 - responsible for a feature from
17:25 - start to finish
17:26 - so that's a full stock developer
17:29 - that's great i think that's good insight
17:31 - for those of you who didn't know that
17:32 - there's front sides and back sides um
17:35 - and then there's also people who make
17:37 - the pages extra beautiful for you too as
17:40 - well so lots of lots of different roles
17:43 - there
17:43 - um so our next question is for adi what
17:47 - is a technical lead at code monkey and
17:49 - what exactly does a technical lead do
17:53 - so
17:54 - i'm a full stack developer just like a
17:57 - son i mentioned before
17:59 - and i have additional responsibilities
18:03 - i plan weekly tasks for the team and i'm
18:06 - always thinking about how we can improve
18:08 - our
18:09 - the work and
18:10 - our work environment
18:13 - and they're pushing towards a better
18:14 - program and happy developers
18:20 - great so it's more of a managerial role
18:23 - as well in addition to coding right
18:26 - yeah
18:27 - okay our next question is for levnat so
18:30 - libnaught is our content developer so
18:33 - let's not what exactly is a content
18:35 - developer and what do you what does a
18:37 - content developer do
18:39 - okay so a content developer is it's like
18:41 - the
18:42 - the name uh it's someone that creates
18:44 - the content
18:46 - uh in call monkey i'm developing
18:48 - challenges and games um the ones that
18:50 - you
18:52 - i hope uh enjoy to play
18:54 - when we create a new game for example or
18:57 - when we add new challenges
19:00 - i sit with my manager and we do a little
19:03 - bit of brainstorming to decide what we
19:05 - want to teach
19:07 - for example now we are going to expand
19:10 - code monkey junior um the challenges
19:12 - there so we met and we decided
19:16 - that we want to add a new chapter on
19:19 - conditional loops
19:20 - then we decide what the characters will
19:23 - be in the game what the object
19:25 - what new object will be in the game
19:27 - and after we have um
19:30 - that
19:30 - i go and i plan what each what we will
19:33 - do in each challenge what it will look
19:35 - like
19:36 - um i and then after i have uh planned
19:40 - the
19:41 - the challenges themselves i go and they
19:44 - create them and of course play them like
19:46 - you do
19:50 - great so if you ever have any questions
19:52 - she's your person that we usually ask
19:54 - first because she's the one who created
19:56 - most of the monkey courses which is
19:57 - really cool
20:00 - um okay so our next question
20:03 - is
20:04 - for all of you so we would love to hear
20:07 - your backstory on how each of you
20:09 - actually got into the world of computer
20:11 - science
20:12 - um so we'll go ahead and put that off
20:14 - with each one of you answering the
20:16 - questions
20:18 - um okay i'll start
20:20 - um growing up which was a long time ago
20:23 - um i didn't get into i didn't have any
20:26 - um experience in computers um it didn't
20:29 - really
20:30 - interest me
20:31 - also in my high school they didn't have
20:33 - any courses
20:35 - for computer science
20:38 - and then when i had to decide what to
20:40 - study in the university
20:43 - i consulted with my dad who was
20:45 - a programmer and he told me that i would
20:48 - be good at computer science and since i
20:51 - trusted his instinct
20:53 - i uh i went and
20:56 - studied computer science at the
20:57 - beginning it took it i mean at first it
21:00 - took me a while to get into it and to
21:01 - understand it i even failed my first
21:03 - course in computer science in university
21:06 - but then um after i got the hang of it i
21:09 - really enjoyed it and very glad that i
21:11 - made that decision
21:13 - i think it's so great that you shared
21:14 - that the first time that you did it was
21:16 - really challenging and that you failed
21:18 - because there's
21:20 - many times that even when you're
21:21 - learning even we're playing the code
21:23 - monkey course itself sometimes i fail at
21:25 - the challenges too so it's nice to hear
21:27 - that
21:28 - you had some failure but just kept going
21:31 - with it
21:36 - okay who's next up adi
21:38 - yes
21:40 - yes so my story is that
21:43 - in high school
21:45 - we had to choose study majors
21:47 - and my dad tried to push me to to take
21:50 - computers and physics
21:52 - and i was too afraid because it was
21:55 - considered for boys and only nerds and
21:58 - boys
21:59 - and
22:00 - i also worried that i won't be good at
22:02 - it
22:03 - so i chose another major
22:07 - and after high school i did the military
22:10 - service and
22:13 - i sent to be an i.t person
22:16 - and for that i had to take computer
22:18 - network management course
22:20 - there i learned learned about computers
22:22 - and
22:23 - i became close to them i really liked
22:26 - them
22:26 - and i discovered that i was good at it
22:29 - and it was fun for me
22:32 - i didn't listen to my dad and i'm
22:34 - upset about it i should have
22:36 - yeah but you you got there anyway right
22:39 - your journey might have been a little
22:41 - bit different but sounds like he had the
22:43 - right thing in mind for you um just
22:45 - something i like to share with our
22:46 - audience is because our company is based
22:49 - in israel all of our ladies are actually
22:51 - joining us from our israeli office
22:54 - in israel after you finish high school
22:57 - most everyone correct me if i'm wrong
23:00 - you guys i will do military service and
23:03 - the military actually does some really
23:04 - extensive testing and they try to fit
23:07 - you into roles
23:09 - that basically best fit you so sometimes
23:12 - there's a lot of personality tests
23:13 - there's a lot of just testing that they
23:16 - do in general to kind of fit fit your
23:20 - what they think will fit you best
23:22 - is that right
23:26 - okay
23:27 - all right sanda um how did you oh sorry
23:31 - um
23:32 - yeah no problem
23:34 - i i actually didn't do military service
23:38 - um
23:39 - but uh i started um
23:42 - from
23:44 - an early age uh because of my um my
23:47 - mother who was a professor of
23:48 - mathematics
23:51 - so at an early
23:53 - very young age she already she really
23:56 - encouraged me
23:58 - to study to be involved in math and
24:00 - science activities we went to the
24:02 - science museum a lot and
24:05 - she would always give me math problems
24:07 - to do which i didn't really like
24:10 - but
24:11 - it helped me later because it was easier
24:13 - for me
24:14 - because i had someone to ask always
24:17 - um
24:18 - i also remember that she bought me a
24:20 - book about women in mathematics and i
24:23 - think that was also really inspiring as
24:25 - a young girl
24:29 - so i ended up liking math because um i i
24:33 - guess i wanted to please her but i also
24:35 - had the confidence because she gave me
24:37 - confidence
24:39 - um
24:40 - but it was only later that i got into
24:43 - computer science because it was um it
24:46 - was just more practical
24:48 - because there was there's a lot more
24:50 - applications and
24:52 - and i thought that it would be
24:55 - that i would be good at it because of
24:58 - my math background but um
25:00 - later like i realized that computers
25:03 - just like
25:06 - um is much more interesting to me and
25:09 - much more empowering and i'm i'm really
25:12 - glad that i went to study computer
25:14 - science so
25:16 - that's great that you had a mom that
25:18 - also empowered you so it sounds like all
25:20 - three of you actually had um all of your
25:22 - parents were very big supporters of
25:25 - getting you into computer science or at
25:28 - least kind of pushing you into those
25:29 - stem fields
25:34 - um okay so now we're going to
25:37 - ask another question is what program
25:40 - languages do you use and do you have a
25:43 - favorite programming language
25:48 - um so i'll start
25:50 - i use the same languages as the kids
25:54 - who plays uh cold monkey use
25:58 - uh when i create or solve challenges so
26:00 - those languages are coffeescript python
26:03 - and also coding with blocks
26:06 - um
26:07 - i i like um i like the blocks uh coding
26:11 - a lot especially when you play it on a
26:13 - tablet it's really fun to
26:15 - drag it and
26:16 - it's very um
26:18 - easy to use i think
26:21 - i agree i love code monkey jr
26:26 - yeah at codemonkey
26:28 - we use uh
26:30 - coffeescript javascript and ruby
26:33 - uh mostly um
26:36 - uh i really like javascript just because
26:38 - it's really uh easy to run on any
26:42 - computer and all you need is a browser
26:44 - you know like a terminal of a browser
26:47 - so it's really easy to run anywhere
26:50 - um and like
26:53 - most of the other languages i feel like
26:55 - are at least the ones that i've used are
26:57 - fairly simple like there's different
26:59 - syntax but
27:01 - um
27:02 - that they're the the concepts are the
27:04 - same
27:08 - i think that's important because each
27:10 - one of you mentioned that you use
27:11 - different languages but i'm sure you've
27:14 - throughout your careers have used other
27:16 - languages as well but it sounds like if
27:18 - you know the concepts of computer
27:20 - science
27:21 - then you can use any
27:23 - language
27:27 - okay
27:29 - that's great
27:31 - i think that's a good thing for for
27:32 - those kiddos to take away that you may
27:34 - you may start with a different language
27:36 - but that doesn't mean that that's going
27:37 - to be the language that you work in when
27:39 - you first start your job or you might
27:42 - also have like a few other languages
27:44 - each one of these ladies mentioned that
27:46 - they have many different languages they
27:47 - use every single day so i think that's
27:49 - if you know the concepts then just know
27:52 - that you can
27:53 - have more adversity to the languages
27:55 - even when looking for a job like it's
27:57 - still like people ask for certain
28:00 - languages like experience in certain
28:02 - languages and i feel like it's not that
28:04 - relevant for the most part you know
28:07 - um
28:08 - you know it's experience that you can
28:10 - learn within
28:12 - a few weeks i think for the most part
28:15 - like
28:16 - um
28:18 - so
28:19 - i don't know
28:21 - i think that's great though i think
28:23 - that's good feedback because you see a
28:24 - lot of people who ask those types of
28:26 - questions when they are interviewing or
28:28 - trying to apply for jobs like oh i see
28:30 - that it has this language but i may not
28:32 - know that
28:33 - um
28:34 - i may not know that language is it
28:37 - should i still apply and i think what
28:39 - you're saying is that
28:41 - with you know one language very well and
28:43 - then
28:45 - you can probably apply most of the
28:47 - things to other languages like of course
28:49 - there are there there are languages that
28:51 - are much different but most of the
28:52 - languages that are used in programming
28:55 - uh web
28:57 - are fairly you know similar
29:01 - great though i think that's really good
29:02 - feedback
29:03 - okay so our next question is
29:06 - we know that math and coding have close
29:08 - ties to each other we always hear math
29:10 - and coding they go so well together
29:12 - so how do you feel
29:14 - that this brought you to being a
29:17 - programmer
29:20 - so i'll answer that
29:23 - um
29:24 - so in mathematics there are like
29:27 - just a single answer either
29:30 - it's right or it's wrong
29:32 - you need to get to a single result
29:36 - and
29:38 - so for me it's give me a lot of
29:40 - certainty like i know
29:43 - if i'm right i know
29:45 - and so
29:47 - this is something i find
29:49 - connected in programming
29:51 - i need to reach some result i know if
29:54 - the program is working or not
29:57 - so that's the connection for me
30:01 - yeah sounds like a lot of problem
30:02 - solving skills kind of go together and
30:04 - that those math problem solving work
30:07 - itself with the regular coding that you
30:09 - use every single day
30:14 - okay
30:15 - so code monkey has a pretty equal ratio
30:18 - of men to women just in the whole
30:20 - company in general um obviously our
30:23 - women development team is majority women
30:25 - so it's really one of my favorite things
30:27 - about working at the company
30:29 - and has that been an experience that
30:32 - you've experienced
30:34 - that same thing of more women to men or
30:36 - equal ratios and other workplaces that
30:39 - you've worked at
30:43 - uh from
30:45 - for me like uh it is a very different
30:48 - experience um
30:50 - working at code monkey
30:52 - um the other places i worked at were
30:55 - like at most like 25
30:58 - like women
31:00 - especially in the development like um
31:03 - and i think it just adds like for me
31:05 - it's a lot more comfortable
31:08 - i think there's like a greater sense of
31:10 - camaraderie and like helping each other
31:13 - out i don't know if it's because there
31:14 - are more women or an equal amount of
31:17 - women in the company but i think it
31:19 - helps like
31:21 - um
31:24 - i wish more places were like that
31:27 - definitely
31:30 - i think i think it's um important you
31:33 - know to have women around you also to
31:35 - support you but i think
31:36 - we've discussed this offline prior to
31:39 - you know having our event today um just
31:41 - about how kobuki has also supported them
31:43 - which we'll dive a little bit deeper
31:45 - here in a bit about also being mothers
31:48 - in the workplace and i think that as
31:50 - women
31:51 - sometimes that could be a scary thing
31:52 - and sometimes can push women back from
31:55 - actually moving into more of those
31:56 - managerial roles
31:58 - because being a mom
32:00 - um
32:01 - sometimes or has often been stereotyped
32:04 - that we have to stay home or that we
32:07 - have to kind of give up
32:08 - our roles in the
32:10 - professional world to be mothers so i
32:13 - know that sanda and lyvnat are both moms
32:17 - um so
32:18 - i guess we can kind of talk about that a
32:20 - bit
32:21 - how has that experience been for both of
32:23 - you
32:24 - being a woman in stem and then also
32:26 - being moms
32:30 - um so
32:31 - that actually goes to the next question
32:35 - um
32:37 - well and i worked in when i
32:40 - worked in my previous company
32:43 - we worked with offices in the us
32:47 - and because of the time difference i had
32:49 - to have
32:50 - a lot of meeting took place in
32:52 - the afternoon
32:54 - and evening of israel time
32:57 - um
32:58 - so it made me stay
33:01 - at work late and miss
33:03 - being with my kids at home for dinner
33:06 - and other times i would have to stay at
33:08 - work to to join those meetings
33:11 - um i would go home to be with my kids
33:14 - and then i would miss on um meetings at
33:17 - work
33:18 - so
33:18 - um it made me
33:20 - feel that i wasn't 100 at home and also
33:25 - i wasn't 100 at work and um
33:28 - i always felt guilty about something so
33:32 - um i felt that that was
33:35 - harsh because i don't know if
33:37 - um
33:38 - male i mean if men feel the same
33:41 - as we do i don't know
33:43 - i think that it's probably has been
33:46 - important to find a
33:48 - company that also supports that you are
33:52 - a mom and
33:54 - you know and you're working too so that
33:55 - you can kind of have those experiences
33:58 - with your children too
34:06 - um sanda do you have any additional
34:08 - points to to that one
34:10 - yes sorry um
34:14 - yeah um i'm still getting used to the
34:17 - mom thing
34:18 - so i think feel like i'm still working
34:22 - on it um
34:24 - both being a mom and
34:26 - being a programmer and
34:29 - um yeah sometimes i feel like i'm
34:33 - not good at either or okay
34:37 - at both
34:39 - but yeah code monkey is supportive place
34:42 - and very understanding
34:45 - and it helps that are there are other
34:47 - people in my position you know um
34:50 - definitely helps
34:52 - um
34:53 - in general i feel like um
34:56 - like
34:58 - at interviews i think i felt a lot of um
35:03 - sort of like uh when there are several
35:05 - men interviewing me and like a lot of
35:08 - the you know sometimes you feel like
35:10 - they're very competitive and just kind
35:12 - of showing off uh to one another it's
35:15 - like
35:16 - i felt that way at interviews um it's
35:19 - definitely not fun it's one of the
35:22 - less fun activities
35:24 - um and finding a job as a programmer the
35:27 - interviews are very tough um at least
35:29 - here i don't know um i bet same in the
35:32 - states
35:34 - um
35:35 - but um
35:38 - also at places i've worked even after
35:40 - getting into the in you know going
35:42 - through the interview process and
35:44 - getting accepted at a place and then
35:46 - being really unhappy because just
35:48 - feeling that the culture is a total
35:50 - mismatch it's just like a lot of men
35:53 - that are like really competitive and
35:55 - want to make lots of money
35:57 - and like you've gone through this whole
35:59 - extensive process and you feel like you
36:01 - just want to get out of there so and you
36:04 - know i've left places like that and i
36:06 - left one place after a few months only
36:08 - working even though i felt really guilty
36:10 - you know
36:11 - but it was really smart that i left
36:13 - because then i started working at code
36:15 - monkey after a while and
36:17 - um i think it's just like um
36:20 - you just have to find a right the right
36:23 - fit like there are so many places and
36:26 - like not to just get stuck in some place
36:28 - that
36:29 - doesn't make you feel good
36:32 - so
36:33 - i think that's an important
36:36 - i think thing to identify is that
36:38 - sometimes we are feeling like we have to
36:41 - compete so so much to prove ourselves
36:43 - um and then you just mentioned like you
36:45 - had a lot of guilt of walking away from
36:47 - where you were but i think that
36:49 - it's kind of like when you're learning
36:51 - anything new even the workplace is the
36:53 - same sort of situation you have to try
36:55 - until you find something that's right
36:57 - um and i think that it it's okay as
36:59 - being a woman i know sometimes we think
37:01 - oh we work so hard to get here
37:04 - um and earn the respect but if it if it
37:06 - doesn't feel like the respect is mutual
37:08 - once you're in the door it's important
37:10 - to know that there are other places that
37:12 - you can go and it doesn't make you a bad
37:14 - person and it doesn't make you
37:16 - any less of a any less of a woman or any
37:19 - less of you know a person contributing
37:21 - to the work field but just knowing that
37:23 - you can stand up for you is an important
37:25 - fact too
37:27 - so i think that's i think that's really
37:28 - good feedback to share with students
37:34 - did you say something sentenced are you
37:35 - remoted
37:38 - no i totally agree oh okay
37:40 - um i could read your words bye i wasn't
37:42 - sure if that's what you meant
37:45 - um and then adi i guess we we mentioned
37:47 - this question at the beginning here is
37:49 - being a woman in a mostly dominated
37:51 - field have you experienced any hardships
37:54 - um just being in the field itself i know
37:56 - we mentioned it with lyvnot and sanda
37:57 - but i'd love to hear from you any
38:00 - hardships that you've experienced
38:02 - yeah so for me code monkey is my first
38:05 - full-time job in this field and i feel
38:07 - very lucky and sanda was the first one
38:10 - to interview me here
38:12 - so it was really nice and
38:15 - so now
38:16 - until now i haven't experienced any
38:18 - hardships as a woman
38:22 - and i think that that's i think that
38:24 - that's great because we kind of have um
38:26 - a bit of like generational
38:28 - all of us are you know different ages
38:30 - and so we've kind of experienced
38:32 - different things coming into the
38:33 - workplace
38:35 - and i think as each year progresses
38:38 - companies are becoming more inviting and
38:41 - more welcoming to women actually having
38:43 - these
38:44 - these different you know roles and
38:46 - things like that so i think i think the
38:48 - fact that you haven't really experienced
38:49 - that i think also speaks to where we are
38:52 - today and i think it's it's really great
38:54 - to see that you're also able to you know
38:56 - you are a lead of code monkey and the
38:58 - technical team and i think that's really
39:00 - cool to just you know kind of hear
39:02 - everyone's experiences and how things
39:03 - have changed
39:06 - does anyone have any follow-up to that
39:10 - okay
39:14 - um okay so when you shared i think this
39:17 - is a good question for everyone to kind
39:19 - of know um when you share with your
39:20 - family and friends that you're going to
39:22 - become a computer scientist
39:24 - did you face any opposition i know each
39:26 - one of you spoke about your past
39:27 - experiences but was there any any
39:29 - opposition that you got from anyone when
39:31 - you did decide and tell everyone that
39:33 - you were going to become a computer
39:35 - scientist
39:38 - for me at first when i chose to go to
39:41 - study computer engineering my parents
39:44 - were very supportive
39:46 - my brothers that
39:48 - were both of them already engineers
39:51 - they were teased being beat they they
39:54 - said that i wasn't smart enough
39:56 - and
39:57 - some of my friends laughed at me for
40:00 - being a robot and
40:02 - some thought it will be hard for me to
40:04 - compete
40:06 - on job
40:07 - with the other mans
40:09 - that it was a meant for a world for men
40:13 - yeah
40:16 - i didn't listen to them
40:17 - good i think that's good feedback
40:20 - yeah dee doesn't really listen to
40:22 - anybody it's good
40:25 - that's the best advice
40:26 - best advice it is good advice for sure
40:29 - um
40:30 - asando what about you i know you had a
40:32 - little bit different experience um
40:35 - yeah
40:36 - you know also like we were we all had
40:38 - support from our from our uh
40:41 - parents that's how we got into it so
40:43 - yeah so my mom's really happy like
40:47 - um she was really um
40:50 - she
40:51 - thought it was really important for me
40:52 - to have like a
40:54 - a strong um
40:56 - uh you know like base
40:59 - sort of uh financial base also
41:02 - um
41:03 - and i think um
41:06 - i it was just for me it was like a
41:08 - practical decision that i made later in
41:11 - life and um
41:13 - [Music]
41:15 - only later i i realized it was also
41:17 - something that could
41:19 - make me also happy like
41:22 - but i think i was just like confident
41:24 - with my decision for for like a
41:27 - practical decision that's it
41:30 - and i think we and we talked about this
41:32 - a bit offline but online too is that um
41:34 - sanda actually her undergrad because her
41:37 - mom is a mathematician and she actually
41:40 - studied so sonda grew up in the united
41:42 - states now she now lives in israel so
41:44 - that's why she didn't have to do the
41:46 - military service there um but she had a
41:49 - different experience where she started
41:51 - out being her undergrad is in math and
41:53 - then she decided to move into computer
41:55 - science so i thought about teaching math
41:58 - and then i quickly realized it was like
42:02 - way too stressful for me
42:05 - um
42:06 - and then i i sort of like took some time
42:08 - off and and tried to figure out what
42:11 - would
42:12 - fit me better you know and my
42:15 - undergraduate like was at a liberal arts
42:17 - school so like
42:19 - what i studied like the math i studied
42:21 - in undergrad is like
42:23 - one semester of what i studied in
42:26 - computer science like it was crazy um
42:29 - how much how intense it was studying
42:31 - computers but like
42:34 - um it was worth it like
42:38 - [Music]
42:40 - um
42:41 - yeah i think what what you mentioned too
42:43 - is that that wasn't you didn't
42:45 - originally
42:46 - think about i mean you had some inkling
42:49 - about being in computers and things like
42:51 - that but that it's never too late to
42:53 - switch
42:54 - a career or find a new passion and i
42:57 - think that um taking you know you took
43:00 - some
43:02 - being a doctor or something where you
43:04 - have to study a friend do like a
43:06 - residency in like 10 years like with
43:08 - computers if you study intensively you
43:10 - can really
43:11 - get somewhere in you know a few years
43:13 - and like
43:15 - there are so many applications like
43:18 - it's crazy
43:19 - yeah i agree i agree with that and i
43:21 - think and i think that's what i think is
43:23 - so unique about computer science is that
43:25 - there are things like we mentioned
43:27 - coding boot camps and like those
43:28 - different things um that
43:30 - you can take and you also mentioned
43:32 - being financially
43:34 - stable and that was an important thing
43:36 - that your mom and you know everybody
43:38 - wants us to be financially stable but
43:40 - computer science and a career in
43:42 - computer science or stem typically leads
43:44 - to a higher salary so allowing us as
43:47 - women to be able to support ourselves
43:49 - independently
43:54 - um
43:55 - oh sorry bud
43:56 - which is very important
43:59 - it is very important
44:01 - does anyone have any finishing thoughts
44:02 - on that one
44:06 - okay and we're gonna we're getting some
44:08 - questions here too so we'll
44:10 - get to that here in just a few minutes
44:11 - some really great things are coming in
44:13 - here um
44:14 - and then we briefly mentioned this i
44:16 - think a little bit there but just wanted
44:18 - to see if anyone had any finishing
44:19 - points here is do you feel that code
44:21 - monkey has supported you as a woman in
44:24 - stem
44:27 - i would say definitely yes
44:30 - [Music]
44:31 - codmin is a very flexible work
44:33 - environment as long as the work gets
44:35 - done
44:36 - you can do it from home you can do it
44:41 - at the time that um best fit you
44:45 - i was able to work from home and
44:47 - accommodate
44:48 - my hours
44:50 - so that i can also be
44:53 - a mom and
44:54 - um
44:56 - and walk so
44:59 - definitely yes
45:03 - yes also i agree uh it's a very i think
45:07 - uh very flexible place and uh there's
45:10 - really a feeling um
45:12 - of um you know
45:15 - listening and thinking about each
45:17 - other's needs
45:19 - not just like pretend like
45:21 - like really so
45:23 - um that's very important and nice
45:28 - okay what about you
45:30 - i agree i don't feel that we're treated
45:32 - any differently for being a woman just
45:35 - everybody here
45:36 - and the environment is really flexible
45:39 - and understanding and
45:41 - as long as the work is done well so
45:43 - we're supported to work
45:45 - in the environment and that it's most
45:47 - comfortable for us
45:50 - which i think is
45:52 - which i think is important
45:54 - um before we get to this last question i
45:56 - just want to ask you guys how many of
45:57 - you do know women that haven't had
45:59 - exactly the same experience being a
46:02 - woman supported in stem
46:05 - do you guys know anyone
46:09 - none of you guys everyone feels like you
46:10 - guys know women that have been pretty
46:12 - supported around you
46:16 - that's pretty much
46:18 - that's great though i think that's an
46:20 - it's rare but that's important i think
46:23 - also it could also be i wonder if it's
46:24 - like a culture or anything
46:27 - oh i know women in stem yeah i think
46:30 - like i don't know i was just like um
46:35 - um
46:36 - yeah it's a difficult question
46:39 - um
46:41 - we can think on it we could touch back
46:43 - on it later um and then i will mention
46:45 - just for i know we talked about this
46:47 - would your family going into um computer
46:49 - science did you have any opposition i
46:51 - just also wanted to answer myself
46:52 - because i'm also in the stem field with
46:54 - who all as well for me i had a lot of
46:57 - people who discouraged me from going
46:59 - into computer science i did physics and
47:01 - i did advanced math courses
47:03 - but when i finally went to it they said
47:05 - oh you wouldn't be good at it and so it
47:07 - took me until i was teaching i had a
47:09 - whole another career in head of it and i
47:11 - was actually introduced during the hour
47:13 - of code to computer science i took a
47:14 - workshop
47:16 - for code.org and so that's actually how
47:18 - i found
47:20 - computer science and started having a
47:21 - love and started attending all these
47:22 - workshops and then started just kind of
47:24 - self-teaching myself and not as great of
47:26 - a coder as these ladies
47:28 - but
47:29 - i have learned quite a bit through the
47:31 - process so i think it's important to
47:32 - know that you just keep going and and
47:34 - it's okay if not everyone agrees with
47:36 - your pathway but you'll find your people
47:38 - when you do so i think that's important
47:40 - too
47:42 - okay so this is a question that we
47:45 - mentioned and the purpose of really why
47:47 - we're doing this is why do you feel it's
47:49 - important to support other women who are
47:50 - currently in stem or wanting to get into
47:53 - the field itself
47:57 - so
47:59 - having more women in stem careers will
48:02 - help narrow down the journey
48:05 - gender pay gap
48:07 - and then
48:08 - enhance women economic security we said
48:11 - it's really important
48:12 - also it ensures the diversity and a
48:16 - talented workforce
48:18 - and uh prevents biases in this fields
48:21 - when it comes to the products and the
48:23 - services that they produce
48:26 - i think it's very important
48:29 - great i think that's a very important um
48:32 - aspect into it and the gender pick up
48:34 - those are all really you know really
48:36 - real things that we've been able to see
48:39 - starting to make movements in the last
48:41 - few years but still needing a little bit
48:43 - more i think traction
48:45 - than there is now
48:47 - um okay so our last like really question
48:50 - before we take our q a from the audience
48:52 - is what inspirational message would you
48:55 - give to young girls or to women to
48:57 - inspire them
48:58 - to pursue stem and whatever that looks
49:02 - like for them
49:04 - i would say that um you can do anything
49:06 - you want and don't be afraid to start to
49:09 - to try new things and
49:11 - you might find that you like them you
49:12 - might find that you don't which is also
49:14 - okay but don't be afraid
49:22 - yeah that's exactly what i want to say
49:28 - for me like i was
49:30 - forced to study computers and that's how
49:32 - i got
49:34 - to know that i'm good at it and that i
49:35 - like it
49:36 - so if you are forced to do something or
49:39 - to learn something that you think you're
49:41 - not good at it just think about it in a
49:43 - positive way
49:45 - you might find that you like it you
49:47 - might not but
49:48 - just try
49:53 - yeah and i think that also like the many
49:55 - applications like there's so much power
49:58 - and in computers and programming and
50:01 - it's like really sometimes in like
50:04 - movies or tv it looks like this really
50:06 - narrow type of person that goes into
50:09 - these fields of like this computer nerd
50:12 - that like sits on
50:13 - like types like really fast
50:16 - and i think that it's like it's really
50:20 - doesn't have to be that way and it's not
50:22 - that way and like
50:23 - um there are so many uh applications um
50:28 - and
50:28 - so much power really and and i feel like
50:32 - yes you know women should be in those
50:35 - in those power positions and and give
50:37 - some more perspective to the world like
50:40 - um i think it will make it the world a
50:43 - better place like really
50:45 - so
50:46 - definitely
50:48 - and i think each one of you has
50:50 - you know kind of said just try i think
50:52 - that's the important thing with the hour
50:54 - of code and really anything that you do
50:56 - just try and you probably it sounds like
50:59 - every single one of them at the very
51:00 - beginning had some hardship with
51:02 - learning how to even do computer science
51:04 - because it is very it is challenging um
51:08 - and there's just even you know writing
51:10 - code and even really well you know all
51:12 - of you will know and anyone who works in
51:15 - other companies will say that you know
51:16 - you have these long sprints and you're
51:18 - doing your code and everything seems
51:19 - like it's great and then bam there's one
51:22 - little syntax error that's hidden
51:24 - somewhere and it takes you hours and
51:25 - days to find where it is so
51:28 - um i think just trying is important
51:29 - anything we do in life just try
51:32 - you may not like it you know let's say
51:34 - it's you know
51:35 - give it a no thank you
51:37 - taste
51:39 - um okay so now we're gonna switch gears
51:41 - and we are going to take questions from
51:43 - the audience so i do just want to thank
51:45 - these ladies for
51:47 - taking these questions and giving their
51:48 - time to us today
51:50 - um and all of you that are spending your
51:52 - time with us too so we did have this
51:54 - question from
51:55 - miss thomas
51:57 - she is in arkansas arkansas and she
51:59 - teaches grades six through eight and so
52:01 - she had this question for you all how
52:03 - can i encourage young women to become
52:05 - part of stem programs whether in school
52:08 - or even out of school
52:14 - yeah i think the first
52:16 - step is to ask
52:18 - young women what
52:20 - interests them and
52:22 - what will encourage them to
52:25 - to
52:26 - to learn stem
52:29 - then try to think how you combine it
52:31 - with program because
52:34 - you can you can
52:35 - combine everything
52:37 - this program like sanders said there are
52:39 - so many applications
52:42 - but the first step is to ask young women
52:47 - that's such great advice i think like
52:50 - because
52:52 - i wouldn't think about it but it's true
52:54 - like
52:56 - uh so i so often like
52:59 - i think that
53:00 - computers aren't taught that way that
53:02 - it's like
53:04 - taught in a certain way and then like
53:06 - really if you just
53:08 - ask
53:09 - what interests the kids like and then
53:13 - show them how it can fit like
53:16 - you can make it
53:17 - a little bit more relevant
53:22 - without do you have any on that
53:24 - um no i'll go with my friends here okay
53:30 - i also think that when you have
53:33 - how to encourage them is i think to also
53:35 - expose them a bit in your classroom so i
53:38 - think taking those traditional
53:41 - regular content areas like science or
53:43 - language arts pairs really really nicely
53:45 - with doing computer science or any of
53:48 - those types of things is that actually
53:49 - everything kind of aligns all together
53:52 - so i think exposing them a bit in the
53:53 - classroom
53:55 - is a really good way to encourage them
53:57 - to try things outside of it sometimes
53:58 - it's lower risk for them to do it in the
54:00 - classroom and then you're like oh you
54:02 - just did all these stem things
54:04 - and then it'll kind of encourage them to
54:05 - do it outside of the classroom one thing
54:07 - that i do caution is making things
54:10 - exclusively like
54:12 - all women like when i've done i've seen
54:14 - coding clubs beginning
54:16 - is they'll take like
54:18 - barbie dolls or something and all the
54:20 - coding needs to be surrounding just
54:22 - strictly
54:23 - women
54:24 - you know dolls or things things like
54:26 - that you
54:27 - we like to do legos too so just giving
54:30 - us more general neutral exposure is also
54:33 - important it doesn't have to be all pink
54:35 - it doesn't have to be all this it can be
54:37 - exposure for everyone
54:39 - thought of anything really yeah
54:43 - like oh we have to do and i've seen it
54:45 - in actually a lot of schools throughout
54:47 - the years just in the exposure is that
54:49 - everything has to be all strictly
54:51 - you know super girly and i think that
54:54 - um there's
54:55 - while it's interesting at the beginning
54:57 - to kind of encourage them to do that i
54:59 - think that there's a danger in sticking
55:00 - only in that zone um so i think just
55:03 - exposing them as much as you can so
55:06 - yeah that's what i have there um before
55:08 - we um we also have some other questions
55:10 - these were pre questions here um i just
55:13 - have a couple of comments from people
55:14 - who have been joining us from around the
55:16 - world we have somebody in bhutan and
55:18 - somebody and a few people in singapore
55:20 - that have been joining us um and one
55:23 - person just shared with us they said
55:24 - it's so inspiring to hear each of your
55:26 - stories
55:28 - they're running coding classes in
55:30 - singapore this person um and so it's
55:33 - just great to hear um your own story so
55:36 - i just wanted to share that with you
55:37 - guys as well um and then we had a
55:40 - question here
55:41 - um at what age did you actually really
55:44 - start coding so i think each one of you
55:46 - could probably answer this so i was 22
55:49 - when i went to university
55:52 - or maybe 21
55:54 - between those ages
55:56 - okay
55:58 - yeah i think i started studying computer
56:01 - science at age 23 or 24
56:04 - but like the whole
56:07 - it was very little programming like
56:09 - mostly it was very theoretical
56:11 - and um i only started really programming
56:14 - at my first job that was like at 27 or
56:17 - something like that like
56:19 - i didn't know at all like from the
56:21 - university like what i studied and then
56:25 - totally different
56:26 - [Laughter]
56:28 - but um
56:30 - i think that's great feedback too i
56:32 - think a lot of times when
56:35 - in higher ed we walk away with only
56:37 - knowing limited skill set but where you
56:39 - actually do most of your learning is on
56:40 - the job
56:42 - yeah what about you a d
56:45 - i was 23 when i started university
56:50 - i think it's great that you all also
56:52 - started pretty young for me when i first
56:54 - learned i think i was oh maybe probably
56:56 - around the same age probably like 20 25
56:59 - 26 so i guess we all started young so
57:01 - that's good but
57:03 - um i've recently been doing lots of
57:04 - trainings with other teachers and things
57:06 - like that and i had a woman who was in
57:08 - one of the trainings she was almost 80
57:10 - years old and she was just beginning to
57:11 - do block based coding so it's never too
57:14 - late and she was
57:16 - so jazzed when she started figuring it
57:18 - out so i think that
57:20 - if an older person who's
57:22 - well seasoned in life and has lots of
57:24 - you know experiences can start coding
57:27 - then and you can too
57:31 - okay so another question um
57:38 - for you all was um hold on one second i
57:41 - lost my place here
57:45 - um
57:46 - okay so if you could go back and tell
57:48 - your younger you one thing about today
57:52 - what is something that you would tell
57:53 - them
57:56 - i'll give you time to process because
57:58 - that's a tough
57:59 - tough question
58:01 - about myself now yeah you would tell
58:04 - yeah tell about like where you are now
58:06 - like if you could tell your give your
58:09 - younger self advice about our
58:11 - world today what would you say
58:14 - i think i will tell her to take this
58:16 - study major to take computers in high
58:18 - school
58:21 - then i will tell her that
58:23 - she needs to be really proud of her
58:25 - herself
58:27 - she really need to believe in herself
58:29 - and and don't listen to people that
58:30 - don't don't support her
58:36 - that's
58:37 - great really good feedback oh i love
58:39 - that be brave that's a good one too
58:47 - i would say for me i think i would take
58:50 - exactly what these advice is
58:52 - um to
58:54 - just
58:55 - go with my good instinct because i was
58:57 - always like tinkering with things i was
58:58 - like taking things apart and putting
59:00 - them back together when i was like young
59:03 - and that wasn't seen as like the girly
59:05 - thing to do
59:06 - but i think if i would have just
59:07 - followed that pathway i probably would
59:09 - be sitting in your seats today
59:17 - yeah i think i would tell myself also
59:20 - like
59:21 - to try as many new things as possible i
59:25 - think i was always very
59:27 - uh
59:28 - kind of wary and timid and um i think
59:32 - now i'm starting to realize how many
59:34 - more interests i have and you know like
59:39 - uh
59:39 - and that uh
59:42 - right to be brave i think that's a great
59:44 - great thing um
59:47 - to just
59:50 - try new things yeah
59:54 - great perspective
59:57 - um
59:58 - i would say that um
60:01 - balance is very important so you have to
60:04 - have um
60:06 - to do what you want to do on like
60:10 - leave time for yourself to do things
60:12 - that make you happy as a person and then
60:16 - have enough time to
60:18 - um to do your job and then have enough
60:20 - time with the family so just
60:22 - find balances
60:25 - in life
60:30 - go ahead
60:31 - to see the details
60:32 - [Laughter]
60:35 - you know there's so
60:37 - there's so much going on in the world
60:38 - you know like thinking about the animal
60:41 - part like
60:43 - um
60:44 - there's so many there's so much we can
60:46 - do i think just uh just by seeing the
60:49 - details that's it you know
60:54 - i i agree with that um since you guys
60:56 - are all
60:58 - part of the code monkey team
61:00 - um since we kicked off an avatar
61:03 - competition where students get to create
61:05 - their own avatars
61:07 - we're having a competition where they
61:08 - draw them and then we're going to turn
61:09 - them into code monkey avatars do you
61:11 - guys have a favorite code monkey avatar
61:13 - that you guys use
61:15 - i love the penguin
61:17 - i wanted to say that too
61:19 - it's also my favorite too
61:21 - i also like the flamingo from the banana
61:24 - table
61:25 - flamingo is good too what's your sanda
61:27 - the cat
61:28 - obviously
61:33 - smooth and orange
61:36 - yes very cute
61:38 - well i want to thank all of you guys so
61:41 - much again for taking time and kicking
61:43 - off your hour of code event with us we
61:45 - are so happy to have these ladies join
61:47 - us
61:48 - um
61:49 - they were a bit nervous before they
61:50 - joined us but i think they did an
61:52 - amazing amazing job and we're so lucky
61:54 - that we had them take time out of their
61:55 - day to share with you your stories and
61:57 - hopefully creating some inspiration for
61:59 - your own students
62:01 - and knowing that you can really do
62:04 - anything that you put your mind to and
62:06 - just try i think that's the the key from
62:08 - today just try so we want to thank you
62:10 - guys again for spending your time with
62:12 - us please remember to like share
62:14 - subscribe and also
62:17 - make sure that you check out all of the
62:18 - hour of code courses that we have and
62:21 - just give them a try all right until
62:23 - next time we'll see you guys later thank
62:24 - you guys so much
62:26 - bye everybody
62:29 - bye
