03:26 - we'll make sure that we
03:29 - will follow up with you directly after
03:31 - today's webinar
03:33 - so we first just like to talk about what
03:35 - is the hour of code obviously all of you
03:37 - guys are joining us
03:38 - to because you already know a little bit
03:40 - about the hour of code
03:42 - but the hour of code was really just
03:44 - designed to be an introduction
03:46 - introduction into computer science
03:48 - really designed to
03:50 - really show that anybody can learn
03:52 - coding and that coding can be very fun
03:54 - it's not really about learning all the
03:56 - basics of computer science within one
03:58 - hour it's not realistic it's really just
04:00 - a way to open up the window and show
04:02 - that coding
04:03 - is really for all and that
04:06 - as long as you take the leap that it can
04:08 - be easy and fun
04:10 - and engaging for students so it's really
04:13 - more about um just teaching both
04:16 - students
04:16 - and yourselves that computer science is
04:18 - fun and that you can learn
04:20 - at any age which is really something you
04:22 - can't do with a lot of things
04:24 - and the computer science is not limited
04:27 - to one
04:28 - hour of coding there are thousands of
04:29 - events that happen during computer
04:31 - science education week that go beyond
04:32 - the hour of code we have one that we'll
04:34 - share with you today at the end of our
04:35 - webinar as well
04:36 - and it involves activities other than
04:39 - just coding
04:40 - that are all under the umbrella and
04:42 - celebration of the hour of code
04:45 - um one of the biggest things that we've
04:46 - seen during covet 19 as you all know
04:49 - is that there are so many job
04:51 - opportunities within the digital space
04:53 - that require students to have some sort
04:55 - of an understanding of computer science
04:58 - and you can see that with just how even
05:00 - the retail season or black friday went
05:02 - this year it was completely all digital
05:04 - thus meaning that we need more people to
05:06 - fill those roles so there's a lot of
05:08 - openings in those roles
05:10 - and they tend to just
05:13 - we really want to open the window to all
05:15 - students and all learners and not just
05:17 - a certain type of learner we know that
05:20 - others are saying
05:21 - there is a need for computer science of
05:22 - course one of my faves bill gates
05:25 - and then there's also governors sharing
05:27 - the importance of computer science and
05:28 - how important it is for students to
05:30 - learn computer science
05:33 - so our webinar objectives today we
05:35 - talked about what is the hour of code
05:37 - and really how it kind of began we're
05:39 - going to share code monkey's story how
05:40 - to find us
05:41 - so we're going to reveal our newest code
05:43 - monkey course
05:44 - and then what sorts of things will you
05:46 - need to consider when running your hour
05:49 - of code course
05:50 - and then we will explore the courses and
05:52 - then have time for q and a
05:54 - at the end so pretty fast and furious in
05:56 - this 30 minutes so
05:57 - bear with me and i hope you're ready for
05:59 - the ride
06:02 - um so code monkey was founded or really
06:05 - born
06:05 - in uh 2014 with the code monkeys
06:09 - co-found
06:11 - there are two brothers and their best
06:13 - friend they found that the company their
06:14 - computer scientist by
06:16 - from very young age they really love
06:18 - doing computer science and they found
06:20 - that
06:21 - when teaching students traditional
06:23 - coding languages they just didn't really
06:24 - learn in the same way and so when they
06:26 - started to make it
06:27 - more gamified and fun using code monkey
06:31 - students really grasp the concepts and
06:34 - they were more engaged and they felt
06:38 - less restricted to learn how to code so
06:40 - today code monkey is a reading fun
06:43 - and intuitive curriculum we do have
06:45 - students worldwide i think we are almost
06:47 - at 15 million
06:48 - users and it's where students can learn
06:52 - to
06:52 - program in real life coding languages we
06:54 - also have many teachers who have taught
06:56 - themselves to code also throughout the
06:58 - program so that's exciting too
07:00 - what makes codemonkey a little bit
07:01 - different is that um
07:04 - it's really fun and easy and it's more
07:06 - gamified it's
07:07 - user-friendly and intuitive and really
07:10 - we desi we have some tools to put
07:12 - you in the driver's seat a lot of things
07:15 - can be restricted
07:16 - you may not know the answer so we really
07:17 - try to put you in the front seat
07:20 - driving the car and it's also extremely
07:22 - easy to roll out as well
07:25 - so now we're going to announce code
07:26 - monkey's newest course i don't know if
07:28 - you've been following along the email
07:30 - threads but we've been dropping along
07:31 - puzzle pieces along the way
07:33 - so our newest course is space adventure
07:37 - or space
07:38 - monkey so we'll get into what that looks
07:39 - like it's really fun and
07:41 - i think your students are really going
07:43 - to enjoy it
07:44 - so we currently have nine hour of code
07:47 - courses and so we're going to get into
07:49 - exactly what all of those
07:50 - look like it's really exciting it spans
07:53 - really the great
07:54 - grades k through almost if you use the
07:57 - moonlander with the physics almost
07:58 - through 10th grade so pretty big
08:00 - span
08:03 - so before we get into diving into the
08:05 - courses and all what all of that looks
08:07 - like let's talk about where you can find
08:09 - us for the hour of code so for
08:11 - our code courses you don't need to have
08:12 - a teacher trial i'll show you
08:14 - how you can do that um but you can
08:16 - actually
08:17 - showcase and code the students can code
08:20 - without having to have a
08:21 - login for the hour of code so how you
08:24 - will do that
08:24 - is let's go ahead and do that together
08:26 - so hour of code last year
08:28 - it used to be code.org it had it hosted
08:30 - now it's
08:31 - its own domain so it is hourofco.com
08:34 - when you go there i just clicked on
08:39 - the try it so i'm here at the main page
08:42 - our code.com
08:43 - and i click on try it and when i click
08:46 - on try it
08:47 - then it will bring me to the courses
08:49 - here and over along the side you can
08:51 - click on
08:52 - any specific computer company
08:56 - you could a tech company that's here and
08:58 - you can find us at code monkey studios
09:00 - here
09:01 - when you do you'll see there are two
09:03 - categories beginner and comfortable so
09:05 - in the beginner courses we have our
09:07 - space adventure
09:08 - beaver achiever code monkey junior
09:09 - banana tales does math and coding
09:11 - adventure
09:12 - and then in our comfortable think about
09:13 - that as the more advanced courses that's
09:15 - our game builder trivia chatbot and our
09:17 - moonlighter
09:18 - moonlander is the most challenging out
09:20 - of all of the courses
09:22 - it is physics-based concepts and so
09:25 - just keep that in mind with your
09:26 - students if they don't have much
09:28 - exposure to coding want them to have as
09:29 - much fun as possible and to not feel
09:31 - frustration
09:34 - so that's how you can locate us here
09:35 - through the code.orgs page
09:37 - or another way that you can um
09:40 - find us is by going to sorry excuse me
09:43 - is by going to
09:45 - codemonkey.com backslash our dash of
09:48 - dash code or you can scroll down to the
09:51 - bottom of codemonkey's website in the
09:52 - footer you'll see our code and you can
09:54 - find it there
09:56 - when you do excuse me when you do get to
09:58 - the hour of code
09:59 - page what you'll see is the hour of code
10:02 - activities you can sign up for a trial
10:04 - here if you would like the trial does
10:06 - include 100 seats
10:08 - and gives you access to basically all of
10:10 - the hour of code
10:11 - with all of the features the teacher
10:12 - resources student accounts
10:14 - and all of that so here are the hour of
10:17 - code
10:18 - courses what happens when you click on
10:20 - any one of the courses that you
10:21 - want to take you can start playing right
10:24 - here without any login
10:26 - some other things to note on these hour
10:28 - code pages
10:30 - are it tells you what grade levels there
10:33 - for
10:34 - and what concepts will be covered and
10:36 - then there's also teacher notes and
10:38 - standards if you want those as well but
10:40 - in the teacher notes when you click on
10:41 - access teacher notes it's going to give
10:43 - you an overview
10:44 - what things you'll need so i see some
10:46 - people asking me
10:48 - what students
10:51 - what devices students should use and
10:54 - what you kind of need for the setup
10:56 - it'll be all located here within each
10:58 - course
11:00 - and it'll tell you all about it and then
11:02 - how to prep it there are student
11:03 - certificates that you can download
11:05 - beforehand
11:06 - we'll talk about that a little bit more
11:08 - and then there is a trailer and
11:09 - different things to kind of get your
11:11 - students excited so we have one of these
11:13 - teacher
11:13 - notes for every single course that we
11:16 - offer
11:16 - so just something to keep in mind there
11:20 - also want to sign up for a teacher trial
11:22 - you can do that on any of the hour of
11:24 - code courses
11:25 - or you can click up here in the right
11:26 - hand corner at sign up
11:28 - and when you click on sign up logged in
11:31 - so we'll not let me do that
11:33 - but it will let you choose how to sign
11:35 - up there so
11:36 - that is there for you like i mentioned
11:38 - 100 seats just for the trial
11:40 - it is just the 30 days 30 students oh
11:43 - you're sorry used to be 30 days 30
11:45 - students now it's 30 days 100 students
11:48 - okay so now let's get in and talk about
11:50 - our hour of code courses where we should
11:52 - start who they work best for just so we
11:54 - can go ahead and do this fast and
11:55 - furious for time
11:57 - um i am going to answer this question
12:00 - here do students have to log
12:01 - in do students
12:05 - sorry i lost that question really quick
12:07 - do students have to log in to access the
12:09 - hour of code activities they do not
12:11 - but if you would like to have some of
12:12 - the features which i'll show you here in
12:14 - just a minute
12:14 - you do want your students to have an
12:16 - account okay so now we're here on our
12:18 - hour of code courses so code monkey
12:21 - junior is our pre-reader course it's
12:22 - really for pre-k
12:24 - k it's really about computational
12:26 - thinking this is the only course
12:28 - here that we have that is app-based it
12:31 - is the only one that
12:32 - has an app for the course the rest of
12:35 - the courses
12:37 - will work with an ipad best used with a
12:40 - keyboarded device just to kind of keep
12:42 - that
12:42 - in mind except for oops i didn't mean to
12:45 - do that oops
12:46 - sorry guys except for the courses that
12:48 - require
12:49 - python so those are something that you
12:51 - want to make sure that you are
12:53 - using that with your students a keyboard
12:56 - or device it's really important to have
12:57 - a keep it a
12:58 - device also real computer programmers
13:00 - type on a keyboard so something to just
13:02 - kind of keep in mind
13:03 - our beaver achiever is a block based
13:05 - course it's really for grades one and
13:06 - two it works through fundamentals of the
13:08 - coding concepts just like all the other
13:10 - ones do
13:11 - it's really fun you help a build beaver
13:13 - build his wall up
13:14 - and there are a few other courses with
13:16 - our more advanced packages for that
13:18 - our dota does math is supplemental and
13:20 - includes addition and subtraction
13:22 - um measuring with measuring distances
13:25 - there's also multiplication inside of
13:27 - that one and then they also
13:29 - do some angle measurement where they
13:30 - pick up a protractor and use that so
13:32 - that's
13:33 - one of my favorites honestly especially
13:35 - being a former fifth grade teacher
13:37 - um and then moving right along we have
13:39 - our coding adventure course this is the
13:40 - first course
13:41 - from code monkey itself um it is in
13:45 - what we call coffeescript well not what
13:46 - we call an official language called
13:48 - coffeescript it's a web-based language
13:49 - it's just a not very syntax heavy
13:53 - it's a much cleaner code for students
13:55 - who are learning how to begin coding um
13:57 - syntaxing
13:58 - curly brackets all of that can be really
14:01 - difficult for students so we really want
14:03 - to
14:03 - um you know get them excited about
14:06 - coding and this teaches them the
14:07 - fundamentals
14:08 - after that we have our game builder
14:11 - course
14:12 - and the game builder with i just
14:14 - mentioned this coding adventure
14:16 - should be done pre should be done prior
14:18 - to students doing dota does math and the
14:20 - game builder the concepts that they used
14:21 - are covered in this one
14:23 - so you would want your students to do
14:25 - that first
14:26 - um i also will answer this question
14:29 - there's some people
14:30 - asking about the recording we will send
14:31 - this recording out after and it's always
14:33 - available on both our webinars page and
14:35 - our youtube channel
14:37 - so the game builder course is event
14:38 - driven programming students will work
14:40 - through that
14:41 - and then our newest space adventure
14:43 - course is also in coffeescript as well
14:45 - it's so much fun i
14:46 - just recently played it as it's a newer
14:48 - course
14:49 - the students work through space and they
14:52 - have to program him to move forward and
14:54 - backwards
14:54 - and then work to eventually get him to
14:56 - his spaceship so he can go home
14:59 - and then we have our banana tails and
15:02 - trivia chatbot those are both in python
15:04 - banana tales you help this baby monkey
15:07 - collect his he has you have to help feed
15:10 - him by using this car to get to him
15:12 - and then the trivia chatbot is exactly
15:14 - what it is a chat bot that does
15:16 - trivia that the students program and
15:17 - work through and that is python
15:20 - sometimes i suggest that students do
15:22 - banana tales before
15:23 - trivia chatbot if they don't have much
15:24 - experience coding just to kind of get
15:26 - them familiar with python itself
15:28 - and then the moonlander course like i
15:29 - mentioned is similar
15:31 - in the same way that it's set up to the
15:32 - game builder course but it is working
15:34 - with physics content
15:35 - concepts they work with thrust and
15:37 - acceleration and they have to basically
15:39 - land the moon lander onto a pad
15:42 - i'm not the best at playing that game
15:43 - because i'm just not very good at
15:45 - playing these games but students
15:47 - rock it out of the water and it's great
15:48 - to see them doing that as well
15:52 - okay if you're ever wondering we do have
15:54 - our code monkey course page it does have
15:56 - an
15:56 - alignment there and then you can also
15:58 - see that on the hour of code course
16:00 - as well so now let's go ahead and
16:02 - explore the courses so we can kind of
16:04 - dive
16:05 - into that and explore some of the
16:06 - teacher features that will really help
16:08 - you
16:10 - when doing this hour of code virtually
16:12 - or in person
16:13 - as well okay so
16:17 - i am logged into my code monkey account
16:20 - and you'll see i have some classes set
16:22 - up here
16:23 - and i'm just going to go into the back
16:25 - end of the well let's do the courses
16:27 - first and then let's go into the back
16:28 - end so i'm going to go to the courses
16:31 - you will assign this for your students
16:35 - like i mentioned here on the courses it
16:38 - will tell you
16:39 - what type of language it is and then
16:41 - what grade level it should be for
16:44 - and so you'll see this is a block based
16:47 - course and that kind of thing but what
16:48 - you'll see in what
16:50 - for these hour courses you'll want to
16:52 - look for the hour of code courses if you
16:54 - have an account you'll need to make sure
16:55 - that these are either assigned or
16:56 - unassigned to your students so they can
16:58 - see them
16:58 - so in the beaver achiever course itself
17:01 - let's go into this one
17:02 - the students really love this i'm not
17:04 - sharing my sound with you
17:05 - there are lots of fun fun things
17:09 - that uh fun sounds and animations and
17:11 - things that happen with it so this is
17:12 - just a drag and drop
17:13 - they need to help this beaver fill his
17:17 - um his damn because he wants to go
17:19 - swimming there is a story line that is
17:20 - associated with it
17:22 - something to mention if students are not
17:25 - logged in for
17:28 - the hour of code activities what happens
17:30 - is the students move through linearly
17:32 - through the coding concepts and so
17:33 - you'll see
17:34 - i'm logged in as a teacher so i'm able
17:36 - to do
17:37 - wherever i have a star score is the
17:40 - challenges that i've completed
17:42 - with students doing the hour of code
17:44 - activities just keep in mind if
17:46 - they don't have log in with an account
17:47 - their progress will not be saved at all
17:49 - so
17:50 - they'll have to if their computer
17:51 - crashes or you know the hour of code
17:53 - week of hour of code is always busy for
17:55 - all the hour of code code.org usually
17:58 - crashes during that time and so does
17:59 - most of those web pages so if that
18:03 - happens just keep in mind their progress
18:05 - will not be safe so that's why we kind
18:06 - of suggest you do a teacher trial but
18:08 - totally up to you
18:09 - so they'll progress linearly through
18:11 - these coding concepts all the while this
18:13 - is reporting back to you you'll see we
18:14 - got a star score so three stars shortest
18:17 - most concise
18:17 - two stars and extra step and one star i
18:20 - like to say are the struggle busters
18:22 - and so that will happen that way and
18:23 - once they get to the end of the concept
18:25 - it increases in complexity
18:27 - and they learn harder concepts as they
18:29 - progress through here
18:30 - they're working with um if and else
18:33 - statements and tying those all in
18:35 - together there so
18:36 - pretty fun um way to
18:39 - to do that so let's look at our
18:43 - space monkey course space adventure so
18:46 - we can see that
18:47 - newest course here and
18:51 - in this course everything always starts
18:53 - out with a story line
18:55 - gordo here is a teacher assistant just
18:57 - like in coding adventure here we'll see
18:59 - that we need to program him to move
19:01 - up so he's floating in space so instead
19:03 - of stepping he's moving
19:06 - and so these buttons are really great
19:08 - because they also type out for students
19:10 - and so that you're not slowing students
19:12 - down by how they're coding you know by
19:14 - the spelling
19:15 - or functionalities of that as well so
19:18 - that is our space adventure course and
19:20 - by the time
19:21 - he gets to the end gordo is also giving
19:24 - some tips along the way as well and
19:28 - as he works along through that's also
19:30 - reporting if you have an account on the
19:32 - teacher side of things so i'll show you
19:33 - that and i'm going to show you one more
19:35 - course and then we're going to get into
19:36 - q
19:36 - a i see we have lots of questions so i
19:38 - want to be able to
19:43 - molly that's yes are you able to change
19:45 - that
19:50 - no okay okay
19:53 - so um actually yeah you do want
19:58 - you do want that okay so um i have
20:01 - my classes set up and i'm gonna oops
20:03 - sorry i did want to show you one more
20:05 - course that will
20:06 - the game builder and the space
20:09 - the moon lander will look similar but
20:12 - let's go into the moon lander as in the
20:15 - as in the how it looks is exactly the
20:18 - same you'll see the instructions on the
20:19 - left hand side
20:20 - scripting on the middle and you're
20:22 - playing and creating on the right hand
20:24 - side
20:24 - so we do say this is for more advanced
20:26 - as you see the concepts here
20:28 - are are a little bit more challenging
20:30 - with velocity
20:31 - you see a little bit more curly brackets
20:33 - and different things like that that are
20:34 - happening
20:35 - you basically have to get this by
20:38 - adjusting the velocity in the thrust you
20:41 - have to get this moon lander onto its
20:43 - pad so you'll see that this is for a
20:44 - more
20:45 - advanced coater and as the students are
20:48 - working through
20:49 - these will highlight for them and tell
20:51 - them
20:52 - how far they progress so if they like i
20:54 - mentioned if they don't have an account
20:56 - something happens it goes down they'll
20:57 - will have to start over from the
20:58 - beginning so those are all there for you
21:01 - to be able to use
21:02 - and because we're getting short on time
21:04 - i want to show you a little bit more
21:05 - functionalities and if you want to see
21:07 - more of the courses we can do that
21:08 - during the q and a
21:10 - um so here in the teacher resources when
21:12 - you have an account all the lesson plans
21:14 - are located here for you but i want to
21:16 - show you something
21:17 - specific is the solutions are located
21:19 - here so you have access to all the
21:21 - solutions for all of the hour of code
21:23 - courses
21:24 - all you have to do is select the course
21:26 - and when you do it will pull up a
21:28 - three-star solution for
21:29 - whichever challenge the students are
21:31 - working on so that's something to
21:33 - also keep in mind on the hour of code
21:35 - page there is a place for students to
21:37 - print out certificates
21:38 - we do have the certificates located here
21:41 - they are also in the media kit
21:43 - so in case you need those i recommend
21:45 - taking those certificates doing a
21:47 - program like
21:48 - autocrat where you have the student
21:50 - creating a google form and attaching it
21:52 - and then it will auto generate it for
21:53 - your students unless you have a small
21:55 - amount of students
21:56 - it's easier to print those out but we
21:58 - all know students love certificates no
21:59 - matter how old they are
22:01 - and then we'll get into the my
22:03 - classrooms side of things so
22:04 - i have seen a few questions about
22:07 - how students sign on do we have single
22:09 - sign-on we do
22:11 - we have um students can log in using
22:14 - single sign-on through clevver or
22:16 - classlink
22:18 - they can also log in with their google
22:19 - accounts it's really easy to add a class
22:22 - code
22:23 - you you just share the class code with
22:25 - them and they're able to log in as
22:27 - they're able to log in that way or we do
22:29 - have a google classroom integration
22:32 - where you can just straight import that
22:33 - for your students
22:34 - um so there are some different
22:36 - variabilities for that if you're
22:37 - interested in that i would recommend
22:39 - going to our help center
22:41 - and there is a getting started guide for
22:42 - teachers and i would just recommend
22:44 - checking that out for that since we
22:46 - are just more so fast and furious at
22:48 - this time right now
22:50 - another thing is when i'm in my
22:52 - classroom
22:53 - there is this progress page and the
22:55 - progress page contains all the student
22:57 - data so i just wanted to quick mention
22:58 - that
22:59 - all the teacher all this all of the
23:01 - teacher solutions are along the top
23:03 - and then every single star shows you
23:04 - exactly how the students did that so
23:06 - this is a way if you're doing this in
23:08 - person or virtually you could post up
23:09 - this progress page
23:11 - and it reports in real time those stars
23:13 - when we work through on those challenges
23:14 - are being reported right here um in the
23:17 - progress page so it's just a really good
23:18 - way to host that virtual
23:22 - hour of code event so the students can
23:24 - see it and it also gives them a little
23:25 - bit of competition as well and if you
23:27 - can sort by progress to to see those
23:29 - students that are on struggle busing
23:31 - if you're interested about learning
23:33 - anything more about these
23:34 - functionalities we have some really
23:35 - great webinars on our webinar page that
23:37 - we'll talk through
23:38 - all of these it's how to set up and
23:39 - manage your classroom i would recommend
23:40 - checking that out
23:42 - okay so i know that was fast and furious
23:45 - meant to be fast and furious
23:47 - so what are some things that you need to
23:48 - prep and i want to leave time for our q
23:50 - a what are some things that you need to
23:51 - prep
23:52 - i'm definitely doing your certificates
23:54 - like i mentioned
23:55 - um doing some self-generated so you
23:57 - download the template
23:59 - and then you put it in a program like
24:01 - autocrat it's free to use
24:02 - you just the students will fill out
24:04 - their name and maybe the date and it'll
24:05 - populate and send it to them or send
24:07 - you can have it just send to you and you
24:09 - can download files and you'll have them
24:11 - right there for you
24:11 - easy to print and easy to share um i
24:14 - always highly recommend testing out
24:16 - beforehand
24:17 - i know that no matter if you're it or in
24:20 - person
24:21 - sometimes connection can be an issue
24:23 - sometimes it could be something
24:24 - especially with an ipad ipads are tricky
24:27 - especially if they're not most recently
24:28 - updated you know even with your phone
24:30 - there's a new release it gets slower
24:31 - those types of things so just those
24:33 - things to keep in mind as well
24:36 - and then giving your students logins
24:38 - beforehand is important
24:39 - you don't have to but if you would like
24:40 - to it's always important to create that
24:42 - before the hour code so they spend as
24:44 - much time
24:44 - coding as possible that's what we want
24:46 - to have happen so some things to
24:48 - consider for
24:49 - virtual versus in person is in person
24:52 - and virtual no matter what you have to
24:54 - plan plan plan plan plan so making sure
24:56 - you planned out the
24:57 - activities that you want the students to
24:59 - to be working with
25:01 - if you're doing in person i always
25:02 - suggest rotations so doing some plugged
25:04 - in activities
25:05 - and doing unplugged activities i like to
25:07 - do those throughout the week
25:09 - if you're doing virtual you can also do
25:11 - unplugged activities as well you can
25:13 - give students an activity i'll share
25:15 - this on the next one where you can find
25:16 - some unplugged activities
25:17 - you can have them share it via flipgrid
25:20 - or make their own slide deck
25:22 - of showing students how to do an
25:23 - unplugged activity maybe you take one of
25:25 - the puzzles from
25:26 - code monkey's web page you put it in
25:29 - your google classroom and you have the
25:30 - students
25:31 - tell you how they would solve it using
25:32 - those code cues from the bottom
25:34 - so those are just some different ways to
25:36 - do in person first virtual
25:38 - unplugged activities and i see a lot of
25:40 - people asking me if this slide deck will
25:41 - be
25:42 - available well this will be posted on
25:44 - the youtube channel
25:46 - underneath in the notes we always share
25:48 - the notes there for you
25:49 - so code monkey we do have some unplugged
25:52 - activities you can find that on the blog
25:53 - page actually some really great
25:55 - unplugged activities
25:56 - for you to utilize during this time
25:57 - whether in person or virtual
25:59 - um csm plugged is one of my favorites
26:01 - obviously everyone knows code.org has
26:03 - them as well
26:04 - another one that is really great is
26:06 - barefoot computing they have some really
26:08 - great unplugged activities like hand
26:10 - washing
26:10 - that's an algorithm so a lot of really
26:12 - great computer science resources for
26:14 - your students
26:16 - they are more along the primary range so
26:18 - just keep that in mind but we will share
26:20 - this
26:20 - out in the notes within the webinar as
26:23 - well
26:26 - that was fast and furious so we talked
26:28 - about the hour of code
26:30 - code monkey stories how to find us our
26:33 - newest
26:34 - course the space monkey course or space
26:36 - adventure
26:38 - what are our code courses are setting up
26:40 - for the hour of code
26:43 - hour of code courses our technical
26:46 - requirements the teacher notes where you
26:48 - can find those we explored some of the
26:50 - courses
26:50 - and now we're going to do some things
26:52 - for q a
26:54 - paige she's one of our teacher
26:55 - ambassadors she has been sharing with
26:57 - you that we also do have a code monkey
26:59 - super fans group
27:00 - we really encourage you to collaborate
27:02 - with one another as well and i see molly
27:04 - shared some information regarding
27:06 - the hour of code for you as well
27:09 - and then there are just some really
27:10 - great questions do students have to log
27:13 - in to access the hour of code courses
27:15 - they don't
27:16 - up to you about the teacher trial so the
27:19 - teacher trial
27:20 - is a hundred students but it's only a
27:22 - trial for 30 days
27:23 - so um that is there for you we just
27:27 - extended that used to only be 30 so
27:28 - that's exciting
27:30 - and we also had another question is
27:34 - will can you share your classroom with
27:36 - another teacher you can
27:38 - within the classrooms page we have some
27:40 - really great resources in our help
27:41 - center so
27:42 - let me just show you how to do that so
27:44 - if you have an account
27:46 - even if you don't in the help center
27:47 - down here you can type in
27:49 - i would recommend checking out this
27:51 - getting started for teachers guide here
27:53 - it has everything you need to know how
27:55 - to add student accounts
27:57 - how to create classrooms how to share
27:59 - your classroom how to set up a
28:01 - co-teacher
28:02 - which is how you would share your
28:03 - classroom so that's a really good one to
28:05 - know as well
28:06 - will this be available it will on our
28:08 - webinars page and via youtube so i hope
28:11 - that
28:11 - is something that you're able to check
28:13 - out as well we'll also send out a
28:14 - recording
28:15 - more than likely tomorrow for you guys
28:17 - to be able to view that
28:19 - what is the best way to advocate for
28:22 - code monkey during our code
28:24 - week through code.org or through
28:26 - codemonkey's website
28:27 - um the hour of code actually if you do
28:30 - it through here
28:31 - it does take you straight to our code
28:32 - and monkey page so really either one
28:34 - works for us
28:35 - it'll just take you directly it's just
28:37 - another way to take you to that page if
28:39 - you can't remember how to get there
28:41 - do we have anything for fourth and fifth
28:43 - graders for hour of code we do
28:45 - on the hour of code page let me just get
28:49 - there really quickly
28:51 - i mentioned this i mentioned this as
28:54 - well but
28:55 - coding adventure dota does math the game
28:58 - builder
28:58 - those are all really good for fourth and
29:00 - fifth grade we do have if your students
29:01 - have a little bit more experience
29:05 - um then then you could do the banana
29:09 - tails as well but i would just recommend
29:10 - sticking with
29:11 - those ones for now um you're on the hour
29:15 - of code website and it looks like there
29:17 - are five that include grade five okay
29:19 - great yeah so there
29:20 - are quite a few activities that are
29:22 - there it's now code.org has it
29:24 - laid out a little bit easier for you to
29:26 - kind of navigate we do have it like i
29:27 - mentioned on rs2
29:29 - on the main code monkey hour of code
29:30 - page as well does it work with google
29:33 - sign-in
29:33 - we do work with google sign-in the
29:35 - students can have a classroom code
29:38 - or um you can also import your google
29:41 - classroom as well
29:42 - um can multiple teachers collaborate and
29:47 - be
29:47 - one-on-one which i just answered that
29:50 - can you share the unplugged activities
29:51 - website as well yes i will share the
29:53 - slide deck in the youtube notes so i
29:55 - just saw somebody ask me for the
29:58 - url for this specific one and won't be
29:59 - uploaded until we're finished but
30:01 - they're there but otherwise we do have
30:02 - this webinars page or you can
30:04 - find us on youtube we do have a playlist
30:07 - that's just teacher webinars
30:10 - um there will be a certificate following
30:14 - today's
30:15 - webinar so as soon as you as soon as we
30:17 - finish this and you're out of here
30:20 - there will be a survey sent to you and
30:21 - you'll fill it out and you should get an
30:23 - email with your certificate
30:24 - um before that as well
30:28 - okay i see some really great questions
30:30 - molly or brett is there anything that i
30:34 - missed
30:37 - uh which activities i see this one
30:39 - question which activities are best for
30:41 - middle school
30:41 - students grades k through sorry grades
30:44 - six through eight i definitely recommend
30:46 - um the space adventure for the older
30:48 - ones i also would recommend
30:51 - let me just go to our main page the game
30:53 - builder but
30:54 - having them play coding adventure first
30:56 - is going to be important especially
30:58 - i don't know how much exposure they have
30:59 - to coding themselves
31:01 - and the trivia chat bot as well so these
31:04 - right here you'll see it says grade six
31:06 - plus so
31:07 - these ones here on the bottom are really
31:09 - going to be your bread and butter and
31:10 - the banana tails as well
31:15 - molly or brett is there anything else
31:17 - that i missed
31:19 - no okay so i know there was
31:22 - a lot of questions um
31:26 - m harris i see that you're asking a
31:27 - question if you teach more than
31:29 - 100 students we're happy to follow up
31:32 - with you
31:32 - um via email after today's event
31:36 - um so as always we just want to thank
31:38 - you guys
31:39 - so much we want to honor your time we
31:40 - said half an hour so we're going over a
31:42 - few minutes over
31:43 - but we just want to thank you guys so
31:45 - much for joining us
31:46 - during today's event and all of the
31:49 - great questions that you
31:51 - have surrounding this surrounding the
31:54 - hour of code if you have follow-up
31:55 - questions
31:56 - please feel free to reach out to us um
32:02 - and oh one thing i just wanted to
32:04 - mention is we are having two
32:05 - hour of code events next week for
32:07 - students um so we invite you to ask your
32:09 - students both of our founders jonathan
32:11 - the two brothers
32:12 - are each hosting their own webinar
32:14 - telling their own stories about how they
32:17 - became coders and their story and we are
32:20 - doing a live q a
32:21 - session with students so if you haven't
32:23 - done that you can find that also on the
32:24 - webinars page you can register for that
32:26 - right there
32:27 - and so we're excited to share that with
32:29 - students as well
32:31 - how code can translate beyond just the
32:33 - walls of the classroom
32:36 - um so once again thank you guys so much
32:38 - if you enjoyed this webinar like us on
32:40 - facebook and all of our social media
32:42 - accounts please tag us in any photos or
32:45 - any pictures that you have with your
32:46 - hour of code event in your
32:49 - room we want to share it out and
32:51 - celebrate you
32:52 - and all the work that you're doing and
32:55 - we just want to thank you guys so much
32:57 - for taking this time today remember to
33:00 - write code
33:00 - catch bananas and save the world we'll
33:02 - see you guys next time bye
