00:00 - all righty hello everyone thank you for
00:01 - attending the 2018 hour of code webinar
00:06 - we know that how many choices you have
00:08 - for the hour of code and we thank you
00:09 - for choosing us after today's session we
00:12 - will send you out a form for you to fill
00:14 - out in which you will receive PD credit
00:16 - for today's webinar if you have any
00:18 - questions during today's session please
00:20 - send them in the Q&A or in the chat box
00:22 - along the side also follow us on twitter
00:26 - or on instagram at at code monkey es-tu
00:29 - and then hashtag code monkey webinar my
00:33 - team is going to be joining us
00:36 - so if you like I said if you have any
00:38 - questions in the cap and the chat box or
00:40 - in the Q&A section all right and we're
00:43 - gonna get started remember to write code
00:45 - catch bananas and save the world
00:53 - all right so hour of code 2018 so who
00:57 - are we so today I'm gonna introduce my
00:59 - team that's joining us first I'll just
01:00 - start out with myself my name is lina
01:02 - saleh and i am the professional
01:03 - development manager here at code monkey
01:05 - so i do all of the trainings for
01:07 - teachers and all of the online webinars
01:12 - hi everyone my name is Zach I'm the
01:16 - director of sales I may know a lot of
01:18 - you as you are current clients of code
01:22 - monkey and we appreciate you joining us
01:23 - today and also joining us for the
01:25 - remainder of the year I'm here to say
01:28 - hello to everyone know so to just tell
01:29 - you that our of code is a great start
01:32 - for some people it's a great push for
01:34 - your students to get them invigorated
01:36 - for coding but if any of you are
01:39 - interested in furthering your coding in
01:42 - your school I'm the guy to speak to I'll
01:44 - be mentioning something at the end of
01:46 - the webinar but taken and Lina is gonna
01:48 - do a great job and if you want to do
01:50 - more coding I'll be in touch with you
01:51 - after the webinar we also have Zoe Diane
01:56 - she is our marketing and media manager I
01:58 - have her here in this little monkey
02:00 - trophy because she is our rock star here
02:04 - at could lucky alright so let's go ahead
02:06 - and do it sorry
02:10 - and I would like to see you all here
02:13 - today and best of luck Lena
02:19 - okay so first we're just gonna start off
02:21 - with talking about what is the hour of
02:22 - code I'm sure most of you that are
02:24 - joining obviously know a little bit of
02:26 - hour of code but I just wanted to give
02:28 - you a kind of a glimpse into it so the
02:30 - hour of code is basically not a place
02:33 - where students are learning how to code
02:35 - it's giving them that exposure and the
02:38 - access to computer science so when it
02:39 - was originally designed it was designed
02:41 - to basically show students how fun
02:44 - coding is and just basically opening a
02:48 - window or kind of you know giving the
02:51 - picked big picture in the background for
02:53 - students and showing them how fun and
02:54 - interactive it can be so I like to share
02:57 - this graphic here along the Sakai
02:59 - I think co.org did a really great job in
03:02 - making this graphic here and kind of
03:03 - doing a lot of the research that they've
03:05 - done with computer science so here we
03:08 - have the percentage of female high
03:09 - school students that had no prior
03:11 - computer science experience prior to the
03:15 - hour of code and when they interviewed
03:17 - them about 55 percent of students said
03:19 - that they liked computer science and
03:21 - after during the hour of code
03:23 - seventy-five percent of the students now
03:25 - really enjoyed or liked computer science
03:27 - so that's basically the goal of the hour
03:29 - of code is to get your students jazzed
03:31 - about the hour of code and about what
03:33 - coding can be
03:38 - okay so let's talk about where can you
03:40 - find us so you can find us at code.org
03:43 - slash learn and I'm going to show you
03:44 - that here in a second or you can also
03:47 - find us at wwlp.com backslash our dash
03:53 - of dash code and you'll find all of our
03:55 - courses there and then we also have our
04:00 - teacher notes alongside that so I'll get
04:02 - into a little bit more about what that
04:03 - is and what they look like here as we
04:05 - get started like I said if you have any
04:08 - questions along the way please feel free
04:10 - to ask them and we'll do our best to
04:12 - answer them we'll also have some time at
04:13 - the end for some Q&A so here are five
04:16 - courses that we have we have the trivia
04:19 - chat bot moon lander dota does math
04:21 - coding adventure and game builder and
04:23 - I'm gonna discuss in more detail what
04:25 - each of these courses look like because
04:27 - I know that many of you joining us are
04:29 - joining us from different age levels and
04:31 - different areas of the teaching spectrum
04:34 - so I want to be able to talk about each
04:35 - and every single one of those so our
04:38 - hour of code courses like I said we
04:40 - currently have five courses our coding
04:43 - adventure course is our beginning
04:45 - beginners course so it walks all the
04:48 - students in a linear manner through all
04:50 - of our coding concepts and this is
04:52 - geared for grades seven through six then
04:54 - we have our dota does math and so
04:57 - basically every single of our courses
04:59 - after coding adventure requires the
05:01 - students to have a little bit of
05:02 - background experience as far as coding
05:04 - goes coding adventure like I said as our
05:08 - beginners course so dota does math as
05:10 - our second through fourth grade and this
05:11 - talks about has many math concepts in it
05:14 - it has distances angles and
05:16 - multiplication and the students work
05:19 - through coding concepts to solve these
05:21 - types of problems game builder is our
05:25 - interactive like exactly what it says a
05:27 - game builder course then we have a
05:28 - Python chat bot and those are geared for
05:31 - our older grades and so the game builder
05:33 - is fifth through ninth the Python chat
05:35 - bot is seventh through ninth and then
05:36 - our last course is moon lander and moon
05:39 - lander is an interactive it's also very
05:43 - fun but geared more towards the older
05:46 - grade levels more advanced coding it is
05:49 - a little bit more challenging so we'll
05:50 - talk about that
05:51 - just know that with any of these courses
05:53 - just because the grade-level says second
05:55 - through sixth grade does not mean that
05:57 - an eighth grade student cannot attempt
05:58 - to take coding adventure we'll talk a
06:01 - little bit more about that but basically
06:03 - through coding adventure the monkey will
06:05 - go through catching bananas and
06:07 - sometimes middle school students will
06:10 - find that a little bit too babyish or
06:12 - sometimes they'll love it it just
06:13 - depends on the scope and sequence of the
06:15 - kids okay so moving right along um I
06:20 - love this graphic here on the left-hand
06:22 - side so this is what we want our
06:24 - classrooms to look like the cousins on
06:26 - the right-hand side when preparing for
06:28 - the hour of code we want it to be very
06:29 - calm and easygoing and everyone is
06:32 - working together and it's in a seamless
06:34 - manner and so I as I'm sure any of you
06:37 - as teachers have had these moments where
06:40 - it looks like you think you have
06:41 - everything under control and then
06:43 - there's a fire and you've got to put it
06:44 - out so I learned this the hard way the
06:46 - very first year that I set up the hour
06:48 - of code I organized it for my whole
06:50 - school I was a stem teacher for a k-8
06:53 - school and basically I was the T in the
06:55 - stem and so we had we decided to set up
07:00 - an hour of code with all of our students
07:02 - and we very quickly realized that there
07:05 - was a lot of troubleshooting that wasn't
07:07 - was involved with it and at this time it
07:10 - was back in 2012 there weren't as many
07:12 - expansive coding courses as there are
07:14 - now and so we didn't really have
07:16 - anything in the background or really let
07:18 - our volunteers know what to do so in the
07:20 - second year we tested all of our devices
07:22 - we made sure that everything kind of
07:26 - works seamlessly and that our volunteers
07:28 - had kind of some background
07:32 - troubleshooting to go with so basically
07:33 - what we did is we decided when to host
07:36 - your event so you want to decide when
07:38 - you want to host your event a lot of
07:39 - schools um internationally will host
07:41 - them after school to do really good
07:43 - community building some schools will
07:45 - host it during school during having an
07:47 - hour of code this is a great time to
07:50 - introduce to bring in parent volunteers
07:52 - parents love to help and so this is what
07:54 - better way then to have them during the
07:56 - hour of code when you have hundreds of
07:58 - devices working all at one time always
08:02 - like I said Tessa picking out code
08:05 - code monkey works on or our our platform
08:09 - works on Chromebooks iPads MacBooks
08:13 - hardwired computers there's no
08:14 - downloading there's no flash so it
08:17 - really works well on a lot of devices
08:18 - just making sure that your browsers are
08:20 - up to date because that's really
08:21 - important and then like I said invite
08:24 - your parents to come in I'm going to
08:26 - show you some really great resources to
08:27 - share with your parent volunteers or
08:29 - even bringing volunteers from the
08:31 - community like local businesses they
08:33 - have a lot of times where they have
08:34 - volunteer hours and they love to help
08:36 - especially during these times so you
08:39 - give them those and then we have some
08:42 - hour of code notes that I'll share with
08:43 - you and then I would recommend having
08:47 - especially if you're like a librarian or
08:49 - even having your volunteers set up the
08:52 - computer so that when the students come
08:54 - in they spend the entire hour coding we
08:57 - want them to have as much exposure and
08:59 - as much fun during this time as possible
09:01 - so those are just some really important
09:02 - things to kind of keep in mind when
09:04 - setting up for the hour of code ok so
09:09 - now we're going to explore our courses
09:11 - what the courses look like and the
09:13 - teacher notes that are involved with
09:14 - them
09:20 - sorry just getting these notes here and
09:22 - then we're gonna get moving okay
09:24 - so we're gonna start out with our very
09:26 - first course and so how we access these
09:28 - courses so you can go to code org
09:31 - backslash learn like I had mentioned
09:33 - before and over here on the left hand
09:35 - side and the created by section you can
09:38 - go to code monkey and when you do so
09:40 - you'll see that there is a beginner and
09:42 - there is a comfortable and the beginner
09:44 - and like I said suggests a coding
09:46 - adventure is our beginners course now it
09:49 - does increase in complexity if you go
09:50 - beyond just the hour of code and then
09:53 - the comfortable version meaning we want
09:55 - our students to have some background
09:56 - knowledge with coding beforehand so
09:58 - that's how you can access the courses
09:59 - and with each of these courses there is
10:01 - this short link here and so the short
10:03 - link is really great to even do
10:07 - something like a bitly or maybe a QR
10:09 - code that's really easy for your iPad's
10:11 - to just go straight to it um whatever
10:13 - you think kind of works for you but
10:14 - really making sure that you launch those
10:16 - beforehand so let's start out with our
10:18 - coding adventure course and when you
10:19 - click on the beginner in the coding
10:21 - adventure course it'll bring you here to
10:23 - the screen I've already brought it up
10:24 - just for I'm x purposes here and
10:27 - underneath underneath each and every
10:30 - single one of our courses we have
10:31 - teachers notes and then we have full
10:34 - lesson plans so with coding adventure
10:36 - that comes with our free teacher trial
10:38 - which we'll talk about a little bit at
10:39 - the end but that does give you the
10:40 - exposure to the lesson plans that are
10:42 - involved with those as well and so
10:46 - underneath the coding adventure when I
10:47 - click Boop sorry I wanted to go to the
10:50 - teacher notes so let's go back here to
10:52 - the free teacher notes so we'll click
10:54 - here on the teacher notes and underneath
10:57 - will will it'll give you what the course
11:00 - is about and so in coding adventure the
11:02 - goal is that the monkey is there
11:03 - students are learning coding concepts
11:06 - through playing gamified version of
11:08 - monkey collecting bananas and as he goes
11:12 - along he's like I said learning the
11:14 - coding concepts in a linear manner so
11:16 - the kids aren't skipping around or kind
11:18 - of doing any of that the age
11:19 - specifications are here if you want to
11:21 - look at any of those but basically what
11:23 - I said you definitely need internet you
11:25 - need to make sure that headphones are
11:26 - definitely recommended we have some
11:27 - really fun sounds that are associated
11:29 - with those
11:30 - then the programming language that we
11:33 - use for dota does math and coding
11:37 - adventure is CoffeeScript and so
11:39 - CoffeeScript is a just a much easier
11:41 - version of JavaScript it's basically the
11:45 - context without all of the syntax
11:47 - surrounding it so it just makes it much
11:49 - easier for the students to learn and
11:51 - then we'll talk about how the challenges
11:54 - are scored and then just know that all
11:56 - of our all of our courses are common
11:59 - core and CTS aligned and we're working
12:01 - on some other alignments as we as we go
12:03 - through here and then how to prep for
12:05 - the hour of code there are those
12:06 - certificates remember at the end of the
12:08 - hour of code that you can print out for
12:09 - your students I suggest making those
12:11 - ahead of time printing those off we all
12:13 - know how much students are driven by
12:15 - certificates and they love them even the
12:16 - older grades this is a great reference
12:20 - card that I shared with my parent
12:22 - volunteers in my classroom and so I just
12:24 - let them know so if a student were to
12:26 - ask for help instead of giving them an
12:29 - answer we're not giving them an answer
12:30 - during this time we just want them to
12:32 - try it so we're mostly just having our
12:34 - volunteers basically give words of
12:37 - encouragement like I don't know that's
12:38 - great question let's what can you do to
12:41 - figure that out and so we're just really
12:42 - encouraging them to go through and
12:45 - depending on how much experience your
12:47 - students have some of them may finish
12:49 - the course in under an hour and so we
12:51 - can encourage them to go to the other
12:52 - courses as we kind of go along okay so
12:56 - let's go ahead and let's start playing
12:58 - I'm going to show you a couple
12:59 - challenges from each and every single
13:00 - one of our courses we get moving here
13:04 - for coding adventure and oh that as map
13:06 - there is a trailer that goes alongside
13:08 - of it it's super cute I'm for the
13:10 - essence of time I'm not going to show it
13:12 - we do have this new narration feature
13:14 - here if you turn off the narration
13:16 - feature within the settings then the
13:18 - narration feature will not pop up so
13:20 - just making sure that you know that if
13:21 - that happens for troubleshooting reasons
13:24 - like I said there's some fun noises so
13:27 - I'm just going to turn the noises down a
13:29 - little bit I still want you to be able
13:31 - to hear them but that feature and in the
13:34 - teacher notes it'll tell you exactly
13:36 - what Gordo does and so Gordo is our
13:38 - teacher assistant he gives all of the
13:40 - directions and encouragement when a
13:43 - student
13:44 - pass a challenge and then I also wanted
13:46 - to notice that we do have many languages
13:49 - here and so the directions will be in
13:52 - their native language but the coding is
13:54 - always in the same language okay it's
13:56 - always and it's always CoffeeScript
13:58 - CoffeeScript doesn't change okay
14:06 - very beginning of coding adventure it
14:07 - starts very simply when you hit run it's
14:11 - showing it's introducing students to the
14:13 - platform and then they'll get a scoring
14:15 - system so basically in a shortened
14:18 - version of this a 3-star means they
14:20 - wrote the shortest most concise code to
14:22 - star solution means when they were able
14:24 - to take what they learned and a one-star
14:25 - solution means it took them a very long
14:27 - time very long process to code it
14:30 - basically we don't want our students
14:35 - writing up 100 lines of code when they
14:37 - can solve it in two because when you
14:38 - become a true computer programmer nobody
14:42 - wants to be spending up much time
14:44 - writing that much extra steps of coding
14:46 - okay so then we go to our next challenge
14:49 - and like I said dota or Gordo gave us a
14:52 - little bit extra and so that's what the
14:57 - narration feature looks like and so here
14:59 - we have monkey and it also tells them
15:02 - but we have monkey you can pick up the
15:03 - ruler we can measure we can use the
15:05 - different tools and so in this case
15:08 - monkey needs to step 15 and so if I
15:11 - write this drag this out here this is
15:14 - going to yield a two star solution
15:16 - because I could have changed it to step
15:18 - 15 and so if you see that or encourage
15:21 - your volunteers to see this scoring
15:23 - system if you're using this in the
15:24 - elementary classroom or whatever say oh
15:26 - well how do you think you could get
15:27 - three stars for this challenge so just
15:29 - kind of just encouraging them as they go
15:31 - along I am going to skip ahead here to
15:36 - challenge number 30 so you can take a
15:38 - look at what does it look like at the
15:39 - end of the course so
15:45 - sorry let me just quickly quickly login
15:49 - here or I won't be able to skip ahead so
15:50 - your you'll notice your students will
15:52 - try to skip ahead and they cannot skip
15:54 - ahead unless they've had the access to
15:57 - do so and you can access this through
15:58 - the story mode or change it here and so
16:02 - as you can see in challenge number 30
16:04 - there is no code written here so we're
16:06 - needing the students to figure out how
16:07 - to write the code and because I've
16:11 - already done this and you'll notice too
16:14 - the code gets quite challenging and in
16:16 - this here the students are actually
16:18 - doing loops so it says loop lance and
16:21 - students will have to be learning what a
16:22 - loop is and so if you don't know what a
16:23 - loop is it's a repetition of sum up
16:27 - steps and so here we're saying that 3
16:30 - times the monkey will step 10
16:32 - step back 10 and then the turtle that's
16:35 - why this is associated here this is an
16:37 - object so we've programmed the turtle to
16:39 - move the turtle then to step 10 and
16:42 - monkey will repeat the steps so let me
16:44 - show you what that looks like
16:49 - you
16:54 - and Humberto Neumann and so you ask how
16:58 - is the criterion to assign one two or
17:00 - three stars and so in the teacher's
17:03 - guide it details a little bit more about
17:05 - what the one star to star in three star
17:07 - solutions will look like and in the
17:10 - actual teacher dashboard once you have a
17:13 - teacher trial it will also show you how
17:14 - students stuff is scored so we can talk
17:17 - about that and I can show you that here
17:18 - at the end so I'll get back to your
17:19 - question here soon okay
17:21 - and so with coding adventure you get
17:24 - challenges one through thirty for the
17:26 - for the next one and so that's what
17:29 - coding adventure looks like so they're
17:31 - catching it and it's super fun they love
17:33 - the noises and what better way than
17:35 - catching bananas so dota does math here
17:38 - is like I said coding concepts and so
17:41 - let me show you what the teacher notes
17:42 - look like and I'm sorry if I'm going a
17:44 - little bit fast but I want to be able to
17:45 - show you all five of our courses so the
17:48 - same thing dota those math it's an
17:50 - interactive our still web-based still
17:52 - Chromebook compatible same thing the
17:54 - scoring system for dota does math is
17:56 - exactly the same as coding adventure and
18:00 - so three stars means that you did it in
18:03 - the shortest most concise two star means
18:05 - that you incorporated what you did and
18:08 - picked up all of the eggs and then
18:09 - onestart means that to be a much longer
18:12 - journey basically to catch the eggs here
18:14 - GTS aligned as well there's still the
18:17 - certificates and they'll be seeing a
18:19 - little bit different buttons here
18:20 - encoding adventure and iris aren't in
18:23 - dough to this math and they're actually
18:24 - using real world tools here okay so
18:27 - they're using a protractor a ruler to do
18:30 - that so I'm gonna go ahead and I'm gonna
18:32 - start playing them and introduce you to
18:34 - a couple of the lessons there still are
18:36 - a couple of the challenges there's a
18:38 - video here too this one's super cute
18:40 - basically dodo laces eggs on a turtle
18:42 - shell and the turtle moves away and so
18:44 - dodo is left to collect his eggs so this
18:51 - starts out super basic introducing the
18:53 - students to how a ruler works and it is
18:55 - set up like a real ruler and we all know
18:57 - that our students struggle with how to
18:58 - do measurements so just keeping that in
19:02 - mind so here the kids learn to use a
19:04 - real-life blue ruler
19:06 - it's not always an exact amount they
19:09 - learn also how to read a protractor a
19:11 - real-life protractor and using the
19:13 - measurement and so I'll show you that
19:14 - let me turn down this sound here because
19:16 - it can be like I said overwhelming
19:18 - sometimes especially when you're trying
19:21 - to speak and then I like I said they're
19:25 - exposing them to measurement and they're
19:29 - getting its really this one is very much
19:31 - stem integrated okay so in this case
19:34 - here we need to pick up the eggs and for
19:39 - the exact measurement and it gave us a
19:41 - tutorial and so I'll pick up the ruler
19:44 - and this is where it's measuring and
19:47 - it's telling me that I need to step
19:48 - eight instead of step zero so in this
19:52 - case he's now step eight we use the
19:56 - ruler it's not always exact sometimes
19:58 - there's a lot more complexity that goes
20:00 - is associated with that
20:05 - okay and you can see here this is a
20:08 - story map and so we have this for coding
20:10 - adventure and dota this map mmm dota
20:13 - does map in which you can see how the
20:15 - students moved in because I've obviously
20:17 - already solved this we can access
20:19 - different challenges so I'm gonna go to
20:21 - challenge number four here within the
20:23 - distances and measurement and we can see
20:26 - that this one actually has the distances
20:29 - laid out for us but the students have to
20:32 - do some math here so it's saying okay we
20:34 - need to add and so I need to step that
20:39 - distance and then I'll need to pick up
20:41 - the egg and so when I do so I had to add
20:46 - the distances together if I had done
20:50 - something I'll just quickly show you
20:52 - since some of the questions have been
20:54 - surrounding this what does it mean it
20:57 - look like so I added those two together
21:00 - to get a three star solution this will
21:02 - yield me a to a 1 star solution because
21:05 - I didn't do it in the shortest most
21:07 - concise way here okay so those are just
21:12 - some ways to kind of understand that
21:14 - concept and then as we move along we go
21:16 - into we go into angles and measurement
21:20 - and so here you can see they not all of
21:25 - them are blank this is just an
21:26 - application of what they've learned from
21:28 - the days before and so they'll have to
21:30 - figure out ok how do I use this how do I
21:33 - use the protractor so we can see where
21:35 - he is you can turn it and actually use
21:38 - the real-life measurement here we can
21:40 - see okay how far do we need to step and
21:44 - so this one's a little bit more
21:46 - complicated in that manner and so we
21:48 - turn 65 here you can see it in between
21:51 - okay so I turned 65 then I had to
21:54 - actually in this one use both the
21:57 - protractor and the ruler to get to where
21:59 - I need it to be and we're using some of
22:02 - the coding concepts from coding
22:03 - adventure so your students can start
22:06 - using coding adventure and it gives them
22:08 - all of the tools that they need to
22:09 - succeed for any of our courses
22:15 - and there were two eggs here so I needed
22:17 - to pick up both of the eggs
22:21 - but the distance
22:25 - measurement look like and then let me
22:27 - show you just one more about what the
22:29 - multiplication will look like
22:33 - so this one is more so skip counting so
22:37 - dodo has to throw the lobsters to walk
22:40 - across the lobsters to get to the end
22:42 - because if dodo just starts walking he's
22:44 - going to drought so I can debug this and
22:50 - figure out that I don't have enough
22:53 - and so I'll need to throw the lobster
22:58 - distance of 20 and then I'll need to
23:02 - pick up the egg so for the purpose of
23:05 - time we can see that I threw 20 lobsters
23:08 - and I will now need to step the distance
23:11 - of 20 to get to the end
23:18 - and so in these in DotA does math it's
23:22 - not just the coding it's also math so
23:24 - there's a lot of thinking involved
23:26 - inside the dough does math course so if
23:28 - you're really wanting to challenge your
23:29 - students definitely recommend doing this
23:32 - especially I taught fifth grade and my
23:34 - students don't know multiplication I
23:36 - actually don't even know how it didn't
23:37 - know how to use the tools and so I used
23:39 - this course actually as a
23:42 - supplementation to some of the things
23:44 - that I was teaching because even though
23:46 - this says hour of code and it's
23:47 - available during the week of computer
23:49 - science it's actually available all year
23:51 - round so why not utilize it why you can
23:54 - okay moving right along to our next
23:57 - course here so our next course that
24:00 - we're going to take a look at is game
24:02 - builder so you can already see right
24:04 - away that game builder looks different
24:06 - than any of the other ones that we've
24:08 - done before okay so in game builder
24:11 - there are three screens you can see this
24:13 - here there is the directions then we
24:17 - have our text editor which if you're not
24:19 - sure what a familiar a text editor is
24:21 - where you write your code and then over
24:23 - here is we have our scene or basically
24:25 - the action of what's happening and so
24:29 - this will start out very basic there's a
24:32 - lot of reading that's involved with this
24:34 - and so making sure that that's why it's
24:37 - a look for a little bit older grade
24:39 - levels as well as a lot of thinking here
24:41 - and so it starts out super simple and in
24:48 - this one we have where you're coding but
24:51 - you're also playing so the students will
24:53 - code the code here and then they'll also
24:56 - play so they can also see what's
24:57 - happening but also play so in this one
25:00 - we're saying when we're programming the
25:03 - object of the monkey here and this is
25:06 - asking us to program him to step one and
25:09 - so when I attached the app to it means
25:13 - that I am programming these are matching
25:16 - so I'm programming the monkey to go with
25:18 - him and when I do so now I'm going to
25:20 - move him
25:24 - - the banana so there's some fun noises
25:25 - as well here in some encouragement that
25:27 - goes alongside it and it continues to
25:31 - grow and so here it says I need to use
25:34 - the keyboard right so right now what's
25:36 - inside of my coat is it saying that when
25:38 - I push this on key which is the Run
25:41 - button if the keyboard which is the
25:45 - arrow right is pressed then he will
25:47 - earth the arrow left he'll step
25:50 - backwards and then now I need to program
25:52 - him to step right so what I am gonna do
25:56 - for the sake of this obviously you want
25:58 - to encourage your students to write this
26:00 - out but you can also copy and paste and
26:07 - now I'm saying if I push left he'll go
26:09 - back if I push right he'll go forward
26:11 - and so we can see here that now he's
26:13 - moving forward and backwards to get to
26:16 - the banana and I'm just following the
26:18 - directions that are over here on the
26:19 - left hand side of the screen and so when
26:22 - they get to the very end here it gets a
26:26 - little bit the students start adding
26:30 - different parts to the world they add
26:31 - sprites and bananas and that kind of a
26:33 - thing inside and you can design it so
26:37 - they're designing and they're playing
26:39 - and they're coding all at the same time
26:43 - so it's really great and interactive and
26:44 - really middle schoolers love this one I
26:47 - love it they love it and what student
26:49 - doesn't want to design their own game
26:51 - and so here it'll walk you through all
26:54 - of that I'm just going to show my
26:55 - solution there's a lot to this one
26:58 - you're programming different parts and
27:02 - you're programming the banana and the
27:04 - monkey and so there's different so
27:06 - you're these are sprites like you've
27:09 - heard in scratch I'm sure before so
27:11 - you're programming the sprites here to
27:12 - get to it and what happens when we get
27:16 - to it is we're trying to collect the
27:18 - bananas and jumping and we do all kinds
27:21 - of things inside of this one so this
27:22 - one's really fun and probably will take
27:25 - students a little bit longer than an
27:26 - hour and that's totally fine okay moving
27:31 - along to our next course so now we went
27:34 - over three courses coding adventure
27:36 - doted as
27:37 - and game builder and now we're going on
27:41 - to a fourth course which is moon lander
27:43 - and then I'll try to wrap this up
27:45 - because we said only 30 minutes
27:47 - obviously for quicker so in moon lander
27:49 - the goal of moon lander here is that we
27:51 - are using physics integration so it was
27:54 - developed for an Israeli cyber
27:56 - competition and basically you learn what
27:59 - gravity and thrust is and how to
28:01 - increase and decrease thrust and gravity
28:03 - and how much is needed basically to move
28:05 - through this world so they are still
28:08 - doing lots of coding concepts like event
28:11 - handlers and functions and loops if
28:14 - you're really into computer programming
28:15 - this would be great this one is very
28:17 - similar to the game builder in which
28:19 - you're playing and coding at the same
28:21 - time and so I'm just gonna go we'll just
28:25 - look at this one here and so you have to
28:27 - control and to me this one is I'm not
28:29 - very good with really good at the coding
28:31 - I'm not very good at the gameplay and so
28:33 - I can't pass this challenge actually and
28:37 - I played it a lot of times and so the
28:38 - goal is to land here and that's kind of
28:42 - how this goes and so you can see it's
28:43 - very complex lots of components are
28:46 - involved in this one last but not least
28:50 - we have our trivia chat bot ok same
28:53 - thing we have our instructions our code
28:55 - in the centre and on the right hand side
28:58 - students if they're looking for
28:59 - something there's their first time
29:00 - coding the chat bot might not be as fun
29:03 - but if you're a computer science teacher
29:04 - this is perfect you're using real Python
29:07 - and who doesn't want to learn Python in
29:10 - this way than in the traditional
29:11 - environment and it is guided in a step
29:14 - by step and they're not exactly learning
29:16 - everything but it's guiding them and
29:17 - exposing them to the concepts as they go
29:19 - along so at the very end this is what
29:24 - like I said you can see there's lots of
29:26 - learning here
29:30 - that's going along and I'm going to test
29:33 - the chat bot and you can see that
29:37 - there's some trivia happening along the
29:39 - way who is the first Disney Princess and
29:42 - it's actually interactive and it's kind
29:44 - of moving around as they go and oh I
29:47 - forgot to mention moon lander is our
29:49 - brand new of course I'm sorry that I
29:51 - didn't say that earlier so thanks Zoe
29:52 - for clarifying that in the bottom and
29:55 - actually be launching on the code monkey
29:57 - page after today so that's gonna be
29:59 - really great so as you can see they're
30:01 - programming little components here
30:03 - I also found just for your own note that
30:06 - at the end of challenge number 16 that's
30:08 - why mine wasn't working as I was playing
30:09 - with um the components you can change it
30:12 - to do different questions so this one
30:15 - was saying who is who is Joey and
30:18 - Angelina
30:19 - German cannot say her name but anyway
30:22 - it's Lady gaga and so it's kind of
30:24 - interacting so I use this actually with
30:26 - my students at the end to show me some
30:30 - different concepts I made them do um I
30:32 - taught math and science so I had them do
30:34 - like a little science interactive thing
30:36 - at the end of that at the end of
30:38 - challenge number 16 so you can
30:40 - definitely do that with your students as
30:41 - well so those are our hour of code
30:44 - courses and underneath here it just
30:49 - talks about went what is the hour sorry
30:51 - let me start this part again sometimes
30:54 - you get so fast you forget where you are
30:57 - in the concepts here okay so before we
31:01 - go on to that page that I was just
31:03 - talking about I want to talk about what
31:04 - code monkey is and why we're a little
31:06 - bit different so code monkey was founded
31:09 - in 2014 by Jonathan Shore and he
31:12 - launched basically code monkey after
31:14 - working with students and figuring out
31:16 - what they really grasp concepts when it
31:19 - was presented in a fun in game a fight
31:21 - way what makes us different so I love
31:26 - this graphic because it puts you as a
31:27 - teacher in the driver's seat so the
31:29 - uniqueness of code monkey stems from the
31:31 - fact that it's real text-based coding
31:34 - it's not block based as you saw the
31:35 - students are really learning the coding
31:37 - concepts it's easy it's user friendly
31:40 - it's very intuitive and the best part is
31:42 - that we put you in the driver
31:43 - see so with all of our coding courses
31:45 - even the hour of code we provide you
31:48 - with resources to make you as just as
31:51 - successful as your students and when you
31:54 - create like a teacher trial you will
31:56 - actually have access to all of the same
31:58 - you actually have access to the course
32:00 - that your students have access to so you
32:01 - can learn to code - so what makes a more
32:05 - fun way so before we get back to this
32:07 - thank you part I want to show you one
32:11 - more thing on our webpage itself so if
32:13 - you go to that address that I have
32:15 - listed earlier the plate code monkey com
32:19 - backslash our - up and then - of - of -
32:24 - of - code the backslash it will take you
32:26 - here to this course here so here's where
32:28 - you can sign up for a free teacher trial
32:30 - but if you're wanting to share with like
32:32 - some of your stakeholders maybe your
32:33 - principal isn't sure why you should have
32:35 - an hour of code we have some information
32:37 - about what is the hour of code when does
32:39 - the hour of code take place and why is
32:41 - the hour of code important and then like
32:45 - I said moon lander will be here very
32:47 - soon so that was short and sweet but
32:53 - thank you guys so much for attending our
32:55 - webinar today and now we're going to
32:56 - open it up to some Q&A I hope that we
32:59 - gave you a chance to see all of our
33:01 - courses in action and of course you can
33:03 - always email our team we're happy to
33:04 - help you go into any more detail if you
33:06 - need any of that so we'll open it up to
33:09 - some questions for you so just before we
33:11 - get to all the questions and Lina you
33:13 - did such a great job I wanted to say
33:16 - that again anyone that's interested in
33:18 - furthering their coding in their school
33:21 - in the district I'm an after-school
33:24 - program whatever you are doing we are
33:26 - here to help I'm gonna put my email in
33:29 - the chat bot chat box where you can send
33:31 - me an email if you want more information
33:33 - about bringing full-time coding to your
33:36 - school but definitely hour of code is a
33:37 - great way to invigorate your students
33:39 - whether you're doing coding already or
33:41 - you're just about to start Co monkeys a
33:43 - great place to start and just remember
33:45 - have fun with the hour of code that's
33:47 - what it's designed for
33:48 - and like I said just have everything set
33:51 - up beforehand and you'll have a seamless
33:52 - exciting and we would love also I should
33:54 - throw this out there we would love for
33:56 - you to
33:57 - hashtag us and any of your social things
34:00 - that you're doing for our code we would
34:01 - love to share your information on our
34:03 - blog and with our users hope we have one
34:06 - question here in the Q&A box let's check
34:08 - this out what was the hour of code URL
34:12 - so let me go back to that actually oops
34:15 - that's a great question thank you so
34:18 - much for asking that so you can do it
34:21 - through code org slash learn and click
34:23 - on code monkey or you can do our web
34:26 - address right here
34:27 - WWL a code monkey comm backslash our -
34:31 - of - code backslash
34:41 - you
34:45 - all right well it looks like there is no
34:52 - I'll answer this - someone had asked
34:55 - what is the code monkey hashtag and our
34:58 - code monkey hashtag is hashtag play code
35:00 - monkey and so like I said you can tag us
35:04 - during the hour of code and somebody
35:09 - asked can they go back to the game that
35:11 - they didn't finish an hour
35:12 - absolutely students can go back and
35:14 - finish it if the students are not more
35:17 - than good to trial they may have to
35:19 - start again but you can encourage them
35:21 - to kind of do that as well all right
35:26 - thank you everyone and looks like we
35:28 - have no more questions just remember
35:32 - we're always here for you and we thank
35:33 - you again for joining us at code monkeys
35:35 - hour of code webinar have a wonderful
35:37 - day everybody
35:43 - you
