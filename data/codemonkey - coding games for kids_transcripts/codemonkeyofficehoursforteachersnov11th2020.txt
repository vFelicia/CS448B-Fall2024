04:25 - a few things that you saw in the

04:46 - dynamic um
04:48 - session where we just take your
04:50 - questions and we answer them throughout
04:51 - the demo so
04:53 - um i'm going to share my screen now
04:56 - and i'm going to do the first a few
05:00 - basic
05:01 - basic things i'm going to
05:04 - log in first to my teacher account
05:09 - using the google i'm using my google
05:12 - account
05:14 - basically i'm i'm using google because i
05:16 - want to show you after
05:18 - how you can import your google
05:20 - classrooms onto code monkey so it's a
05:22 - sort of new integration that we have
05:25 - but in order to access that in order to
05:27 - be able to import your
05:28 - google classrooms you need to make sure
05:30 - that you sign in um
05:31 - through your google account which you
05:34 - use for your google classrooms
05:36 - so basically the first thing i do is um
05:40 - i need to create a classrooms because
05:41 - that's where i add my students and
05:43 - that's how my students can start
05:45 - accessing code monkey
05:47 - so the first thing i would do is
05:50 - create a new classroom by um clicking on
05:53 - create new classroom
05:54 - and giving my classroom a name
06:00 - and just making sure it's connected to
06:03 - my either my active subscription or if
06:06 - i'm just using the trial then
06:07 - to my trial but you need to choose a
06:09 - subscription um
06:10 - and i'm creating a classroom um and then
06:14 - and then the next thing
06:16 - that you would do is um add students so
06:19 - you can just
06:20 - follow this pop-up message here or you
06:22 - can also just click on the classroom
06:25 - but i'll just take i'll just let it take
06:27 - me
06:28 - um directly to the classroom dashboard
06:31 - where i can add my students so i just
06:33 - want to show
06:35 - quickly the the three methods we have
06:37 - for adding students
06:39 - i saw somebody asking about clever so
06:42 - this will be uh relevant also for you
06:44 - but the first two ways are for you as a
06:47 - teacher to
06:48 - create accounts for your students so you
06:50 - can either create a single account
06:52 - um or if you already have all your group
06:56 - you can use a csv file and just
06:59 - upload the csv file and the system will
07:02 - create
07:03 - all the accounts for you and these two
07:06 - methods are actually
07:07 - really great for the younger students
07:09 - who you want to create their accounts
07:11 - for them and and
07:15 - also if they're accessing code monkey
07:17 - from home
07:18 - um you can also after you created their
07:21 - accounts
07:22 - you can provide them with um two ways
07:25 - for easier
07:27 - access so i'm gonna actually show you
07:30 - that
07:31 - now quickly
07:34 - i'll just go to a classroom where i
07:35 - already have students
07:37 - and we have two ways to provide easier
07:41 - access for your students
07:43 - the first one being the login cards
07:47 - so that's something that you can either
07:50 - print out or
07:51 - send to your students i'll show you that
07:56 - so that's the login cards it has the
07:58 - student's username and password
08:00 - um so you know if they tend to forget
08:02 - their password that's something great to
08:04 - give them
08:05 - um and the other way um to provide your
08:08 - students with easy access is using the
08:10 - classroom login url
08:12 - um this is great because it means less
08:16 - typing for your students all they need
08:17 - to do is locate their username
08:19 - click on it and um enter their password
08:22 - and they're in so instead of going to
08:24 - codemonkey.com
08:26 - they would just go to this url so you
08:28 - can share it somewhere
08:29 - maybe through google classrooms and they
08:32 - click on the url they locate their
08:33 - username click
08:35 - enter their password and they are in
08:36 - their account
08:39 - um so those are the two first ways to
08:41 - add
08:42 - to create students and have them access
08:45 - their account
08:46 - the other way is by sharing a class code
08:50 - so for students who are joining from
08:52 - home or perhaps
08:53 - older students we recommend using
08:56 - this method method and
09:00 - basically for your students who are
09:02 - using any single sign-on options
09:05 - google for example for example clever
09:08 - class link
09:09 - this will be the way that they will join
09:12 - their classroom
09:13 - it's actually um quite an easy um
09:18 - an easy thing um they would copy this um
09:22 - that you can share with them this code
09:24 - and they'll go
09:25 - to the code monkey sign up page and they
09:28 - can use the codes to code to enter their
09:30 - classroom um if we'll have time i can
09:33 - show you that process
09:34 - after another nice thing that we have
09:38 - is what we call the classroom
09:42 - sign up page basically this is a url
09:45 - that already has
09:47 - the classroom code in it so
09:50 - you can share this with your students
09:52 - and then they'll
09:53 - automatically be directed to a sign up
09:55 - page that once they sign up
09:58 - they will be in their classroom um so
10:00 - they won't need to enter the code
10:02 - themselves
10:03 - so this url already has the code in it
10:05 - so that's great for
10:06 - having your students join your classroom
10:09 - um
10:10 - that's the method of joining
10:13 - the the the classroom using the
10:16 - classroom code
10:18 - i do want to show you also how you can
10:21 - import your
10:22 - google classrooms and again that's only
10:24 - if you've
10:25 - used your google account to log into
10:30 - codemonkey
10:32 - and again clicking on create new
10:35 - classroom and you can see i have this
10:37 - option right here import from google um
10:41 - and basically um if if this is your
10:44 - first time
10:46 - using it you might need to authorize
10:49 - codemonkey
10:51 - to get access to your google classrooms
10:56 - and now once i've chosen this option
10:59 - all i need to do is choose the classroom
11:01 - i want to
11:02 - import so i'm going to choose my monday
11:05 - class
11:05 - and i'm going to choose to connect it to
11:08 - my subscription
11:10 - and now i'm importing my classroom and i
11:14 - can only import classrooms that i have
11:17 - on my google classrooms that i am a
11:19 - teacher on so
11:21 - um you might have and we've been getting
11:23 - these questions you might have a
11:24 - colleague
11:25 - who is also sharing your subscription
11:28 - and also wants to
11:29 - import their google classroom so they
11:32 - would actually need to add you as a
11:34 - teacher
11:35 - onto their google classroom for you to
11:37 - be able to import
11:39 - the classroom so that's just something i
11:42 - wanted to point out
11:43 - and um great so i imported my classroom
11:47 - and
11:47 - basically i imported all the students
11:50 - that were in my roster in google
11:51 - classroom
11:52 - i imported them to my classroom as well
11:55 - so
11:56 - basically now all they need to do is log
11:59 - in to code monkey
12:03 - and i'll show you that just a second i
12:06 - want to show you another
12:08 - nice thing is that let's see our roster
12:12 - right here
12:13 - right so i have here two students um
12:16 - and basically
12:19 - and basically any changes that i want to
12:22 - want to do
12:23 - in my roster say i want to remove a
12:25 - student or maybe i want to change the
12:27 - classroom name
12:28 - so you need to make these changes from
12:31 - google classrooms
12:32 - and then you can sync use the sync
12:36 - classroom button here on the top
12:38 - and it will automatically update your
12:40 - classroom on codemonkey
12:42 - just as it appears on google classroom
12:46 - we have a question here from raquel
12:49 - what if we want to import a classroom
12:51 - that already used
12:52 - the trial can we save their progress and
12:55 - continue
12:56 - so that's a great question
12:59 - first of all i'll start by saying that
13:01 - students progress is always
13:04 - saved to their account so even if they
13:07 - move
13:07 - classroom or they move between
13:09 - subscriptions
13:11 - their progress is always always saved so
13:14 - no need to worry about that and i'll
13:16 - show you
13:18 - in just a second um how you can move
13:21 - your classroom from your trial
13:23 - um to a new subscription so if you
13:26 - already imported that classroom that
13:27 - they're already on code monkey
13:29 - you might have purchased a subscription
13:31 - and you want those students to enjoy the
13:33 - subscription
13:34 - so you'll just move the classroom to
13:36 - your new subscription and i'll show you
13:38 - that
13:38 - in a few minutes and
13:42 - i just want to show you now the the
13:44 - student side
13:50 - okay so i'm back in the codemonkey.com
13:54 - page
13:55 - and i want to log in to codemonkey i'm a
13:58 - student
13:59 - in the monday classroom and this is
14:02 - basically what you would need to tell
14:03 - your students
14:04 - they would go to the login page also
14:07 - click
14:08 - on the google button
14:11 - basically they need to choose their
14:13 - google account
14:15 - and they are in their classroom
14:18 - first thing they need to do once they
14:20 - enter their code monkey account is
14:22 - choose an avatar
14:24 - but they are in their classroom and they
14:26 - can already start
14:27 - accessing the courses that you have
14:29 - assigned
14:31 - to them so that's the students part and
14:35 - what they would need to do
14:36 - once you've imported the classroom onto
14:38 - codemonkey
14:42 - okay
14:46 - another thing i wanted to show you and
14:48 - i'm going back
14:49 - to my adventures in coding classroom
14:52 - which is a
14:53 - regular code monkey classroom that was
14:54 - created on code monkey as you can see
14:56 - students have
14:57 - user names i want to show you another
15:01 - thing that
15:02 - some of our teachers have been asking if
15:04 - they want to add
15:05 - other teachers to the classroom they can
15:08 - do that
15:09 - you can add your colleagues as
15:10 - co-teachers to your classrooms
15:13 - and that's something that you might do
15:16 - sometimes you would be the one creating
15:17 - the classroom but you have
15:19 - different teachers who need access to
15:21 - these classrooms
15:23 - once you add the teachers through the
15:26 - code teachers part
15:28 - [Music]
15:30 - part here they'll get an invite they'll
15:33 - accept the invite they'll log in to
15:34 - codemonkey and they'll see the classroom
15:37 - on their my classrooms list they can
15:40 - then access the courses
15:42 - and they can basically see the classroom
15:45 - dashboard manage the student accounts
15:47 - and see their progress
15:49 - so they basically can do anything that
15:51 - you can do
15:52 - just over the classroom that they are
15:54 - co-teachers
15:56 - on so that's something that you can do
15:58 - for any of the classrooms and
16:00 - as well for the google classrooms um
16:03 - google classrooms is um also
16:06 - you're able to import teachers
16:10 - you would be able to import teachers
16:13 - that are also teachers on your classroom
16:16 - but on google classroom sites so make
16:18 - sure you first added
16:20 - the teacher as a teacher in google
16:22 - classroom and then the drop down menu
16:24 - will allow you to choose
16:26 - just from the teachers that have are
16:28 - already defined as teachers from google
16:30 - classrooms
16:32 - basically and then you click on import
16:34 - and then
16:35 - the teacher can log in to code monkey
16:38 - through google
16:40 - and already see the classroom
16:46 - okay so um i want to move on to uh
16:49 - to uh two features that i'd like to sort
16:52 - of give a spotlight on today
16:54 - um and this is from a survey that we've
16:56 - recently sent
16:57 - out um we've found that
17:01 - um some users are not so familiar with
17:04 - these features
17:06 - um but the ones who are familiar with it
17:08 - find it very useful and helpful
17:10 - so these are great features especially
17:13 - if you're running a structured lesson
17:16 - or giving assignments using code monkey
17:19 - either
17:20 - meeting students face to face or in a
17:22 - remote environment
17:24 - so i want to talk about uh limiting
17:28 - students progress so sort of controlling
17:30 - their pace
17:32 - and also we'll talk about the lessons
17:34 - feature right here so
17:37 - limiting progress is available for you
17:40 - within a course so first thing you do
17:43 - after you've added your
17:44 - students would be to assign the relevant
17:47 - courses to your students so
17:49 - i always recommend before starting the
17:52 - class
17:53 - going here making sure you have the
17:55 - right courses assigned
17:57 - coding adventure part one as well as our
18:01 - hour of code courses are assigned by
18:04 - default so if you don't want them
18:06 - assigned
18:07 - you can unassign them but just
18:10 - visit this tab the courses tab to make
18:12 - sure you have everything
18:14 - organized for your lesson the next thing
18:17 - is the progress tab so this is um
18:21 - basically um a great place to go
18:24 - to see how you're so it's less it's less
18:28 - uh
18:29 - let's go to the this classroom it has
18:32 - more students in it more progress
18:34 - much more colorful um and this is where
18:38 - you can go
18:38 - to see how your students are doing
18:42 - in each of our courses so that's
18:44 - available for you for each of the
18:45 - courses and i'm in coding adventure part
18:47 - one
18:48 - and i have my students just playing but
18:51 - but let's say i want to keep them at the
18:54 - same pace i don't want them to go
18:56 - just through the challenges without my
18:58 - guidance
18:59 - so you are able to limit their progress
19:02 - by clicking on the limit progress
19:03 - buttons
19:06 - and let's say i want them only to play
19:09 - the first five challenges so i'm gonna
19:12 - put here
19:12 - five and you'll see that everything
19:14 - beyond that will be
19:16 - grayed out basically once they finish
19:18 - the first less the for the first five
19:20 - challenges
19:21 - they'll get a message that the teacher
19:23 - has locked the rest of the challenges
19:27 - at any point you can either come back
19:30 - here
19:30 - to change and limit their progress
19:34 - to a different challenge or just return
19:36 - them to
19:37 - free play and
19:40 - of course you can also limit the
19:42 - progress based on
19:44 - the last lesson taught which i'll show
19:46 - you in just a moment what
19:48 - lessons feature is so now i'm going to
19:50 - go back to free play
19:58 - okay
20:03 - okay so i'm clicking here on the lessons
20:06 - tab
20:09 - and this is um currently only available
20:13 - for coding adventure
20:15 - so if you're teaching coding adventure
20:17 - and if you are using
20:18 - our lesson plans then this feature will
20:20 - allow you
20:21 - to easily conduct your lesson
20:24 - each number here represents a lesson
20:26 - plan
20:28 - and you can just click on the number to
20:31 - see that the page is divided according
20:33 - to the lesson plan structure
20:36 - so it's all laid out for you to teach it
20:38 - out with your classroom
20:39 - you can also access the individual
20:42 - lesson plan
20:43 - um right here oh sorry i'm
20:47 - yeah okay i'm in lesson two that's okay
20:49 - so you can access the individual
20:51 - lesson plan um if you want to review it
20:55 - before the class which we usually
20:56 - recommend
20:57 - and and basically um
21:01 - you also have your shortcuts for the
21:03 - challenges that that the students will
21:05 - uh review throughout this lesson um as
21:08 - well as shortcuts to the reference cards
21:10 - and character review
21:12 - so this really um has it all laid out
21:15 - for you
21:16 - and ready for you to to use and to teach
21:19 - uh once you're done you can even mark
21:21 - the lesson as complete
21:22 - um and then next time you come back here
21:25 - you can already know
21:26 - um where you've last left and now that
21:28 - you need to continue to lesson number
21:30 - three
21:31 - so if you choose to use lessons this way
21:34 - that's great it helps you run your
21:36 - lesson if you're using our
21:37 - lesson plans or you can go even further
21:41 - and use our lesson mode and lesson mode
21:44 - is a great distinct
21:46 - um it's great way to
21:49 - use lessons and have a part where you're
21:53 - teaching and the part where
21:54 - the students are playing so it
21:58 - prevents your students from going too
21:59 - far ahead or being distracted
22:02 - basically using
22:06 - lessons once you
22:10 - enter lesson mode your students will go
22:13 - into
22:13 - into lesson mode meaning they won't be
22:15 - able to
22:16 - um access any of the courses until
22:20 - you decide that it's time to assign the
22:22 - challenges and have them play so until
22:24 - then you can go through the introduction
22:26 - explain what you're about to do and when
22:28 - you're ready assign the challenges
22:30 - and have the students start playing
22:34 - once you're done you might want to end
22:37 - play time
22:38 - go into debriefing and then when you're
22:41 - finished
22:42 - with your lesson you can click here
22:44 - you'll also have it marked in green
22:46 - so you know where you stopped um
22:49 - and you know where to come back next
22:52 - time
22:53 - that you're using um code monkey with
22:56 - your students
22:57 - we also have your short tutorial on
22:59 - lessons so
23:00 - feel free to uh refer to this
23:03 - uh tutorial if you want any additional
23:05 - explanations on how to use this feature
23:09 - and i think i think that's
23:13 - that's it for lessons
23:20 - let's see if we had here any questions
23:27 - oh um before we'll continue i did want
23:30 - to show
23:31 - the part of how to move a classroom
23:34 - between subscriptions
23:36 - i'm going to go back to the classrooms
23:38 - page
23:39 - and we have here a classroom that is
23:41 - connected to an old subscription but you
23:43 - can also
23:44 - um see this as a classroom that is
23:46 - connected to a trial
23:49 - which now i want to move to my new
23:51 - subscription
23:52 - and we have this upgrade button right
23:56 - here
23:56 - which allows me to move classrooms
23:59 - between subscriptions so once i move the
24:01 - classroom all the students in the
24:02 - classroom
24:03 - move also to the new subscription so
24:06 - um this pop-up message kind of gives me
24:09 - a review
24:10 - if i need to remove some of the students
24:12 - before upgrading
24:14 - the the classroom i'm able to do that
24:17 - but basically i want to continue with
24:20 - these four students
24:22 - next thing i need to do is to choose the
24:23 - subscription i want to move the
24:25 - classroom to
24:27 - and click on upgrade
24:31 - and now as you can see the classroom is
24:33 - already part of my new subscription
24:35 - all the progress that the students made
24:37 - is kept
24:39 - all they need to do is log in and they
24:41 - continue from where
24:42 - they last stopped
24:50 - okay lina do you want to continue
24:58 - on one moment
25:08 - alrighty thank you talia for that part
25:12 - and now we're going to go ahead
25:18 - and get into a couple of the new
25:22 - features here right
25:26 - let me just re-share my screen here
25:30 - all right so some things that i wanted
25:32 - to cover that are
25:33 - newer to
25:40 - interesting
25:42 - okay you should be able to see my screen
25:45 - tell you can you see my classrooms page
25:48 - yeah okay good just want to make sure
25:51 - okay so
25:52 - something that is newer to um the code
25:55 - monkey
25:56 - platform and something i just wanted to
25:57 - discuss was if i go into
25:59 - my own teacher's classroom here in each
26:02 - of the classrooms page there's
26:04 - a new feature that we recently added and
26:06 - that is the proficiency table
26:09 - and so when you go into the grade book
26:13 - within your classroom you will see here
26:16 - at the top you can see by course or by
26:19 - proficiency
26:21 - so in the proficiency table you will be
26:23 - able to see all of your students that
26:24 - are listed within that classroom
26:26 - and then you're able to see the coding
26:27 - concepts that are covered throughout
26:29 - all the courses in coding adventure you
26:32 - will also be able to see
26:34 - what level your students are at within
26:36 - those coding concepts so we can see
26:39 - where our students are proficiency wise
26:42 - based on the
26:43 - concepts of which they're working and so
26:45 - those will fill in as a student's
26:47 - progress
26:47 - progresses
26:51 - and then one more thing i would like to
26:53 - show you
26:54 - here is on our courses page i know talia
26:56 - was showing you the courses
26:58 - and things like that but we just
27:00 - recently
27:01 - um added these
27:04 - banners to the top of each of the
27:06 - courses and they tell you what language
27:08 - each of the courses are
27:09 - um so if they're block based or
27:11 - text-based coding and then what level
27:14 - it is for students so that's just
27:15 - something good to note as far as
27:17 - you know you're not sure which courses
27:19 - to start with your students there's that
27:21 - there for you so you have a reference
27:23 - point as well
27:27 - okay
27:32 - sorry okay great
27:38 - um i i did want to also um
27:42 - show the part of um
27:45 - logging in as a student to uh to a
27:48 - classroom using the class code
27:50 - um because that's that's also always a
27:52 - part that
27:53 - i talk about but i never show and i
27:55 - think i think
27:56 - i should show that part um let me also
27:59 - share my screen again
28:02 - okay and and basically the first thing i
28:06 - need to do
28:06 - is of course share the the class code um
28:09 - with my students and where do i find the
28:12 - class code would i where
28:14 - i showed you um the first place
28:17 - um is when i click to add new students i
28:21 - have here the
28:22 - i have the class code method but you can
28:23 - always find your classroom codes
28:26 - um right here um or
28:29 - by clicking on the classroom from the
28:32 - classroom dashboard
28:36 - i can also locate it from the students
28:39 - tab
28:43 - right so it's also right here and i'll
28:45 - copy that for
28:46 - for now um also when i click on add
28:48 - student
28:50 - i also have the class code here and and
28:52 - at any point if you want the class code
28:54 - is unique for your classroom and you can
28:56 - at any point click here to generate a
28:58 - new class code
28:59 - um if you feel like the students have
29:01 - been passing around the code now we've
29:03 - encountered that as well and you have
29:05 - students who you
29:07 - don't or not part of your classroom
29:09 - joining your classroom
29:10 - just create a new code for your
29:12 - classroom
29:14 - so i'm going to go now
29:19 - and join the classroom
29:23 - and just log out
29:30 - okay so basically from codemonkey
29:34 - the first thing i would do i'm a new
29:36 - student i want to join my classroom and
29:38 - click on the sign up and
29:41 - i'll choose student
29:44 - i'm going i'm going to be asked if i
29:46 - have a classroom code yes i have a class
29:48 - code now i need to enter the class code
29:50 - will i
29:51 - copy the class code from before
29:56 - great and now the next step would be to
29:57 - create my account
29:59 - if i'm using any of these single
30:02 - sign-ons i can just choose them
30:04 - and use them for my codemonkey account i
30:07 - think it's great we see many
30:09 - users teachers students using that
30:12 - it's just less passwords to remember but
30:15 - for now i'm going to
30:17 - actually create
30:20 - my own username and password
30:26 - i might add a few characters to it
30:33 - okay so last stop before i'm also
30:36 - getting this
30:37 - reminder i can download a copy of my
30:40 - username and password because i tend to
30:41 - forget my passwords
30:43 - but let's start
30:50 - and great again choosing my avatar i'm a
30:53 - new
30:54 - i have my my new account i'm in my
30:57 - account
30:57 - as you can see i'm in um the courses
31:00 - page where i can already start the
31:02 - courses that are assigned
31:04 - to my classroom so that was the process
31:07 - of joining
31:08 - a classroom using the class code your
31:11 - students can create their own accounts
31:13 - either
31:13 - by creating their own username and
31:15 - password or by using any of the single
31:17 - sign-on options
31:18 - if your user if your students are using
31:20 - clever um they can also
31:23 - either go through the clever single
31:25 - sign-on or you can add codemonkey to
31:28 - your clever portal
31:29 - and have them click on codemonkey
31:32 - through the clever portal or class link
31:35 - that's available also there
31:38 - and then just something to note here on
31:40 - this page
31:41 - recently added to the platform itself as
31:43 - well is you'll see the courses on top
31:45 - that are assigned by the teacher so the
31:47 - students will still have access to the
31:49 - courses
31:49 - only see the courses that are assigned
31:51 - to them
31:52 - even though all the coding adventure
31:54 - courses are assigned
31:56 - still works in the same way that it
31:58 - worked before the students do have to
31:59 - work through the courses in order to
32:00 - have access to them
32:02 - and then all of the courses that are
32:04 - within the subscription but are not
32:06 - available to them will now be listed
32:08 - below right so they don't need to scroll
32:11 - down to find
32:12 - um the the chorus they have it here on
32:15 - top
32:16 - um okay
32:19 - let's see um let's maybe
32:22 - lina let's go back to the question slide
32:24 - because we had a few questions that
32:27 - um you've sent us uh before the webinar
32:30 - so
32:31 - we have time to cover those as well
32:37 - in the in in our slides
32:40 - okay so we have a couple of questions
32:42 - that have been asked beforehand so we
32:44 - want to make sure that we're
32:45 - also honoring your time as much as um
32:51 - honor your time and your questions so
32:52 - what order should my course
32:54 - should my students be completing the
32:56 - courses
32:58 - and so i'm just going to go ahead and
33:00 - show you where you can find
33:02 - that at so on the codemonkey.com page
33:17 - right here you're able to find
33:20 - our basically essential scope here your
33:22 - sales rep or somebody that has worked
33:24 - with you on your account can also share
33:26 - with you
33:26 - a customized scope and sequence but your
33:29 - the courses will be listed here so we
33:31 - have them listed from our kindergarten
33:33 - grade level all the way up to our
33:35 - ninth grade grade level and based on the
33:37 - block based moving to text-based coding
33:40 - there so
33:43 - i'm just dependent oops definitely
33:45 - recommend that
33:46 - students in grades three through
33:49 - eight start working on text-based coding
33:52 - it's great to introduce them with the
33:53 - block-based coding
33:54 - coding adventure is in coffeescript so
33:56 - that's a shorter version of javascript
33:58 - and python coffee java
34:00 - and then moving right along to banana
34:03 - tails is our full python course so
34:05 - it's more of an intermediate course so
34:08 - it's good for the students to have a
34:09 - background knowledge and some coding
34:11 - before they attempt
34:12 - the python itself so that's a great
34:14 - question
34:16 - the next one is how do i know which
34:18 - standards code monkey is aligned to
34:22 - so i'll show you where you can find that
34:23 - those are all listed within the lesson
34:25 - plans themselves
34:27 - or at the bottom of the codemonkey.com
34:30 - webpage
34:33 - here i just scroll down to the footer
34:35 - and you can click on standards
34:37 - and in there you can find the standards
34:39 - for each one of the courses themselves
34:41 - so you can click on the course and then
34:42 - you're able to find the standards here
34:44 - we have the csta
34:46 - standards listed here um we also have
34:48 - some common core standards if you're
34:50 - looking for something more customized
34:52 - standards based on your state you can
34:53 - also reset reach out to talia or anyone
34:56 - of
34:56 - a member of our sales team and we're
34:58 - happy to provide that those resources
35:00 - for you
35:00 - as well and then another place that you
35:02 - can find them is in our lesson plan so
35:05 - the lesson plans are located under the
35:07 - teaching resources
35:08 - in the teaching with codemonkey page and
35:11 - when you click on the lesson plans
35:12 - themselves
35:15 - they will pop up within the lessons
35:18 - we do have a specific slide sorry i went
35:22 - too fast there
35:22 - um related to the standards that are
35:24 - here these are also the csta standards
35:26 - so you can find them on the
35:28 - bottom of the footer of the page or you
35:29 - can find them within the lesson plans
35:31 - themselves as well so
35:32 - another great question um upgrade
35:36 - how does this work should i use this
35:38 - instead of renaming the classroom
35:40 - so i know that talia just mentioned on
35:42 - about that but i'll also talk about this
35:44 - as well so she mentioned
35:46 - switching from an expired subscription
35:48 - to a new subscription
35:51 - there is no need to recreate student
35:53 - accounts
35:54 - or to recreate that classroom all you
35:57 - would do is you would click
35:58 - on here i am in the my classrooms page
36:00 - the class you would like to
36:01 - upgrade essentially means to move to the
36:04 - new subscription
36:05 - so when you click on that upgrade button
36:08 - it will ask you if you're basically sure
36:10 - and you would like to continue so if i
36:12 - would then i choose the specific
36:14 - subscription that i would like this
36:15 - classroom attached to
36:16 - and then i would click on upgrade and
36:18 - now i would see the classroom
36:20 - attached here if you are a co-teacher
36:22 - you the main
36:24 - teacher on the account will need to do
36:25 - that for you but that is how you
36:27 - upgrade the subscription
36:31 - okay so that is um just some of the
36:34 - questions that we were asked
36:36 - prior there's a question here in the q a
36:38 - we've already used the free trial
36:39 - through our district's
36:40 - clever platform we need to know how to
36:42 - continue with our subscription
36:44 - we want to access it through clever so i
36:46 - understand
36:47 - rockhill i believe that you have been
36:50 - working with molly so she'll be able to
36:52 - follow up with you
36:54 - after today's webinar regarding that
36:57 - you can feel free also as well if you
36:59 - guys have a question
37:01 - we are a pretty small group here so if
37:03 - you would like to hop on and ask us a
37:05 - question
37:07 - we're also here for that as well
37:17 - oh if you would like to ask a question
37:19 - we'll just have to unmute you so you can
37:21 - raise your hand and then
37:22 - that way i can know to unmute you as
37:24 - well
37:34 - all right very quiet
37:37 - group but we're happy that you have
37:40 - joined us for today's webinar
37:42 - all right so once again i'll just
37:44 - mention um
37:46 - that we covered the classrooms and
37:48 - student access
37:49 - how to add co-teachers limiting progress
37:53 - the lesson feature grade book and
37:55 - proficiency and we did some time for q a
37:57 - i do just want to show you just one more
37:58 - thing under the teacher resources before
38:00 - we get moving something that i think
38:02 - a lot of teachers just are not aware
38:04 - that it's there
38:06 - um so under the teaching with coding
38:08 - code monkey we do have this
38:10 - um teaching with coding adventure
38:12 - certification it's like our
38:13 - certification course
38:14 - it will go over all of the concepts that
38:16 - are covered within coding adventure
38:18 - itself so when you go here it'll talk
38:20 - about the platform
38:22 - and it'll walk you through that then we
38:24 - also have the teacher tools and then
38:26 - it'll walk you through
38:27 - just quick short videos about what each
38:29 - of these concepts are so if you're not
38:31 - sure about the concepts
38:32 - you can come here and work through this
38:35 - course
38:36 - itself another way to find those
38:39 - resources
38:40 - are by visiting our webinars page which
38:42 - you can do within this teaching with
38:44 - code monkey
38:45 - there is also an additional place that
38:48 - you can go and that's into our help
38:49 - center
38:51 - in the help center is where you'll find
38:52 - all of the resources that we've shared
38:54 - with you
38:55 - today about how to do your account
38:57 - getting started the classroom dashboard
39:00 - within these resources themselves there
39:02 - is
39:03 - typically a video that's attached or
39:05 - screenshots and then
39:06 - text to walk you through what to do so
39:08 - if you're ever unsure
39:09 - always check out the help center but
39:11 - something else that's within the help
39:13 - center is that i click on co if i type
39:15 - in coding adventure
39:16 - it's going on that correctly there when
39:19 - i type in coding adventure you're able
39:21 - to see the coding concepts that are here
39:23 - what i love most about this resource is
39:25 - that it will tell you
39:27 - where you will see these specific
39:28 - challenges and then it will give you a
39:31 - walk through about what a simple loop is
39:33 - what a variable is and it gives you an
39:36 - example
39:37 - with an animated screenshot about what
39:41 - each of the concepts covers so this is
39:43 - another way to
39:44 - refer to something if you're kind of
39:46 - stuck you're not sure exactly where to
39:49 - find that resource or maybe you're not
39:51 - sure about the concept and what it
39:52 - exactly means that's another way
39:55 - and then one more place i would like to
39:57 - mention is within the teacher block so
39:59 - if you go up to the upper
40:00 - right hand side of the screen the three
40:02 - lines
40:03 - and you click on blog
40:07 - you are able to see all of our blogs
40:10 - that we
40:11 - are writing our teacher ambassadors are
40:13 - also sharing articles
40:14 - as well but a really good place to find
40:17 - some unplugged activities for remote
40:19 - learning
40:20 - are going to be if you type in unplugged
40:22 - within the blog page itself
40:24 - and we have created quite a bit of
40:26 - activities
40:27 - how to explain algorithms with your kids
40:30 - and exactly what that means
40:31 - in a unplugged manner so
40:34 - just to give you a few more resources
40:36 - with that in-person at-home
40:38 - type of learning there's no reason
40:40 - students can't get moving either using
40:42 - flipgrid
40:43 - or doing vocabulary work with a jam
40:45 - board where each student is working
40:47 - through
40:48 - what exactly an algorithm means and how
40:50 - they can break that down
40:52 - so those are just some different
40:53 - resources um
40:55 - as well to utilize within the teacher
40:58 - resources themselves and then
41:00 - the solutions i know talia had mentioned
41:02 - this but i'll also mention this again
41:04 - in the solutions tab within the teacher
