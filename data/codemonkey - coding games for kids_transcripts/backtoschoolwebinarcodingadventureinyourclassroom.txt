00:00 - Oh
00:04 - all right everyone thank you so much for
00:06 - joining us um welcome to code monkeys
00:10 - webinar coding adventure in your
00:13 - classroom thank you for joining us this
00:15 - afternoon please follow us on Twitter at
00:19 - code monkey s tu or on our Instagram
00:21 - also please tweet at us today during
00:23 - today's webinar at hashtag code monkey
00:25 - webinar we will do our best to answer
00:28 - any live tweets during today's webinar
00:31 - my team is also here to answer any
00:33 - questions that you may have and then
00:35 - following today's webinar we'll send you
00:38 - information regarding your PD
00:39 - certificate so let's get ready to write
00:41 - code catch bananas and save the world so
00:46 - I was like to start off the webinar
00:51 - discussing about Who I am since you're
00:53 - I'm sure you're wondering who who who
00:55 - who I am and basically what I do so my
00:58 - name is Lena Saleh and I'm the
00:59 - professional development manager here at
01:01 - code monkey I have 10 years of education
01:04 - experience actually a little bit more
01:05 - now nine of those years I spent in the
01:07 - classroom I was a former stem teacher in
01:10 - which I developed curriculum across my
01:11 - district for grades K through 12
01:16 - oh I'm sorry sometimes you get so
01:19 - excited when you're moving through that
01:20 - you forget the extra part so
01:22 - back-to-school webinar with coding
01:23 - adventure in your classroom so I just
01:24 - want you to be able to see this slides
01:26 - now you can be on the same page with me
01:28 - here so my apologies about that anyway
01:31 - so I'm a former stem teacher I help
01:32 - write curriculum for K through 12 for
01:34 - our district and scaffolding what that
01:36 - looks like I'm also a professional
01:37 - development leader so what that means is
01:40 - I've done workshops prior to my role
01:42 - here at code monkey in of my districts
01:44 - and out of my districts kind of across
01:46 - the country I'm also an organizer of
01:48 - EdTech Austin and so we basically marry
01:51 - the partnerships between teachers and
01:52 - the local ed tech scene and kind of
01:55 - create for that kind of seamless
01:57 - partnership I'm also very passionate
01:59 - about computer science doesn't know me
02:02 - and those of you that don't both my
02:04 - parents never graduated from college or
02:06 - never even went to college and I just
02:08 - didn't know that that was there I just
02:10 - always thought that Siot science was
02:12 - with computers and I never really
02:14 - understood what that was and so I'm just
02:16 - passionate about creating that
02:18 - opportunity for students and knowing
02:20 - that coding is not just for one but for
02:22 - all so I think that's pretty important
02:23 - um you can always tweet at me here at
02:26 - Lena at code monkey studio or a code
02:27 - monkey sorry excuse me or you can email
02:29 - me for any questions or anything that
02:31 - you might have from today's webinar or
02:33 - maybe some thoughts that you have after
02:34 - our webinar today so thank you once
02:37 - again for joining us and we're gonna go
02:39 - ahead and get started here
02:40 - oh sorry before we get started though I
02:43 - do want to introduce our panelists here
02:45 - on the left-hand side in the red jacket
02:46 - we have Zoe she is our marketing and
02:49 - media manager and on the right hand side
02:50 - we have Talia she's the customer success
02:53 - manager both really awesome they're
02:55 - joining us from Israel which is where
02:58 - our main office is located and so it's
03:01 - midnight for them so thank you so much
03:02 - for taking that time to join us today
03:04 - both of you
03:05 - so now let's kick it off and let's get
03:08 - started so today we're going to review
03:10 - how to run a lesson in your classroom
03:12 - with coding adventure we're going to go
03:15 - into the intro to coding adventure
03:17 - itself what a coding adventure is what
03:20 - language we use to code in then we're
03:23 - going to use coding adventure with our
03:25 - new feature code monkey lessons which is
03:27 - our
03:31 - sorry which is poopsies I mean to do
03:34 - that which is our new mode that we can
03:36 - use so we're going to discuss what it is
03:38 - the interface the layout and then we're
03:40 - gonna work through lessons 1 & 3 to get
03:42 - you started it with this year fresh with
03:45 - coding adventure how to track students
03:47 - progress some of the key concepts that
03:49 - are intertwined within there we're going
03:52 - to talk about skill mode and why we use
03:53 - it some new features and new courses
03:56 - that we have here at code monkey and
03:57 - then we're gonna leave some time for you
03:58 - at the end for coding adventure I mean
04:00 - sorry for questions
04:02 - alright so coding adventure in your
04:04 - classroom so what is coding adventure
04:06 - I'm sure many of you already know but if
04:08 - you don't know I like to always review
04:10 - what coding adventure course is so
04:11 - coding adventure is for grades three
04:13 - through eight it's a very it's a game
04:15 - based course with two hundred-plus
04:17 - coding levels both in story mode and
04:20 - skill mode which will discuss universal
04:22 - coding concepts that go across any
04:24 - coding language it teaches that
04:26 - text-based coding which is CoffeeScript
04:28 - which we'll talk about here in just a
04:29 - minute and then there's no prior coding
04:31 - experience that's needed to begin um
04:34 - it's very scaffolded and goes linearly
04:36 - very interactive kids are very excited
04:38 - about it and they really enjoy making
04:41 - the monkey catch the banana which we'll
04:43 - do today so what is CoffeeScript what
04:47 - language is it any time I'm at
04:49 - conferences or even students asking me
04:53 - what CoffeeScript even is CoffeeScript
04:56 - is a real computer language real people
04:59 - do use it so you can look it up and
05:01 - google it at any time
05:03 - it is a shorter version of JavaScript
05:06 - and Python so think about like the meat
05:08 - and potatoes of the language it's very
05:09 - clean there's no like syntax hanging
05:11 - down or curly brackets or any of that
05:13 - kind of thing we know and you know that
05:16 - students have a really hard time putting
05:18 - periods in and asking them to do a
05:20 - semicolon is even more challenging and
05:24 - syntax especially when you're a new
05:25 - coder really is the thing that really
05:26 - ties you down and so CoffeeScript really
05:28 - makes it easy if we're that seamless
05:30 - transition to whatever next language you
05:32 - want to learn
05:35 - so let's get into coding adventure using
05:38 - the code monkey lessons so first what
05:42 - are the code monkey lessons and what is
05:44 - it that I'm talking about so code monkey
05:47 - lessons like I said is our newest
05:48 - feature it's a feature that helps you
05:50 - more easily conduct your coding classes
05:53 - so excuse me you can access it from the
05:55 - classroom dashboard it it also gives you
05:58 - the ability to access individualize
06:00 - lesson plans based on the lesson that
06:02 - you're teaching and gives you the
06:04 - challenges that are associated within
06:06 - those lessons it's also a distinct mode
06:09 - for when you're teaching and when
06:10 - students play so we'll take a look at
06:11 - what that looks like and then it's also
06:13 - saves the teaching progress for each
06:15 - progress for each class so it's not just
06:17 - Universal for all of your classes it
06:20 - saves it very specific to each one of
06:21 - the classrooms that you're working in
06:23 - all right so let's go ahead and let's
06:27 - take a look at lesson mode itself so I'm
06:31 - gonna spare you of how we actually get
06:33 - to lesson mode if you're not sure we do
06:35 - have a really nice short tutorial about
06:36 - lesson mode and kind of like how to get
06:38 - there and that kind of a thing
06:40 - but we're gonna go ahead here and get
06:43 - started with what is the user in what
06:45 - the interface looks like so coding it I
06:48 - mean the lesson code monkey lessons is
06:51 - set up exactly like our lesson plans so
06:53 - it has the challenges that are
06:55 - associated with it with a lesson plan
06:58 - but in how it's set up is it is broken
07:01 - into three parts the first part is
07:02 - introduction the second part is the
07:05 - playtime and then it will have certain
07:07 - challenges that are associated there and
07:09 - then the last part is the debrief so set
07:12 - up just like I said very similarly over
07:14 - here on the right hand side we see all
07:16 - of the challenges as well as our
07:18 - reference and character card and we'll
07:19 - look at all of those here in just a
07:21 - moment
07:23 - you
07:25 - so before so let's let's get into the
07:29 - teaching of sorry just wanna move
07:32 - sometimes when you're doing these zooms
07:33 - you have toolbars are kind of getting
07:35 - your ways there so here I always like to
07:38 - kick off my school year really getting
07:41 - students really jazzed about coding so
07:43 - how do we do that so I usually introduce
07:47 - with an unplugged coding activity in the
07:49 - code monkey lessons there are always
07:51 - some kind of an unplugged activity
07:53 - intertwine with in the lesson so that's
07:55 - just something to keep in mind
07:56 - reacher research states that it doesn't
07:59 - unplug activities don't make students
08:01 - better coders but it makes them have
08:03 - better self-efficacy and better
08:05 - vocabulary so can't really beat that
08:07 - right so kind of I feel like it really
08:09 - gives them that background knowledge to
08:10 - really be successful and apply it to the
08:12 - challenges themselves so this is my most
08:17 - favorite coding activity I do in teacher
08:19 - trainings I've really been all across
08:21 - the country doing this activity and
08:23 - teachers always love it just as much as
08:25 - the students do so I don't really know
08:29 - what the technical name of it but I've
08:30 - call it blindfolded coding so here are
08:34 - the activity directions so you will
08:35 - choose three students in your classroom
08:37 - so usually when I do this activity I
08:39 - bring all my students down to like my
08:40 - little presentation area or wherever you
08:43 - kind of had them and even 5th graders I
08:45 - had them sit on the floor didn't matter
08:46 - to me so I have them sit down and then I
08:50 - set up to like station well let's just
08:53 - talk about what the roles are so first
08:54 - you choose three students and I choose
08:56 - one student who is the gives the
08:59 - directions and I call them like the
09:00 - guide or the mapper then I have one
09:03 - student who is going to be blindfolded
09:04 - and that's their gonna receive the
09:06 - directions then you have another student
09:08 - who's the scripter so really they're
09:10 - like dictating script and writing it
09:12 - down so everyone can see it and then the
09:14 - materials that you need two bowls you
09:16 - can do cups you can do whatever kind of
09:18 - works for you in your classroom one
09:20 - blindfold and then items to fill that
09:23 - bowl so I've done it with beads and that
09:26 - tend to get all over the floor so
09:27 - usually when I did it in my classroom
09:29 - I would do it with like unicorn erasers
09:32 - I was like you know the big thing or
09:33 - those poop emoji erasers or whatever it
09:35 - is that kind of get the
09:37 - kids excited and so when I did that what
09:41 - you basically do is you set up two bowls
09:44 - pretty considerable distance apart
09:46 - making sure there's nowhere for them to
09:48 - trip or fall or whatever you really want
09:51 - them to be able to trust kind of how
09:54 - they're going so one so then you set
09:57 - them apart the student that's blindfold
09:59 - you can see where they are not a big
10:00 - deal
10:01 - makes no difference in fact you want
10:03 - them to know where it is and then the
10:06 - mapper will guide the student okay using
10:09 - the code that we have here so I have
10:11 - very explicit code here step turn right
10:14 - turn left and then I have students
10:17 - making sure that we determine what how
10:19 - they step so heel toe so this isn't
10:22 - really part of the code but it is
10:24 - something that you want to establish
10:25 - because when students are blindfolded
10:27 - and what I've done this several times
10:29 - with teachers and when they're
10:31 - blindfolded and I have not said walk
10:32 - heel toe then they end up like tiptoeing
10:35 - little tiny steps or some people make
10:37 - giant leaps so this is just a way to
10:38 - keep it really consistent because we
10:40 - really want consistent concise code pick
10:44 - up set down and then pour okay so then
10:48 - the scripter is going to be dictating
10:50 - this on the on the board so the guide is
10:53 - - so the goal is to guide the student to
10:57 - dump the bowl with items into it into
10:59 - the end people I notice here that I'm
11:01 - missing a B on this air in the spelling
11:02 - thing so you know of course your
11:04 - students would catch that if they saw it
11:05 - but there it is
11:07 - and so what we want to have happen is as
11:10 - you can see here these this set of
11:13 - students here they're actually teacher
11:15 - in the teacher College they're doing
11:17 - this activity here and you can see what
11:20 - starts to happen is that they're very
11:23 - off-balance and not trusting really
11:25 - where they are as well as this gentleman
11:27 - here when he was doing it um hopefully
11:31 - this kind of goes through but anyway
11:33 - unless he's doing it he was very like
11:35 - wishy-washy about where he was going so
11:37 - really making sure that the students are
11:38 - kind of guiding them and in writing
11:40 - those steps down there for it
11:41 - therefore so that if we ever were to
11:44 - repeat it again we could repeat the code
11:46 - so like I said they're blindfolded
11:49 - they're walking they dump one empty
11:51 - I mean they dumped the bowl with the
11:52 - objects in it and they walk it over and
11:54 - dump it into the other bowl and you'll
11:56 - see things start to happen so it's an
11:58 - algorithm there's lots of planning
11:59 - that's involved and then there's also
12:01 - that sense of trust they really have to
12:03 - trust the direction giver I've seen this
12:05 - where teachers have actually watch walk
12:07 - to other teachers into the into the wall
12:09 - so just some things to kind of keep in
12:11 - mind and kind of watch as your students
12:13 - are kind of going through but you'll see
12:17 - that you're immediately off balance so
12:19 - you have to really rely on your senses
12:20 - so it's just something to really kind of
12:23 - understand as we're kind of going
12:24 - through and then they walk it over and
12:26 - they pour the objects into the board so
12:29 - we've seen many different ways that a
12:31 - computer would work and actually as the
12:32 - monkey does when we do challenge number
12:34 - five it's the first time we see an
12:35 - algorithm and also some other factors
12:37 - are like an if statement if something is
12:39 - there it won't keep walking as you saw
12:41 - this young lady on the left-hand side
12:43 - when she was walking she reached out
12:45 - really quickly to the bookshelves even
12:46 - though she knew she was safe she even
12:48 - saw where the items were she just didn't
12:50 - trust her own senses and that happens to
12:51 - you sometimes when you're walking you
12:53 - know to the bathroom is it a little of a
12:54 - night so just some things to kind of go
12:58 - through and the kids like I said love
13:00 - this you can have introduced it and then
13:02 - have the kids go and do it themselves
13:03 - they get really jazzed about it so what
13:05 - better way to get jazzed up about the
13:08 - year then to do some kind of an
13:11 - unplugged activity all right so now
13:13 - let's go ahead and let's get moving here
13:15 - so here I am in lesson mode and like I
13:17 - said if you'd not sure how to get there
13:19 - there's many ways you just do from the
13:21 - classroom dashboard the CMI classrooms
13:23 - click on your classroom and then you'll
13:25 - see it'll populate right into this
13:27 - lesson mode here so here I am on lesson
13:30 - number one and what I'm going to do is
13:32 - I'm going to begin the lesson once I
13:35 - confirm begin lesson I want to show you
13:39 - what it looks like on the student side
13:41 - of it because I just think this is an
13:42 - important thing for you to be able to
13:45 - see here
13:48 - and you can see
13:53 - that oops just make sure I show this
13:55 - here you can see here that it says your
13:58 - teacher will unlock challenges shortly
14:00 - so that's just really to keep all of
14:01 - your students together we know how they
14:03 - do and you know how they like to get
14:05 - super ahead of themselves so this just
14:07 - really keeps everyone all together in
14:08 - one spot
14:12 - so let's head back to our teacher
14:14 - dashboard I'm sorry to our code monkey
14:18 - lessons and so I began a lesson you saw
14:23 - would it look like on the student side
14:25 - of it now let's go ahead and let's take
14:27 - a look at our lesson plans
14:33 - so I've actually already oh sorry
14:37 - hold on
14:42 - like I said sometimes these toolbars
14:44 - make it a little bit harder to navigate
14:45 - here so
14:47 - or work in here okay so you should be
14:49 - able to see here that I'm one lesson one
14:51 - so how did I do that I just accessed it
14:53 - from on the right-hand side where it
14:56 - said lessons and it pulled me up the
14:58 - specific PDF that matches with the
15:01 - lesson that we're going to so the first
15:03 - thing that we see here in the lesson is
15:04 - we see basically a summary about what
15:07 - this lesson is going to be about so take
15:08 - some time to read on their own I'm not
15:10 - going to read it with you today I feel
15:11 - like we're all pretty good at that
15:14 - remember the lesson plans are always
15:15 - just a guide and they're always designed
15:17 - to be about 45 minutes so if you're ever
15:19 - wondering about that that's kind of how
15:21 - each of the lessons are designed
15:24 - all right so here we are on the
15:26 - objectives and so what I do with my
15:28 - student objectives always have a coating
15:31 - or a tech notebook and so I have the
15:33 - students write down their objectives so
15:35 - we can know at the end of the day that
15:36 - we have reached our objectives or maybe
15:38 - we still need to work or kind of
15:40 - struggling on one so the students are
15:41 - writing these down so define coding and
15:43 - computer programming become familiar
15:46 - with the code monkey platform which
15:47 - we're going to do together and then
15:48 - we're going to work through challenges
15:49 - zero through five together so having
15:52 - those students write that down next I
15:56 - have these components here so the
15:57 - components under the teacher resources I
16:00 - will show you those in just a little bit
16:02 - but they do have these here so I have
16:04 - the students also do vocabulary work
16:06 - with these so I want them to know what
16:07 - the functions of step and turn what they
16:09 - actually mean so I have them draw a
16:10 - picture and then write an example of
16:12 - what it is in their notebooks it's
16:15 - always good for students to have extra
16:17 - resources because we all know they're
16:18 - very forgetful when they need to know
16:20 - different things so then the terms here
16:22 - that we're also going to be focusing on
16:23 - a challenge and what CoffeeScript means
16:26 - and we just
16:29 - coffeescript meet so you know that as
16:31 - well next we have our standards Zoey and
16:35 - my team will actually send you where
16:36 - this where you can find the specific
16:37 - standards but outside of here we do have
16:39 - a specific place that you can't find the
16:40 - standards if you're not wanting to go
16:41 - and hunt through the lesson plans
16:42 - themselves okay so we are going to go
16:46 - ahead and get started so here at the
16:48 - very very beginning there is an activity
16:52 - and it's an unplugged activity now I'm
16:55 - just kind of modified this a little bit
16:57 - for the sake of today and so this tells
17:00 - us to play a short game where you place
17:02 - an object in the room and so to do so
17:04 - what I do is I usually just display this
17:06 - on the board I kind of want all my
17:08 - students to kind of work through it
17:09 - together and kind of develop that kind
17:11 - of collaboration because coding is
17:13 - really not something it is something you
17:15 - do solo but really it's about like I
17:17 - said failing forward and kind of working
17:19 - through problems together and so here we
17:23 - will see we have our whiteboard and it's
17:26 - really important to have graph paper
17:27 - because you really want to know that
17:29 - it's an XY coordinate the code or the
17:32 - stage itself for instance an XY
17:35 - coordinate so you just want to kind of
17:36 - make sure that you're keeping with that
17:37 - and making sure that you're in twining
17:39 - that as much as possible so we're not
17:40 - just guessing where they go because we
17:43 - don't want our students to just guess
17:44 - either so here student a is facing the
17:47 - board and we want to count the steps I
17:51 - mean we want our student aid to move so
17:54 - we see here on the left hand side that I
17:56 - have a key that I want the kids to kind
18:00 - of follow step turn right to turn left
18:02 - and I also have that it's one square
18:04 - equals one step so that's also some
18:07 - graphic like messages I mean some
18:10 - there's also a key there to kind of
18:12 - interpret that okay so student a is
18:15 - facing the whiteboard
18:17 - and we want them to do something so here
18:20 - we want our student to turn right and
18:22 - then step the direction so when we count
18:25 - the squares we step five and then we
18:27 - always want to step the direction in
18:28 - which we face and then we step four
18:31 - because a computer not that this is my
18:33 - most favorite term I heard it from a
18:35 - Harvard professor and many coding
18:36 - professors they like to say that the
18:39 - computer doesn't have a brain so just
18:41 - something to think about they think
18:42 - about it as as teachers I hate this word
18:44 - being stupid and that we have to tell it
18:47 - what to do not my favorite term to use I
18:49 - just like to say that the computer can't
18:51 - think for itself so we need to give it
18:53 - the information for it to do it so here
18:55 - we are dictating the code for the
18:56 - students to see another algorithm as
18:58 - well
18:59 - TURN RIGHT step 5 turn left and step 4
19:02 - that's just kind of a way to kind of
19:04 - introduce that so we do that activity
19:06 - which we just took directly from the
19:08 - lesson plans nothing that like is any
19:10 - different it just kind of modified it
19:11 - instead of doing an object and I did it
19:13 - together on the board talks about next
19:16 - thing it talks about is the different
19:18 - languages which we just talked about and
19:19 - now we get into the play time so here
19:22 - this says for the students to log in and
19:24 - kind of play I don't ever introduce it
19:25 - like that and I'm not going to
19:28 - specifically assign them the challenges
19:29 - yet because I want to do something
19:31 - together so while my students are all
19:32 - sitting there we've solved this one
19:34 - unplug challenge on the board I bring
19:36 - all of them down to the carpet I'm gonna
19:37 - exit out of everything and I'm just
19:39 - gonna bring a student up that I know is
19:41 - not super strong not an expert coder I
19:44 - don't want an expert coder I want
19:45 - someone who the students trust and that
19:47 - if they make a mistake they have the
19:49 - ability could not be so flustered and
19:51 - figure out kind of what to do so I bring
19:53 - up a student the students name is
19:54 - Savannah she comes up to the board and I
19:56 - step back
19:57 - I'm completely just turned from a
20:00 - teacher into a facilitator I don't want
20:02 - I don't want me to be really involved in
20:05 - the picture at all so Savannah is gonna
20:08 - have to figure out what do I do
20:09 - what do I do here so I don't give her
20:12 - any guidance and I just let her take
20:14 - control I first the class is usually
20:16 - supermom until they figure out what to
20:18 - do so we get our solution here and now
20:22 - we move on to the next challenge now we
20:23 - saw that the run makes him run and then
20:27 - kind of what we do so this is all about
20:29 - failing forward there
20:31 - no wrong way to do it there's always a
20:34 - more concise way to do it but not really
20:35 - a wrong way to do it so she may see the
20:38 - directions there and do that she might
20:40 - figure out that she can use this ruler
20:41 - and measure the distance of however she
20:44 - wants to do it and so here when students
20:48 - are learning how to code they often will
20:49 - do it in two separate lines and I will
20:51 - not say one thing I'll just kind of let
20:53 - it happen and later it's gonna be more
20:55 - of a teachable moment here and now
20:57 - now there's two stars and they may start
20:59 - to pick up on it you'll see here that
21:00 - there's a little tip here and that Gordo
21:03 - is usually cheerleading or maybe
21:04 - introducing a concept as we go along so
21:06 - now the students are really getting
21:08 - confident they're really getting super
21:09 - excited and if she gets stuck I ask her
21:13 - to call on anyone in the crowd but they
21:15 - must give an explanation as to why why
21:18 - she should do what she should do just
21:20 - gives them really good way to like start
21:21 - really doing that procedural text
21:23 - writing or really just to get them to
21:26 - explain their thinking and so here she
21:29 - measures the distance and she figures it
21:31 - out and she gets to the end and
21:33 - challenges three and four it introduces
21:37 - the directionality so I'm not going to
21:39 - solve this challenge specifically with
21:41 - you because the students start to get
21:42 - the idea and I stop it too
21:46 - and I just want to note something on
21:47 - here because I think it's important one
21:49 - of my teacher ambassadors a student
21:51 - shared that with them and I didn't even
21:53 - notice this myself he's over here on the
21:55 - left hand side is a watch and so the
21:57 - watches just helps with the
21:58 - directionality for code monkey himself
22:00 - okay so I stopped at challenge number
22:03 - three and then now I'm going to move on
22:07 - to before I let them go I'm gonna
22:10 - introduce them into an algorithm now I'm
22:12 - very familiar with the code monkey
22:13 - platform so I want you to also be aware
22:15 - as well challenge five is a very
22:17 - challenging challenge for students even
22:22 - though it looks like it's super easy
22:23 - they have a hard time understanding that
22:25 - there's a certain amount of planning
22:27 - involved here
22:29 - okay so as the students are kind of
22:31 - going through this you can see I'm
22:34 - solving this with you but before I do
22:36 - this I'm going to introduce what an
22:40 - algorithm is because the students do
22:42 - need to know the sense of term it will
22:44 - retake about algorithm in lesson number
22:47 - two we're not going to do lesson number
22:49 - two for the sake of today but I did want
22:52 - to kind of show you that part of that
22:58 - okay so now I've done those challenges
23:00 - and now I want to talk to you about what
23:02 - an algorithm is so an algorithm is a
23:04 - recipe or I'm sure as you figured out
23:06 - right now kind of a set of directions
23:08 - what you put in is what you get out or
23:11 - you put something in and you get
23:12 - something else so think about like
23:13 - chocolate chip cookies they're they're
23:16 - not really cookies until I put them in
23:18 - the oven and when I get them out they're
23:20 - cookies and they're delicious not that
23:21 - I'm not the raw cookie dough isn't
23:23 - delicious but I just get a different
23:24 - result than what I put it and so we just
23:27 - solved challenge number five I love to
23:30 - use this video this is an algorithm
23:33 - video from BBC my team will share this
23:35 - with you I'm just going to play a little
23:37 - bit of the video so you can get an idea
23:39 - of what I like to share with my students
23:46 - if we want a computer to understand how
23:49 - to do something we need to give it an
23:51 - algorithm pick up first algorithm sounds
23:55 - like a big word doesn't it but actually
23:58 - an algorithm is something very simple
24:00 - but important to us an algorithm is a
24:05 - list of steps you'd give to computers to
24:07 - solve a problem or get something done
24:09 - imagine that you need to show someone or
24:12 - you brush your teeth to paint and learn
24:14 - how to do it themselves you would need
24:16 - to experience all the little steps you
24:18 - do in the right order to understand like
24:25 - this on the dis brush 3 or crush your
24:35 - teeth nicely 5 mention mice with water
24:39 - six smile it is important to explain the
24:43 - right steps in the right order so you
24:45 - can get great results
24:46 - [Music]
24:56 - okay a video that I like like I said a
25:00 - video that I like to use I'm kind of
25:03 - share with students I feel like even
25:04 - even middle school students liked this
25:07 - video because it's very explicit about
25:08 - what it what it's teaching there okay so
25:12 - we talked about what an algorithm is and
25:16 - then I'm going to now assign the
25:18 - challenges to my students so now if we
25:22 - go to what the student looks like I just
25:25 - like to show you this because I think it
25:27 - is important so you can understand where
25:30 - where we are
25:35 - now you can see that the student is no
25:38 - longer frozen that they can now continue
25:40 - and they only have access to those
25:42 - challenges that are within the lesson
25:44 - so just important to note oops sorry
25:47 - really so you didn't see that but now
25:49 - you can see that they are active here
25:51 - and that they have the ability to code
25:52 - and they're only going to do those
25:54 - challenges that are associated with the
25:56 - lessons themselves so now let's go back
26:01 - to our lesson that we are reviewing here
26:05 - okay so now we've done our playtime that
26:10 - it had for us to discuss and it talks
26:12 - about on the left about the stage so I
26:14 - we always suggest looking up the lesson
26:16 - plans before even if you're not a super
26:19 - strong coder it just gives you that
26:21 - really strong sense about what it is to
26:23 - do you know I know this we're always
26:25 - guilty of sometimes flying from the seat
26:27 - of our pants but it's really good and
26:28 - inefficient to check these out
26:30 - beforehand at least as a guide so we
26:32 - work through those challenges and then
26:34 - now we get to the debrief so what did
26:36 - you learn today what did you like most
26:38 - about coding adventure so just from Yui
26:39 - getting them excited challenges zero
26:41 - through ten are really just to get the
26:43 - students excited and familiar with the
26:44 - concepts we don't want to start off with
26:47 - something super super hard to begin with
26:48 - because then they're not going to want
26:50 - to continue ok so then I can end the
26:54 - playtime and once I end the playtime I
26:56 - can then mark
27:00 - chalant or mark this lesson as complete
27:03 - and when I do so it will grade this out
27:07 - now I'm still working in another lesson
27:09 - so I just have alright just have to make
27:12 - sure I end the lesson before I do that
27:14 - and then you'll see that it is marked as
27:16 - complete right down here so just
27:17 - something a kind of note alright so now
27:20 - let's get into lesson number three which
27:24 - is
27:26 - which is object-oriented programming I'm
27:29 - gonna move a little bit quicker through
27:30 - this because I think that first part
27:32 - really takes the most time and so then
27:33 - we're just going to kind of move through
27:35 - here so now I'm on challenge sorry I
27:37 - tend to do this mixes up but that's not
27:39 - what I mean
27:39 - lesson number three and we're going to
27:42 - do challenges 12 we're basically going
27:45 - to do challenges 11 through 15 and I'll
27:47 - show you exactly kind of what that looks
27:48 - like here in just a moment okay so I am
27:51 - going to go through object-oriented
27:54 - programming so here in the lessons
27:56 - themselves we have the same sort of
28:00 - setup the the objectives that we're
28:03 - doing here is what they were reviewing
28:05 - what they learned in previous a previous
28:07 - lesson we skipped lesson number two it's
28:10 - just the back half of that intro discuss
28:13 - the concept of planning which we just
28:15 - talked about the algorithm and then
28:17 - complete challenges 11 through 15 so
28:19 - here we're gonna introduce some brand
28:20 - new terms the turn to and the turtle
28:22 - step I always like to really talk about
28:23 - these with teachers and really talk
28:25 - about them with students because they
28:26 - really are very hard concepts for them
28:29 - to kind of understand same standards all
28:32 - that other kind of stuff here the
28:35 - activity in the room is to kind of play
28:37 - in this lesson is to play a game of like
28:41 - Simon Says where you put an object in
28:42 - the room and you have them turn
28:43 - specifically to that object like in a
28:46 - game of Simon Says so their only move
28:49 - when it says turn - so instead of
28:51 - turning right and turning left or
28:53 - turning a degree turn we're turning
28:55 - specifically to something like you do
28:56 - with your brain you turn so that you
28:58 - want to go out the door I'm up thinking
28:59 - oh I need to turn right turn left I
29:01 - think I need to go to the door and I
29:03 - need to walk out the door
29:05 - so same sort of concept here okay this
29:08 - one has them write down a map of how
29:11 - they get to school so what I usually do
29:12 - is I usually have them map out how I get
29:15 - from my classroom to the PE room or
29:17 - something like that
29:18 - in a very set by step directions this is
29:21 - a great place to do pair share with
29:23 - students and just being able to kind of
29:29 - share that information with them okay
29:33 - and then sharing that and they'll find
29:35 - out they have extra steps that are not
29:36 - needed we want them to have the shortest
29:38 - most concise set of directions to be
29:40 - able to go through so now this says
29:42 - let's go ahead and let's do play time
29:45 - and here this says have them work
29:47 - through challenges 11 through 15 with
29:48 - two stars we suggest the younger grades
29:51 - two stars and we suggest the older greys
29:53 - three stars so something to keep in mind
29:56 - we'll talk about that so let's look at
29:58 - challenge number 12 which is what this
29:59 - tells us to do so in our walkthrough so
30:02 - I'm gonna make sure I begin the lesson
30:03 - so the kids are seeing what I see and
30:05 - then I'm going to click challenge number
30:07 - 12 and we're going to solve this so here
30:10 - like I said I'm gonna do bug my
30:12 - challenge here and you'll see that I'm
30:14 - turning specifically to the object
30:16 - you'll also see here along the bottom in
30:18 - introduction to the buttons the buttons
30:21 - don't type they don't they're not
30:23 - drag-and-drop they just type out for
30:24 - students it really helps for those
30:27 - students with special needs dyslexia or
30:30 - ll learners or even those students that
30:32 - just are not great spellers so they're
30:34 - not tied down anything with the white
30:36 - text next to it also types out so just
30:38 - something to keep in mind so here I
30:40 - don't want to turn to the banana I want
30:41 - to turn to the bridge and then I want to
30:44 - turn specifically to the banana you'll
30:47 - see here that I did not fully solve this
30:49 - yet but you do see how he specifically
30:51 - is now turning to an object this syntax
30:54 - things sometimes can be an issue for
30:55 - students or just making sure that they
30:57 - check their syntax is kind of important
31:00 - and then before moving on what is an
31:04 - object tab this is pretty important I
31:06 - visited like I said a lot of classrooms
31:08 - and talked with a lot of students and
31:10 - you know as we're kind of moving through
31:12 - this they just really don't understand
31:16 - this concept so I'm going to do
31:18 - something here at the top and you can
31:22 - notice there's something different about
31:23 - the code here
31:26 - okay so we have the turtle moving how do
31:29 - we get the turtle to move well the
31:31 - computer automatically assumes member
31:33 - has it only has the brain for what we
31:35 - have here that the monkey is the main
31:37 - character so the monkey is who's running
31:40 - or this set of challenges is the monkey
31:43 - who is the main I mean is the main
31:45 - character which is the monkey and the
31:47 - monkey is the one who's doing the moving
31:49 - so we don't have to tell the computer
31:50 - every single time it is not wrong if we
31:53 - do that okay but it is not necessary so
31:58 - here we have the turtle moving if I
32:00 - don't have this object tag here you'll
32:03 - see that the monkey just continues
32:04 - moving so we have to tell the computer
32:06 - who needs to move this is a very
32:10 - abstract concept for our students to
32:12 - understand so it's important for you to
32:13 - also see that too that we just need to
32:16 - associate what the object tag is
32:18 - themselves so I always show them this
32:20 - before because it's just very tricky and
32:22 - it's very hard to understand if you're
32:23 - not understanding okay well I just see
32:25 - that there I know it needs to but why
32:27 - does it because the computer needs to
32:28 - know if you don't have the period there
32:31 - the computer also doesn't know what to
32:33 - do so we have to make sure that we
32:34 - associate the object tab with what's
32:37 - moving okay after I do that then I
32:40 - assign the challenges to them and when I
32:43 - assign the challenges to them
32:47 - I can I'm just going to refresh this
32:49 - really quickly
33:00 - when I sign the challenges to them they
33:02 - will only have access to those specific
33:04 - challenges now normally this is grayed
33:06 - out but my Internet's a little getting a
33:08 - little sometimes with the zoom it gets a
33:10 - little tricky so it's not that it
33:13 - doesn't it does work in its full way I'm
33:16 - just my Internet's a little shaky right
33:17 - now so but so let's talk about the
33:20 - classroom dashboard and how we track
33:22 - students progress so here in the dash
33:25 - this is the student progress page here
33:27 - on the progress page it is a teacher's
33:30 - best friend it's your best friend why is
33:32 - it your best friend because it contains
33:33 - all the answers to everything you don't
33:34 - have to go hunting or fishing or trying
33:36 - to figure out any of those kinds of
33:38 - things this contains all the answers
33:39 - here here you can see when I do the
33:42 - limit progress based on the lessons
33:44 - taught you'll see that now it's only has
33:47 - access to the lessons for which I want
33:49 - them to be doing just then that way it
33:53 - just kind of keeps everyone on the same
33:54 - thing when I hit free play it will kind
33:57 - of open it will open it up completely to
33:59 - them okay so you're looking at these
34:01 - stars we talked about the Stars
34:03 - what do the stars even mean so a 3 star
34:05 - solution is the shortest most concise
34:07 - code a 2 star solution means that they
34:09 - took an extra step to get there and a 1
34:11 - star solution means they were able to
34:13 - get the banana or get the object that
34:15 - they needed to but they just really were
34:16 - not understanding that concept I like to
34:19 - call those students to struggle bus so
34:22 - here how do I figure out even what the
34:24 - answer is so up here in green are all of
34:26 - the three star solutions to every single
34:28 - challenge so you're not like I said not
34:30 - having to go to hunt you know and that
34:31 - student comes up to you and you're
34:32 - panicked and you're like I don't know
34:35 - why don't you phone a friend you don't
34:36 - need a phone to friend have all the
34:37 - answers right here for you ok
34:41 - also if a student is struggling you can
34:43 - click on it see how many times they
34:44 - attempted a challenge and you can see
34:46 - the answer in real time how they solved
34:50 - it really creating that authentic
34:51 - conversation many times I've used this
34:54 - when my kids are struggling and I look
34:56 - at their code and I think to myself mmm
34:57 - I don't really know I come back and I
34:59 - look at my solution and I compare it to
35:00 - theirs and then I can really have that
35:02 - conversation to really see what it is
35:04 - that they're kind of meeting so the
35:06 - limit progress is really important you
35:08 - can limit it based on a lesson that
35:09 - you're taught you can do free
35:10 - or you can just do a very specific one
35:13 - and you'll see that they have no access
35:15 - to that beyond their okay so we worked
35:20 - through the second lesson and really
35:22 - like really showing them what they need
35:24 - to do here I just want to note this
35:27 - since we landed here that this is an
35:29 - assessment challenge it means that
35:30 - there's no pre-built goat code and it's
35:32 - taking what they've learned prior and
35:35 - applying the application here okay
35:39 - all right
35:43 - so here at the end of the play time
35:47 - there is also this debrief and this is
35:50 - doing challenge 14 which we just did
35:52 - together which is the object text so
35:53 - just something to kind of keep in mind
35:56 - there all right so what coding concepts
35:59 - did we learn the step the turn that turn
36:03 - to and the turtle step something I want
36:10 - to mention really quickly is about the
36:13 - coding concepts they are all listed here
36:15 - at the top I like to call them units but
36:17 - they're really coding concepts so first
36:19 - we do our stepping and turning our turn
36:21 - to turtle the times loop and then
36:24 - variables okay so kind of moves through
36:27 - there so I wanted to show you actually
36:29 - on a challenge itself here how we kind
36:33 - of understand how that matches itself so
36:35 - here we have a story map in each world
36:37 - with an Astoria map has its own concept
36:39 - of which the students are going through
36:41 - so just something there as well okay so
36:46 - I'm just going to quick talk about skill
36:48 - mode so skill mode is an extra
36:51 - reinforcement of skills you saw it right
36:53 - here on the story map you can access it
36:55 - here or from the main screen it's
36:57 - basically a reinforcement of skills so
36:59 - you have a student who is really really
37:01 - advanced and you need to differentiate
37:03 - for them you can put them in a skill
37:04 - mode and skill mode opens up after the
37:07 - end of each coding concept the students
37:09 - have learned it just as a deeper dive
37:10 - into that or if students are really
37:12 - struggling like when students do
37:13 - variables I highly highly suggest that
37:15 - you use the skill mode for them there
37:18 - okay so now we're going to move on to
37:22 - our news and notes here I know that was
37:24 - pretty quick
37:25 - a little intro into everything but I did
37:29 - want to talk about our newest courses
37:30 - that we have so our newest course here
37:32 - is the banana tails and banana tails is
37:35 - a Python course for students in the
37:38 - older grades grades 5 through 8 it's
37:42 - really a deeper duck it's very similar
37:44 - to coding adventure and that it moves
37:45 - through a map but it does work in full
37:48 - Python we also have cody code monkey
37:50 - junior which the all the teacher has
37:53 - been raving about it all four
37:54 - ambassadors you're super jazzed about it
37:56 - is a
37:57 - based coding Pro our course in which
38:00 - students work through sequencing and
38:02 - loops and this is for our preschool to
38:04 - early kindergarten age students okay so
38:08 - let's go ahead and let's review our
38:10 - objectives that we went over today how
38:12 - to run a lesson in your classroom with
38:14 - coding adventure an intro into coding
38:17 - adventure what CoffeeScript was we
38:20 - talked about coding adventure using
38:21 - lesson mode what it is the interface the
38:24 - lessons we've did lessons one in lesson
38:27 - three how to track your student progress
38:29 - where to find the coding concepts what
38:32 - skill mode is any news and notes and now
38:34 - we're gonna leave some time here for a
38:36 - Q&A but before I do that I just want to
38:38 - briefly briefly mention something and
38:40 - then we'll leave some time here over
38:42 - here on the right hand side our teacher
38:45 - resources something that I like to
38:49 - mention is the coding concepts such as
38:50 - what I talked about earlier where you
38:51 - can find those vocabulary for stepping
38:53 - and turning and then there's all kinds
38:56 - of like video tutorials and things to
38:57 - just kind of note so I highly recommend
38:59 - looking through that I think it's very
39:00 - beneficial for you there's a lot of
39:03 - resources that you're probably unsure of
39:05 - there okay yes there are okay so now I'm
39:12 - gonna leave some time for Q&A so you can
39:14 - leave it in the chat box and I'm just
39:17 - gonna go to the Q&A here so if you have
39:23 - any questions please put it into the
39:27 - chat box there so I have one question
39:29 - here are there lesson plans available
39:31 - for the trial version as well there are
39:33 - they're just going to be a limited
39:35 - version because you don't have access to
39:37 - all the challenges it will it will give
39:39 - you the lessons - challenge number 30 a
39:42 - well and more question where can I find
39:44 - the unplugged coding activity so the
39:46 - unplugged coding activities are located
39:50 - in the lesson plans they're always in
39:51 - the intro they're not specifically
39:54 - listed like on their own but they are
39:55 - right there in the beginning
39:58 - so that's nice there okay
40:04 - suade a couple so that's a great
40:11 - question so what grades is coding
40:14 - adventure recommended for coding
40:16 - adventure is recommended as for grades 3
40:18 - through 8 I personally just find that
40:22 - with second grade it gets a little bit
40:23 - tricky with the variables but they
40:24 - absolutely can do it I've worked with
40:26 - many students as far as that goes
40:29 - and then how many classes can you set up
40:33 - you can set up however many classes you
40:35 - want most of the subscriptions that we
40:38 - have are based on students seats so it's
40:40 - just dependent on how many you put in a
40:42 - in a classroom but the max for each
40:45 - classroom is 50 this next question
40:50 - assuming previous coding experience
40:51 - where should it greater start I always
40:53 - suggest that they start from the
40:55 - beginning because you really want to get
40:56 - them intertwined in the platform itself
41:00 - and making sure that they understand but
41:03 - they'll move pretty quickly through the
41:05 - first like at least 30 challenges once
41:07 - they get to variables that tends to be
41:08 - pretty tricky for them but that's where
41:10 - I would start with them it's just
41:11 - definitely start them from the beginning
41:13 - and it's fine if they move pretty
41:14 - quickly through that first part of
41:17 - coding adventure Wanda we will send you
41:21 - a follow-up internment and follow-up
41:23 - regarding your question um this program
41:28 - is for grades its program is for k2 a
41:31 - our code code monkey junior is for the
41:35 - younger ages and then you can start some
41:37 - parts of coding adventure pretty early
41:39 - there is like a scope and thing so if
41:40 - you're interested we can definitely help
41:42 - you with that
41:45 - great question Brian had a question in
41:48 - FreePlay he said I understand that
41:51 - students can work through all of the
41:53 - lessons is that correct it is correct
41:56 - unless you limit them then they can move
42:00 - freely just keep in mind that it is does
42:02 - move in a linear manner so they cannot
42:05 - skip around or anything like that as a
42:08 - teacher you have the ability to skip
42:10 - around and access things but they cannot
42:13 - they have to move in a linear pattern
42:17 - this is a really great question does
42:20 - grade level really matter if they have
42:22 - never coded before no it does not
42:25 - we we do not base it on that we I like
42:32 - to think and we like to think of coding
42:34 - as a language like if you're learning
42:35 - Spanish in kindergarten and if you're
42:37 - learning Spanish like an old lady like
42:39 - me you will still learn Spanish in the
42:42 - same way so we there is no we don't
42:46 - really like to say that there is a grade
42:49 - requirement I have another question the
42:56 - teacher assigns the lessons or it runs
42:59 - on students levels so if you assign the
43:03 - lesson to them then they only are
43:05 - working with you in that lesson mode to
43:07 - the specific set of challenges that are
43:09 - in the lesson itself and then so that's
43:19 - kind of how that goes and then it does
43:21 - it does if you want them to have free
43:23 - play like if you want them to just move
43:25 - at their own level then you wouldn't you
43:28 - don't have to limit any progress they
43:30 - can just kind of move along as they go
43:33 - okay so you have any questions I see
43:39 - that there's a couple more questions
43:40 - we'll try to get to your answers after
43:42 - today's webinar we want to honor your
43:44 - time thank you so much for spending time
43:46 - with us today directly following this as
43:49 - soon as we end the webinar you will
43:50 - receive a feedback form and in the
43:55 - feedback form
43:58 - we'll pop up with a after you complete
44:03 - the feedback form you'll receive your
44:04 - professional development certificate so
44:07 - just to kind of keep that aware all
44:09 - unanswered questions will answer you by
44:11 - email so we'll follow up with you after
44:13 - today's webinar thank you again so much
44:15 - for joining us thank you Talia and Zoe
44:17 - for taking on the questions and
44:18 - answering me with being so late there
44:21 - and thank all of you for spending your
44:23 - time with us today remember to write
44:24 - code catch bananas and save the world
