03:41 - code monkey I also have taught in the
03:45 - classroom work with many students across
03:47 - the k-8 spanha even taught second grade
03:49 - and fourth grade and worked with sixth
03:51 - graders so I look quite a bit of
03:52 - students so if you have any questions or
03:55 - anything feel free to reach out to me
03:57 - here is my contact information I do have

04:04 - today but we do have Talia she's joining
04:07 - us from our Israel from Israel and then
04:10 - we have Molly who is joining us from
04:12 - Colorado so we're kind of all over the
04:13 - country just like you guys are and I am
04:15 - from Austin Texas so thank you so I'm
04:19 - just gonna start off first by telling a
04:22 - little bit about code monkey had a code
04:24 - monkey get started so in 2014 our
04:27 - founder
04:29 - Jonathan launched code monkey after
04:32 - working with students um he is a
04:34 - computer scientist and he started
04:35 - working with kids like you and realized
04:37 - that they just didn't really like to
04:39 - learn code coding in the same boring old
04:42 - way so that's how code monkey was born
04:44 - so it's fun it's gamified it's really
04:47 - designed for you to be able to have a
04:50 - lot of fun while you're learning how to
04:52 - cope and we use real programming
04:56 - languages so today we're gonna kind of
04:58 - get kick-started here so in the chat box
05:01 - I would like for you to rate yourself on
05:06 - a scale of one to three so one being I'm
05:10 - a superb coder - I'm kind of in the
05:13 - middle and three I'm not so good yet at
05:15 - coding but I'm on the right track
05:17 - so if you could take a minute really
05:18 - quickly to pop into the chat box a one
05:21 - Rockstar coder - in the middle three I'm
05:25 - on my way with still learning
05:30 - oh good I like the 2.5 that's a good one
05:32 - oh hi Thomas thanks for joining us from
05:39 - Columbia you're far away away from me
05:42 - alright good so it looks at me I kind of
05:44 - have an in-betweener here and that's
05:46 - perfect and that's great so today we're
05:48 - gonna be working with our beaver
05:49 - achiever of course it is our block-based
05:51 - course we won't be working with anything
05:54 - text-based today if you are I saw one of
05:57 - you were in sixth grade
05:59 - you should definitely join us tomorrow
06:00 - for our game builder or webinar all
06:03 - right so we're gonna do an unplugged
06:04 - activity we're work on some coding
06:06 - vocabulary and then we're gonna work
06:08 - with our beaver
06:08 - achiever in the chatbox really quickly
06:12 - of or not in the chat box if you could
06:14 - raise your hand if you have your own log
06:17 - in for code monkey
06:20 - you
06:22 - you
06:24 - okay great so some you do some of you
06:28 - don't and that's perfect I'm just kind
06:30 - of getting a feel for kind of where you
06:31 - guys are so actually today I would like
06:34 - for you to not be logged into your own
06:36 - account if you're a teacher
06:37 - feel free to go ahead and be logged in
06:39 - but if you're a student please make sure
06:40 - that you are logged out of your account
06:42 - and we'll give you a username and
06:43 - password to use for today so that you
06:45 - can have the same ability as everyone
06:47 - else so we can explore some different
06:48 - challenges today all right so the first
06:52 - thing that we're going to do is I'm
06:53 - going to ask you to be interactive in
06:54 - our chat box here today and we are going
06:57 - to do an unplugged activity so we have
06:59 - what we can see here on a grid so I want
07:02 - you to think about the grid as one one
07:06 - movement we have a few of the directions
07:09 - that we can step and our goal here is
07:11 - that we want to get student a to our
07:16 - ball so to do so we can use the
07:19 - following oops the following directions
07:22 - here up step turn right and turn left so
07:27 - I want you to think about when you're
07:29 - turning your body left so we are facing
07:30 - in the same direction currently right
07:32 - now I am as student a I'm facing my
07:35 - white board and I want you to in the
07:37 - directions in the chat box I want you to
07:41 - write out the directions that you think
07:43 - we should take to get student a to the
07:45 - ball and with coding we always face in
07:50 - the direction of which we're moving so I
07:52 - want you to think about that about how
07:54 - that should go so I'm gonna have a
07:56 - couple I'm gonna give you guys a couple
07:58 - of minutes and I want you to tell me
07:59 - what our first step or you can write out
08:02 - the steps in the chat box themselves
08:05 - what step you think we should take first
08:08 - from our code over here on the Left we
08:11 - have step turn right turn left
08:14 - oh okay so everyone is saying we should
08:17 - turn right first that is correct we want
08:19 - to turn right so we can turn the
08:21 - direction in which we so we can face the
08:23 - direction in which we want to walk so
08:25 - now that we're turning in the correct
08:27 - direction what should we do next
08:33 - oh okay I see step I see some people
08:36 - just say a certain just stepping I see
08:39 - some people giving me a number great
08:43 - okay great thank you guys for being so
08:45 - interactive Ian I see that you said step
08:51 - five or will you said Step five Paul you
08:55 - said step four alright so let's go ahead
08:58 - and let's see where we think we should
09:00 - move so those of you that said Step five
09:03 - awesome you guys did a really great job
09:05 - but he said step four there's nothing
09:07 - wrong with that we just would find
09:09 - ourselves just a little bit short of
09:10 - where we want to go so now that we step
09:13 - five what happens next okay I see some
09:24 - really good directions here we are going
09:26 - to we made it we Step five we counted
09:29 - from where we were one two three four
09:32 - and five and now I see that we're gonna
09:34 - turn
09:35 - whoops sorry turn left so that we can
09:37 - that is correct
09:39 - face up or face the direction in which
09:42 - we want to go so Thomas really great job
09:44 - okay and then I see everyone giving me
09:46 - these directions you guys are on it
09:47 - today
09:48 - great and then now we're gonna need to
09:49 - do something so we're gonna have to step
09:53 - if we just count nothing is going to
09:55 - happen so we're gonna have to step
09:57 - whoops and we're gonna step four this
10:01 - time so one two three and four and now
10:05 - we've gotten to the ball so first we
10:07 - turned right then we stepped five and
10:11 - then we turn left and we stepped four so
10:15 - in this case basically what we did here
10:17 - is we created an algorithm so an
10:20 - algorithm is a set of steps to solve a
10:24 - problem so anytime that you're kind of
10:27 - creating a plan of action I like to say
10:30 - that means that you are creating a set
10:32 - of steps to solve a problem so in this
10:34 - one we solved the problem together so
10:35 - congratulations you guys just did your
10:37 - first vocabulary term so another
10:41 - vocabulary term that we also did is we
10:43 - had a sequence so we can see here that
10:46 - we have a specific sequence in which we
10:48 - went we didn't step five before we
10:51 - turned right so we go line by line and
10:53 - that's part of a sequence also today
10:57 - we're going to be working on a loop
11:04 - joy great question but I'm actually just
11:06 - gonna kind of leave it as it is say just
11:08 - for kind of like privacy reasons and
11:09 - things like that but I might as a good
11:11 - point so now that we are kind of going
11:17 - here we're going to talk about what a
11:19 - loop is and so Oh
11:28 - good question joy so on you guys's chat
11:30 - box I forgot to share with you you will
11:32 - you should be able to see here for on my
11:34 - chat box yours might be a little bit
11:36 - different but you can say to all
11:37 - panelists or you can change it to all
11:39 - panelists and attendees if you would
11:41 - like other people to see your directions
11:43 - either way works for me okay
11:46 - so a loop is something that is going to
11:48 - repeat over and over so we're gonna take
11:50 - a look at that today in our beaver
11:52 - achiever activity and kind of go from
11:55 - there
11:55 - so I'm gonna do this with you because
11:57 - the last webinar we did together many
12:00 - people were kind of struggling so what I
12:02 - want you to do is I'm on the same screen
12:04 - as you guys you guys are in a zoom
12:05 - screen so if you're in a zoom screen
12:08 - like me you're gonna need to open up
12:10 - your web browser so if you're using it
12:12 - if you're using a desktop computer or a
12:15 - Chromebook or anything like that you'll
12:17 - just need to open another web browser so
12:20 - to do so I'm going to open my browser
12:23 - and you'll see I'm actually already in a
12:26 - browser so I'm gonna stay where I am and
12:28 - what you're gonna do is you're going to
12:31 - go to code monkey comm so we're going to
12:33 - help you out and we're gonna put code
12:36 - monkey into the box here and you can
12:37 - actually just click this link and when
12:40 - you click the link it's going to take
12:41 - you exactly where you need to go
12:46 - so I want you to raise your hand when
12:49 - you're there with me so I can just kind
12:52 - of know that you're ready to login and
12:54 - we're ready to enter that username and
12:55 - password into the box
12:59 - you
13:06 - okay Hanna and Isaac are you guys with
13:10 - me yet if you are if you could just
13:11 - raise your hand and in so I can know
13:14 - that you're there will
13:18 - it's kind of waiting to make sure that
13:21 - everyone's there if you're not sure and
13:23 - you're that's fine if some of you are
13:25 - just kind of following along with me but
13:26 - if you're not sure you can just click on
13:27 - this link right here and it will open in
13:29 - a new window for you okay amazing
13:33 - awesome you guys are rocking it today
13:35 - okay so now what you're gonna do is
13:38 - you're gonna enter in webinar one and
13:41 - the password is also webinar 1 so if you
13:45 - need to copy if you need a copy and
13:47 - paste if you need a copy and paste
13:50 - Natalya has put it in our chat box for
13:53 - you so you can just quickly copy that
13:55 - and paste it into the box for you and
13:57 - I'm gonna do exactly the same as you are
13:59 - as well just so you guys can kind of see
14:02 - what that looks like
14:18 - Thomas just making sure that if you
14:21 - can't and you're still trying to kind of
14:23 - do it are you using Thomas are you using
14:25 - an iPad or using a Chromebook or a
14:27 - laptop that kind of makes a difference
14:29 - sometimes a little bit too
14:35 - okay so when you're in the iPad
14:37 - unfortunately it's a little bit trickier
14:39 - to do the zoom is its own app so
14:42 - unfortunately you'd have to close out
14:44 - the app and then kind of do it from
14:46 - there so if you find that you're stuck
14:50 - you might just want to kind of follow
14:51 - along with us and stay with us and then
14:53 - afterwards try to practice it it's a
14:55 - little bit trickier sometimes with the
14:57 - iPad to kind of do two screens so just
15:00 - hang out with us and we'll kind of
15:01 - follow along and we'll kind of go from
15:02 - there okay all right awesome
15:05 - okay so here we are on the code monkey
15:08 - homepage and you guys are gonna be able
15:11 - to use this account with me today and so
15:14 - what I want you to do is I want you to
15:15 - scroll to where it says block-based
15:18 - beginner and I would like you to click
15:21 - on the beaver achiever the very first
15:23 - one it says sequencing and loops you
15:26 - can't find it just look for the viewer
15:27 - with the log in his mouth okay so just I
15:38 - know that some of you are kind of trying
15:41 - to get there with me so if you are there
15:43 - with me if you could just go ahead and
15:45 - raise your hand I know some of you are
15:47 - just kind of following along so not a
15:48 - big deal but those of you that are
15:50 - students and you can go ahead and raise
15:51 - your hand so I know if I need to wait
15:52 - for you or kind of give you a little bit
15:54 - more time
15:57 - great you guys are just rockin and
16:00 - rollin today so great so all of our code
16:03 - monkey courses I always have some kind
16:06 - of a story so what do you what is this
16:13 - story here for our beaver so the beaver
16:15 - wants to be able to go swimming he sees
16:18 - that there is no swimming so what does
16:20 - he do he decides he wants to create a
16:23 - dam so that he can actually kind of go
16:26 - from there so in this course here we're
16:28 - gonna drag and drop our log to be able
16:33 - to fill the hole here so some things
16:37 - that I like to point out when we're kind
16:38 - of looking at this at this here is we
16:40 - have our beaver he's hanging out we see
16:42 - there's a hole in the dam and we need to
16:44 - fix it so we have to kind of figure out
16:46 - what we want to do we can also something
16:48 - else to notice is that each one of these
16:51 - rows with the logs is one and we're
16:55 - gonna either be moving just like we
16:57 - practice in our warm-up and our
16:58 - unplugged activity we're either going to
17:00 - moving right or we're gonna be moving
17:01 - left so the first thing I want us to do
17:05 - together is I want us to drag the log
17:08 - and connect it with the when play
17:12 - so to make our beaver move or to make
17:16 - this code run we have to click our play
17:20 - button and I have the sound turned off
17:22 - you guys feel free to turn your sound
17:24 - off when you have it connected and you
17:26 - click the play button will see that
17:28 - he'll drop his log
17:30 - and now the dam is fixed
17:34 - all right so we did that first intro one
17:37 - and we got a solution and that's
17:39 - repeating back to us we've got a three
17:40 - star which means that we did the
17:42 - shortest most concise code that we could
17:44 - do
17:47 - all right so now I want you guys to
17:50 - click on the story map up here and when
17:53 - you click on the story map I want you to
17:55 - skip to challenge number five with me so
17:59 - click on challenge number five
18:02 - so remember you click on the story map
18:05 - and we skip to challenge number five
18:12 - Rosanna I will answer your question I
18:14 - hope I'm saying your name correctly but
18:16 - I'll answer your question here at the
18:17 - end with everybody together okay now we
18:20 - can see there's a little bit more that
18:22 - we kind of have to do here so I would
18:25 - like you in the chat box or by raising
18:30 - your hand
18:36 - be able to tell me what should we do
18:39 - oh I did say your name right cool very
18:41 - cool that's very lucky move for me here
18:43 - so in the chat box if you could just
18:45 - please drop in what you think we should
18:47 - do here I see some people saying some
18:49 - things you can go ahead and tell me what
18:52 - I should do
18:56 - oh you guys are man you guys are rock
18:58 - star rock stars okay so I see a couple
19:00 - of things here the first person first
19:03 - thing that you guys are telling me is
19:04 - that we need to drop the lock
19:06 - okay so let's drop it I always like to
19:09 - debug as I go so I am going to test this
19:12 - out and just see if I was correct and
19:14 - you guys are so smart you guys thought
19:16 - this so you can see here that there is
19:18 - an ability to have a super hint here so
19:21 - if we are stuck and we're kind of
19:22 - working through and we need or she kind
19:24 - of what I like to call the struggle bus
19:26 - we're not really sure what to do we can
19:28 - go ahead and click on need a hint so
19:30 - then the next thing that you guys are
19:32 - telling me to do is that I need to move
19:34 - left okay so we're seeing that there's
19:36 - an arrow here and we need to move left
19:37 - so we're going to go in the same
19:38 - direction using our left hand where we
19:42 - want him to go and we see need to move
19:44 - and then I see you guys telling me that
19:46 - I need to have a double drop well let's
19:50 - test it out and let's see if we are
19:51 - getting there
19:54 - you're gonna make it
19:58 - awesome okay so we are gonna get a
20:02 - solution here and the solution is going
20:04 - to tell us if we got the shortest code
20:06 - or if we probably need to do a little
20:08 - bit of work so you guys are doing in
20:10 - phenomenal job
20:14 - okay the next thing I'm going to ask you
20:16 - guys is if you have a microphone
20:19 - connected to your computer if you could
20:21 - please just raise your hand just so I
20:24 - know I might call on a couple of you to
20:25 - answer this next one
20:28 - you
20:30 - so if you do just go ahead and raise
20:32 - your hand so I know that you have a mic
20:34 - if you don't have a mic no big deal just
20:35 - leave your hand not raised okay great
20:39 - I'm gonna leave your hands raised so I
20:40 - can call on you hopefully for the next
20:42 - one okay so now we're gonna go again to
20:46 - our story map ooh I see you guys are
20:47 - progressing movin and groovin here
20:49 - without me so I would like for you to go
20:55 - ahead and this time we're gonna click on
20:58 - challenge number 15 so we're gonna move
21:01 - along and then we're gonna try something
21:03 - and go to my favorite course of
21:05 - superachiever which i think you guys are
21:06 - going to love as well
21:10 - okay so do you guys remember in our when
21:15 - we're talking about vocabulary we talked
21:17 - about a loop so I'm gonna go back one I
21:20 - want you guys to stay on challenge 15
21:22 - but I'm gonna go back one here and we're
21:25 - gonna talk about a loop here so a loop
21:30 - means that we are doing something over
21:31 - and over and over again and here we see
21:34 - that we kind of have a pattern we are
21:37 - going to move right and drop a log we're
21:42 - gonna move right drop a log and move
21:44 - right and drop a lock so Hanna I'm gonna
21:48 - allow you to talk and I want you to tell
21:50 - me what you think we should do to solve
21:53 - this specific challenge
21:57 - okay Hanna I'm gonna unmute you
22:03 - oh is it working
22:07 - okay let's see if I can
22:10 - okay Hanna you should be able to talk so
22:13 - you should see a microphone kind of like
22:15 - how you can see online here and you'll
22:17 - be able to unmute yourself
22:21 - you can't if you could just Hannah tell
22:24 - me how you think we can solve this in
22:26 - the chat box that will work - oh I see
22:28 - you there okay you hear me I can hear
22:32 - you okay okay I already did this oh man
22:40 - you're moving way too fast
22:42 - okay move left again drop - and so the
22:48 - oddness challenge so I'm challenge 414
22:50 - the same challenge that I'm on should we
22:54 - move to wait 14 yeah no sorry that's
22:59 - okay
22:59 - oh yeah okay then moves right drop one
23:04 - right draw right drop one okay so move
23:08 - right drop one right drop one okay so
23:13 - let's go ahead and let's run this watch
23:16 - to check this out okay
23:19 - now using that vocabulary that we use do
23:23 - you think there's another way that we
23:24 - could solve this using something else we
23:27 - have here
23:30 - yeah the loop okay
23:34 - so you see we've got a 1-star solution
23:36 - so we could use the loop so what can we
23:38 - so if we pull this loop out here it
23:40 - tells us how many times we want to do
23:41 - something so we have a pattern sort of a
23:44 - blocks here do you agree
23:45 - mm-hmm okay so what can we eliminate and
23:49 - put inside of our loop block
23:52 - a little move right okay so we can put
23:57 - the move I'm just gonna get rid of these
23:58 - here so you can put the move right and
24:00 - then what else should we do a drop okay
24:03 - so let's put the drop in and then I need
24:06 - to connect it that's why it's all grayed
24:07 - out right and then I'll hit the play
24:09 - button and what kind of solution do you
24:13 - think we're going to do with this
24:17 - you
24:21 - awesome thank you so much Hanna what a
24:25 - rockstar
24:25 - okay I'm gonna mute you now okay all
24:29 - right
24:31 - all right awesome job again I thank you
24:34 - so much for helping us okay great
24:36 - awesome so on challenge 15 somebody
24:40 - asked me how long this is gonna be we're
24:41 - gonna go just a little bit over our 30
24:43 - minutes though we'll have some time to
24:45 - kind of go through we're gonna do one
24:46 - more on this one and then we're gonna go
24:47 - to my favorite course of Beaver achiever
24:50 - with the smoothie making so that's my
24:52 - favorite one
24:52 - okay so learning what we did with Hannah
24:56 - Rose on I see that you have a microphone
25:00 - as well so I'm gonna unmute you and if
25:02 - you can also unmute yourself you're able
25:05 - to talk you can tell you can walk us
25:07 - through what to do here
25:12 - oh oh hear me I can hear you okay okay
25:16 - challenge fifteen you said mm-hmm
25:19 - challenge fifteen can you walk me
25:20 - through this guy repeat four times okay
25:25 - repeat four times move left move left
25:30 - drop
25:32 - okay drop how many drops should I have
25:37 - um - okay - okay
25:44 - so let's check this out and let's see
25:46 - what we get here
25:50 - Rosanna what grade are you in
25:52 - Oh fits okay well and where are you
25:58 - joining us from New Jersey
26:01 - Spottswoode oh wow okay cool awesome all
26:08 - right awesome great job
26:09 - okay I'm gonna mute you okay okay all
26:12 - right awesome thank you so much for
26:13 - doing that for us okay
26:16 - so we see here that we got a three star
26:19 - solution on this challenge you guys are
26:22 - rocking and rolling so that means to me
26:24 - that you guys are ready for the next
26:25 - step so I want you guys to follow along
26:27 - with me so now that we are rockin and
26:30 - rollin we know what a loop is we were
26:33 - able to use it and kind of see the
26:34 - pattern that we were kind of working
26:36 - with there is another way to solve this
26:38 - challenge as well but we I'll let you
26:40 - guys figure that out on your own and
26:41 - challenge ourselves to try a new way to
26:43 - solve this one what we're gonna do to go
26:45 - back to our screen is we're going to
26:46 - click on our little code monkey face
26:48 - over here
26:51 - and I'll just take a minute because I'm
26:53 - sharing my screen so it's a little bit
26:55 - slower than yours will be and then we're
26:57 - gonna go down to Beaver and we're gonna
26:59 - click on our beaver achiever with the
27:01 - smoothies because this guy is my fave
27:03 - okay and now what we're gonna do is
27:06 - we're gonna click start coding and when
27:09 - you guys are logged in us as students
27:11 - just know that you won't be able to move
27:13 - around like we're moving around right
27:15 - now this is just a special for this
27:17 - webinar okay alright so now in this one
27:21 - the beaver
27:22 - wants to be able to make some money so
27:24 - he knows that the more likes that he
27:26 - gets on his page the more people are
27:28 - gonna come and visit him here so let's
27:30 - go ahead and we're gonna start playing
27:31 - here okay
27:33 - so this one is a little bit different
27:35 - than the one that we have done
27:36 - previously because we're done we're not
27:39 - filling the dam this one we're actually
27:41 - gonna make smoothies so I'm gonna do the
27:42 - first one and then I'm gonna call on
27:44 - those of you that have your hands raised
27:46 - with the microphone just remember if you
27:48 - have a microphone and you would like to
27:49 - participate just go ahead and raise your
27:51 - hand and we'll call on you okay alright
27:53 - so we have our monkey and so we can see
27:57 - that the monkey likes bananas and we can
28:00 - see that one person is going to be
28:01 - coming to visit us so that only one
28:04 - person is going to give me the monkey so
28:05 - I'll bring out the monkey and I can see
28:07 - that I can change these tiles to be
28:09 - whatever it is that the person my friend
28:12 - wants to have in their smoothie so I
28:15 - have the banana and now I'm going to
28:16 - bring out my blend and serve so these
28:19 - are two different two different blocks
28:22 - that we haven't seen before
28:23 - okay and Hannah I see that you say you
28:30 - can't move try to locate kind of where
28:32 - we are as far as that goes so now we
28:34 - still have our editor in the center our
28:37 - blocks are on the left-hand side and our
28:38 - stages on our right-hand side and now
28:40 - we're gonna do the same thing that we
28:42 - did before except for this time instead
28:44 - of saying when clay it says when the
28:46 - customer arrives so we don't know when
28:49 - the customer is gonna arrive we just
28:50 - know that he's coming and so our our
28:53 - monkey gets our banana smoothy alright
28:56 - so awesome all right cool so beavers
29:00 - happy I'm happy monkey got his smoothie
29:02 - and we've got three stars so we're
29:04 - rocking and
29:04 - okay so let's go ahead and let's skip
29:09 - again and let's go ahead and go to
29:11 - challenge number five and let's do this
29:16 - one together okay so same thing here if
29:21 - you raise your hands if you have a
29:23 - microphone so I can call call on you so
29:27 - you're able to participate Hannah I
29:29 - agree with you this guy this one is my
29:31 - favorite because he's so cute and this
29:33 - one and so are his friends all right
29:37 - Thomas I am going to allow you to talk
29:44 - and then all you'll do on your side is
29:46 - unmute yourself now yep we can hear you
29:53 - oh hey Thomas where you joining us from
29:54 - I'm done yeah
29:58 - Oh Columbia oh you're so far away okay
30:02 - perfect so Thomas can you tell me what
30:04 - to do you have to you have to wait add
30:16 - some strawberry okay so I'm gonna add a
30:19 - strawberry how do you know I need to add
30:21 - a strawberry and I don't need to add
30:22 - something different because I'm the
30:24 - board behind the beaver there's a
30:28 - strawberry
30:29 - oh so intuitive okay great and then what
30:32 - do I do next you put it in a blender oh
30:39 - I blend and serve okay and then I need
30:42 - to click what do you think next to make
30:45 - okay so let's push play oh man look that
30:49 - raccoon he's gonna be so excited he's
30:55 - excited just as excited as I were to be
30:58 - if I had a strawberry smoothie don't you
31:00 - agree yeah okay awesome Thomas thank you
31:04 - so much for sharing with us I'm gonna
31:05 - I'm gonna mute you now okay okay bye
31:14 - all right so very awesome okay so now
31:17 - we're gonna learn something called an if
31:18 - and else conditional so we're kind of
31:20 - skipping along and learning some things
31:22 - a little bit faster than we normally
31:23 - would okay but I feel like I'm feeling
31:27 - pretty confident that you can do it okay
31:29 - all right so now we're gonna go to our
31:32 - story map and whew I see some of you are
31:36 - already progressing ahead of me let me
31:38 - just double check this challenge really
31:40 - quickly and then we're gonna kind of do
31:42 - something together exactly okay so I saw
31:47 - somebody was already on challenge ten
31:48 - moving ahead of us but we're gonna go
31:50 - ahead and I would like you to do the
31:52 - story map again and this time click on
31:55 - challenge a number ten and we have a new
31:57 - block here that I am confident that you
32:00 - guys are going to be able to work with
32:05 - so when you are there I am going to
32:09 - lower everybody's hands here really
32:10 - quickly but when you are there just go
32:12 - ahead and raise your hand just so I know
32:14 - that everyone's kind of with me so I can
32:15 - talk about this new block and what this
32:17 - new block does great man you guys are
32:21 - such rockstars okay great
32:23 - I love coding rock stars they're my
32:24 - favorite okay let's make let's help this
32:26 - beaver make some smoothies for his
32:28 - friends okay so we see here that we have
32:31 - our rabbit and we have our raccoon and
32:35 - our rabbit or bunny or whatever however
32:37 - you want to call him we see that he he
32:39 - likes carrots and we know our raccoon
32:41 - like strawberries this time though we
32:43 - see we have three friends so that's a
32:45 - little bit different than something
32:46 - we've seen before so we are going to
32:50 - bring out our if something happens so
32:55 - we're bringing out our if our if
32:58 - statement here and so we want to say if
33:01 - who is going to arrive if our rabbit
33:04 - arrives then we're going to add a carrot
33:07 - and if our raccoon arrives oops you
33:14 - don't want to have this nested that when
33:16 - you have a loop inside of a loop we call
33:17 - that nested okay so when we have our
33:20 - raccoon we're going to add a strawberry
33:24 - we don't know though who's coming in
33:26 - which order so
33:27 - now we are going to go look at that
33:31 - reckon this time sir fancy glasses she
33:34 - has there okay so we're gonna do a super
33:42 - hint here and let's see so I forgot
33:44 - something
33:45 - uh-oh what did I forget I forgot the
33:47 - blend and serve how could I forget that
33:49 - so thank goodness I use that super him
33:52 - to kind of help me there so now I'm
33:54 - gonna click run now our raccoon comes
33:56 - back now she I'm gonna assume she has
34:00 - cooking classes a cookie now the raccoon
34:02 - gets his strawberry drink and is just as
34:04 - excited whoo now we have a rabbit coming
34:06 - back up and getting his smoothie his or
34:10 - her smoothie and also super excited
34:14 - I don't know how excited I would feel
34:15 - about a carrot smoothie I don't know
34:17 - about you but Hoonah does and now we
34:20 - have our other raccoon so we had two
34:22 - raccoons and one rabbit join us for our
34:25 - smoothie making party okay so we have
34:29 - the if our if statement here okay and if
34:34 - you have a question you'll see there's
34:35 - the little question there too in case
34:37 - you need something okay so now we're
34:40 - gonna skip ahead and now I would like
34:41 - you to go to challenge 14 okay all right
34:47 - and I'm gonna I'm gonna leave you guys
34:52 - on challenge 14 but I'm gonna go back to
34:54 - challenge 13 and we're going to talk
34:56 - about this so that we can do challenge
34:58 - 14 and one of you can solve it together
35:00 - okay so now we have our we have
35:06 - something new here this is called an if
35:08 - and else statement okay so we see our
35:11 - monkey on the board with a banana and we
35:13 - see our rabbit on the board with the
35:15 - carrot so if the monkey arrives we know
35:18 - that the monkey wants the banana
35:20 - otherwise okay
35:24 - if our monkey if our rabbit arrives then
35:31 - he wants to add a carrot
35:35 - okay so let's loops can't forget the
35:38 - blend and serve so let's see if this is
35:41 - correct
35:42 - so if the monkey arrives and we add the
35:46 - banana if else or else--if somebody else
35:49 - arrives then the rabbit comes and he
35:52 - gets his smoothie and we see we have two
35:54 - people so we had the rabbit and the
35:56 - monkey and who's gonna who's going to be
35:59 - our last person to the party today yeah
36:02 - monkey
36:05 - okay awesome all right so raise your
36:08 - hand if you feel confident that you can

41:42 - a blend and serve up this oh I forgot
41:45 - the one I serve before
41:46 - oopsie okay let's see all right like
42:04 - it's top hat what do you guys think
42:17 - okay do you guys see how the code is
42:26 - highlighting as we're running through so
42:28 - every single time it's highlighting
42:30 - where its stopping to watch it here oh
42:33 - we did it okay great so we got a three
42:36 - star solution you guys aren't rockstars
42:38 - so we just had to do that now I forgot
42:41 - to add the blend and serve here so I'm
42:43 - actually gonna do that I'm gonna show
42:45 - you how what it would do if we were like
42:48 - this and then we're gonna finish up this
42:50 - was our last I'm gonna meet all of you
42:52 - guys
42:52 - thank you guys so much for your help
43:04 - okay okay so you can see this is still
43:07 - running but there was a more efficient
43:09 - way to solve this so you guys were not
43:11 - wrong on your first attempt I forgot to
43:14 - add the blend answer so that was my
43:15 - fault so we just have we can see that
43:19 - there are as many ways to solve
43:21 - challenges when you're working through
43:22 - things but there is always a more
43:24 - efficient way which is how he shouldn't
43:25 - how he started out the challenge or how
43:28 - he actually finished up right so this is
43:30 - not in correct but there is a more
43:32 - efficient way to do it and was as a
43:34 - coder if you started working and having
43:37 - so many lines of code all the time it
43:39 - would be really really hard to work on
43:42 - your code with having so much so you
43:43 - want to have the shortest amount that
43:45 - you can because it excuse-me just makes
43:48 - it easier for you later on okay you guys
43:50 - in a fabulously amazing job on today's
43:55 - webinar so if you get stuck you can use
43:59 - those super hints you can ask a friend
44:00 - or you can review past challenges like
44:03 - we did today definitely encourage you
44:05 - use the super hints and ask a teacher or
44:08 - a friend like I said or you past
44:10 - challenges if you're working in coding
44:12 - adventures some of you guys are a little
44:13 - bit older I recommend working in this
44:16 - feel no challenges okay so really
44:19 - quickly before we end we have just about
44:20 - a minute or so before we finish today's
44:22 - webinar so you have any questions you
44:25 - can either put it in the chat box for me
44:27 - or you can add it in the Q&A box Hannah
44:33 - thank you so much hello as well to you
44:45 - okay and I want to thank my special
44:48 - helpers that helped me today for today's
44:50 - webinar is really great to have some
44:52 - extra help if you are oh that's a good
45:01 - question
45:01 - Oh Rosanna I know you had a question
45:03 - about earlier in the webinar about
45:06 - asking about unlimited as long as you
45:10 - are part of your teachers classroom just
45:12 - have your teacher reach out to us and we
45:14 - can set you up with that or if you are
45:16 - at home with your family you can have
