00:04 - hello
00:05 - welcome to code monkey's coding
00:07 - adventure
00:08 - the first topic we're going to learn
00:10 - about is sequencing
00:13 - sequencing is when you put things in a
00:15 - certain order for example days of the
00:18 - week are in a certain sequence first
00:20 - comes monday then tuesday then wednesday
00:22 - and so on
00:24 - actually real life runs in sequences
00:28 - you probably have a plan for getting up
00:31 - each morning
00:33 - maybe it's that you get out of bed then
00:35 - you take a shower you put on your
00:37 - clothes you brush your teeth have
00:39 - breakfast
00:40 - that's the sequence that you run through
00:42 - each morning
00:44 - well code follows a sequence also also
00:48 - and that's line one line two line three
00:51 - it always runs in that order
00:54 - so what that means is that when you plan
00:56 - your code you got to think of not just
00:59 - the commands
01:00 - but also the order of those commands or
01:03 - the order of the actions
01:06 - let's take a look at an example here's
01:08 - an example where we want the monkey to
01:10 - get the three bananas
01:13 - to get to that first banana
01:16 - we know the monkey is going to need to
01:19 - step 15.
01:23 - now you could look at the monkey and see
01:26 - where it's facing
01:28 - and it looks like the monkey's going to
01:29 - need to turn also
01:32 - so we know we're going to have a step
01:33 - and we know we're going to have a turn
01:35 - but what order should we put those in
01:39 - let's try if we would have put step
01:42 - 15
01:44 - and then turn left we know those
01:47 - commands are right
01:50 - ah but it looks like the order isn't
01:53 - it's because code
01:55 - runs from the top of the program to the
01:58 - bottom
01:59 - it's going to step 15 before turning
02:01 - left
02:03 - we want to do the opposite so i'm going
02:05 - to
02:06 - take this
02:09 - and put it below
02:12 - just
02:15 - ah that looks right
02:18 - and now we just
02:20 - need to do that same sort of thinking to
02:22 - get to the second and last banana
02:25 - so now that we've gone over sequencing
02:28 - it's your turn
02:29 - good luck
