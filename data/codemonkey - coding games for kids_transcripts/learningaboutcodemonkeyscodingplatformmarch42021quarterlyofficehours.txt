04:42 - for you to access at any time
04:46 - all right oh not yet
04:53 - not yet with that slide sorry
04:56 - it's a surprise all right anyway
05:01 - okay the first look before the first
05:02 - look exactly
05:05 - okay so uh hi everyone let me share my
05:08 - screen i'm gonna
05:10 - continue from here with a short
05:13 - short demo of the different
05:17 - features that are available
05:20 - i'm just making sure lena can you see my
05:23 - screen
05:24 - the login screen yes i can okay great so
05:27 - i'm just gonna log into one of my my
05:29 - accounts i'm gonna use the
05:31 - google single sign-on um sorry for this
05:33 - this is
05:34 - hebrew um but um basically i'm just
05:38 - gonna choose my codemonkey account and
05:41 - and the reason i'm using
05:42 - um my google account is uh
05:45 - i wanna show you actually also how to
05:48 - import google classrooms
05:49 - so for that purpose i need to um log in
05:52 - using my google account the one i use
05:55 - for my
05:56 - google classrooms um and i have also my
05:58 - google classrooms ready right here
06:01 - um and uh i already have a few
06:03 - classrooms here i
06:04 - have i have an active subscription with
06:06 - available seats
06:08 - but basically the first thing you would
06:09 - do on codemonkey is to create your
06:12 - classroom
06:13 - um you can either
06:16 - create just a new classroom
06:20 - right here just a regular classroom
06:24 - and then you would need to add your
06:25 - students um
06:27 - or you can import a google classroom
06:30 - with your students already in it so that
06:33 - sort of saves you time of having
06:35 - to add your students later on
06:38 - but let's let's talk about the different
06:41 - methods
06:42 - for adding students before i show you
06:45 - the way to import a google classroom so
06:49 - actually i'm going to go to the new
06:51 - classroom i've just created
06:53 - just to review the the three available
06:57 - methods
06:58 - and i can add students through the
07:00 - students tab right here
07:02 - by clicking on add students i see the
07:04 - three methods so the first two
07:07 - are relevant when you're looking to
07:08 - create
07:10 - your students accounts so you would give
07:12 - them a username and a password
07:14 - which you can then share with them um
07:18 - and then they can just log into
07:20 - codemonkey using their
07:21 - um username and password and they're
07:24 - already in the classroom
07:25 - so this is this is handy especially for
07:28 - those younger students
07:30 - and you want to create their accounts
07:31 - for them so
07:33 - you can do that or for students who
07:36 - don't have any
07:38 - google accounts for example so they
07:40 - don't use any single sign-ons
07:42 - so you would create usernames for them
07:44 - the third method
07:45 - is having your students join using the
07:48 - class code
07:50 - so so that's that's handy especially
07:52 - when you have students joining
07:54 - from home um
07:58 - and uh you would just provide them with
08:00 - the classroom code
08:02 - um so either students joining from home
08:04 - or
08:05 - this is what you would use in case your
08:07 - students are using any
08:09 - um single sign-on methods we have
08:12 - um google clever class link
08:15 - so students are able to use these
08:18 - accounts which is great because you
08:20 - don't want to have
08:21 - them remem remember another username and
08:23 - another password so
08:25 - just let them use the single sign-on
08:27 - option
08:28 - um and you can just share with them this
08:31 - classroom code it's a it's a code
08:33 - it's a unique code that each classroom
08:35 - uh would have
08:37 - and um and then they would um be able to
08:40 - join
08:41 - using the class code um and they would
08:44 - enter your classroom with the code i'll
08:47 - i can show that later on if we'll have
08:48 - time
08:50 - another another nice way is
08:53 - by providing them this
08:57 - unique link which already has the code
09:00 - so this would be less steps for your
09:03 - students they wouldn't have to
09:05 - enter the code themselves so
09:08 - i definitely recommend checking out this
09:10 - and using the link
09:12 - and sharing them the link instead if
09:15 - you're able to share a link if you're
09:16 - communicating online
09:18 - um you can send this so that's the class
09:21 - code
09:22 - method i'm going to go back to the
09:25 - my classrooms page because i want to
09:28 - show
09:29 - also the option to import a google
09:31 - classroom
09:32 - which is very handy i'm sure many of you
09:35 - use google classrooms you already have
09:37 - your
09:37 - students group together and this will
09:40 - definitely make your life
09:42 - easier and your students wouldn't have
09:44 - to join using the class code
09:45 - because once you import the classroom
09:49 - the students would already be imported
09:51 - with it just one thing
09:52 - the first time you sign into codemonk
09:55 - using your google account
09:56 - you will be asked to provide to
10:00 - authorize codemonkey to view your google
10:02 - classrooms so
10:04 - you will have here a message and you'll
10:06 - just have to authorize that
10:08 - and then you'll be able to go on and
10:11 - import
10:11 - classrooms so i'm going to import
10:14 - my monday classroom i'm going to have it
10:17 - connected to my subscription
10:20 - and
10:23 - okay let's click on create my classroom
10:26 - so i'm just going to wait for
10:28 - monkey to import my classroom and i
10:32 - i have this confirmation that classroom
10:34 - imported import has
10:36 - been completed and you can see my monday
10:39 - class has been added
10:41 - with three students already in my
10:43 - classroom
10:45 - let me just click on the classroom so i
10:48 - can see
10:49 - let's go to the students tab this is my
10:52 - classroom dashboard where i can
10:54 - perform different actions on the
10:56 - classroom and see
10:58 - see my students and indeed these are my
11:01 - students
11:02 - um you can see them right here
11:06 - so they've already been populated
11:09 - another thing i want to show you
11:11 - regarding
11:11 - google classroom is that you can at any
11:14 - point make any changes to your
11:16 - students or even to the classroom name
11:19 - once you do that
11:20 - on google classroom you can just sync
11:23 - your classroom on codemonkey to have the
11:25 - changes reflected
11:27 - on code monkey as well so any changes to
11:30 - your students
11:31 - if you're going to add any additional
11:33 - students you would do that
11:34 - on your google classroom and then you
11:37 - can
11:38 - sync the classroom on code monkey and
11:40 - have the
11:42 - change is reflected okay
11:48 - okay let me now show you
11:51 - just the student side because we we
11:53 - don't always show that but i know it's
11:54 - it's important
11:57 - so i'm going to share a new screen um
12:00 - just our home page
12:01 - and and i'm going to logging is a
12:05 - student who is in that google classroom
12:08 - so
12:08 - this is something that you would need to
12:10 - um direct your
12:12 - your students to do we also have a a
12:15 - great
12:16 - help article a student guide for
12:19 - students who are
12:20 - in a google classroom so this would
12:22 - guide them
12:23 - for the steps that they need to do but
12:25 - basically once they access the login
12:27 - page
12:27 - all they would need to do is click on
12:29 - the google button
12:31 - um in order to and then they would need
12:34 - to choose their google account
12:36 - um and once they do that
12:40 - they are in their codemonkey account
12:42 - they can choose their avatar
12:46 - and um they can see here the classroom
12:48 - names and
12:49 - basically they have the courses here
12:52 - available to them
12:53 - again according to what you as the
12:55 - teacher has assigned
12:57 - have assigned to them uh but that's it's
12:59 - just a few steps
13:00 - and once they're in they can already
13:02 - access
13:04 - the the courses so that's the student
13:06 - side
13:07 - of things okay
13:13 - i'm going uh back
13:16 - to um the my classrooms page
13:19 - another thing i want to show you you
13:21 - might have other teachers working with
13:23 - you
13:24 - on the same classroom also and you would
13:27 - also need to provide them with access to
13:30 - the classroom
13:31 - so you can add them as co-teachers
13:34 - so as long as you have these teachers
13:38 - also added as teachers on your google
13:41 - classroom
13:42 - so you see i have i've added myself also
13:45 - as a teacher on google classroom
13:48 - but here from code monkey i would need
13:50 - to import
13:52 - the the teacher and then i can add them
13:55 - as a co-teacher
13:56 - to this classroom so once they log into
13:58 - their account they'll also be able to
14:00 - see this classroom um to perform all the
14:03 - actions um and as you can see i've been
14:07 - added
14:08 - so so that's the that's the first thing
14:11 - that you would do
14:13 - let's see
14:16 - and on this student list just really
14:18 - quickly i like to note that you can see
14:20 - that
14:21 - this student has this
14:24 - username here so that's just important
14:27 - so you can see
14:28 - that they logged in correctly
14:32 - right okay lina you want to take it from
14:36 - here
14:42 - that was so quick
14:47 - i felt like i blinked my eyes no just
14:48 - kidding um okay so
14:50 - we'll go ahead and um
14:53 - now it's my turn to begin sharing so
14:57 - um
15:01 - we have recently so when talia just
15:03 - shared her screen about the student
15:05 - guides and how you know the student
15:06 - screen looks like we did recently add
15:09 - the tiling also
15:10 - of these basically what the course is
15:14 - and what level they are to the courses
15:16 - page so how i got here is on my
15:18 - classrooms page you can see all of my
15:20 - classrooms are listed here
15:21 - and i just clicked into a classroom when
15:24 - i clicked into the classroom it brings
15:26 - you right to
15:26 - the teacher behind the scenes dashboard
15:29 - here
15:30 - it brings me right into the progress
15:32 - page i'm going to come back to this
15:34 - progress page
15:35 - but i want to talk about the courses and
15:37 - so in the course page i just clicked on
15:40 - it here on the top we have these
15:42 - new improvements that we made here so
15:44 - we're able to see all of the courses
15:46 - that we have here
15:49 - and then when you click on the specific
15:51 - course you can click read more
15:53 - and here you're able to see a quick
15:55 - synopsis
15:56 - summary of what the course is going to
15:59 - be covering
16:00 - what it's about what specific coding
16:02 - concepts there are you can click here
16:04 - and see the specific standards that are
16:06 - associated with the lesson plan these
16:08 - are csta standards here
16:10 - and then you can find the specific
16:12 - lesson plans
16:13 - for that specific course you just click
16:16 - on a few lesson plans and it's right
16:17 - there and once it's assigned to the
16:19 - students then they'll be able to see it
16:21 - on their side we've
16:22 - had a lot of questions specifically
16:24 - around
16:25 - i've signed all i've assigned all three
16:27 - courses to my students in the bieber
16:29 - achiever and so beaver achiever coding
16:31 - adventure
16:32 - and banana tales are a suite of courses
16:34 - that means that students have to work
16:36 - linearly through those through those
16:39 - courses
16:40 - in order for the next course to unlock
16:42 - so that's just something to keep in mind
16:44 - a question that we've
16:45 - we've gotten a few times and then here
16:48 - on this course page
16:49 - specifically as well you can see the
16:50 - grade levels i've been asked this do the
16:52 - students see this they don't they only
16:54 - see
16:55 - um this tiling and the name this
16:58 - specific banner here that tells you the
16:59 - course and the specific
17:01 - language that's attached to it and then
17:03 - the course name itself
17:05 - you can see which device it's best for
17:08 - so
17:08 - web or a tablet so web is
17:11 - just you know right through the web and
17:13 - if it's available
17:14 - on a tablet device or if it works well
17:16 - once it's been assigned to the student
17:18 - you see that it's
17:19 - has a yellow banner that says hey this
17:22 - has been assigned
17:23 - and if it hasn't then you'll see this
17:24 - green button here for the for the
17:26 - students
17:28 - something else that we added new here is
17:29 - you can easily navigate now between all
17:32 - of your courses you don't have to go
17:33 - back out to the classrooms page
17:35 - but you can do that right over here on
17:37 - the side you can quickly navigate
17:39 - between all of your classrooms
17:41 - and then you have that ability to see
17:44 - those
17:44 - as well okay so now let's go back to the
17:49 - progress page
17:51 - and let's just discuss this progress
17:53 - page here so limiting progress is a
17:55 - pretty
17:55 - important um feature for a lot of
17:57 - teachers just depending on how you're
17:59 - kind of running
18:00 - your classroom so as you can see here i
18:02 - have this
18:03 - classroom specifically limited to only
18:06 - challenge
18:06 - 20. what that means is that the students
18:09 - will
18:09 - submit the challenge for challenge 20
18:11 - but they won't be able to go on to
18:13 - challenge
18:13 - 21 they will be able to see all of the
18:16 - previous challenges
18:18 - up until that point and then also able
18:20 - to see the skill mode challenges
18:23 - skill mode challenges are just specific
18:25 - reinforced
18:26 - concepts based on the concept reinforced
18:29 - challenges
18:30 - based on the concepts that they've
18:31 - learned so specific to stepping and
18:32 - turning
18:33 - specific to the turtle and turning to
18:36 - them
18:37 - and they're sport in the exact same way
18:39 - you're also able to see the solutions
18:41 - here as well
18:42 - you can sort by progress the same way
18:43 - that you can in story mode as well so
18:46 - those are there for them
18:48 - for them to have some extra practice and
18:50 - reinforcement
18:52 - you can also in this same thing do it
18:55 - free play that means it opens up
18:57 - completely for the students
18:58 - or you can do it limited based on the
19:00 - last lesson taught so if you are
19:02 - using lesson mode this is an important
19:04 - feature
19:05 - i've seen a lot of teachers say oh the
19:08 - kiddos have been able to
19:09 - fly past the specific challenges within
19:12 - the lesson
19:13 - if you don't have this on here that says
19:16 - limit based on the last lesson taught
19:17 - then the students will
19:19 - be able to continue to progress once you
19:21 - end the lesson mode
19:24 - so that's just something that we like
19:26 - for you to
19:27 - keep in mind when you're working through
19:31 - those challenges or assigning them to
19:33 - the students themselves
19:39 - okay um
19:42 - and i'll i'll i'll talk a bit about
19:45 - um lessons about the lessons uh feature
19:49 - um i'll share my screen again
19:52 - okay yeah um
19:55 - okay so the lessons feature uh
19:59 - you might already um some of you might
20:01 - might be using this but
20:03 - but this is a really great
20:06 - helpful feature that will help you
20:10 - run your coding classes even when you
20:13 - have students accessing
20:14 - from home it's currently only available
20:16 - for coding adventure course
20:18 - and this is great to use when you are
20:21 - using
20:22 - our lesson plans so basically under the
20:25 - teacher resources you can find
20:26 - lesson plans for all of our courses and
20:29 - for coding adventure as well of course
20:31 - but through the lesson feature you can
20:33 - access the individual lesson plans
20:36 - so here we are on lesson number one
20:41 - so we also have here access to just the
20:44 - individual
20:45 - lesson plan let's just open that up
20:50 - and we have here the the lesson plans
20:53 - with the different parts we have the
20:54 - introduction
20:55 - play time um we were finishing up always
20:59 - with the debriefing so that's our our
21:02 - lesson plan available for you and uh so
21:04 - if you can see
21:05 - this page is structured according to the
21:08 - to the lesson plan
21:10 - and uh it also gives you access to the
21:13 - different challenges
21:15 - and other um great files here
21:19 - that you might want to open up once
21:22 - when you are teaching this lesson so
21:24 - this is a great way to
21:27 - conduct your lesson it has it all
21:29 - structured here
21:30 - and you can just use it this way
21:34 - or you can go a bit further and use our
21:37 - lesson mode
21:39 - so the lesson mode is
21:43 - this button right here so you know how
21:45 - you're
21:46 - explaining something for your students
21:48 - but they're already on code monkey and
21:50 - they're
21:50 - clicking on things and they want to
21:52 - access things so once you
21:54 - use the lesson mode you click on begin
21:57 - lesson and basically
21:59 - it will lock your students from all of
22:01 - the activities
22:02 - until you assign the challenges so
22:06 - i'm going to confirm and let's also
22:09 - see how the students would see this
22:13 - so this is the student account i'm just
22:15 - going to refresh
22:16 - and you would see that the student is
22:19 - now locked
22:20 - everything here is closed and waiting
22:23 - for
22:24 - the the teacher so now you really have
22:26 - your students with you
22:28 - focusing and um you can
22:32 - start with the um with the introduction
22:37 - and then only once you are ready for
22:39 - your students to start playing
22:41 - you can click on the assign challenges
22:43 - and then your students once they refresh
22:45 - their page
22:46 - they can access these uh these
22:49 - challenges
22:50 - until you end the play time and now you
22:53 - want to go into the debrief
22:55 - and talk about what what we've learned
22:57 - in these challenges
22:59 - and uh once you're done with your lesson
23:01 - you can
23:02 - end the lesson and the great thing about
23:04 - this it marks your lesson here in green
23:06 - so
23:06 - you know that you've completed this
23:08 - lesson so once you're back
23:10 - uh meeting with this classroom you're
23:12 - all you you know it kind of saves
23:14 - um it keeps track of of what you
23:18 - uh what lesson you last taught so you
23:20 - can continue to the next
23:22 - lesson another little thing i wanted to
23:25 - add here
23:25 - this is relevant for when you're using
23:27 - google classroom
23:29 - this is currently um
23:32 - an option that we have to assign
23:36 - challenges to your google classroom
23:39 - from codemonkey so once you click on
23:41 - this
23:42 - it will let's see how it would look like
23:46 - in the classroom stream
23:52 - so as you can see i posted an assignment
23:56 - to my classroom
24:00 - the post has a link
24:04 - a link to these challenges and
24:08 - um i can also as the teacher
24:11 - i can also choose to edit it i can add
24:14 - more instructions
24:15 - i might want to assign it to diff
24:17 - specific students
24:18 - i want i might want to give it a due
24:20 - date um
24:22 - or i can add different things so that's
24:25 - available for
24:25 - for you through google classroom but i
24:28 - just wanted to show you
24:29 - um that connectivity
24:32 - that you have and of course once your
24:35 - students have completed they can
24:37 - on their end they can complete this as
24:39 - done
24:40 - um i will add that this won't show on
24:43 - um it won't show here you would see that
24:46 - on your
24:47 - google classroom so this is the lessons
24:50 - feature currently only available for
24:52 - coding adventure um and
24:55 - i really recommend using this this is
24:57 - super handy especially
25:00 - in remote and especially when you
25:03 - are running a very structured lesson
25:08 - another thing that i'll just note on
25:10 - here too is if you have students who
25:12 - are maybe a little bit further behind
25:16 - you when you assign those challenges to
25:18 - them within the lesson
25:20 - it does um have them bypass the
25:22 - challenges where they were so this is a
25:24 - way to kind of keep all of your students
25:26 - together as well
25:28 - so whether you use the lesson note in
25:29 - that way or you just assign it to the
25:31 - students it kind of is a way to keep
25:32 - everyone
25:33 - on the same page
25:51 - okay so moving right along here
25:54 - we are now in the gradebook tab of
25:57 - everything here
25:58 - and so in the gradebook i just clicked
26:00 - on this proficiency table just something
26:02 - we like to note
26:03 - this is all of the concepts that are
26:05 - covered throughout all of the courses
26:07 - within code monkey so you can see we
26:09 - have sequencing
26:10 - all the way to modules and import sorts
26:13 - input output
26:14 - i'm just the different variances of
26:16 - coding concepts that the students will
26:19 - encounter throughout coding throughout
26:21 - code monkey
26:23 - here we can see that a we have very
26:26 - novice to advance so the more that they
26:28 - are introduced in working through those
26:29 - concepts
26:30 - the more advanced they become in the
26:32 - concepts themselves so some teachers
26:34 - like to use it to see oh
26:36 - okay they worked on a couple of
26:37 - different courses now i know that they
26:39 - need some remediation or some extra
26:41 - reinforcements to kind of
26:43 - help enhance those skills that they
26:45 - might be struggling on
26:47 - or they might be super advanced some
26:49 - just just different variations
26:54 - um so then we also have our just the
26:57 - typical gradebook here you can
27:00 - change it based on numbers letters and
27:01 - percentages you can also average it
27:03 - between
27:04 - um you know whichever concepts it is
27:06 - that you're working on within that
27:07 - course
27:08 - all accessible fully from all of the
27:11 - for all of the courses that we have here
27:13 - you're able to see how many students
27:15 - completed
27:16 - this specific course since the dota's
27:18 - math is a shorter course
27:20 - you're also able to see if you're
27:22 - working through platformer you're able
27:24 - to see
27:25 - this pass fail for students you can see
27:27 - i have a couple of
27:29 - struggle bolsters here you can see how
27:30 - many exercises they've reached
27:32 - how many bonuses that the students have
27:34 - solved so the average on the bonuses
27:36 - here
27:36 - and then how many students have actually
27:38 - completed the course so i really like to
27:40 - use this because i really like the
27:41 - statistics that are here at the bottom
27:43 - um just for some you know extra places
27:45 - to look you can also export this into a
27:47 - csv file
27:50 - something like that as well
27:54 - before we get into
27:59 - the first look i just like to make
28:01 - mention of something i was
28:02 - speaking with a teacher the other day
28:04 - and she wanted to kind of keep track and
28:05 - see she was running a little
28:07 - mini coding competition with her
28:08 - students and so she was looking for ways
28:11 - to be able to track the data she had
28:13 - 70 classrooms and she didn't want to
28:14 - check the data for every single
28:16 - classroom so
28:17 - when you export all of this data from
28:19 - all of your classrooms to a csv file it
28:21 - will put them all
28:23 - organized by each classroom name and
28:25 - you're able to see the ranking of the
28:26 - students so just something i like to
28:28 - note as well for you
28:30 - there too
28:36 - great um
28:39 - lena can you share your screen with the
28:41 - with the slide
28:43 - please
28:49 - well just uh something uh we we wanted
28:52 - to give you a first look of
28:54 - a feature that will we will release soon
28:58 - um
28:59 - this is uh it's it it's it might have
29:03 - it's a small addition but it might have
29:04 - a big impact uh we've been getting
29:07 - requests from
29:08 - from teachers about this um teachers
29:11 - looking to see
29:12 - more information per student you have
29:14 - your students now
29:16 - either in class or from home um so it's
29:19 - really not the same it's really hard to
29:21 - see what
29:21 - are they actually doing how much are
29:24 - they how much time are they spending on
29:26 - codemonkey
29:27 - so um
29:30 - so from the progress tab which lena
29:33 - showed
29:34 - before once you have all the students
29:37 - there and once you would click on a
29:39 - student so this is our new student
29:41 - activity dashboard and this is
29:43 - um it's not the final it's not the final
29:45 - look it's not the final design but we
29:47 - really wanted to show you
29:48 - already what to expect coming real soon
29:53 - and this will give you much more insight
29:56 - into your students progress how much
29:58 - time have they spent on code monkey
30:01 - in the last few days you can see the
30:04 - course progress
30:06 - at the bottom so this is a great way if
30:09 - you want to
30:10 - look into a specific student um he might
30:12 - be a student that is
30:14 - struggling um or you might want to
30:17 - you might you might be communicating
30:19 - with their parent
30:20 - so this is one place where you can see
30:23 - information about this student you can
30:25 - navigate between the courses and see
30:27 - their progress
30:28 - within the courses or you can see some
30:31 - nice stats
30:33 - at the top right how many games they've
30:36 - created
30:37 - how many challenges they've created um
30:39 - if
30:40 - how many activities have they started
30:42 - maybe they're only on just
30:43 - one activity so maybe they're a bit
30:45 - behind
30:46 - and then you have the proficiency report
30:49 - for this specific
30:50 - student again showing how proficient
30:53 - they are in the different coding
30:56 - concepts across all the courses they've
30:59 - already started
31:01 - and of course you can see when they last
31:03 - logged on so
31:04 - so this is uh not the final design but
31:07 - this is some
31:08 - this is going to be um these are the
31:10 - this is the information that
31:11 - that will be available um and we're
31:14 - looking forward to hearing your thoughts
31:16 - on this your feedback on this you know
31:18 - i'll say again this is um all
31:21 - uh thanks to to feedback we've received
31:24 - from
31:25 - um our users so we're really excited
31:28 - we're really excited to
31:30 - to release this i hope you are as well
31:33 - and um i think i think that's it
31:37 - unless you have any questions regarding
31:39 - this specifically or we can also move on
31:41 - to some
31:42 - questions we've already received um in
31:44 - the
31:45 - um registration form so we a few of you
31:48 - already sent us some questions
31:50 - uh we'd like to answer um and be
31:54 - just before we get to this q a part just
31:56 - a couple of things i wanted to
31:58 - also just reinforce and just kind of
32:00 - remind you of
32:01 - in the teacher resource section is where
32:04 - all of the lesson plans are located
32:06 - um something that we have seen a lot of
32:08 - questions
32:09 - coming in is um we do have this teaching
32:11 - with coding adventure course here
32:14 - it's me if you haven't gotten tired of
32:15 - me but it will kind of introduce you to
32:17 - a few of the concepts
32:19 - well it will introduce you to the
32:20 - concepts that are covered in part one of
32:22 - coding adventure which are also concepts
32:24 - you see
32:25 - in other places in other courses so if
32:28 - you're looking for something to just
32:29 - kind of reinforce that
32:31 - piece maybe something you're not sure
32:33 - about too well yourself this is a really
32:35 - great way to see that in a more
32:37 - visual way in addition to that you can
32:41 - always see
32:42 - the you know the webinars at any other
32:44 - time the how-to guides nothing
32:46 - too much has changed there the solutions
32:49 - just a reminder they're here
32:50 - and on the progress page as well and
32:52 - then um
32:53 - in the help center so you can locate the
32:55 - help center on the
32:56 - left hand corner we do always have any
32:59 - of the resources that we shared with you
33:01 - today are pretty much located here on
33:03 - the help page so we have the student
33:05 - login guides
33:06 - there is a getting started for teachers
33:09 - we do have
33:10 - a video guide here um how to create
33:12 - classrooms
33:13 - we also have something as well
33:17 - that we just recently added here
33:20 - and that is
33:26 - um coding adventure so we do have the
33:29 - coding concepts and terminology located
33:31 - here
33:32 - it does have the specific concepts that
33:34 - are covered an
33:35 - animated image that's here it shows you
33:37 - what it looks like as well as
33:39 - just basically a walkthrough of those
33:41 - concepts for coding adventure
33:43 - and then we do also have this
33:47 - getting started with coding adventure
33:49 - and so this walks students through
33:51 - basically the components of coding
33:53 - adventure with from gordo
33:55 - all the way through the story map so
33:57 - this is just a good introduction that
33:58 - you can utilize
34:00 - with your students when introducing this
34:02 - course
34:03 - especially virtually this will really
34:05 - help you know with that or
34:06 - it's just fun for them to listen
34:08 - sometimes
34:10 - to others than just ourselves right so
34:12 - just wanted to share
34:14 - that component with you so you kind of
34:17 - knew
34:17 - that as well another question that had
34:20 - come
34:20 - up this week was being able to remix
34:23 - something
34:24 - in discover um and so this is just
34:27 - something to to to note here in
34:30 - in your classrooms page itself
34:33 - when you go to the showroom that's where
34:35 - all the students games and challenges
34:37 - are showcased
34:38 - when you if you don't have the discover
34:41 - enabled you're not able to make a you're
34:43 - not able to remix
34:45 - the games the students actually won't
34:46 - even see the discover tab themselves so
34:48 - that's just something
34:50 - um that has been kind of brought to our
34:52 - attention a couple of times just
34:53 - some wonderings about why they can't see
34:55 - it and so if they can't see it it's just
34:56 - because the enable discover hasn't been
34:58 - there and why would you utilize the
35:01 - discover this is really good for working
35:02 - through an engineering design
35:04 - process re-mixing games maybe changing
35:08 - some modifications
35:10 - and you know even working through some
35:12 - pseudo-coding itself would be some
35:14 - really good ways to use the discover
35:16 - as well
35:20 - okay so it's quite quiet for questions
35:24 - but
35:25 - now we would like to hear your questions
35:29 - see any wonderings that you have
35:30 - anything you would like us to touch base
35:32 - on
35:33 - we really want this to be a time to
35:35 - honor your time as well we know that
35:37 - your questions are very valuable and we
35:39 - really
35:40 - we very much value your feedback
35:44 - or wonderings or any of that
35:54 - so i will move to some questions that
35:56 - came from our
36:00 - q a as well
36:05 - so a question was how do we
36:08 - delete email addresses and don't have an
36:11 - account
36:12 - against your number of users so when
36:14 - you're importing through google
36:16 - classroom as you've noticed
36:18 - it will just automatically take the
36:20 - seats up so if you're having an issue if
36:22 - you feel like something has not been
36:24 - correct or there's been an issue you can
36:26 - just email us at support
36:28 - codemonkey.com and we'll be sure to take
36:29 - care of that for you
36:34 - another question here was when can we
36:36 - give the certificates how many
36:38 - levels do students need to complete so
36:40 - we do have certificates for all of the
36:42 - courses
36:42 - i definitely recommend giving the
36:45 - certificates to students after they've
36:47 - completed a course
36:49 - but obviously it's totally up to you
37:00 - okay so this is a great question here we
37:02 - have i'm
37:03 - new joining i'm new to joining code
37:05 - monkey and i have some questions
37:07 - one is well i need to create a new
37:08 - classroom for every session so
37:11 - for the students that you've had in your
37:13 - classrooms it is best to create
37:15 - a classroom for every session so whether
37:17 - you're importing that from google
37:19 - classroom
37:19 - you're sharing a class code with them
37:21 - i'm just something to note is when you
37:23 - do
37:23 - archive your students let's say you
37:25 - don't want to see all the
37:27 - the classrooms active within the
37:30 - classrooms page when you archive them
37:32 - here basically the students data
37:36 - is still there the student's data
37:38 - doesn't doesn't disappear
37:39 - i know we get a lot of questions about
37:41 - that too what if i
37:43 - what if i archive them and they come and
37:44 - see me again for the next semester
37:46 - sometimes that happens
37:47 - um as long as they become active
37:50 - again and they keep the same username
37:53 - password same login information
37:55 - their data is stays the same for the
37:58 - lifetime of their account so their
37:59 - progress saves
38:00 - all of that kind of thing
38:04 - um would a classroom purchase now
38:06 - extended to the next academic year
38:08 - um pete that's a great question that's
38:10 - something that would be best to reach
38:11 - out to your sales rep or
38:13 - um to ask that question depending on the
38:15 - length of your subscription but a way to
38:17 - to see where your subscription and how
38:19 - long it's been active if you can't
38:21 - remember
38:22 - is here i'm on the my classrooms page
38:24 - when you click on view all
38:26 - you're able to see the name of your
38:28 - subscription
38:29 - and then when your subscription starts
38:31 - and ends so that's just a good way to
38:33 - check that out as well
38:41 - okay i'm just looking for some questions
38:44 - here
38:48 - for you okay i'm gonna get that
38:52 - get back to that okay so upgrading how
38:54 - does this work
38:55 - should i use this instead of renaming a
38:57 - classroom so
38:58 - here on my classrooms page
39:01 - you're able to see the upgrade button
39:04 - here basically upgrade just means
39:06 - applying a new subscription so let's say
39:08 - your subscription
39:09 - has expired now when you upgrade it
39:13 - that's just means that you're upgrading
39:15 - either from your free trial to your paid
39:17 - subscription or
39:18 - um you know re-applying your classroom
39:21 - to the old to the new subscription so
39:24 - that's just a way basically to say hey i
39:25 - want my new subscription
39:26 - attached to my classroom so should i
39:29 - should i show it
39:30 - on my screen because i have one expired
39:33 - classroom
39:34 - sure i can quickly show this
39:39 - so so this is uh as lena said so if if
39:41 - you have
39:42 - so you have a new subscription with code
39:44 - monkey but you want your classroom to
39:46 - continue
39:47 - or you might have used our trial and
39:50 - then
39:50 - uh purchased a subscription and now you
39:53 - want to move the
39:54 - the classroom from your trial to your
39:56 - new subscription show
39:57 - there's no need to create a new
39:58 - classroom and create new student
40:00 - accounts
40:01 - um you can just upgrade using this
40:04 - button
40:04 - and upgrade basically means moving a
40:07 - classroom between subscriptions
40:10 - so you'll you'll have a few pop-up
40:12 - messages here just asking you to review
40:15 - if you are actually looking to have all
40:17 - the students
40:18 - um upgraded with the classroom if not
40:21 - you can first archive them so they won't
40:23 - move don't move over to the new
40:24 - classroom but then you can
40:27 - continue just choose the subscription
40:30 - you want to upgrade the classroom to
40:32 - and click on upgrade and then as you can
40:35 - see the classroom is
40:36 - now part of the new subscription so
40:38 - that's the upgrade button
40:40 - great um another question here we have
40:45 - or
40:45 - just a comment from one of our teachers
40:47 - is for
40:48 - students logging in this teacher alan
40:52 - he's uh he is here in texas located with
40:55 - myself as well
40:56 - but he created a google slide that has
40:59 - the app links to it and then
41:01 - he just uses the login url and then the
41:03 - students
41:04 - all they have to do is find their name
41:05 - and click on the password so that's
41:06 - great for the younger students
41:08 - that is that classroom login url that
41:10 - you can share so there's a lot of
41:12 - a lot of ways to you know kind of make
41:13 - that a little bit easier
41:15 - another question is here i
41:18 - have nine-year-old kids which course is
41:21 - best suited to start with so
41:24 - it's just really going to depend on the
41:26 - exposure that your students have
41:27 - had to coding prior to that sometimes if
41:31 - i
41:31 - have kiddos that are around that age
41:34 - range it might be best to start them
41:36 - with beaver achiever just to get them
41:37 - excited about it sometimes the switch
41:39 - from block based to tech space can be a
41:40 - bit challenging
41:42 - although nine years old is about the
41:44 - sweet spot for getting them into coding
41:46 - adventure but sometimes just to kind of
41:47 - get them hyped about coding itself and
41:49 - really ready for that next step
41:51 - sometimes the beaver achiever can be a
41:53 - good starting point i also think it's a
41:55 - very fun
41:56 - course so it's it's really good for
41:59 - anyone to kind of check out and then um
42:02 - molly our panelists also shared with you
42:03 - you can always go to codemonkey.com
42:06 - courses or in our help center we do have
42:08 - some good articles regarding that as
42:10 - well
42:11 - um for just some kind of help there
42:14 - another question
42:14 - here that we got from our
42:18 - questions for registration was how
42:21 - best to teach functions and variables so
42:24 - a good question
42:25 - about questions and you know how to
42:28 - teach functions and variables i
42:30 - definitely recommend when you're
42:31 - teaching
42:32 - variables to use
42:35 - the skill mode challenges and have your
42:37 - students practice those skill mode
42:39 - challenges
42:40 - um something i'm not sure um
42:44 - when you started using codemonkey or or
42:46 - that but
42:47 - let me show you a couple of components
42:49 - about the variables itself
42:51 - so we recently added something to the
42:54 - variables
42:55 - page and the variables challenges here
42:58 - and so i'll just go right into
43:02 - one of the variables themselves so i
43:04 - recommend that the students work on
43:05 - these variables here
43:07 - and then work on those variable
43:08 - challenges but let's say i go to
43:10 - challenge
43:18 - 46. i have to remember which challenge
43:20 - is the best one to showcase to you so
43:22 - here we see
43:23 - i'll just kind of talk through this
43:25 - really really quickly
43:27 - so basically what we see here is
43:29 - obviously the stage on the left the
43:30 - script
43:31 - and text editor on the right hand side
43:33 - and here we see
43:35 - a variable so variable is a container it
43:37 - contains an inform
43:38 - it contains a value and the value here
43:41 - that we have is 5.
43:42 - y is the value of 5 here well we can see
43:45 - that we can either
43:46 - pick up the ruler and measure the
43:48 - distance or in this number line here it
43:50 - actually tells us what the distance is
43:53 - oh i'm sorry i realized i wasn't sharing
43:56 - that's my fault
43:57 - good good point here okay so i'm on
43:59 - challenge
44:00 - 46 on coding adventure and so i'll just
44:02 - kind of walk through this really quickly
44:04 - so we have
44:05 - the monkey here and we have some values
44:07 - on the number lines and here we see that
44:09 - d
44:09 - is container and the d is the container
44:11 - value for five we set it as five because
44:13 - we know that's how much he needs to move
44:16 - and then um we'll see that he also is
44:20 - then next gonna need to move a distance
44:22 - of
44:22 - five so what do we do so we know that
44:25 - the very first step that this monkey is
44:27 - going to take
44:28 - is going to be that value of five then
44:31 - we set it to turn right like anything
44:33 - else and then what we have here
44:35 - is a variable statement so
44:39 - basically what do we want it to increase
44:41 - well we know that five
44:43 - plus five is ten so we want it to
44:45 - actually
44:46 - increase by a difference of five
44:49 - so what we'll see here and then we'll
44:51 - run it so when it gets to the statement
44:54 - it's adding the value it's either
44:57 - adding it's like an additive pattern or
44:59 - it's a
45:01 - subtraction so it's it's taking it's
45:03 - either adding or taking away and so
45:05 - here we're going to add a value of 5 and
45:08 - that means that the new container will
45:10 - be 10. so i want you to pay attention
45:12 - here
45:12 - at the bottom basically where the
45:14 - buttons are
45:16 - and you're able to see this so here we
45:17 - can see the value is
45:19 - five and then when we got to that
45:20 - variable statement
45:22 - the value changed to ten and so that's
45:25 - just a really good way to kind of show
45:27 - that a little bit more
45:30 - so about the variables and then
45:32 - practicing those variables when you get
45:34 - to those skill mode challenges i also
45:36 - recommend checking out those coding
45:37 - concepts that i had mentioned
45:39 - um there either checking out the
45:42 - variables here
45:43 - or checking that out from the help
45:44 - center article
45:46 - um and then with functions i'll just
45:49 - briefly go to a function that i know is
45:51 - a
45:51 - tricky part so these so there are
45:53 - functions here this is
45:54 - more complex functions here um so
45:57 - i'll just kind of talk through what we
45:59 - see here so instead of having the monkey
46:01 - we have
46:02 - a rat and the rat has to collect matches
46:06 - and then the rat has to take the match
46:09 - back to the pile
46:11 - so we basically set the function
46:14 - we're basically naming this function it
46:16 - could be anything here i just named it
46:18 - go to
46:19 - and we have a placeholder the
46:21 - placeholder is a it doesn't have
46:23 - any value at all all we're saying is
46:26 - that every time we write
46:27 - go to we want it to turn to whatever
46:30 - object we've determined
46:32 - and then step the distance to that
46:34 - specific object
46:35 - so here we can see that we want it to
46:37 - every time we run go to so what it's
46:39 - going to do it's going to turn to the
46:40 - bridge
46:41 - and step the distance to the bridge then
46:43 - it's going to turn to the match
46:44 - and step the distance to the match and
46:46 - then it's going to
46:48 - grab it and drop it so we're going to
46:51 - see that it's going to be a short code
46:53 - but you'll also see it's running here
46:54 - what is a
46:55 - representing it represented the match
46:58 - and it represented the bridge
46:59 - now there was an extra step i needed to
47:01 - go to the pile
47:03 - but we can see it here a is the bridge a
47:05 - is the match
47:06 - then it's the bridge and then it's going
47:08 - to the pile so
47:09 - a is just kind of a placeholder so we
47:12 - added this
47:13 - new um you know functions box
47:16 - descriptions box to kind of help with
47:18 - that so
47:19 - just some things i recommend um with
47:21 - that
47:22 - so i think there were
47:26 - not any more questions here let me just
47:29 - check our q a here
47:31 - is there a way to see more difficult
47:32 - coding classes
47:34 - in the free trial to see how much more
47:36 - complex it will become um billy i think
47:38 - it would be best
47:39 - to get in contact with our sales team so
47:41 - you can contact sales codemonkey.com
47:44 - and we can kind of help you with that
47:46 - and just depending on you know kind of
47:47 - what things you're looking at and just
47:49 - want to make sure that we're able to
47:50 - meet your needs
47:51 - in the best way possible
47:55 - all right so um i just wanted to
47:58 - mention i'm just going to do one more
48:00 - screen share here we are going to be
48:02 - doing our first ever twitter chat
48:05 - march 23rd at 6 p.m central and that's
48:08 - going to be led by
48:09 - our teacher ambassadors paige and javier
48:13 - and they're going to be discussing
48:14 - synchronous and asynchronous
48:17 - coding so if you're available we hope
48:19 - you can join us during that time if not
48:21 - share chat with other people hopefully
48:23 - they'll also
48:24 - be um just as excited as we are about
48:27 - this twitter chat that we'll be hosting
48:29 - and it's our very first one so it's
48:30 - pretty exciting
48:33 - um okay so
