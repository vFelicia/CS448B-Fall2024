00:54 - all right everyone thank you for joining
00:56 - our last session of the day to come and
00:59 - learn with us this is a student's guide
01:00 - to learning with code monkey so it's not
01:02 - really a teacher centered webinar
01:04 - obviously feel free to join us students
01:07 - and all of our attendees if you don't
01:10 - mind just raising your hand just so I
01:11 - know that you can hear me and if you're
01:13 - not sure where to do that you can do
01:15 - that in the participants and when you
01:17 - click on participants you'll a blur you
01:19 - will be able to see the hand raised at
01:21 - hand and lower
01:26 - all right perfect awesome okay so we're
01:29 - gonna go ahead and get started
01:31 - so always when doing some video
01:34 - conferencing and things like that I
01:35 - always like to talk about a little bit
01:36 - of etiquette this is a little bit
01:38 - different because we are doing it with
01:40 - you as your students so being on time
01:42 - making sure that you're always 5 to 10
01:44 - minutes early before the meeting
01:46 - everyone is muted today but if you have
01:48 - any questions please feel free to answer
01:50 - to ask them in the Q&A box and if you're
01:54 - not sure how to do that on your toolbar
01:55 - you see a little Q&A icon and you'll be
01:58 - able to click right there to answer any
01:59 - questions as far as the presentation
02:02 - just making sure that you're always in a
02:03 - good spot of here on camera making sure
02:05 - you have headphones and then when you're
02:07 - using the Q&A box please make sure that
02:08 - you are using school appropriate
02:10 - language and then if you need to use any
02:13 - signals or anything like that just go
02:15 - ahead and raise your hand for the most
02:17 - part we'll be able to interact with you
02:19 - best in the Q&A box okay so my name is
02:24 - Leena Saleh and I am the professional
02:27 - development manager here at code monkey
02:29 - I did teach in the classroom for about
02:31 - 10 years and I worked with students from
02:32 - K through 8 working in technology so if
02:36 - you have any questions or anything like
02:41 - that feel free to email me or reach out
02:43 - to me on Twitter so I just want to
02:48 - a little bit of backstory about code
02:50 - monkey so code monkey was founded in
02:52 - 2014 the CEO and Jonathan and his
02:57 - brother and his childhood best friend
03:00 - actually developed the company they are
03:02 - computer programmers and they were
03:04 - working with students and just notice
03:05 - that a lot of students didn't really
03:07 - want to learn in the same way you know
03:11 - that computer programmers did it was
03:13 - very boring so that's how kind of how
03:14 - code monkey was born so today we are
03:18 - going to be working on code monkey
03:20 - lessons and challenges one through five
03:22 - 11 through 15 will be focusing on some
03:26 - coding vocabulary and computational
03:29 - thinking as well as to get coding with
03:32 - code monkey I see a couple of other
03:34 - people joining from previous sessions
03:38 - and lessons just want to let you guys
03:40 - know that this is the same lesson that I
03:42 - have them in a few previous seventh
03:44 - session so if you have joined us before
03:46 - just know that it is the same thing ok
03:50 - so before we get started I actually want
03:53 - to just kind of take a temperature
03:54 - reading to kind of see everyone's
03:56 - background and just see how comfortable
03:58 - you are with coding so I'm going to
04:00 - launch this poll I'm gonna give everyone
04:02 - just a couple of minutes well just about
04:05 - a minute to go ahead and take this poll
04:15 - you
04:24 - we're going to do just about 10 more
04:26 - seconds just so I can get a good read
04:29 - right now we have 33 people so just
04:30 - waiting for a little bit more of you to
04:32 - go ahead and take the poll
04:57 - you
05:03 - okay so I'm just sharing a little bit of
05:05 - the results with you most of you the
05:08 - average is that most of you are
05:10 - beginners here which is great it's
05:12 - exactly what we want you to be you're
05:13 - still familiar about learning you're a
05:15 - decent coder and then have you use code
05:19 - monkey before mostly video not so this
05:20 - is great because this is a perfect
05:22 - introductory and then just wondering
05:23 - what grade levels you are it so the
05:26 - average grade level is fourth grade
05:28 - basically second through fifth grade all
05:32 - right so now we're gonna go ahead and
05:35 - get back started so the very first thing
05:38 - about being a computer programmer is
05:39 - obviously understanding the computer
05:42 - vocabulary that's associated with that
05:44 - so we're going to talk about what an
05:45 - algorithm is what a function is and then
05:47 - basically the the basic directions we'll
05:50 - be learning today about functions are
05:52 - step and turn so an algorithm is a set
05:57 - of steps to solve a problem so any kind
06:00 - of mapping or anything that we basically
06:02 - have to do so anything that requires
06:03 - some kind of planning so if you think
06:06 - about on a traditional day when you're
06:07 - getting ready to go to school you will
06:11 - have a certain of prep of preparation
06:14 - needed to kind of get there or maybe if
06:16 - you're going to sports camp or something
06:19 - like that you'll have a certain amount
06:20 - of planning you might want to bring your
06:21 - snacks you have a certain order of kind
06:24 - of how you get outside of the door so
06:25 - that's a set of set of step-by-step
06:28 - directions that you will kind of use
06:30 - when doing an algorithm so we're gonna
06:31 - go ahead and look at my favorite video
06:33 - which is about an algorithm and this
06:36 - will just give you a little bit of
06:37 - background now if we want a computer to
06:41 - understand how to do something we need
06:43 - to give it an algorithm first algorithm
06:47 - signs like a big word doesn't it
06:50 - actually an algorithm is something very
06:53 - simple not important for us an algorithm
06:57 - is a list of steps you'd give computer
06:59 - to solve a problem or get something done
07:02 - imagine that you need to show someone or
07:05 - you brush your teeth the way you learn
07:07 - how to do it themselves all the little
07:11 - steps you do in the right order
07:15 - confused like rats one toothpaste on the
07:23 - toothbrush three open your mouth or
07:27 - brush your teeth nicely
07:29 - five mention life with water six smile
07:34 - it is important to explain the right
07:36 - steps in the right order so you can get
07:38 - great results
07:39 - [Music]
07:45 - so that's just a little video that I
07:48 - like to share to talk about what an
07:50 - algorithm is and will actually identify
07:52 - an algorithm when we kind of get moving
07:55 - while we start coding so now that we
07:58 - know kind of when algorithm is that it's
08:00 - a set of step by step directions that
08:01 - requires a little bit of planning like
08:03 - brushing your teeth or learning how to
08:04 - ride your bike or anything like that all
08:08 - right so the next thing that we have is
08:10 - our step in turn so both step and turn
08:12 - are functions and they both have
08:14 - associated arguments so an argument do
08:17 - we want it to do so let me tell the
08:18 - monkey to step we're asking him how far
08:21 - and when we asked the monkey to turn we
08:24 - also are designated a certain degree
08:28 - turn that the monkey will actually go
08:30 - through so we'll talk about that when we
08:32 - get into the platform itself the next
08:35 - thing that's pretty important outside of
08:37 - those two terms that we're going to be
08:39 - working with today is understanding what
08:41 - computational thinking is so
08:43 - computational thinking is can be seen in
08:46 - all things that we do school-wide
08:47 - whether it's social studies or science
08:49 - or math or even art it's you know those
08:53 - special areas is really just recognizing
08:55 - those kinds of things so there's four
08:57 - parts to computational thinking
08:59 - the first is abstraction so that's
09:00 - focusing on what is relevant and
09:03 - filtering out unnecessary information so
09:05 - if you think about yourself maybe you're
09:08 - going to an amusement park
09:10 - so what we kind of want to know about
09:12 - the amusement part is did you have a
09:13 - good time and what you wore to the
09:16 - amusement park is not necessarily
09:17 - important information so we filter that
09:20 - out of the story it's not necessary it
09:21 - doesn't really have anything to do with
09:23 - the ultimate goal of the story this is
09:25 - really important when you're also doing
09:26 - some summaries and some things and
09:29 - language arts or even if you're doing a
09:31 - science experiment making sure that you
09:33 - have the focus of what is actually
09:35 - important then we have pattern
09:38 - recognition so that's observing trends
09:40 - this is really relevant in math concepts
09:43 - or in science when you're looking at
09:45 - graphs and you're able to see kind of
09:47 - looking at the data and just kind of
09:48 - saying is there a pattern and what it is
09:50 - that we're seeing then there's also the
09:52 - algorithmic design which is what we just
09:54 - talked about and algorithm and then
09:56 - there's decomposition that's looking
09:58 - what the big problem is and instead of
10:00 - like when you're doing a project you
10:02 - break it up and those smaller pieces
10:04 - that's the decomposition so now what
10:09 - we're gonna do is I'm going to show you
10:10 - how to sign in first and then I'm gonna
10:13 - give you the username and password so if
10:15 - you already have an account that's
10:17 - perfect
10:18 - okay but for today I would like you to
10:19 - go ahead and use the same account that
10:21 - we are kind of going to be using
10:23 - together so what I did is I went to code
10:25 - monkey comm and add code monkey comm in
10:30 - the right-hand corner I click login and
10:33 - this will bring me to the log in box in
10:38 - the email username and the password you
10:42 - are going to enter in the username as
10:45 - webinar and the password as monkey once
10:50 - you have done so I would like for you to
10:52 - raise your hand so I know how far you've
11:00 - gotten or that you're there with me some
11:03 - other sessions some people have gotten
11:05 - stuck or or that kind of thing so just
11:07 - let us know if that is the case for you
11:13 - and we'll do our best to help you
11:21 - you
11:26 - okay so it looks like overall almost
11:29 - every single person is in so I'm gonna
11:31 - go ahead and get logged in as well with
11:33 - you so remember it's webinar and then
11:35 - the password is monkey with a capital
11:38 - and the number one and now I just click
11:41 - login now that I've gotten logged in
11:45 - you'll see that at the if you've been a
11:47 - code monkey before then it's changed a
11:49 - little bit otherwise if not it's brand
11:51 - new to you so over here on the left hand
11:53 - side is where you'll get to all of your
11:54 - courses when you create creations which
11:57 - we're not going to be doing that today
11:59 - that's where they're all be held and
12:01 - then in the discover feature our games
12:03 - and challenges that have been created by
12:04 - other students like you after this
12:07 - webinar today this username and password
12:09 - will not be valid so just keep that in
12:10 - mind so today we're going to be working
12:13 - in coding adventure so what I want
12:15 - everyone to do is find coding adventure
12:17 - part one go ahead and click on it those
12:21 - students who are in here you will need
12:23 - to have another browser or open up a web
12:25 - page that you can actually see on the
12:28 - code monkey page and go along with us so
12:33 - for the case of this I am using the same
12:35 - username and password as you as well so
12:37 - I'm going to go ahead and mute
12:39 - everything what I want you to go ahead
12:41 - and do is click on the challenge map
12:43 - when you click on the challenge map and
12:45 - the double arrows at the top that will
12:49 - take us back to the very beginning so
12:51 - when I do so I will go ahead and click
12:54 - on challenge number one and what we see
12:59 - here is we have Gordo and Gordo is our
13:01 - teacher assistant he pops up with tips
13:03 - and directions and anything I may know
13:06 - now what happens typically I'm a student
13:08 - and I don't like to read that much so I
13:10 - click out of the box and I didn't even
13:12 - remember what the directions were so I
13:14 - say what do I do
13:15 - you can always click on Gordo for any
13:17 - directions so I have some kind of a code
13:21 - here on the right-hand side this is our
13:23 - code editor that means where all of our
13:25 - code will go is on the right-hand side
13:27 - we want to see how the code works we
13:29 - click the Run button if we want to reset
13:31 - we can just reset the code over here on
13:33 - the left-hand side is our stage which is
13:36 - what is happening with our text so as
13:38 - the text is run
13:39 - something is happening over here on the
13:41 - left-hand side anything that I hover
13:44 - over with white text is an object and it
13:46 - will actually type out on the screen for
13:48 - us if need be so if I'm not a perfect
13:50 - speller that kind of happens also the
13:53 - language that we use in code monkey this
13:56 - coding adventure dota does math and game
13:58 - builder courses is called CoffeeScript
14:00 - CoffeeScript is a shorter version of the
14:02 - language it just means it doesn't have
14:04 - things like a semicolon or brackets
14:07 - inside of it it's just very clear and
14:10 - concise the goal of our all of our
14:12 - challenges is to always write the
14:14 - shortest most concise code that we can
14:16 - possible so what I'm going to do is I'm
14:18 - just gonna click run because I have code
14:19 - here we always debug a challenge when
14:21 - there's pre-built code the tip told me
14:24 - to use step 15 instead of step 10
14:27 - however I see this ruler here and I want
14:29 - to verify that that is in fact the
14:31 - distance that I set so I pick up my
14:32 - ruler and I'm going to measure for the
14:34 - distance when I do I'm going to type it
14:37 - here and I'm going to click run hooray I
14:43 - solved this challenge gordo gives me a
14:45 - little tip and you'll see here I got two
14:47 - stars I would like for you to either
14:50 - enter in the enter in the chat box I
14:52 - mean in the Q&A box why you think that I
14:54 - only got two stars on this challenge
14:57 - rather than three
15:06 - you
15:10 - so Wendy I saw that you raised your hand
15:12 - if you can just enter in the Q&A box I'd
15:14 - be helpful the question is why did I
15:17 - only get two stars instead of three
15:31 - okay that is correct I use more than one
15:34 - line of code the goal remember is to
15:37 - write the shortest most concise code so
15:39 - I can always go back did I fail this
15:41 - challenge I did not but there's always a
15:44 - more concise way to do it so now I have
15:49 - reached three star solution and now I'm
15:53 - going to do is I am going to let you
15:55 - work through challenge number five so
15:59 - you're doing challenges one through five
16:00 - when you're finished I would like you to
16:02 - raise your hand so I know that we can
16:05 - continue on to the next portion and I
16:07 - will meet you at challenge number five
16:17 - you
16:42 - and I will be working alongside you as I
16:45 - go
16:47 - if you notice the monkey does have a
16:48 - wristwatch on so that helps us to know
16:51 - which direction we would like for him to
16:52 - turn
16:55 - and it is on his left wrist
17:01 - you
17:04 - you
17:07 - okay I'm almost a challenge number five
17:09 - I hope you're getting close to me
17:15 - I see just about four attendees have
17:18 - reached challenge number five so I hope
17:20 - you're getting close
17:22 - you
17:27 - you guys are doing rock star coding over
17:30 - here
17:38 - okay remember to raise your hand when
17:41 - you've gotten to challenge number five
17:50 - you
17:52 - okay great it looks like the majority of
17:54 - you are with me so that's amazing all
17:57 - right so there's something different and
18:00 - unique about this challenge then
18:02 - something that we've seen before you can
18:04 - enter in the Q&A box why you think you
18:09 - may why this challenge looks different
18:11 - than anything that we have done before
18:15 - you
18:19 - you
18:23 - okay so there are some obstacles here as
18:25 - well so something we might not have seen
18:29 - before in the other challenges if you
18:33 - think about something that we worked on
18:34 - earlier is there something that we have
18:37 - not gotten the chance to see before okay
18:41 - good so there's multiple steps to reach
18:43 - the banana so that means this is
18:45 - actually the first time that we truly
18:47 - see an algorithm so this is where it
18:51 - requires some set of planning to get to
18:55 - now I'm going to show you a common
18:59 - mistake that might be made here and you
19:03 - will see that I made an error in
19:05 - capitalizing step and it says I don't
19:08 - know what step is we have to make sure
19:09 - that we are keeping with the right
19:11 - syntax to make sure that we are able to
19:14 - order to correctly get to the it I'm
19:19 - sorry so we can correctly make sure that
19:21 - the computer understands what it is that
19:23 - we're doing so the computer will let you
19:28 - know when it doesn't understand
19:29 - something so something regarding
19:31 - spelling or anything like that
19:44 - you
19:47 - okay my apologies alright so now that we
19:51 - have actually worked through that those
19:54 - first five set of challenges we are
19:56 - going to start we are going to learn
19:58 - something new so we're moving on to the
20:01 - next story map and I would like you to
20:03 - click on challenge number eleven objects
20:05 - and friends
20:08 - so in challenge 11 we see something new
20:11 - we see the function of turn two
20:14 - instead of saying turn right or turn
20:16 - left or turn 45 degrees we can see that
20:19 - we can specifically step to an object so
20:22 - when what we do is the monkey is no
20:25 - longer turning right or turning left we
20:27 - say and we want it to turn to a specific
20:29 - object so that's just something to note
20:33 - here okay
20:38 - so I'm gonna skip to a different
20:40 - challenge different challenge here and
20:43 - make sure that I want to go over there
20:46 - one more thing with you before we get
20:47 - close here to the end of the challenge
20:49 - and then you guys are going to work
20:50 - together so what we're going to do is if
20:55 - you saw Gordo just told us that that was
20:57 - a function of turn two I am going to go
21:00 - - you guys are going to continue staying
21:02 - where you are I'm going to go to
21:07 - challenge number 13 and challenge 13 is
21:12 - something different than we've seen
21:13 - before
21:15 - before we have seen that there is only
21:19 - one character on the screen that's
21:21 - moving and/or on our stage that's moving
21:23 - and that character is the monkey so what
21:28 - coding Adventure does for you is that
21:31 - you don't have to associate what we call
21:33 - an object tag with the monkey because
21:35 - the computer automatically assumes that
21:36 - the object is the monkey itself so in
21:40 - this case we don't have to assume
21:43 - however we need the computer to identify
21:46 - who else is moving and in this case we
21:50 - need the turtle if I don't enter the
21:53 - period the computer will not understand
21:56 - that so turtle
21:59 - dot is an object tack just like we did
22:02 - with the object tag at the monkey we do
22:03 - the object tag of the turtle and this is
22:05 - important so we know who's moving so the
22:08 - turtle will need to move
22:11 - so we have to make sure that we are
22:13 - earth doing the correct number of
22:17 - distance for the turtle to move so we
22:20 - just learned when an object tag was and
22:21 - the function of turn two so what I would
22:24 - like for you to do now is work through
22:25 - 11 through 15 once you work through 11
22:28 - through 15 just know it's okay if you
22:31 - get a one-star the first time there's no
22:32 - problem in failing many developers in
22:35 - Google and Facebook and all of those
22:37 - places they fail quite often when
22:40 - they're coding and a lot of times it has
22:42 - to do with those syntax on pages and
22:43 - pages and pages of code and the code
22:45 - will have to do that they had an error
22:47 - within their syntax so just keep that in
22:49 - mind that that happens and it's just
22:50 - always there's no problem with failure
22:52 - we call that I would like to call it
22:54 - failing forward so trying again until
22:56 - you get it right it's kind of like when
22:57 - you ride a bike the first time you are
22:58 - not an expert and you continue learning
23:01 - and eventually if you practice enough
23:03 - you can do some really cool tricks and
23:04 - things like that so I'm going to let you
23:07 - guys work through 11 through 15 when you
23:09 - have finished working through 11 through
23:11 - 15 just raise your hand so I can know
23:15 - that you are all on the same page with
23:16 - me and then we'll get moving to the next
23:18 - part
23:26 - you
23:35 - and those of you that can't see your
23:38 - screen or your you're looking at me
23:40 - while you're doing this call just make
23:42 - sure that you kind of have different
23:44 - pages
23:45 - you know toggling between the two pages
23:46 - having two different pages open and if
23:50 - you're still stuck you can let us know
23:52 - and we'll do our best to help you and
23:55 - we'll also give you some tips for what
23:57 - to do when you get stuck so we're going
24:04 - to give you just about another minute to
24:06 - work through those challenges to
24:08 - challenge fifteen
24:16 - you
24:35 - those of you that are struggling between
24:37 - tabs you'll see here I have my
24:40 - presentation open and I have another tab
24:43 - here open for code monkey and so you're
24:47 - not able to see my full screen because I
24:49 - am sharing a portion of my screen but I
24:51 - would click from one window this is
24:53 - called a window for the next window when
24:56 - I'm trying to work through things so you
25:01 - can just click the clicks plus line if
25:03 - you're in on Google or if you're
25:07 - wherever in with the zoom you just move
25:10 - it over so I just move it to the side so
25:13 - that I'm able to see it
25:27 - okay I'm gonna work through 15 with you
25:31 - you'll see that this is an assessment
25:33 - challenge so this is the first time this
25:36 - is not the first time that this means
25:37 - that there's no pre-built code inside of
25:39 - here so it's just an assessment
25:40 - challenge so I know that I need to use
25:43 - the turtle so that I can get the monkey
25:46 - across to the across to the banana and I
25:52 - have a little bit of thinking that kind
25:53 - of goes through here so I'm planning it
25:58 - out trying to see what's going to be
25:59 - work best and sometimes I just wrote
26:01 - right or line of code and debug it
26:05 - and other times I might write out all
26:08 - the code so but it's easier for me to
26:09 - see where the error is when we work
26:11 - through it like that awesome you guys
26:15 - did a great job we worked on functions
26:17 - what an algorithm was a function is step
26:22 - with the argument of whatever we want it
26:24 - to so step 10 sep 2013 11 and we also
26:35 - learn turn to and what an object tag
26:37 - list so you actually learned five really
26:40 - important vocabulary terms to help you
26:42 - with computer science and programming
26:47 - so if you're wondering how do you get
26:49 - logged in when you're finished our team
26:51 - is going to be sending a this recording
26:55 - to your teachers as well as a way to
26:56 - request free access for coab it 19
27:00 - subscription and we want you to
27:02 - obviously continue coding now this is a
27:06 - great question a common question we've
27:07 - had what do you do when you get stuck so
27:10 - one question is to send a message to
27:12 - your teacher or maybe ask a friend for
27:14 - help review past challenges so in code
27:17 - monkeys coding adventure you can always
27:19 - go back to previous challenges that you
27:21 - played just like when I got to star
27:23 - solutions and those things I went back
27:25 - and I tried them again so you can always
27:27 - go back up you're feeling stuck and you
27:30 - can use super hints so what happens is
27:33 - when I missed a lot of times on my
27:37 - screen gordo will pop up with a text
27:40 - bubble and his text bubble will be a
27:42 - super hint for you and teachers can turn
27:46 - those off as well so now that we've
27:50 - worked through those coding challenges
27:52 - we've done quite a lot today if you have
27:55 - any questions please put them in the Q&A
27:56 - box and we will get to them as fast as
28:00 - we can
28:07 - you
28:19 - teachers I know that there are a few of
28:22 - you teachers on here so just an essence
28:24 - of time we have a couple of minutes I
28:29 - would like to show you the new the
28:31 - teacher side of things has also changed

28:52 - some ways to kind of navigate that
28:54 - new screen all right so we have worked
28:58 - through those challenges kind of went
29:01 - over how to get into coding adventure
29:03 - itself and kind of what how to use the
29:05 - ruler and what Gordo was for how to go
29:08 - back and revisit past challenges so we
29:11 - want to thank you so much for spending
