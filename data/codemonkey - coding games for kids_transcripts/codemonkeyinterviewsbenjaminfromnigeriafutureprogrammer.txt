00:01 - hi my name is Benjamin Edward I'm a
00:05 - Nigerian I'm 24 years old
00:10 - I am I'm trying to become a web
00:13 - developer in front-end full stack
00:16 - developing and I'm currently doing HTML
00:20 - CSS and
00:22 - with that with time I'm trying to start
00:24 - up with JavaScript and for now CSS is
00:29 - still kind of difficult but you know
00:31 - there's no obstacles we can if you just
00:34 - tell me to overcome
00:40 - um initially I I was an administrative
00:44 - musical Administrative Assistant back in
00:47 - Nigeria and I did some odd Works which
00:51 - is usually someone who
00:55 - um who is a graduate wouldn't want to do
00:57 - but you know with time we see that Tech
01:00 - is the future and you have to
01:04 - you have to go into the flow and develop
01:08 - yourself for the future because the
01:11 - future is Tech because AI is taking
01:13 - place and you know and now I'm trying to
01:17 - learn and develop in the experts
01:20 - development
01:26 - um yeah because programming itself it's
01:30 - a field where you can program what's in
01:33 - your mind like you want to design a
01:35 - particular
01:37 - um let's let's take a website for
01:38 - instance you want to design a website
01:41 - and a particular layout that is in your
01:44 - mind you can use programming to arrange
01:46 - the layer at
01:49 - how you want it to be and
01:52 - you can program you make programming at
01:55 - what any design you want so programming
01:57 - itself is creativity
02:04 - programming in English is not a program
02:06 - problem for me because Nigeria is an
02:09 - English-speaking country by officially
02:11 - because we were colonized by the British
02:14 - so we all speak English and right from
02:18 - there to speak English so English is
02:20 - nothing but
02:22 - if we are in a country where it doesn't
02:24 - speak English you can also learn with
02:27 - the words it's not that serious because
02:29 - when you're learning it's same
02:33 - um coding line so you can practice it
02:35 - when you over view the tutorials one two
02:38 - three times you must die you don't have
02:40 - to learn how to speak English yes
02:43 - it's something you can learn
02:47 - so my long time ago in programming I
02:52 - I want to
02:54 - find myself in the security architecture
02:57 - where I can be among the expertise that
03:02 - are trying to solve security issues by
03:05 - using programming
03:11 - programming is not that's really scary
03:14 - but when you just starts you might feel
03:17 - oh it's scary but when you do it once
03:20 - two three times you see that yes it's
03:24 - kind of friendly but
03:27 - you just have to devote more time and
03:30 - but when you say okay you you're
03:33 - programming and um you say that the
03:35 - video having a headache or something you
03:38 - can just okay take a break programming
03:40 - is not that difficult
03:43 - awesome okay thank you so much Benjamin
03:46 - you're welcome good luck in your future
03:48 - and thanks for taking the time to
03:50 - interview with us
