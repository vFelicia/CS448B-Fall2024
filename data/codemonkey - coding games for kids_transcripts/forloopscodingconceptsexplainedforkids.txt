00:04 - hello welcome to the four forest
00:07 - let's learn about four loops
00:12 - use a for loop to repeat code for each
00:15 - item in an array
00:17 - so for example if you had an array
00:19 - called bananas
00:21 - and there were 10 bananas in the array
00:25 - if you say for b
00:28 - in
00:28 - bananas
00:30 - this for loop is going to
00:33 - repeat for each banana in the array so
00:37 - it's going to loop 10 times
00:40 - and each time this variable b will hold
00:46 - a given banana so the first time through
00:50 - b
00:51 - is going to be the banana with index
00:53 - zero
00:54 - the second time it will be
00:57 - the banana in bananas with index one
01:02 - and so on all the way through all the
01:04 - bananas however if bananas just had
01:07 - three bananas
01:09 - in it
01:11 - it would loop three times
01:13 - let's look at an example
01:17 - here's a challenge where we have
01:20 - six banana objects
01:23 - and each of these bananas are in an
01:25 - array
01:27 - called bananas
01:29 - here we have bananas with index zero so
01:32 - each of these bananas have a different
01:34 - index
01:36 - and since there's six of them the index
01:38 - is 0 through 5.
01:42 - now if we look at the code we know we
01:44 - want the monkey to pick up all those
01:46 - bananas
01:47 - so if we look at the code we're using a
01:51 - for loop
01:52 - for b in banana so this is the name of
01:55 - the array
01:57 - and because there are six bananas in
02:00 - this array this for loop will repeat
02:04 - six times
02:05 - each time
02:07 - b
02:08 - which is a variable
02:10 - will
02:12 - b
02:12 - will store
02:14 - a different banana
02:16 - so the first time through b is
02:20 - bananas with index zero
02:23 - the next time through b is
02:26 - bananas with index one
02:29 - and so on all the way to bananas with
02:32 - index five
02:34 - so it repeats six times
02:37 - and the first time through when we say
02:39 - turn to b we're really saying turn to
02:42 - bananas with index zero
02:44 - and step the distance to bananas with
02:47 - index zero
02:49 - and then the next time through
02:51 - we will be turning to bananas with index
02:54 - 1 and stepping the distance to
02:57 - bananas with index 1.
03:01 - now one
03:02 - point i want to make is b
03:05 - is only valid within this for loop
03:08 - if i use b
03:10 - outside of this for loop it would not
03:14 - work
03:15 - you know
03:16 - the program would not recognize b
03:19 - it's only valid within the loop let's
03:21 - look at it let's go ahead and run this
03:23 - first and then we'll look at another
03:25 - example
03:26 - you see how
03:29 - it's nice how we see what b is each time
03:32 - b is bananas four b is bananas with
03:35 - index five
03:39 - [Applause]
03:41 - here's a challenge with turtles
03:44 - we could see in the challenge that we
03:47 - want the monkey to
03:49 - step onto the turtle
03:51 - and then have the turtle move to the
03:53 - banana
03:55 - and then the monkey to step onto
03:58 - this turtle and have the turtle move to
04:00 - the banana and then have the monkey step
04:02 - onto the last turtle and then have the
04:04 - turtle go to the banana
04:06 - so we have three turtles and three
04:08 - bananas
04:10 - uh
04:11 - you have to decide sometimes which array
04:14 - you want to loop on
04:15 - and we have the starter code that tells
04:18 - us we are looping on the turtles
04:21 - there's three turtles so how many times
04:23 - will this for loop repeat
04:26 - three times and each time t
04:29 - is going to be a different turtle
04:32 - so the
04:34 - so let's see we want to
04:36 - [Music]
04:38 - step
04:40 - we probably don't want to we want to
04:42 - step more than zero we want to step the
04:45 - distance to
04:47 - this
04:48 - turtle
04:49 - but we know that later on we're going to
04:51 - want to step to this turtle and then
04:53 - here we're going to want to step to this
04:55 - turtle
04:56 - so instead of
04:58 - saying
05:01 - you know turtles with index 0
05:04 - instead
05:05 - i'm going just to say
05:07 - step the distance to t
05:10 - because t will change each time through
05:14 - the loop
05:15 - and then we're going to have
05:18 - the turtle that the loop is working on
05:21 - step
05:23 - 10 let's just make sure that is 10.
05:26 - ah it's actually 20.
05:28 - so let's put 20 in here instead
05:32 - okay let's see how this works
05:35 - okay t is turtles with index zero
05:39 - now t is turtles with index one
05:43 - and now t is turtles with index two you
05:47 - see how flexible that is
05:51 - [Music]
05:54 - now that we have reviewed for loops it's
05:56 - your turn good luck
