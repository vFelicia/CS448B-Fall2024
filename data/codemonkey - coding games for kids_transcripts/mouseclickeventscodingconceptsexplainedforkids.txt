00:04 - welcome to click me let's learn about
00:08 - mouse click events
00:10 - clicking on your left mouse button on an
00:13 - object creates an event each object has
00:17 - an on click function that is called
00:20 - whenever you click on the object
00:22 - you can code the onclick function to do
00:26 - specific actions
00:28 - here here's an example of an on click
00:31 - function for the object monkey
00:36 - so because you would have this function
00:38 - in your code
00:40 - whenever you would click on the monkey
00:44 - it would
00:45 - make the monkey step three
00:48 - so when you write your on click
00:50 - functions just make sure you have the
00:52 - object name
00:53 - dot
00:54 - on click
00:56 - and then you could specify the actions
00:58 - you want to happen whenever you click on
01:01 - that object
01:03 - let's look at an example
01:06 - here's a challenge
01:08 - where we're going to use the on click
01:11 - function to make
01:12 - the monkey
01:14 - move
01:16 - our monkey object
01:17 - and also our turtle object
01:21 - in order to get our banana object
01:24 - so
01:25 - let's see we have the on click function
01:27 - already here for our monkey
01:30 - whenever we click on the monkey make the
01:32 - monkey step three
01:34 - so now let's add one for the turtle
01:37 - turtle
01:39 - that's our object
01:41 - and we have the on click function for it
01:44 - and we're going to tell the turtle
01:46 - to step
01:48 - let's say 5.
01:50 - now when i run this you're going to see
01:53 - a little finger
01:55 - like a little like it's clicking a
01:57 - little finger that's about to click
02:00 - appear above these objects just to tell
02:03 - you really quickly that the on click
02:05 - function is attached to
02:06 - it see it
02:09 - okay now i can click on the turtle
02:12 - and it's
02:13 - stepping five
02:15 - and then i'll click on the monkey and
02:17 - it's stepping three each time
02:19 - [Applause]
02:20 - there we go
02:24 - here's a challenge with three bananas
02:27 - and we want to have an on click function
02:29 - for each banana
02:31 - so
02:33 - one quick way to do that is i could have
02:36 - a for loop so for b in bananas
02:40 - i'm going to have an on click function
02:42 - for each of those bananas so i use b
02:47 - and then within that function i'm
02:49 - telling it for the monkey i'm telling
02:51 - the monkey to go to that banana
02:54 - so whatever banana i click on the monkey
02:56 - will go to that banana
03:00 - and then i also want to have a crocodile
03:02 - on click function
03:04 - what do we want the crocodile to do in
03:06 - this challenge
03:10 - probably turn so the monkey can get on
03:13 - get to the banana so we could say
03:16 - crocodile
03:18 - turn
03:19 - left
03:22 - okay now go ahead and run this
03:26 - now note that we do not have a on click
03:29 - function for the monkey
03:32 - so when i run it
03:34 - if i click on the monkey
03:36 - really nothing happens except it the
03:39 - monkey claps
03:41 - so it all but i can click on the
03:43 - crocodile
03:46 - okay now the
03:48 - if i click on the banana the monkey
03:50 - should go to that banana
03:53 - okay go to this banana
03:56 - what do i need to do next
03:58 - okay i'll turn the crocodile
04:01 - and then i'll click on this banana
04:06 - all right
04:08 - now it's your turn to use mouse click
04:11 - events good luck
