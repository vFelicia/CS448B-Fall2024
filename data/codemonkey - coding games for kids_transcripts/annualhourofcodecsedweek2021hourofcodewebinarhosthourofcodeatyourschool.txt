00:01 - okay everybody we are gonna go ahead and
00:03 - get started with today's event
00:07 - so welcome to the 2021 hour of code
00:10 - webinar series it is the start of our
00:13 - series or our webinar is the start of
00:15 - our hour of code kickoff event
00:18 - and so we're very thankful that you guys
00:20 - are spending the time with us today
00:28 - so welcome to our annual hour of code
00:31 - webinar the code monkey team wants to

01:38 - professional development certificate for
01:40 - the time that you have spent with us
01:42 - today so let's go ahead and get ready to
01:45 - write code catch bananas and save the
01:48 - world
01:52 - so first we always like to kick off by
01:54 - starting out by introducing who's
01:56 - joining us from the team

01:59 - so today you are joined by myself and i
02:02 - am lena saleh i'm the professional
02:04 - development manager
02:06 - um here at codemonkey you can reach out
02:08 - to me at lena codemonkey on twitter or
02:10 - you can send me an email if you have any
02:12 - questions following up today's
02:14 - webinar and i have been with codemonkey
02:16 - for now about
02:18 - um almost four years so this is i'm
02:20 - excited to do my fourth webinar this
02:22 - year with you all
02:23 - fourth year of our code webinar
02:26 - also joining us
02:30 - is my team
02:31 - [Music]
02:33 - brett eskelsen he is the vp of sales and
02:35 - so you can also reach out to him right
02:37 - at codemonkey.com if you have any
02:38 - questions we also have
02:41 - molly shubach she is our director of
02:44 - sales as well and you can reach her here
02:45 - at her email and they will be answering
02:47 - any questions alongside the chat box and
02:49 - we do have another member of our code
02:51 - mckee team joining us today and that's
02:53 - maya and she will be also answering
02:56 - those questions in the chat box i feel
02:57 - bad if her

03:03 - will be joining me today and answering
03:05 - any questions so feel free to ask those
03:07 - as they come up
03:11 - okay so what exactly will be even
03:13 - covering to the end today's webinar well
03:15 - we're going to talk about what is the
03:17 - hour of code
03:19 - codemonkeystory where to find us for the
03:21 - hour of code covering those hour of code
03:24 - courses that you'll have access to and
03:26 - the tips and tricks for setting up for
03:27 - an hour of code requiring the technical
03:30 - requirements teacher notes and teacher
03:32 - lesson plans and resources as well as
03:34 - leaving time
03:36 - to explore those courses and for q and a
03:43 - so what is the hour of code i'm sure
03:44 - most of you at this point have heard
03:46 - about the hour of code
03:48 - the hour of code is really just an
03:51 - introduction or giving students a taste
03:53 - to computer science i also like to say
03:55 - it's also giving teachers a taste for
03:57 - computer science it's really low risk
04:00 - and it allows everyone to explore
04:02 - computer science
04:03 - um
04:05 - in a fun way and i think once you start
04:07 - to explore and bring computer science
04:09 - and really the hour of code into your
04:11 - classroom you'll be hooked and so with
04:13 - your students so it really was designed
04:15 - to demystify
04:17 - code and show that anyone can really
04:18 - learn the basics of coding it breaks
04:21 - down many stereotypes and opens many
04:23 - doors there's also a lot of
04:26 - computational thinking problem solving
04:28 - collaboration and different skill sets
04:30 - that will assist students throughout any
04:32 - content areas
04:34 - that they
04:35 - are exposed to
04:37 - and just keep in mind
04:39 - um
04:40 - that the hour of code is really just
04:43 - designed to be a taste of hour of code a
04:45 - student isn't going to be walking away
04:47 - with a computer science degree at the
04:48 - end of the hour of code it's really just
04:51 - to give them an unintimidating way to be
04:53 - introduced to computer science so you
04:56 - always have access to any of our code
04:58 - courses all year long so if you don't do
05:01 - it this week during the computer science
05:02 - education week you do still have access
05:05 - to all of those courses all year long
05:09 - and
05:09 - this week or this next week for the
05:11 - computer science education week also
05:13 - known as the hour of code will
05:16 - you'll see many different activities and
05:18 - different
05:20 - exposure opportunities for your students
05:22 - during that
05:23 - during that week so feel free to take
05:24 - that risk
05:26 - so what are others saying about the
05:28 - importance of coding well we've seen
05:30 - people like mark zuckerberg and steve
05:32 - jobs and the ceo of microsoft talking
05:34 - about
05:35 - really the importance of coding and
05:37 - we've seen computer science really
05:39 - transition itself since 2013 when it
05:42 - very first started with its very first
05:43 - event with just a few courses
05:46 - um and now we there are hundreds over
05:48 - 200 actually partners that are part of
05:50 - the hour of code event
05:53 - what you'll see and some will have some
05:56 - really cool we have a really great
05:57 - article coming out blog post about
06:00 - computer science but computer science
06:01 - really trickles into anything from
06:04 - doing data sets at a baseball game to
06:06 - programming road signs and really more
06:09 - complex things like we see in big tech
06:11 - like facebook and twitter and instagram
06:13 - and all of those other things that we're
06:15 - being exposed to
06:18 - and there'll also be lots of twitter
06:19 - chats and things i forgot to mention
06:21 - throughout the week
06:22 - um so
06:24 - now we know exactly what the hour code
06:26 - is and kind of the backstory for the
06:28 - hour of code
06:29 - let's talk a little bit about codemonkey
06:31 - obviously we thank you so much for
06:33 - joining us so in 2014 the year after the
06:36 - first hour of code event code monkey's
06:38 - ceo and founder jonathan shore launched
06:41 - code monkey after working with kids and
06:43 - a lot of at-risk youth and just seeing
06:46 - how much they grasp the concepts
06:48 - versus
06:50 - how much better they grasp the coding
06:52 - concepts which can be really complex and
06:54 - the language can be very syntax heavy
06:56 - curly brackets semicolons all of those
06:59 - things can really trick students up but
07:01 - when they turned his brother and himself
07:04 - turned the game into
07:05 - turned the code into a game the students
07:08 - were hooked and like that they started
07:10 - to see the students were grasping
07:12 - concepts
07:13 - in a and they were excited about what
07:16 - they were doing so today codemonkey is a
07:18 - leading
07:19 - fun and intuitive curriculum for
07:21 - students in grades k through eight
07:23 - um where they do learn to code in many
07:25 - different programming languages first we
07:27 - just started out with coffeescript now
07:29 - we have blockbase and python so we have
07:31 - quite the variety of that as well so
07:35 - that's how codemonkey got started
07:37 - so what does make us a bit different
07:40 - is that codemonkey stems from an easy
07:43 - and game-like manner we really try to
07:45 - scaffold it it's more gamified students
07:47 - learn i'm in a more linear manner it's
07:50 - user-friendly and it's very intuitive
07:52 - for students we try to scaffold it as
07:54 - much as possible along the way
07:56 - and also what we really do really well
07:59 - is putting teachers in the driver's seat
08:01 - we have many tools and resources to make
08:03 - you feel successful as well because as
08:05 - teachers that's sometimes the biggest
08:07 - inhibiting factor is that
08:09 - most of us teaching the younger grade
08:11 - levels just don't have the background
08:13 - knowledge of being a computer science
08:14 - teacher i myself taught in the classroom
08:16 - as well when i first started teaching
08:18 - computer science back in actually 2013
08:20 - the first hour of code
08:23 - i just really didn't have the tools in
08:25 - my back pocket but when i started using
08:27 - the resources provided by hour of code i
08:29 - really started to grasp computer science
08:31 - as well and then i could have more
08:33 - robust conversations and really take
08:36 - that ownership for teaching code as well
08:38 - but we really do try to give you all of
08:39 - those tools so it's not intimidating for
08:41 - you to teach it with your students and
08:43 - to utilize it
08:45 - and it's also extremely easy to roll out
08:47 - being that it's completely web-based
08:50 - so let's talk about where can you even
08:52 - find the hour of code how can you get
08:54 - there what do you do well hour of code
08:57 - you can still go to code.org but now it
08:59 - is hourofcode.com
09:02 - and
09:04 - make sure i am sharing my screen here
09:08 - all right great um so it is
09:10 - hourofcode.com
09:12 - now um so it's all just one word or you
09:14 - can still go to code.org and there will
09:16 - be the hour of code listed there they
09:18 - just branch it off into a new web page
09:19 - with the more games and just to kind of
09:21 - help with keeping everything together
09:24 - so how you would find code monkey is i'm
09:26 - here on the hour of code.com page which
09:29 - they'll throw in the chat box here for
09:30 - you in just a few minutes
09:32 - and when you click on try it is when
09:34 - you'll actually get to
09:37 - um
09:41 - it's how you'll actually excuse me sorry
09:43 - how you'll actually get to the courses
09:44 - themselves you'll see there's all
09:46 - different grade levels pre-reader grade
09:48 - two through five six through eight nine
09:50 - you have beginner and comfortable
09:52 - and this year we are very very excited
09:54 - um code monkey the new block jumper
09:57 - course is actually located right here on
09:58 - the front page so that's exciting for us
10:01 - um but you can actually sort by you can
10:03 - do by recommended or you can sort by
10:05 - whoever created the course so you'll see
10:07 - there's many many many many different
10:09 - coding opportunities
10:11 - and platforms that you're able to
10:13 - utilize but if you go down here you can
10:15 - find code monkey here it's listed as
10:16 - code monkey studios
10:18 - and you're able to see all of the
10:20 - courses that are available here you can
10:22 - search for beginner or you can search
10:24 - for comfortable comfortable just means
10:25 - that the students have had a bit of
10:27 - exposure
10:28 - to using the courses which will dive in
10:30 - a bit deeper to coding itself and so
10:33 - these will just present a bit more
10:34 - challenge for the students so beginner
10:36 - is always a good place to start if
10:38 - you're not really sure you can also sort
10:40 - by which ones work best on which device
10:43 - so if i do ipad you'll see it limited a
10:45 - few of the courses that we have
10:47 - available those more tech space work
10:48 - better on something like a chromebook or
10:50 - something more web-based
10:54 - and so that will be located there for
10:56 - you as well now how do you also get to
10:59 - it from
11:02 - code monkey itself well you can also go
11:04 - to the code monkey webpage and if you
11:06 - scroll down to the bottom of the page
11:08 - you'll see down here in the footer
11:10 - there is oops excuse me down here in the
11:12 - footer is the hour of code page under
11:15 - curriculum
11:17 - or there is also a link that
11:19 - that my team will throw in the box here
11:21 - and that's just codemonkey.com
11:23 - slash
11:25 - hour of code which you can see right
11:27 - here so we will go back here to the page
11:30 - and when we're here you'll see it's just
11:32 - the taste of coding
11:34 - which is the hour of code and here we
11:36 - have all of the courses located here for
11:38 - you as well when you click on them these
11:40 - ones do not require you to have a login
11:42 - you can play these all year long just
11:44 - keep in mind that doesn't keep the
11:46 - progress as it would if you were logged
11:48 - in with a teacher trial or a an account
11:52 - um here you'll find
11:55 - um
11:58 - here you'll find that they are located
12:00 - sorry
12:01 - um here you'll find all of the courses
12:03 - here you'll also see there by grade
12:04 - level pre-k what language they are in so
12:07 - we have our block based courses here and
12:09 - then the specific grade levels that
12:11 - they're specific to
12:12 - code.org will sort it based on
12:15 - the beginner and the comfortable and
12:17 - here you're able to see it based on
12:18 - grade level and so it'll give you a
12:20 - little bit of context about what each
12:21 - one of the games is about and when i
12:23 - click on any specific one of the hour of
12:26 - code courses that we offer here you can
12:28 - start playing right here
12:29 - you can also see um
12:32 - basically how many levels there are what
12:34 - concepts the students will be covering
12:36 - so that's always sometimes really nice
12:38 - to know and then the block based
12:39 - sequences so we'll get mentioned more of
12:41 - this here in just a few minutes but i
12:43 - just wanted you to know that's there if
12:45 - you do want to have access to yours to
12:48 - some of the features that code monkey
12:49 - offers you can sign up for a free
12:51 - teacher trial it does give you access
12:53 - for 100 students
12:55 - so you can have the opportunity to kind
12:56 - of check out those hour of code courses
12:58 - and track them there in the platform
13:00 - itself
13:03 - now we know how to get to the courses
13:05 - we've done that now what else is next
13:08 - well we just covered the hour of code
13:10 - courses from our blog base to our tech
13:12 - space
13:12 - and you'll be able to see those on the
13:14 - code monkey page or our or sorry
13:17 - code.orgs page as well so be sure to
13:19 - check those out
13:24 - okay
13:25 - now let's talk a little bit about the
13:27 - sequencing so on code monkeys are on the
13:30 - hour of code it sorts it into beginner
13:32 - and sorts it into comfortable but we do
13:33 - actually have scope and this is the same
13:36 - we have hour of code courses of all of
13:38 - our courses
13:39 - um so code monkey junior this is a
13:41 - really good place and an unintimidating
13:43 - way to start with all of your students i
13:44 - even recommend it for the older students
13:46 - middle school um just so they can kind
13:48 - of get that taste and window in an
13:51 - unintimidating way this code monkey
13:53 - junior is completely block based there
13:55 - is no text it is really about
13:57 - computational thinking you're moving a
14:00 - monkey forward and backwards and jumping
14:03 - and it's a really good place to start
14:04 - then we have our beaver achiever and so
14:06 - you work through different
14:09 - work through different concepts and that
14:11 - is also block based and then we have
14:13 - coding adventure that's tech space
14:14 - that's a coffee script or that is
14:17 - coffeescript and coffeescript is short
14:19 - for
14:20 - javascript coffee java it just means it
14:23 - doesn't have any syntax meaning there's
14:25 - no curly brackets there's no semicolons
14:28 - there's not some weird syntaxing that's
14:31 - there it's really clean and it's really
14:33 - going to build the foundational skills
14:34 - for students and then there's dota does
14:36 - math so in the dota's math hour of code
14:38 - course they work through multiplication
14:41 - angles where they're picking up a
14:42 - protractor and measuring
14:44 - and then also working through so
14:46 - distances multiplication and the angle
14:48 - measurement will all be combined in that
14:50 - hour of code course we also have our
14:52 - game builder
14:54 - of course that will work the students
14:55 - through our shorter version of our
14:57 - platformer course a super mario style
15:00 - very scaffolded they'll work step by
15:02 - step to be able to build their own game
15:04 - by time they get to the end and we also
15:06 - have a block
15:07 - based course of this as well so just
15:10 - depending on where your students are and
15:12 - then we do have banana tails banana
15:14 - tails is python so they work through a
15:16 - baby monkey finding his twin baby
15:18 - brother
15:20 - working through different obstacles
15:21 - through those coding concepts
15:24 - and then we do have a coding chatbot
15:26 - where they are building
15:27 - um a chat bot that is um full python as
15:32 - well
15:32 - and then what's not listed on here is
15:34 - moonlander that's one of the more
15:36 - challenging courses of the hour of code
15:38 - courses it is physics and so they're
15:40 - working on thrust and acceleration and
15:43 - they have to get a moon lander onto the
15:45 - pad
15:46 - and then the other one is space monkey
15:48 - so there's also that one too
15:52 - so let's go ahead and let's dive into
15:53 - the courses and kind of explore what
15:55 - those are
15:56 - and what there is there
16:00 - don't forget if you have any questions
16:02 - feel free to go ahead and pop those
16:04 - right into that chat box or into the q a
16:07 - so to get to the hour of code courses if
16:09 - you're not logged in you can go ahead
16:10 - and you can just click start playing
16:14 - so in this
16:16 - code monkey junior here something i want
16:18 - to note is you will go back out to this
16:21 - story map here and i'm
16:24 - i'm actually logged in so let me do a
16:26 - new screen share here just one second
16:29 - for my other
16:30 - account so you can see what that looks
16:32 - like
16:34 - if you're logged in and your students
16:35 - have an account then they will their
16:37 - progress will be saved however if not it
16:39 - will look like this so when you go to
16:40 - the story map you'll see everything is
16:42 - locked until i've been there so i can't
16:44 - do one i can't do five before i've done
16:46 - one i have to do everything in between
16:48 - this is something to keep in mind for
16:51 - any hour of code course that you do
16:52 - decide to take just keep in mind it
16:54 - won't keep students progress so if
16:55 - something crashes like low bandwidth
16:58 - hour of code can be a very busy time in
17:00 - the computer science world and for all
17:02 - of those
17:04 - all of those curriculum providers and so
17:06 - just keep in mind that if the students
17:08 - do walk out or
17:10 - there's computer crashes or something
17:13 - happens that they will in fact have to
17:15 - start over so that's just something to
17:16 - keep in the back of your mind for that
17:18 - preparation time frame as well so when
17:20 - we click on the exercise here this is
17:22 - really great because you can move it and
17:24 - drag it
17:25 - there are fun sounds i just have the
17:27 - sounds turned off right now but feel
17:29 - free to turn those on at any time
17:31 - and then you can see i can drag
17:33 - or i can click to be able to get the
17:35 - monkey to his treasure box and so they
17:37 - work through different components here
17:39 - sequencing and then they get into loops
17:42 - and that's the end of the hour of code
17:43 - course for that one
17:49 - so we also have our beaver achiever and
17:51 - i won't be going into all of the courses
17:53 - in their entirety today but i do want
17:55 - you to see i'm here you'll see that we
17:57 - go over sequencing loops and some logic
18:00 - here and it's ideal for six to seven
18:02 - year olds so really for first or second
18:03 - grade
18:04 - i would recommend that if you're working
18:06 - with kindergarten um
18:08 - that it it will be best to start with ko
18:10 - monkey junior first and then it does
18:12 - tell you how many levels there are so
18:14 - there'll be 12 levers here so you start
18:15 - playing exactly the same concept here
18:17 - you'll see the story map as well and the
18:19 - story map has 12
18:21 - um challenges for which the students
18:23 - will be working on and here the goal is
18:26 - to fill
18:27 - um this hole with logs so that the
18:31 - beaver is able to go swimming this
18:33 - little parrot down here who's snoozing
18:35 - away this is a new feature that we just
18:37 - recently added when you click on him he
18:39 - will actually have the sound turned off
18:42 - on your end but he will actually read
18:45 - the blocks for students so when he's off
18:47 - he's snoozing when he's on his eyes are
18:49 - awake and he's he's so cute um so we're
18:52 - just going to click and drag and we'll
18:54 - see that if there isn't anything
18:55 - connected that means that the students
18:56 - don't have any code working they will
18:58 - need to snap those blocks together in
19:00 - order to get it to run and then they'll
19:02 - be able to move on to the next challenge
19:05 - and it will increase in with intensity
19:08 - as it goes along
19:09 - as far as teacher resources go something
19:12 - i'll mention which will dive a bit
19:13 - deeper here in just a second is there
19:15 - are notes here for you so you will be
19:17 - able to access the notes here you're
19:19 - able to see
19:21 - what text specs are available so do you
19:24 - need to download anything all everything
19:25 - that we do have is web-based
19:27 - komaki jr does have an app but i would
19:30 - suggest going web-based with that one as
19:32 - well even though it is available on an
19:33 - ipad
19:35 - it does tell you a little bit of prep so
19:37 - making sure you test those coding
19:38 - programs just to make sure everything is
19:40 - working for you if not reach out to your
19:42 - tech or it directors
19:44 - and then the certificates so we do have
19:46 - certificates that you can print you can
19:47 - do the hour of code ones or we do have
19:49 - exclusive code monkey ones
19:52 - and
19:53 - something that i really like to note
19:55 - about our code when we get more into the
19:56 - prep thing is this is a really good
19:58 - place to involve parents
20:00 - and then you can also see the specific
20:02 - standards that are associated with each
20:05 - one of these hour of code courses
20:08 - um so we went into the beaver achiever
20:11 - and then this space adventure or we'd
20:13 - like to call him space monkey over here
20:15 - at code monkey you can click on space
20:17 - spunky and this is also coffeescript as
20:19 - well and so this one this time they will
20:22 - have to write out the text these buttons
20:24 - down here do type out for the students
20:26 - as well
20:27 - and as well as any of the objects that
20:28 - you hover over that has white text this
20:31 - is our space monkey this is space gordo
20:34 - and so space gordo is a teacher
20:35 - assistant he pops up with those tips and
20:37 - directions for the students same concept
20:40 - with the story map it's locked until
20:41 - they proceed on to the next one
20:44 - so if i just run this as is you'll see
20:46 - that moving up got us there and then
20:48 - they're yielded with a star solution if
20:49 - you have a teacher trial this will
20:51 - report back to you on the progress side
20:53 - but gordo does do some
20:57 - tips and tricks and that kind of a thing
20:59 - as well
21:00 - there is sound and narration for this
21:02 - one as well i just have this turned off
21:04 - so if you're interested in that you get
21:05 - stuck at any time just let us know um so
21:08 - this one here we can see we're going to
21:09 - need to move forward and the students
21:11 - will need to move backwards so just a
21:13 - little bit more thinking as it
21:14 - progresses and this one is in
21:16 - coffeescript as well
21:19 - and then the first course that we ever
21:21 - had in codemonkey is coding adventure
21:25 - this one is that same concept of
21:27 - coffeescript
21:28 - and here we have gordo and you actually
21:32 - can use this ruler to measure the
21:34 - distances you just click on the top of
21:36 - the monkey's head and you click to the
21:37 - banana and then you'll run it in the
21:39 - same way so it is that similar language
21:41 - that is in our space adventure is in
21:44 - coding adventure same concept with the
21:47 - with the map here um something that you
21:48 - do have access to even with the hour of
21:50 - code courses that we've recently added
21:52 - is these teacher tutorials so the
21:54 - students will have access to teacher
21:55 - tutorials if they get stuck this teacher
21:58 - walks them through specific concepts
22:00 - that they're exposed to this can help
22:02 - with that additional scaffolding for
22:04 - students
22:09 - okay
22:12 - um so let's check out one of our new
22:15 - favorite courses and our ceo will
22:18 - actually be reading a coding class for
22:19 - students next week so if you haven't
22:21 - checked that out make sure that you
22:22 - check that out we'll send you a link to
22:24 - that at the end here
22:26 - so you can click on start playing this
22:28 - one has 10 challenges this one also is
22:30 - narrated as well if you click right here
22:33 - and the goal here is we have the
22:35 - different sprites and we want to create
22:38 - and have the monkey reach the star so we
22:40 - click run nothing happens there's no
22:42 - event i'm not pushing anything the code
22:43 - doesn't automatically run like in other
22:45 - courses
22:46 - so it does tell us that we need to do
22:49 - something and what do we need to do in
22:50 - this case we need to step
22:53 - and how much am i going to step when it
22:55 - runs it's going to step one
22:57 - pixel essentially every single time so
23:01 - he moves we've seen that however moving
23:04 - on run sorry not every single time he'll
23:06 - only move that one specific spot so in
23:09 - this case it tells us that we need to
23:10 - move it we need to change it to 300
23:13 - and then we're going to check if we did
23:15 - that correctly and then now we're going
23:17 - to click on run and see if it works so
23:19 - now he did move the exact distance here
23:22 - this one does show you the coordinates
23:24 - on the other ones they're built in
23:26 - behind the scenes and you're not able to
23:27 - see them but here you are able to see
23:29 - the exact coordinates so we can actually
23:30 - see how far does he need to step by
23:32 - doing a little bit of math
23:34 - so just some different integrations that
23:36 - are happening inside of the course
23:37 - itself
23:40 - um and then you'll see i'll give you an
23:43 - example of our python course so we'll go
23:45 - ahead and we will go into banana tales
23:49 - and so when we go to banana tails that
23:50 - same concept of the story map as well
23:52 - there's always a trailer at the
23:54 - beginning basically these two twins get
23:56 - split up
23:57 - and then there's some different um
23:59 - specific hints that are that are built
24:01 - in right here so you're able to see
24:02 - those as well and so the goal here is
24:05 - that we need to get this car down to the
24:07 - monkey so he can be fed because he is a
24:10 - hungry bear so it tells us we
24:12 - there is no need to add or change
24:14 - anything so
24:15 - this car can get to the monkey because
24:17 - there's no holes right now and this one
24:18 - does show the coordinate grid so you can
24:20 - see that
24:22 - and when i click on run he gets to the
24:24 - monkey the first one is just an intro
24:27 - and then when we get to our second
24:29 - challenge here it gives us the star
24:31 - solution which if you had a teacher
24:32 - trial or you have an existing account
24:34 - you're able to see this on your side
24:37 - and now we need to adjust the height so
24:39 - we can see the giraffe here we can click
24:41 - on the level setup i can see the exact
24:43 - coordinates of where the draft is
24:44 - there's no ruler to add or subtract the
24:46 - students are having to do a bit more
24:48 - math here to figure out how far the
24:50 - actual distance is for him
24:53 - um so we can run it as is debug the
24:55 - challenge and we see that that actually
24:57 - worked out perfectly
24:58 - and so this is going to get there for
25:00 - him you'll see in the first challenge
25:02 - this wasn't here but now it is there are
25:04 - built-in reference cards these reference
25:07 - cards will open as the students are
25:08 - exposed to more concepts so if they
25:10 - forgot what a concept is this will help
25:12 - them
25:13 - give them
25:15 - some different tips to get there in
25:16 - addition to the ones that are here in
25:18 - the hints
25:24 - okay
25:25 - and we will do one last one and that's
25:27 - the moon lander
25:30 - and moon lander is one of my favorites
25:32 - but like i said the one i find it to be
25:34 - the most challenging i find it tricky to
25:36 - get that moon lander to land
25:38 - right on the launching pad
25:40 - here the concepts that we're going to be
25:41 - covering here it says
25:44 - that they'll be using
25:46 - to they'll be using physics concepts
25:49 - this was actually designed for an
25:51 - international
25:53 - cyber security nafa competition in
25:55 - israel so that's how this course was
25:57 - actually designed so just a fun fact
25:59 - there
26:00 - here you'll see this looks like the game
26:03 - the block jumper
26:05 - interface it's the same sort of concept
26:07 - there
26:08 - here we have the coordinate grid just
26:10 - like we had on the other one
26:12 - and then we have some specific concepts
26:15 - here so this one tells us that we need
26:17 - to create our own game and we need to
26:19 - get the spaceship to land safely on the
26:21 - moon i'm the worst at getting to land on
26:23 - the moon but i know kids are way better
26:24 - at playing those types of things than
26:26 - myself um it tells us that we need to
26:28 - use thrust so this is automatically
26:30 - talking about thrust within the on key
26:32 - so what i have here is a sprite
26:34 - and this is my spaceship is the sprite
26:37 - and i have a code you'll see i have two
26:38 - sprites here i have a star and a
26:40 - spaceship and i'm going to program
26:41 - inside the spaceship because that's what
26:43 - it tells us to do
26:44 - and it tells us that we do need to use
26:46 - thrust so you can either type it out or
26:48 - the students can come down here and find
26:50 - the buttons
26:51 - and what do we actually need to do well
26:53 - when i push a key that says any key
26:56 - something will happen and we're going to
26:58 - want it to
27:00 - thrust that means it's going to
27:03 - that means it's going to move
27:07 - up we're gonna
27:08 - we're gonna thrust it so when i click
27:10 - that then you'll see when i push any key
27:12 - so i'm pushing one key on the key if i
27:14 - don't do anything nothing happens if i
27:16 - push a key on the keyboard then it
27:18 - actually thrusts up to where it needs to
27:20 - go um this one also has those same
27:22 - reference cards built in here so the
27:24 - students aren't sure about any
27:26 - anything that's
27:28 - happening here this is a really good
27:29 - point for them
27:31 - especially if you're not creating a
27:32 - teacher trial and you don't have the
27:33 - answers right at your fingertips which
27:35 - we do provide in the teacher trial on
27:37 - the progress page and in the teacher
27:38 - resources this is a good way for you to
27:41 - see that and know that as well
27:54 - okay so we have explored most of the
27:58 - hour of code courses just keep in mind
28:00 - it's always good to kind of play them
28:02 - there was a question here is a reason
28:04 - why i'm getting access denied for the
28:06 - hour of code courses if you have an
28:07 - expired trial and you're not able to log
28:10 - in and you're not when you log in you're
28:12 - not able to access them it kind of
28:13 - blocks that kind of roadblocks you there
28:15 - so you will just need to make sure that
28:17 - you're signed out so you have access to
28:19 - those um so it's just good to play with
28:21 - those beforehand i've had many of our
28:23 - code events where i thought oh yeah i
28:25 - got this in the bag and then
28:27 - i try to test things and they didn't
28:28 - work not because the program or the
28:32 - curriculum provider didn't have it but
28:33 - my district didn't have the right
28:34 - settings in place for that
28:38 - okay
28:46 - now let's get into more of the
28:47 - preparation for hour of code
28:52 - um so some things to kind of prepare for
28:54 - the hour of code i find hour to code we
28:57 - just had a twitter chat yesterday so
28:58 - feel free to check that out as well
29:01 - but i find our code the best place to
29:03 - invite industry or invite partners or
29:05 - really to create a really great buy-in
29:07 - you can invite everyone can run
29:10 - different
29:11 - programs i mean each one can run
29:13 - different activities like unplugged
29:14 - activities where you're doing movement
29:16 - there's all kinds of opportunity to
29:18 - bring other stakeholders to the table i
29:20 - personally love having parents come in
29:22 - and run activities they always want to
29:23 - help so this is a really great place i
29:26 - know that with a pandemic it's a bit
29:27 - tricky
29:28 - but you can run hour of code events
29:30 - online
29:32 - or in person so just kind of keep that
29:34 - in mind there
29:36 - laredo isd i know some of them are on
29:39 - here they have a coding competition at
29:41 - the end of their um
29:44 - they have a digital learning day and
29:45 - they actually live stream a coding event
29:48 - so there are different opportunities of
29:50 - which that you can
29:52 - bring those different stakeholders and
29:53 - show them what you're doing and showcase
29:54 - them it's a really great place to create
29:56 - buy-in and and also just show how fun
29:59 - computer science can be um so some
30:01 - things that we talked about earlier was
30:03 - preparing certificates there are cell
30:06 - you can also have a certificate and use
30:08 - a program like autocrat or something
30:10 - like that where you have a form
30:12 - and then
30:14 - in that form you can have the students
30:16 - put their names in and then we'll just
30:17 - auto-create a certificate for them as
30:19 - well or have those pre-printed that's
30:21 - also a good place to have those parents
30:23 - come in and help with those pieces and
30:25 - beforehand testing it out before using
30:28 - it it's a really good plate it's a
30:30 - really good rule of thumb to always test
30:32 - out the tech before you've used it you
30:33 - know that when you think you have
30:35 - everything ready to go
30:36 - something always goes wrong so it's good
30:38 - to know especially during the hour of
30:40 - code week is one of the busiest weeks
30:42 - for every curriculum provider there are
30:45 - thousands worldwide using the platforms
30:48 - and checking everything out so just
30:50 - really testing them out beforehand
30:52 - especially if you're using logins
30:54 - students really struggle and we want
30:55 - them to spend the most time coding and
30:58 - to not be tied down by having to log
31:00 - something in and not getting the
31:01 - opportunity to have that taste of coding
31:06 - um also there's some really great
31:08 - unplugged activities
31:10 - that we have here
31:12 - so codemonkey we have all of our
31:14 - unplugged we have a blog post here about
31:17 - unplugged activities that you can
31:19 - check out and utilize those so an
31:21 - unplugged activity means you're not
31:23 - doing anything online that means that
31:26 - it's offline so there's some really good
31:28 - things like you know um i used to buy
31:30 - shower curtains from the store that had
31:31 - like those grid patterns and set
31:33 - something on it
31:35 - you know a rock or it could be i don't
31:37 - know whatever a pen it doesn't matter
31:39 - and having the students use cards to
31:41 - walk me through i'm having them plan
31:44 - them out with arrows like exactly what
31:46 - code monkey jr is doing but on the floor
31:48 - and having them use those tiles to
31:50 - navigate to get there and then having
31:52 - them write the quote write the code or
31:54 - script it or having another student come
31:56 - in and actually
31:59 - run through the code that they wrote so
32:01 - it's a good way to kind of also create
32:03 - that
32:04 - conversation about it and problem
32:05 - solving and strategizing different ways
32:08 - csm plugged is also a really good one
32:11 - they have they just redid their website
32:12 - which is was much needed and long
32:14 - overdue um there's lots of unplugged
32:16 - activities there code.org always has a
32:18 - ton that i recommend checking out binary
32:20 - bracelets is a good one to have like
32:22 - your art teacher do
32:24 - um working through you know pattern
32:25 - recognition and different things like
32:27 - that and then another one
32:28 - another unsung hero for unplugged
32:30 - activities is barefoot computing they
32:32 - have some really great ones that they
32:33 - did um even from the pandemic they have
32:36 - an unplugged coding activity with
32:37 - washing your hands and what an algorithm
32:39 - is like for washing your hands
32:41 - so some just different ways
32:44 - to bring other people to the table
32:47 - so typically when doing an hour of code
32:49 - event in the class or even with other
32:51 - teachers that i've that i've worked with
32:52 - they set up stations
32:55 - and so a station one station might be
32:56 - with the pe teacher where they're having
32:58 - to maybe hop over something and then
33:00 - having to code that out using a
33:02 - whiteboard or markers or having another
33:04 - student script it for them and then then
33:06 - the other student going back and doing
33:07 - their exact directions
33:09 - then having a station where they're
33:11 - plugged in and they're doing certain
33:12 - activities and maybe you have maybe your
33:15 - pair maybe your peer sharing so maybe
33:17 - you invite a kindergarten group to come
33:19 - up with a third grade and they're
33:20 - working through those together you'd be
33:22 - very shocked that the kindergartener
33:24 - will actually probably get further than
33:26 - the third grader just because they have
33:27 - low inhibitions and they're ready to
33:29 - take risks
33:30 - and then having those different you know
33:32 - stations set up you can have it all
33:33 - around the school you can have your
33:35 - whole school doing an hour of code
33:37 - just different opportunities there and
33:39 - during the hour of code week if you want
33:41 - there's always a lot of people who are
33:42 - willing to come in and do guest
33:44 - appearances
33:45 - you know virtually guest appearances so
33:47 - it's a good place to invite people in i
33:50 - know i myself i'm doing a couple of
33:52 - events supporting some different schools
33:54 - so feel free to reach out to your
33:55 - curriculum providers or really try to
33:57 - utilize those resources around you
33:59 - everyone is using computers so they can
34:01 - come speak to your students to also
34:03 - create a bit of buy-in as well and then
34:06 - just really making sure that you have
34:07 - those unplugged you know certificates
34:10 - students love certificates parents love
34:11 - certificates so it's really good to have
34:13 - those things prepped beforehand and
34:15 - tested i can't say that enough test test
34:18 - tests beforehand just to make sure
34:19 - everything goes have that happen where
34:21 - nothing works and so we just spend the
34:23 - time just problem solving and trying to
34:25 - figure that out so we want them to have
34:28 - the best
34:29 - best first experience coding as possible
34:33 - um so i know that was pretty fast and
34:36 - furious but i also want to leave some
34:38 - time for questions for you
34:40 - so today we did cover what the hour of
34:43 - code is when it first started code
34:45 - monkey story itself where to find us so
34:48 - you can find us on the hour of code
34:51 - website
34:52 - by going to
34:55 - by going here to
34:57 - hour of code and it is learn here and
34:59 - when you click on so we go back to hour
35:01 - of code itself you click on try it
35:03 - and then you're able to locate those
35:06 - um the block jumper course like i
35:07 - mentioned is right here
35:09 - and then you can sort by um the
35:11 - curriculum provider right here
35:16 - and then for finding code monkey itself
35:18 - you would go to codemonkey.com or go to
35:20 - that code monkey hour code
35:22 - link that we shared with you and when
35:23 - you click on hour of code then you're
35:25 - able to see all of those activities that
35:27 - we have there for you
35:28 - to just introduce students to coding
35:34 - also just making sure some tips and
35:36 - tricks try to invite many stakeholders
35:38 - in if you can i know things are still a
35:40 - bit tricky out there
35:41 - but trying to invite some people in to
35:43 - help you run those hour code events i
35:45 - know some of the teachers during the
35:46 - twitter chat that we had yesterday were
35:47 - discussing how they um also have former
35:50 - students come down and work with their
35:52 - students and kind of help lead the hour
35:54 - of code kind of thinking of like a field
35:57 - day for hour of code
35:59 - making sure you test those technical
36:01 - requirements you were able to see the
36:04 - teacher notes and what was there on the
36:06 - teacher notes so we can actually go back
36:08 - here to the teacher notes themselves
36:11 - when you go to the hour code you'll have
36:13 - the
36:14 - access the notes if you have a teacher
36:16 - trial you'll have full lesson plans but
36:18 - here you'll just have the notes
36:20 - and then this will just tell you what
36:22 - concepts they're covering and just kind
36:24 - of to help you host that hour of code
36:27 - event and then it will tell you the
36:28 - specific programming languages and and
36:31 - those types of things right there
36:34 - for you
36:38 - and so now we're going to
36:40 - leave some time for q a for each one of
36:44 - you to ask any questions or for our
36:46 - panelists to ask any questions and then
36:47 - we're going to go over a few
36:50 - things that are up and coming
37:00 - um this is a good question could you
37:02 - show us again how to access the code
37:05 - monkey certificates not um hour of code
37:08 - absolutely so how you would access the
37:09 - certificates is you would go to
37:12 - our website here
37:14 - and here
37:16 - when we are in the teacher notes or the
37:18 - teacher notes for every single course
37:21 - when you click on certificates this one
37:23 - brings you to the hour of code but how
37:25 - you actually access the code monkey ones
37:27 - if you don't have a subscription
37:30 - is in our press pack which i was going
37:31 - to share with you in just a few minutes
37:33 - but here it says to download the images
37:35 - it's really just a google drive folder
37:39 - here you will see all of the
37:41 - certificates and so you'll see the
37:42 - certificate for
37:45 - hours
37:46 - i'll also make sure that this is updated
37:48 - here to include the other certificates
37:50 - that we offer too
37:51 - but they should all be here listed for
37:53 - you it looks like we need to add a
37:54 - couple more there
37:56 - and then we do have a specific hour of
37:58 - code folder for you all so we have
38:00 - specific
38:02 - animated images that we have here as
38:04 - well as you can see i'm using a zoom
38:05 - background here we have a couple of zoom
38:07 - backgrounds for you and as we create
38:10 - more images we'll be adding those to
38:11 - that as well so we encourage you to use
38:13 - those during the hour of code as well
38:18 - um
38:18 - [Music]
38:24 - okay i'm just looking to see here
38:32 - okay so this is a great question could i
38:33 - ask about high school i have some
38:35 - students with a cs background some not
38:37 - many of the hour programs i've seen
38:39 - start from zero is there a quick way to
38:41 - indicate prerequisite knowledge of some
38:43 - of the more advanced levels that way i
38:45 - can curate an hour of code for many
38:47 - levels
38:48 - um so that's a bit
38:50 - it's a bit tricky
38:51 - in that way i would say that
38:53 - we have many many
38:55 - many high schools using our
38:58 - our coding adventure and our banana
39:00 - tales courses
39:02 - i would say that the first 30 challenges
39:04 - which is what you get an hour of code is
39:06 - is would be a really good prerequisite
39:08 - for you to see where the students are
39:11 - and if you feel like they're flying
39:13 - through the coding adventure course so
39:15 - i'll just go back here to
39:19 - um pull up our code monkey so you'll see
39:21 - code monkey studios
39:23 - so here what i would do is i would start
39:25 - them with the coding adventure for
39:26 - pre-requisite and that's for any high
39:28 - school i've worked at conferences i've
39:30 - seen many high school students use this
39:32 - as well
39:33 - coding adventure is a good just starting
39:34 - point goes through sequencing and it
39:37 - goes through loops
39:39 - and also goes through object oriented
39:41 - programming so there's some different
39:42 - concepts that are there which would be a
39:44 - really good quick guide if they go
39:45 - through it super super fast then i would
39:47 - definitely say go towards this python
39:50 - oh sorry go to this
39:52 - banana tails it says beginner but it
39:55 - goes really advanced pretty quickly so i
39:56 - would say that would be your next your
39:58 - next one so i would say do coding
40:00 - adventure first and then i would do the
40:02 - banana teals
40:03 - and then i would
40:05 - shoot for them to do if they're high
40:06 - schoolers they could do the trivia
40:08 - chatbot it's pretty challenging for
40:10 - students that may have different
40:11 - backgrounds or things like that
40:14 - so that would be the best way
40:17 - this is the first time viewing the
40:18 - program what is the curriculum you
40:20 - mentioned what grades and basic costs
40:22 - and subscriptions and how do you get one
40:25 - um so with the so there's lots of
40:27 - questions there um so the curriculum
40:29 - that i mentioned is we do have a k8
40:31 - scope and sequence so i'll just go here
40:34 - um
40:36 - so you all can see it
40:42 - so here i mentioned with a subscription
40:44 - to code monkey you do get access to all
40:46 - the curriculum we offer
40:48 - um so it does move from the k8 span like
40:52 - i mentioned we do have high schools some
40:54 - of them using this banana tails encoding
40:56 - chat bots so that's definitely an
40:57 - opportunity there as well it can kind of
40:59 - be a variable range based on students
41:01 - ability level and things like that
41:04 - so that's a great question as far as
41:07 - pricing and the basic costs and things
41:09 - like that
41:10 - we will be running our half yearly pilot
41:14 - pilot
41:16 - so if you have a question we'll actually
41:18 - link here in the chat box a request for
41:21 - more information
41:23 - um so molly thank you so much has been
41:25 - throwing in links just so fast
41:27 - she put in here for a teacher trial so
41:29 - you can check out the teacher trial or
41:30 - you can request more information and so
41:32 - we'll go ahead and throw that there in
41:34 - the chat box for you as well
41:37 - okay so you guys have some really great
41:38 - questions and i really appreciate it so
41:40 - i'm just going to talk about some things
41:42 - that are actually coming up for next
41:43 - week for the hour of code
41:46 - we do have two we actually have three
41:49 - webinars happening next week on monday
41:51 - we have our code monkey women in stem
41:53 - actually at code monkey we are
41:56 - we are an equal ratio of women to men
41:58 - and so we will be having the women in
42:00 - stem so we actually have um we actually
42:03 - have
42:03 - more women developers than we do have
42:05 - men
42:06 - um so they will be talking about how
42:09 - their their different pathways to stem
42:12 - hardships that they face as being a
42:13 - woman in stem and so we're having that
42:15 - panel conversation there and that will
42:17 - be monday at 11 a.m everything is at 11
42:20 - a.m eastern this year same time all week
42:22 - long
42:24 - on tuesday we will be having jonathan
42:26 - who i mentioned in the very very
42:28 - beginning so these two are the founders
42:30 - of code monkey of jonathan and ido
42:32 - jonathan will be hosting an interactive
42:35 - online class for students
42:38 - and he will be doing coding adventure
42:40 - and go on wednesday we'll be leading a
42:44 - class with students on block jumper and
42:47 - going over
42:49 - different components of that and each
42:51 - one of them have
42:52 - worked with students before
42:54 - becoming the founders of good monkey and
42:56 - then also have taught different coding
42:58 - classes and things like that so it's
42:59 - going to be really really fun for
43:01 - those students so we encourage you to
43:04 - register
43:05 - last year we had so many attendees and
43:07 - that i would definitely encourage you to
43:10 - register beforehand so i'm actually
43:12 - going to throw in
43:14 - a link for each of you
43:16 - uh or a link here for
43:20 - just make sure this is the correct link
43:21 - here okay so i'm gonna throw in our link
43:24 - here this is going to show you all of
43:26 - the
43:27 - right at the top there
43:31 - let me just copy this and show you so
43:33 - the link that i just shared with you
43:34 - will have access to
43:36 - um
43:40 - all you'll see here the hour of code
43:42 - tips and tricks webinar that's the
43:44 - webinar we're doing right now the live
43:46 - coding cat live
43:48 - coding class with our founders code
43:50 - monkey sorry coding adventure and block
43:52 - jumper and then you're able to see the
43:54 - chats here
43:56 - the women in stem is not quite up here
43:58 - quite yet so we'll need to make sure
43:59 - that we get that there for you you can
44:01 - also see all of the hour of code courses
44:03 - there
44:04 - anything that you need is right here in
44:05 - this link that we've provided for you in
44:08 - the chat box there
44:11 - we also have
44:13 - a competition that i'm actually going to
44:17 - let
44:19 - we actually are going to have a
44:20 - competition that we're doing next week
44:21 - for students
44:23 - and so in code monkey itself each we
44:26 - have these pre-loaded avatars that have
44:29 - been created so when i click here we
44:31 - have all these avatars that have been
44:34 - associated so we're actually going to be
44:36 - having a competition for students to
44:38 - create an avatar and
44:40 - a few of the students avatars will be
44:42 - selected and we will code monkeyify them
44:45 - we'll modify them
44:47 - and the avatars will actually be
44:48 - available for students to choose
44:51 - so we're really excited about that one
44:53 - and so be on the lookout tomorrow for
44:55 - the recording of this webinar
44:57 - and then the opportunity to register for
44:59 - all of the webinars
45:01 - for next week
45:05 - molly brett maya have i missed any
45:07 - questions coming through there
