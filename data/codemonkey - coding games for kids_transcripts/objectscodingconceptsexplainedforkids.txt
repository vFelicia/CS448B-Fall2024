00:05 - welcome to objects and friends
00:08 - let's learn about objects
00:11 - many programming languages are object
00:14 - oriented including python java
00:17 - and our very own coffeescript
00:20 - in code monkey objects are the
00:22 - characters on the screen
00:25 - and because coffeescript is object
00:28 - oriented it means that you can use those
00:31 - objects in your code
00:33 - let's look at an example
00:37 - here's a challenge that has several
00:39 - characters on the screen
00:41 - you can tell which characters are
00:44 - objects by hovering your mouse
00:47 - on top of the character and if a name
00:49 - pops up it means it's an object that you
00:52 - can use in your code
00:54 - so of course the monkey
00:56 - got the turtle both bananas and all
00:59 - these bushes
01:01 - but is the ruler an object no
01:05 - and gordy isn't one either
01:07 - but all these other
01:09 - images are objects
01:12 - now
01:14 - let's see how we would solve this
01:16 - challenge
01:18 - so we want the monkey to get the apple
01:20 - in the stream and also
01:22 - the apple the banana in the stream and
01:25 - also this banana
01:28 - so the monkey will have to
01:32 - somehow i think get on the turtle
01:35 - have the turtle move across the river
01:38 - and then go and get this banana also
01:42 - so what we could do is we have the
01:44 - command turn to
01:48 - and we could turn to any object i mean i
01:50 - could turn to one of these bushes but i
01:52 - think i want to turn to the
01:54 - turtle
01:55 - so i will say turn to
01:58 - and because this is an object-oriented
02:01 - program i could just say turtle
02:06 - and then i could
02:09 - step
02:11 - now i don't need to mention the monkey
02:13 - in my code because since the monkey's
02:15 - the main character
02:17 - of the
02:18 - challenge
02:20 - you never it automatically will do the
02:22 - monkey the step and the turn two will
02:24 - automatically refer to the monkey
02:28 - uh but if we want the turtle to step i'd
02:31 - have to mention the turtle
02:33 - so right now we're gonna have the monkey
02:35 - step
02:37 - 10.
02:39 - so let's run that
02:42 - okay so now the monkey is on the turtle
02:45 - so next we want the turtle to go in step
02:49 - so because we want the turtle to step i
02:52 - actually have to say turtle
02:55 - step
02:57 - and let's see how far it is
03:03 - okay i think it's 15.
03:06 - okay so turtle step 15
03:11 - so it's actually turtle period step step
03:15 - space
03:16 - 15. okay let's run that
03:24 - okay we're all lined up i could have the
03:27 - monkey
03:28 - turn to the banana object
03:31 - but they're saying i also could just
03:33 - walk backwards and that would be less
03:35 - code so let's do that
03:37 - so do you remember how to make the
03:39 - monkey walk backwards
03:42 - yeah you use a negative number
03:46 - okay let's run one more time
03:54 - okay we did it
03:57 - hopefully that explains how different
04:01 - characters
04:03 - are objects and you can use them
04:07 - in your code
04:09 - now it's your turn to use objects
04:12 - good luck
