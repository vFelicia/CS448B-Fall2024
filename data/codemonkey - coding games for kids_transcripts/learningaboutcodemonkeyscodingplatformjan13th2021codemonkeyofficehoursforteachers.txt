02:55 - progress the lessons feature and just
02:56 - some of those

03:11 - sure that we are answering
03:13 - your burning desired questions
03:18 - right so now let's go ahead and we are
03:21 - going to show you
03:22 - how to um sign up
03:26 - as a teacher from the get-go so i'm just
03:29 - going to pause my screen really quick
03:30 - and
03:31 - pull up my hundreds of windows as you
03:33 - guys know how that goes
03:34 - um all right and always when you are
03:39 - doing zoom nothing ever pulls up exactly
03:42 - how you would like it to go
03:43 - so all right so i am just going to go
03:46 - ahead and
03:48 - sign up here as a
03:53 - as a teacher
03:58 - and just pulling the right window up
04:00 - here okay
04:01 - all right so the first thing i want to
04:02 - show you guys is how to log in
04:04 - using either signing up for an account
04:07 - or logging in
04:09 - with your google account so i personally
04:11 - like to use a single sign-on
04:12 - account i find that if you sync it that
04:15 - way it just makes it a little bit easier
04:17 - also who has time to remember more
04:18 - passwords
04:19 - so the first thing you'll do is you'll
04:21 - click on sign up i already have an
04:23 - existing account but i'll just show you
04:25 - that way you can either sign up as a
04:26 - student a teacher or a parent in this
04:28 - case
04:29 - that is how your students would sign up
04:30 - and then as a teacher you would sign up
04:32 - right here so in
04:34 - and then once you do it will bring you
04:36 - to the option where you can sign in with
04:38 - a
04:38 - using an email your full name password
04:40 - or you can sign up with a single sign-on
04:42 - option so if you have clever class link
04:44 - you can sign up doing it that way i
04:46 - recommend however your students are
04:48 - logging in
04:49 - then you would log in the same way as
04:51 - they do basically
04:52 - if you're using any functionalities of
04:54 - google at all google classroom any of
04:56 - that
04:57 - you would want to sign in using google
04:59 - or else you can't use the features of
05:00 - google classroom which we're going to
05:02 - get into here so i'm just going to go
05:04 - ahead and i'm going to
05:05 - log in using my single sign on account
05:07 - here
05:09 - and then you're just going to go ahead
05:10 - and you're going to put your email
05:11 - address and your password
05:14 - and then just making sure that you
05:15 - accept the authentication from google
05:19 - um interesting i
05:22 - didn't think that's how that was going
05:23 - to go but anyway so then once you do
05:24 - then you'll be
05:26 - um you'll be in to the account let me
05:29 - just do a new share
05:31 - here and once you do it'll populate
05:35 - you here into the classroom
05:39 - so we're going to get into the classroom
05:41 - feature so this is how you
05:42 - sign in just really briefly the my
05:44 - classrooms page is where all of your
05:46 - classroom information is held and so
05:47 - that's just going to be everything that
05:49 - you
05:50 - how you access any of your student data
05:52 - and any of that information there
05:54 - under the courses tab i'm just going to
05:56 - brief mention this part because it's
05:58 - going to be fun to see this site on the
05:59 - back end
06:01 - and the courses side is where all of the
06:02 - courses that are available to you you'll
06:04 - see that as a student they'll only see
06:06 - the available courses that have been
06:08 - assigned and at the bottom all of the
06:09 - courses that are not that they're not
06:12 - utilizing are all going to be underneath
06:14 - and unavailable for them
06:16 - what has been newly added to code monkey
06:19 - here are these banners across the top
06:21 - that talk about what type of language
06:23 - each of the courses are
06:24 - and then what level the courses are so
06:26 - that's just something for you to keep in
06:28 - mind and
06:29 - i'm going to show you our new feature
06:31 - after that
06:32 - and then we'll go over some of these
06:34 - other features here at the end just
06:36 - based kind of on your questions
06:37 - um so in the classroom this is what we
06:39 - call the classrooms page
06:42 - to create a classroom there's three ways
06:43 - that you can create a classroom you can
06:45 - click on create classroom here
06:46 - and you can either create a new
06:48 - classroom and then you just want to make
06:50 - sure that you select the appropriate
06:52 - subscription this is important when you
06:54 - have an active subscription
06:55 - just making sure that you've connected
06:57 - it to the correct one
06:59 - or you can import from google and what
07:00 - you'll do is you'll click
07:02 - connect with google classroom and then
07:05 - once you do so and make sure you hit all
07:07 - of the
07:08 - all that and making sure that you allow
07:10 - the google classroom then you'll
07:12 - actually have the ability to
07:14 - basically what it will do is straight
07:16 - import your students so that's important
07:18 - um for you to have that when it's synced
07:21 - together then you can have all the
07:23 - functionalities and it will speak
07:24 - between
07:25 - google and itself um so if i allow this
07:27 - to go through then you'll see that my
07:30 - i now have the ability to import
07:33 - um this one i don't have any imported
07:35 - classroom so let me share
07:37 - another screen with you and i'll show
07:38 - you that
07:42 - so you're able to pull that up
07:46 - like i mentioned i have so many tabs
07:48 - here so
07:51 - just give me one second
07:56 - okay
08:06 - so once you do that you'll see you have
08:08 - your teachers and your students here and
08:10 - then you'll actually just be able to
08:12 - work simultaneously together with one
08:15 - another
08:17 - and then those clap that classroom data
08:19 - will just be imported there and then
08:20 - when you want to do the lessons feature
08:22 - which i'll show you it'll populate there
08:24 - another way that you can do it is you
08:26 - can just when you create your classroom
08:29 - you can add students more manually so
08:33 - i'll kind of show you
08:34 - that as well so that's how you create
08:36 - the classrooms
08:37 - um so now that i've created a classroom
08:41 - which you can see here i'll just
08:42 - click on one of the classrooms that i've
08:44 - created this one actually will have
08:45 - students populated inside of it
08:47 - um so i create the classroom either
08:49 - importing it from google or just
08:50 - manually creating a classroom
08:53 - when i go directly here to the classroom
08:55 - i'll click on the students tab here if
08:57 - you've
08:58 - synced with google the students will
09:00 - just be straight rostered in here
09:01 - if you haven't there's a couple of ways
09:03 - that you can do this if you have
09:04 - younger students and they're not using
09:06 - any single sign-on you can
09:09 - create click on this classroom login url
09:12 - if you are synced with google and google
09:13 - classroom this will not pull up for you
09:15 - so that's just something to keep in mind
09:18 - and then the students will just click on
09:19 - their username and be able to easily
09:21 - import
09:22 - or be able to easily add their password
09:25 - and it's just a strike link or they can
09:26 - go into login
09:28 - at the code monkey regular home page
09:30 - there
09:31 - you can also print login url cards
09:33 - obviously in our new remote learning
09:35 - environments of the world
09:37 - this does doesn't necessarily work as
09:39 - well as you would like it to but it does
09:40 - have a straight direct url on here and
09:42 - it does tell their username and their
09:44 - password so you could break that up take
09:46 - a screenshot
09:48 - it's a little bit extra work for you on
09:49 - that side of things but if you're in
09:51 - person it obviously works
09:52 - very very great so that is how you would
09:56 - add
09:56 - students now at the bottom here um so
09:59 - let me just remove one of my co-teachers
10:01 - here you'll see that you can
10:02 - add a co-teacher so on this one
10:05 - specifically i'm actually not
10:07 - able to add a co-teacher because i had
10:09 - both full
10:10 - but you would add a co-teacher here if
10:12 - you're connected with the google
10:13 - classroom it will sync the
10:14 - it will sync the co-teacher there so if
10:16 - you are importing with google classroom
10:18 - you need to make sure with whoever
10:20 - you're
10:20 - sharing your subscription with that you
10:22 - have added them as a co-teacher on your
10:24 - google classroom so that you're able to
10:26 - import and roster with them
10:30 - so that is how you would do that side of
10:34 - things
10:34 - uh for adding students and so molly will
10:37 - actually
10:38 - add that easy link for you there in the
10:41 - chat box
10:43 - um so students who are joining for home
10:46 - or or any of that we do have
10:50 - how would they actually join the
10:51 - classrooms themselves so
10:53 - here you can see we have a classroom
10:55 - code so the students can join
10:57 - signing up using their username or their
10:59 - password and then they would just enter
11:01 - in this
11:02 - this classroom code so something that i
11:04 - want to show you is that in our help
11:05 - center i click on the three lines on the
11:07 - right hand side
11:08 - in the help center we just recently
11:10 - added these student login guides so this
11:12 - is really
11:12 - important
11:18 - oh i'm on a google classroom still okay
11:20 - good catch you guys i'm so sorry about
11:22 - that
11:24 - um okay
11:28 - well good to know my apologies about
11:30 - that okay
11:31 - so i guess you guys didn't see any of
11:32 - that part with the students so
11:34 - let me let me go back because that's um
11:38 - embarrassing part of that okay so here i
11:40 - am in the
11:42 - uh student list here
11:46 - um thanks susan yeah um so
11:49 - here i am in the student list and i'll
11:50 - go back and cover whatever it is that i
11:52 - might have missed at the beginning but
11:53 - i'm just in the
11:54 - classroom so how i got here is the my
11:56 - classrooms page i'm not sure exactly
11:58 - where
11:58 - i left the offer didn't but here's the
12:00 - classrooms page each one of these you
12:02 - can create a classroom by either
12:03 - importing the classroom
12:05 - or manually creating it the class code
12:07 - is also located here as well just
12:10 - for that instance you can click on
12:13 - so i created my classroom i'm going to
12:15 - click into my classroom
12:17 - and i'll just re quick go over this part
12:20 - because i feel like it's important
12:22 - when i get here i will go to the
12:24 - students tab so i'm in my specific
12:26 - classroom so that's just
12:28 - something to keep in mind is that i'm in
12:30 - the specific classroom that i want
12:32 - um and then i'm gonna show you how you
12:33 - can navigate that but here i click on
12:35 - the students tab
12:36 - at the top and if you've imported with
12:40 - google it will just already be here
12:42 - manually won't be able to
12:44 - change passwords or anything like that
12:46 - and if you want to archive or
12:47 - maybe a student leaves your class you'll
12:48 - just have a button at the top here that
12:50 - will say sync with the google classroom
12:53 - and the login url just brief show that
12:55 - since you didn't see that i clicked on
12:57 - the login url
12:58 - and here it shows all the student lists
13:00 - that i've created i've created this
13:01 - student list here in my student account
13:05 - by using a bulk import
13:07 - and so down here you can add students
13:09 - three ways either creating a single
13:11 - account
13:12 - doing multiple accounts which is how i
13:13 - did this because this is a teacher
13:15 - classroom
13:15 - a teacher training classroom or you can
13:17 - share the class code and if you share
13:19 - that then you're able
13:20 - to see it much larger new students
13:23 - you can click on these tabs and these
13:24 - will actually take you to the student
13:26 - guides themselves so
13:27 - if it's input if you're imported with
13:29 - google classroom you won't have this
13:30 - feature
13:31 - if you need to add the students manually
13:32 - this is where you'll see it
13:34 - and then what i was saying is down here
13:37 - at the bottom i have a co-teacher
13:38 - if my classroom is synced with google
13:42 - classroom it will
13:43 - show you just to invite the teacher they
13:45 - must be on your google classroom to be
13:47 - synced with with the classroom here so
13:50 - it's that part is an important feature
13:52 - there
13:53 - um or you can just add people
13:55 - independently and what a co-teacher does
13:57 - is basically they share the classroom
13:59 - with you so they see all of the
14:00 - classroom data of just the specific
14:02 - classroom they can assign courses see
14:05 - student progress
14:06 - and all of the functionalities of being
14:07 - a teacher on the classroom but just for
14:09 - that specific classroom so it's good
14:11 - sometimes special ed teachers or
14:12 - maybe you have another teacher that you
14:14 - want to share your your
14:16 - classroom with and that's also the ways
14:18 - that we share our subscriptions
14:21 - um so that is some of the
14:22 - functionalities and then the
14:24 - login cards which i was mentioning here
14:26 - it does print out a student
14:28 - individual login cards and it has a
14:30 - direct url
14:32 - a username and a password so um
14:36 - not so much it doesn't work so well in
14:38 - our new virtual world but that is there
14:41 - so that is how you would um
14:44 - add students to that classroom so brand
14:47 - new
14:48 - just released this week my most favorite
14:50 - most needed update that we have here
14:52 - is the classroom so before every time
14:55 - you wanted to access each and every
14:56 - single classroom you would have to go
14:58 - out to the my classrooms page click into
15:00 - the classroom
15:01 - now you can easily navigate from this
15:03 - nice little drop down tab and i can
15:05 - easily navigate between my classes
15:08 - i find this to be a really needed
15:10 - functionality and it's really great that
15:12 - i don't have to do extra clicking
15:15 - in that way so here i am so the student
15:17 - list that's how you add students
15:19 - and i just wanted to note that part
15:23 - and then on the courses page so i'm just
15:26 - going to briefly go over this
15:28 - course page here um so on the course
15:30 - page now the tiling
15:32 - these banners at the top match exactly
15:34 - what is on
15:36 - our courses themselves so it has the
15:38 - languaging it has the
15:40 - skill level and then it'll tell you the
15:42 - specific course
15:43 - when you assign it to the class it'll
15:45 - say assigned
15:47 - here will tell you what grade levels
15:48 - it's great for what devices
15:50 - it works best on and my most favorite
15:53 - part is when you click on read more
15:55 - it'll also tell you the coding concepts
15:57 - that are covered within the course
16:00 - and the specific lesson plans are
16:02 - actually attached right here for you as
16:04 - well so if you don't want to go back to
16:06 - the teacher resources you have it all
16:08 - right here kind of in a
16:09 - nifty little square everything that you
16:12 - need
16:13 - and the same is true for our coding
16:15 - adventure course we have the standards
16:17 - here which
16:18 - i know this is true i just caught this
16:20 - today it's telling you exactly what
16:22 - functionalities and what will be covered
16:24 - in the course itself
16:25 - lesson plans and exactly to the
16:26 - standards so if you're wanting to know
16:28 - what standards are associated these are
16:30 - basic standards
16:32 - more general standards not specific
16:33 - state standards are the common core
16:35 - standards for math and language arts or
16:37 - ela
16:38 - and then we do have the csta standards
16:41 - and the national curriculum standards
16:43 - for
16:45 - our international standards as well
16:48 - so that's a really great thing that just
16:50 - also got released so we're very very
16:52 - excited about that
16:55 - um okay so now
16:58 - since i'm unable to get into my google
17:00 - classroom the way that i wanted to i'm
17:02 - gonna
17:02 - talk about um
17:04 - [Music]
17:06 - i'm going to go into our gradebook tab
17:08 - and then i'm going to show you some
17:08 - features
17:09 - and and functionalities of our progress
17:11 - page so in our gradebook
17:13 - as students are working through the
17:15 - course their grades are populating here
17:17 - for you so it's automatically graded you
17:19 - can export it as a csv file if you'd
17:21 - like
17:21 - and import it if you have assigned
17:24 - google classroom
17:26 - in the lessons tab which we're going to
17:27 - go to you're able to
17:30 - edit the grade it won't automatically
17:31 - report this grade to the google
17:33 - classroom
17:33 - um something that we are working on but
17:36 - google's a little bit tricky on their
17:37 - back side of things
17:39 - but that's there and then also here we
17:42 - have this proficiency tab and in the
17:44 - proficiency tab
17:48 - we have this new proficiency table
17:53 - and it's kind of hidden as you can see
17:54 - here it says by course and it says by
17:56 - proficiency
17:57 - but this is basically all of the coding
17:59 - concepts that are covered throughout
18:01 - all of the courses within code monkey's
18:04 - curriculum and so every single one of
18:07 - these is a different coding concept and
18:08 - basically as the students
18:10 - get more familiarize which in each and
18:12 - every single concept it's going to be
18:13 - reporting back
18:15 - to them the more that they practice a
18:16 - skill the more advanced they will be
18:19 - so if they only do one course you're not
18:21 - going to see that they're going to be
18:22 - advanced in that topic
18:24 - it's more about extra practice um
18:27 - and really getting them so if they've if
18:30 - they worked
18:31 - let's say they worked with variables in
18:32 - coding adventure they work with
18:33 - variables in beaver achiever and they
18:35 - worked with variables
18:36 - in the game design courses then they
18:39 - will have
18:40 - mastered that concept so it's just the
18:42 - more exposure that they have to those
18:44 - concepts the more you'll see this chart
18:47 - begin to fill out um
18:51 - and then i'll just quick mention about
18:52 - the showroom here just really quickly
18:54 - here
18:55 - so in the showroom is where students
18:57 - games and challenges will be populated
18:59 - for you so once they publish it to the
19:00 - classroom they'll show up here
19:02 - something i like to know is when you
19:04 - disable the the discover feature so
19:07 - discover is a worldwide publishing
19:08 - platform
19:09 - it is heavily vetted making sure no
19:11 - student information is shared there's no
19:13 - inappropriate
19:14 - things laced inside of there but
19:16 - basically when you discover
19:18 - when you disable the discover for your
19:20 - classroom the students don't have access
19:21 - to this discovery they won't actually
19:23 - see it there at all so
19:24 - that's just something that i like to
19:27 - note i think it's important until you
19:28 - introduce the concept that
19:30 - um my own personal opinion is that they
19:32 - don't have exposure to that right away
19:36 - okay so i've showed you the
19:38 - functionalities of those and now i want
19:40 - to go into the progress page so the
19:41 - progress page i like to always say is a
19:44 - teacher's best friend
19:45 - um and why do i say the progress page is
19:48 - a teacher's best friend well
19:49 - all of the solutions for the solutions
19:52 - are located in two places but this one
19:54 - here is
19:55 - where everything is contained like the
19:56 - holy grail i find of everything
19:59 - it's broken up into by coding concepts
20:02 - for each and every single course
20:03 - along the top and green is the teacher
20:05 - solutions for everything so you're not
20:07 - hunting
20:08 - and every single star within the
20:10 - gradebook or within the progress page
20:12 - actually contains a student solution so
20:14 - you can sort this
20:16 - by student progress and you can do a
20:18 - data dive and notice a data trend
20:20 - so if we look here specifically at
20:21 - challenge 15
20:23 - or challenge 16 excuse me we can see
20:25 - there's a lot of blue stars
20:27 - a three star is the shortest most
20:29 - concise
20:30 - solution that a student could have done
20:31 - so that's kind of the goal
20:33 - a two star means there was an extra step
20:35 - and a one star is a struggle
20:36 - so they really didn't understand the
20:38 - concept but were able to pass
20:40 - the challenge when you click on any one
20:42 - of these
20:43 - student solutions it will tell you how
20:45 - many times they attempted it
20:46 - and like i said you can pull it up in a
20:48 - real life animation it also pulls up
20:50 - anonymously so really good for
20:52 - you know debugging a challenge
20:54 - altogether or some whole group
20:55 - instruction
20:57 - maybe you put it up in a jam board and
20:59 - the students solve it
21:00 - in the best way that they can after
21:02 - you've done some like small reteaching
21:04 - as well
21:05 - but not only that you can put this up a
21:08 - lot of teachers will put this up in
21:09 - their classroom and show the students
21:10 - progressing through the challenges
21:12 - obviously up to you
21:14 - but the biggest feature of this page
21:16 - especially for
21:17 - synchronous and asynchronous type of
21:19 - learning is that you can actually limit
21:20 - student progress so what that means is
21:23 - that
21:23 - maybe i don't want my students to have
21:24 - access to anything i'm starting the
21:28 - i'm starting my lesson i can put limit
21:30 - progress to zero they won't have access
21:31 - to any of the content at all
21:33 - um until i'm ready for them so typically
21:36 - i like to lock this down so i don't have
21:37 - students
21:38 - progressing beyond where i am so it just
21:41 - kind of gives you a little bit more
21:43 - control there
21:44 - the super hints here is only available
21:46 - for coding adventure basically
21:49 - the more a student fails a challenge um
21:52 - then gordo will pop up with an extra
21:54 - hint it will guide them to the answer
21:56 - but doesn't give them
21:58 - the full answer this is really good for
22:00 - remote style learning i also think that
22:02 - if a student has failed a challenge that
22:03 - many times that they probably need the
22:05 - right extra reinforcement so
22:07 - i personally like to turn it on that's
22:09 - just my own preference
22:13 - um
22:19 - i agree that limiting the students is
22:22 - amazing because it just keeps everyone
22:24 - together and you don't have kids that
22:25 - are all
22:26 - over the place as far as that goes so
22:27 - that's kind of the functionalities of
22:29 - behind the scene
22:31 - and then i'm going to show you one more
22:33 - thing here which is our lessons page
22:36 - so the lessons page is only available
22:39 - for coding
22:40 - adventure um depending on
22:43 - um where we go with this but coding
22:46 - adventure right now is the only
22:48 - course that is available for lesson mode
22:50 - but i do find this to be
22:52 - important it's really good for either
22:55 - using it in its full functionality
22:57 - keeping kids with you
22:58 - or being able to do some differentiation
23:02 - so i'll kind of talk about all three of
23:03 - those so here the lessons
23:05 - are so they are set up in the same
23:07 - structure as our regular lessons our
23:09 - lessons are always an intro which is a
23:11 - unplugged activity the play time is a
23:13 - dive into the platform itself
23:15 - and a debrief could be a walk through it
23:17 - could be
23:18 - a reflectionary period anything like
23:20 - that what's nice about this is that i
23:22 - know that in lesson eight just by
23:24 - looking at this these are the challenges
23:25 - that the students will be working on
23:28 - um and here's some other challenges that
23:31 - might be
23:32 - usually in a walk-through it's something
23:33 - that might be a newer concept that they
23:35 - haven't worked on
23:36 - i also have exclusively the lesson plan
23:39 - for that specific lesson right here
23:41 - and if you have this synced with google
23:43 - classroom and i apologize that i wasn't
23:44 - able to pull that up
23:46 - um for some reason it's i'm using my
23:50 - associates account uh and so she
23:54 - needed to approve me again for that so
23:56 - anyway but um so
23:57 - if i were in a google classroom itself i
23:59 - would begin i would actually instead of
24:01 - beginning the lesson it would say
24:03 - assign the lesson and the students would
24:05 - see this on their side of the it would
24:07 - say
24:08 - assigned lesson 8
24:11 - and it would show the challenges which
24:13 - they need to work on and so you can go
24:14 - in and manually grade it there
24:17 - but for all the rest of them when you
24:18 - begin the lesson
24:20 - this is my favorite part about it is
24:21 - that the screens of every single student
24:23 - it says that we are now in the
24:25 - introduction stage
24:26 - every single student will see a lock on
24:28 - their screen so they're actually not
24:30 - able to do
24:30 - anything until you're ready to unlock
24:32 - them so this is just good for going over
24:35 - any unplugged activities any intros
24:38 - maybe doing that small group teachable
24:40 - lesson on lesson 15
24:42 - challenge 15 that the students were
24:44 - struggling so it's kind of nice to kind
24:46 - of keep everyone together and not
24:48 - have the ability for them to mess around
24:51 - while you're talking
24:53 - and then what is also really really nice
24:55 - about this is let's say i have students
24:56 - that are
24:58 - they're not achieving at the same level
25:00 - as everybody else when i'm in the
25:01 - specific lesson
25:03 - and i'm going over the specific concept
25:05 - when i assign the challenges to these
25:07 - students
25:08 - so now the students screens will be
25:10 - unlocked and they will be in play time
25:12 - and what they will see is only
25:16 - when they go into coding adventure only
25:18 - the challenges that are associated with
25:19 - this lesson so that can keep everybody
25:21 - all in the same place
25:23 - once i end playtime the students will go
25:26 - back to their place where they were
25:27 - before so this is
25:28 - really really good for introducing new
25:30 - concepts especially
25:32 - variables or some of the other concepts
25:34 - that are covered in coding mentioned
25:36 - that might be a little bit
25:37 - more challenging and that students can't
25:39 - keep up with that's just a way that you
25:41 - can kind of keep everyone together and
25:43 - kind of do some differentiation
25:45 - once you like i mentioned end play time
25:48 - um then the student screens go back to
25:50 - locked
25:52 - and then you can do your challenge
25:54 - walkthroughs or anything like that
25:56 - the reference cards those are going to
25:58 - talk about all of the
25:59 - the code blocks that are at the bottom
26:01 - so you know the blocks of code don't
26:04 - they're not drag and drop but they do
26:05 - contain text so this will tell
26:07 - each and every single student what those
26:09 - blocks are and what they mean
26:11 - and then the character review card this
26:13 - is something that i always like to
26:14 - mention
26:15 - the character review card will tell the
26:17 - students when they're meeting a
26:18 - character but it's also very very
26:19 - important for when the students do the
26:21 - challenge builder because
26:22 - ad students work through coding
26:23 - adventure these characters and objects
26:26 - open up as they go through
26:28 - and it's just nice for them to have a
26:30 - reminder like this is how you move the
26:32 - turtle so we tell them
26:33 - that we have to have an object tag this
26:35 - is
26:36 - this is how we move the turtle this is
26:38 - what we do when we move the beaver so
26:40 - it's just kind of some good reminders
26:42 - for students as well
26:43 - banana tails game builder they have the
26:46 - reference card all built in for them so
26:49 - but for our younger students we like to
26:51 - have them have access to that so then
26:53 - once i end the lesson
26:54 - now you can see it is green and it means
26:56 - that i've already done that lesson any
26:58 - of the lessons that i have yet to do
27:00 - are going to be in white so it's just
27:01 - good to kind of keep
27:03 - kind of keeps you on track especially
27:04 - when you're teaching hundreds of
27:06 - sections
27:06 - of that
27:10 - um okay so
27:13 - we've talked about the gradebook in the
27:15 - proficiencies tab and we've talked about
27:16 - all parts of the behind
27:18 - the scenes i'm just going to briefly
27:22 - mention this and then we'll get into
27:23 - total q a
27:24 - here with all of you in just a minute is
27:27 - i'm going to click on the teacher
27:28 - resources so i clicked on the teacher
27:30 - resources on the left hand side of the
27:31 - screen
27:33 - here we do have a certification course
27:34 - if you didn't get tired of me today
27:36 - um this is of course uh covering the
27:39 - concepts within the first part of coding
27:41 - adventure
27:42 - they're short they'll just walk you
27:44 - through the concepts that are there
27:45 - especially if you're not super familiar
27:47 - it might be a nice way to just kind of
27:48 - do a refresher for you
27:51 - our webinars any webinars that we host
27:53 - you found our webinars today
27:54 - but our webinars are also hosted there
27:56 - from previously and you can also find
27:58 - them on our youtube channel as well
28:00 - all the lesson plans for all of our
28:02 - courses are located here
28:04 - how-to guides let's say you forgot how
28:06 - to do something you can find the how-to
28:08 - guides
28:09 - locate our help center you can find the
28:10 - help center here or down here in the
28:12 - left-hand side of the screen
28:16 - and there's a classroom complete
28:18 - classroom management guide i like to
28:20 - to note this we everything basically
28:22 - anything that you ever wanted to know is
28:24 - going to live
28:25 - inside of this document it's also on our
28:27 - help center but it has everything
28:28 - pedagogical resources
28:30 - grades by course proficiency in computer
28:32 - science
28:33 - topics how to limit how to view
28:35 - challenge solutions just really anything
28:36 - that you want to know
28:38 - is is in that document it's a very large
28:39 - document but it contains a lot of
28:41 - information
28:42 - we do have getting started video guides
28:44 - so this will walk you through basically
28:46 - everything that i'm doing right now
28:48 - we do have some short video tutorials
28:50 - adding a teacher assigning
28:51 - courses all of that good stuff hour of
28:54 - code notes those
28:55 - really aren't going to be so necessary
28:57 - for you
28:59 - and then classroom resources all the
29:00 - student certificates are located here
29:02 - and the solutions are also located here
29:05 - so the student solutions are
29:06 - so solutions are located on the teacher
29:09 - resource page
29:10 - and in the progress tab so just know you
29:12 - have that
29:13 - um availability um
29:17 - the creation my creations is where all
29:19 - of your creations live nobody else's but
29:21 - yours
29:23 - and then the discover like i mentioned
29:24 - our worldwide
29:27 - discovery platform and then in the help
29:29 - center i'm just going to go there
29:30 - briefly in the help center here you'll
29:32 - see a getting started guide for code
29:34 - for for code monkey it has everything as
29:38 - a text guide how to create classrooms
29:40 - how to add co-teachers
29:42 - there's some different advanced steps
29:43 - there if you're not sure
29:45 - and then we also have these student
29:47 - login guides which is what i was showing
29:48 - my screen was not showing you what i was
29:50 - showing
29:51 - um so the student login guides are on
29:52 - the help center they're at the bottom
29:54 - section
29:55 - and here it will talk about how to sign
29:58 - up with
29:59 - how to share basically it's a guide for
30:01 - your students on how they can
30:03 - join code monkey using a student
30:05 - walkthrough we have that
30:06 - in this web version or we have it as a
30:09 - pdf that you can share with your
30:10 - students as well so
30:11 - if they're not sure how to join using a
30:13 - class code or any of that if you get
30:15 - stuck
30:16 - ever on that you can always reach out to
30:17 - us and we're happy to
30:19 - help with that um
30:22 - and so that's all that we have
30:26 - for that today so we did the lesson
30:27 - features the grade book and the
30:29 - proficiency the q a
30:32 - um our webinars page we talked about
30:34 - that
30:35 - um and then now i'm going to answer a
30:37 - couple of questions that we had
30:39 - previously and then um i'll show you
30:44 - um i'll get into your questions so what
30:47 - is the best way to get k3 students
30:49 - started so it's either having them
30:53 - importing a google classroom typically
30:55 - is going to be the easiest way for them
30:57 - to kind of sign in
30:58 - as well but you can just share a class
31:01 - code or
31:02 - anything in that manner would be the
31:04 - quickest way and then if you're not sure
31:05 - about where
31:06 - students should get started i'll just
31:09 - come back to the slide here we do have
31:11 - this
31:11 - located on the course page but this is
31:13 - basically where every single student
31:15 - should begin so kindergarten will begin
31:16 - with kobunky junior
31:18 - i typically like to have first and
31:20 - second grade start with copenhagen
31:22 - junior i love the lesson plans they have
31:23 - some really great unplugged activities
31:25 - that you can actually
31:27 - change to make virtually and i just like
31:31 - to get the students excited about coding
31:33 - as well um okay so the next
31:37 - question is how do i know which
31:39 - standards code monkey are aligned to so
31:41 - i showed you that in the course page
31:43 - there specifically
31:44 - um you can find the course and then you
31:46 - can click on the standards and it'll
31:47 - take you right there directly
31:49 - if you need something more customized
31:51 - then just reach out to whoever
31:53 - your regional sales director is and
31:55 - they'll help you
31:57 - with that as well susan good question
32:00 - nothing yet for canada
32:01 - but i'll definitely put that as a
32:04 - request down to our product team
32:06 - um regarding those standards i know that
32:08 - it's important for you guys as well
32:11 - what does it mean to upgrade so this is
32:12 - a really good question
32:14 - so oftentimes when you first sign up for
32:16 - your account
32:17 - you'll see that um
32:21 - this will say that is either expired or
32:24 - you have a teacher trial so
32:26 - see here i have this super teacher
32:27 - account so what i will do
32:29 - is i will upgrade it and then when i hit
32:32 - continue
32:33 - i just need to make sure that i'm
32:34 - selecting the correct subscription
32:38 - and with the correct subscription then i
32:41 - select it and then i just upgrade and
32:43 - that means that
32:44 - now my students in the classroom are
32:46 - going to be attached to the correct
32:48 - subscription so that's just an important
32:50 - thing to know or if it's expired so
32:52 - i just clicked on the upgrade and i just
32:54 - selected it
32:56 - we do have use just note here there is a
32:58 - usage report here and then this data to
33:00 - the export data to a csv it's very
33:03 - robust it will
33:04 - it contains a lot of student information
33:07 - it shows you
33:07 - everything that basically is in the
33:09 - progress page but in a csv file so
33:12 - if you ever need that as well and then
33:15 - i forgot to mention this but if i'm in a
33:18 - classroom i'm just going to click
33:19 - on a classroom
33:24 - and i'll go to the students tab here
33:26 - let's say this student
33:27 - class has ended and i want to move them
33:30 - i can click on
33:31 - over here i can click on this and i can
33:33 - select i can either archive
33:35 - all the students in the classroom
33:37 - archive only means that the students
33:39 - move to a non-active position all of
33:41 - their student data will still live there
33:44 - or i can move them to a classroom we
33:47 - the only way that you can delete a
33:49 - student ever
33:50 - is if a student has never used code
33:53 - monkey and so that only means that they
33:55 - can
33:56 - um that means that they can't be
34:01 - that they never took up your
34:03 - subscription see if you do if you
34:04 - archive them it does not reopen a seat
34:07 - the only way the archive works is if you
34:09 - have a flexible type of subscription
34:12 - um and that's the only way that you'll
34:14 - be able to reopen those seats so the
34:15 - question about
34:16 - if a student left from school how can
34:18 - you get the space back unfortunately
34:20 - if you have the subscription that's a
34:21 - per student subscription
34:23 - they occupy that seat for the lifetime
34:26 - of the account
34:28 - susan had a question can students be
34:30 - moved to a different
34:31 - school so if that is the case so we have
34:35 - a lot of students that move around just
34:36 - let us know
34:38 - um and we can help with that as well
34:40 - because we want the students contain
34:42 - their same coding language and things
34:44 - like that um so susan i would say
34:49 - get probably with zach and um he can
34:52 - help you with that
34:53 - and zac and talia they should be able to
34:54 - help you with that part of it um but we
34:56 - do have students that move around
34:57 - pretty regularly in within districts
35:00 - which is
35:00 - always interesting okay
35:04 - so that's that question and then how do
35:06 - i get students to collaborate so i just
35:08 - created a
35:09 - jamboard and i created i took a
35:11 - challenge that i know students struggle
35:13 - with
35:14 - which is the first time this is an
35:16 - assessment challenge for coding
35:17 - adventure
35:18 - and you can create just put the
35:20 - challenges here
35:22 - and then have the students each code it
35:24 - using different colors
35:25 - or you know show theirs each working
35:28 - together collaboratively sometimes you
35:30 - can put them in a breakout room or
35:32 - something like that i had a trial period
35:35 - but never
35:35 - had the opportunity to use it can i get
35:37 - the trial again antoinette if you just
35:39 - want to send
35:40 - a message to support codemonkey.com
35:43 - we can help work through that as well
35:47 - um okay let's see here this is a good
35:50 - question
35:50 - edward asked this question is there the
35:53 - ability to limit progress for code
35:54 - monkey junior unfortunately at this time
35:56 - we do not have the ability for
35:58 - students to
36:01 - occupy basically for you to be able to
36:03 - limit students progress
36:06 - but it is something that we have heard
36:09 - from teachers that
36:10 - is unique
36:13 - how can i delete students from google
36:15 - classroom can i get the space back so if
36:17 - you have
36:18 - your classroom synced with google
36:19 - classroom what you'll need to do is you
36:21 - need to
36:22 - go to your google classroom or not go to
36:24 - your google classroom up here it will
36:26 - say it's been synced with google
36:27 - classroom and you just need to make sure
36:28 - you re-sync it
36:30 - um as far as the space brought i think
36:33 - it's going to be best that you reach out
36:35 - to your your rep whoever you've been
36:38 - working with
36:39 - and they can work through with you on
36:40 - those details because i'm not very
36:42 - familiar with your subscription itself
36:57 - antoinette i did see your question here
36:59 - about doing a small
37:01 - demonstration on how to teach code
37:03 - monkey there is a webinar that i did a
37:07 - little while ago
37:08 - and it is um getting started with coding
37:10 - adventure and i did like a mini
37:12 - type of lesson of teaching i would say
37:14 - that would be a really good resource
37:17 - for how to teach with code monkey i
37:19 - definitely would recommend that as well
37:23 - okay and i see a couple of questions
37:26 - here
37:28 - i already created student accounts with
37:30 - their emails is it too late to sync with
37:33 - the google classroom
37:35 - patty if they've already logged in
37:39 - i would um
37:43 - i would say just reach out to whoever
37:46 - your rep is or
37:47 - to support codemonkey.com and we can
37:49 - look into that sometimes if the student
37:51 - accounts are already
37:53 - google related like they have a they're
37:56 - already google
37:57 - authenticated there is a way that we can
38:00 - we can help you with that if you would
38:02 - like so just
38:04 - um i would say just reach out to support
38:06 - codemonkey.com and
38:07 - we can help take care of that for you
38:10 - um will the recording be available after
38:13 - this it's always

38:36 - here there's also some student webinars
38:39 - that i personally did with students
