00:00 - I realized I was paused so let me go
00:02 - back here how to make steam how to make
00:05 - coding equitable and create soon
00:06 - engagement during the code with 19
00:08 - pandemic and then you can follow us on
00:10 - our social media channels and our code
00:11 - our code monkey ambassadors today are
00:13 - going to share a little bit about their
00:15 - blocks that they've created I like to
00:17 - start off with just introducing myself
00:19 - my name is Lena Saleh and I'm the sales
00:21 - and professional development manager
00:22 - here at code monkey you can follow me on
00:24 - Twitter or you can email me at any time
00:26 - at Lena s code monkey comm I like um a
00:30 - former classroom teacher and obviously
00:33 - all of this remote learning and thing
00:35 - has also affected us all as well so we
00:38 - hope we can provide you some value
00:39 - during today's webinar and if you have
00:41 - any questions please put them in the
00:43 - chat box or the Q&A and we will get to
00:46 - your questions the best that we can
00:48 - during today's webinar we don't answer
00:50 - your question we'll make sure to follow
00:51 - up with any anything left untouched so
00:56 - now I'm going to present my great team
00:58 - that is with me here today and that is
01:01 - our code monkey teacher ambassadors all
01:06 - right so we're going to go ahead with
01:08 - Paige hi my name is Paige best-off and
01:12 - from New Jersey and I've been teaching
01:14 - computer science for approximately 20
01:17 - years I'm currently teaching digital
01:19 - technology and the gifted and talented
01:20 - program for grades two through five
01:23 - where our concentration is encoding
01:25 - robotics steam before becoming a teacher
01:29 - I worked in the nonprofit field tracking
01:33 - employment trends and my area of
01:35 - expertise and what I stress is getting
01:37 - students ready for careers
01:40 - what's better than we were reading this
01:43 - thank you so much Paige for joining us
01:45 - and and developing this webinar today
01:49 - Michelle
01:53 - I am a Michelle ward and I'm a pre-k
01:56 - through eighth grade keyboard computer
01:58 - apps computer science teacher code
02:02 - monkey teacher ambassador I am a CST a
02:04 - member and I'm also presenting at st 20
02:08 - it was the summer but it's been moved to
02:11 - November
02:12 - I am a 23-year veteran teacher taught
02:16 - eighteen years at the high school five
02:19 - of those years the high school has
02:21 - advanced computers to a little bit
02:23 - everything desktop publishing
02:24 - interactive multimedia presentation web
02:27 - design one and two proficient and the
02:30 - Adobe design suite as well as HTML and
02:34 - JavaScript
02:34 - I was also 13 years high school teacher
02:38 - with the math everything from
02:41 - pre-algebra all the way up to algebra 2
02:43 - and technical geometry I am a certified
02:48 - digital designer I also taught
02:51 - accounting 201 and 202 as an adjunct
02:54 - professor
02:56 - as you can see I'm a furrier student and
02:59 - a stop TopCoder
03:00 - my area expertise is Microsoft 365 and
03:04 - I'm also a certified Microsoft
03:06 - innovative educator awesome thank you so
03:10 - much Michelle
03:11 - all right Xavier Priya chamomile sorry
03:18 - good morning everyone my name is javi
03:21 - real are in a bilingual teacher and his
03:23 - is for war Montessori Academy we are a
03:25 - Montessori School to supplicate the 5th
03:28 - graders and I truly believe er if my
03:32 - committee my commitment as an educator
03:34 - is to provide a good coating
03:38 - applications to my students so I am
03:41 - proud ambassador for Osmo also Osteen
03:44 - I've cam in my schools and Lego master
03:46 - educator as a geek person I really love
03:49 - Legos is a for the creativity and
03:52 - hands-on so I really love Legos and also
03:56 - a bit sports ambassador
03:57 - it's another company to provide his
03:58 - JavaScript examples and also I'm proud
04:02 - to be a code monkey ambassador and to
04:04 - presenting in different F camps this is
04:07 - my sixth year in this school where no
04:10 - computer science for all so when I
04:13 - present in these these to my
04:16 - administration say you're crazy these
04:18 - kids they can learn in a coding they
04:20 - they don't know how to type I don't have
04:22 - to say it let's do it because they have
04:24 - fundamentals for co.org so my my goal is
04:27 - up a father or to curse to empower more
04:30 - girls and to have everybody at the same
04:32 - opportunity to learn computer science so
04:34 - like I said and I'm a lingual teacher do
04:36 - you have any questions in Spanish I'm
04:38 - here to help you guys thank you awesome
04:43 - thank you so much Javier before we get
04:45 - started I just want to let you know that
04:46 - this webinar was entirely created by our
04:49 - teacher ambassadors so they have put
04:51 - lots of hard work blood sweat and tears
04:53 - into today's presentation so feel free
04:56 - to ask them any questions and they're
04:58 - happy to be here along the way so
05:00 - without further ado go ahead and get
05:02 - started hi so today's activities are
05:08 - going to include talking about student
05:10 - engagement collaboration equity amongst
05:13 - your students some unplugged activities
05:16 - and talking about skills and incentives
05:19 - to get your students engaged next okay
05:23 - so I'm gonna start out talking about how
05:25 - to engage your students during distance
05:27 - learning next hey go back on please oh
05:39 - oops did I mess up the order here okay
05:43 - oh this is the right way oops sorry
05:46 - this one right or no nope you're too far
05:50 - ahead too far something's missing oh I
05:54 - did go too far I'm so sorry you guys
05:56 - that's okay alright yeah okay next okay
06:03 - here we go all right so once a week I
06:06 - just taught I see my students in person
06:09 - so now that we're doing distance
06:11 - learning weekly I post a teacher video
06:15 - talking about what the activity for the
06:17 - week is going to be giving them their
06:19 - instructions and right now I'm using
06:22 - flipgrid but you can use seesaw some
06:24 - other applications and then once my
06:27 - students watch me in my video with the
06:29 - directions they go on to code monkey
06:31 - they work on their lessons and then I
06:34 - have them come back into the application
06:36 - and they talk about how they've solved
06:40 - the puzzles so here are some students
06:43 - who were screenshots so you can see how
06:46 - my students post their puzzles next okay
06:51 - so next we're going to talk about how to
06:53 - foster this collaboration so it's really
06:56 - next so it's really important to me that
06:59 - my students see me and they have a
07:01 - connection with me as well as them
07:04 - seeing each other again we're all on
07:07 - distance social distancing so we really
07:10 - want them to feel that they're part of a
07:12 - community so what I've done is if my
07:15 - students have cell phone but they do not
07:18 - have any devices at home I have them use
07:23 - some kind of video
07:24 - application FaceTime Skype Google
07:28 - hangout zoom and I have them do what's
07:33 - called paired programming so pair
07:35 - programming is when two people work on a
07:38 - coding activity together using only one
07:41 - device so when I'm in my classroom as
07:44 - you can see there's a picture of my two
07:46 - students they're using one device and
07:48 - they working collaboratively together
07:49 - but since there cannot be together what
07:53 - we do is they do some kind of video chat
07:56 - and I know a lot of families did that
07:59 - over the holidays last week and very
08:03 - popular to do a zoom or house party with
08:07 - your family members
08:08 - so I have them do the same type of thing
08:11 - one student will use the device they'll
08:13 - show the device on their screen to their
08:18 - peer and they'll work together on the
08:21 - puzzles even if students have their own
08:23 - devices they can still work over the
08:25 - phone together I remember as a high
08:27 - school student talking with my friends
08:30 - on the phone working together on
08:32 - different assignments so this way you
08:34 - always have somebody to work with you
08:36 - okay next okay so I post my assignments
08:41 - in Google classroom but if any of the
08:43 - learning management systems will do and
08:46 - what I do is I'll post the assignment
08:48 - and my students will comment on each
08:51 - other's work so this way again they have
08:55 - some kind of connection
08:57 - if a student is stuck on a puzzle and
08:59 - not sure what then what they should be
09:01 - working on they don't know what to do I
09:03 - don't have to be the only one to help
09:05 - them I currently have 407 students so
09:08 - it's very difficult for me to reach each
09:12 - and every one of them and a lot of them
09:13 - will have the same question on the same
09:15 - puzzle so I allow my students to post
09:19 - comments and ask questions while they
09:21 - are in Google classroom and also if a
09:26 - student found a puzzle particularly
09:29 - challenging and they know that their
09:31 - classmates are going to need some help I
09:33 - have them record themselves teaching how
09:36 - to do that
09:37 - and again that brings us all closer
09:40 - together I also use a program called
09:43 - tarot deck but you could also use on air
09:47 - pod buncee and puzzle there are a couple
09:49 - of other different companies that you
09:51 - can use and what I do is I have a
09:54 - synchronous lessons for my students so I
09:59 - create in Google slides using a pear
10:03 - deck of addition and they go through the
10:08 - slides individually at their own pace
10:11 - and they can learn Unplugged coding
10:14 - activities okay next okay so a lot of
10:20 - students again I mentioned before do not
10:22 - have devices I have many students who do
10:25 - not have access to any devices but I
10:27 - want to make sure that they're still
10:28 - learning coding I want to make sure that
10:31 - things are equitable so my next slide so
10:36 - what I do is I can give them paper and
10:39 - pencil activities so for students who do
10:42 - not have access to any devices at home
10:44 - they can build an obstacle course using
10:48 - pillows toys stuffed animals household
10:52 - items and they can write the code to
10:57 - teach their family members how to
10:59 - actually get through this obstacle
11:01 - course I have a lot of students who are
11:03 - siblings so I hope that they are working
11:06 - well they are working together some of
11:08 - them and working through the puzzles and
11:13 - creating different courses for
11:14 - themselves if they have access to a
11:17 - phone maybe a parents phone they can
11:18 - take a picture of it and then they can
11:20 - upload that to Google classroom and for
11:23 - evidence of learning those families
11:26 - where the parents are busy because they
11:28 - are working and the students do not have
11:30 - anybody at home to interact with I have
11:33 - them do the same thing they'll build the
11:35 - obstacle course and then they can post
11:37 - the picture in Google classroom and then
11:40 - their friends and peers
11:42 - can then do the coding activity and also
11:46 - post their responses in Google classroom
11:49 - okay
11:50 - we also um look okay so we also have
11:56 - different coding vocabulary the first
11:59 - one I have listed here is algorithms so
12:02 - algorithms is a list of steps that
12:05 - students that you would follow for
12:07 - everyday activities so I can have
12:09 - students write out a list of different
12:11 - algorithms another vocabulary word is
12:15 - loops and that's something that repeats
12:17 - over and over again so you can have your
12:20 - students write out a list of things that
12:22 - loop so for example if you want them to
12:24 - brush their hair you tell them brush
12:27 - your hair from top to bottom
12:28 - brush your hair from top to bottom brush
12:30 - your hair from over and over again
12:32 - instead you can say just brush your hair
12:34 - from top to bottom ten times and the
12:38 - last activity I have listed here is
12:40 - functions so a function is something
12:44 - that you don't need to give directions
12:46 - for for example make a sandwich so you
12:51 - would teach somebody how to make that
12:53 - peanut butter and sandwich cookie nut
12:55 - butter and jelly sandwich that first
12:56 - time and then you don't have to tell
12:58 - them again those individual steps you
13:01 - can just say as a function make a
13:03 - sandwich whether you're new to coding or
13:07 - not you do not have to be the expert
13:10 - make sure that you are you are
13:13 - facilitating and teaching your students
13:16 - how to become the expert so whether I'm
13:18 - in person or distance learning I make
13:21 - sure that my students are the ones who
13:23 - are teaching each other how to do the
13:27 - puzzles and if your students have
13:29 - trouble and they're not sure how to do
13:31 - the puzzles
13:32 - please remember that code monkey has the
13:35 - teacher solutions there for you you do
13:38 - not have to be the expert there's no way
13:40 - that you're going to be able to learn
13:43 - how to do every puzzle possible
13:46 - okay next if you're interested in
13:51 - finding out more about coding computer
13:53 - science or anything that I teach you can
13:56 - follow me on Twitter Facebook check my
13:59 - website and read my blog post thank you
14:04 - thank you so much Paige
14:26 - Michelle are you are you there
14:28 - I am I forgot I forgot to thank me I had
14:33 - my finger on another yacht that's okay I
14:38 - am Michelle ward and I am presenting the
14:41 - unclogged activity section I have so
14:44 - much stuff and if you want to see all
14:47 - the stuff there are several links in
14:50 - this presentation and I think we are
14:53 - going to be sending this presentation to
14:55 - all of you go ahead and do the next
14:58 - slide for me Lena next now why is it
15:07 - important that we have unplugged
15:08 - activities because some of our students
15:10 - do not have any devices or no compatible
15:13 - devices slow internet we are facing
15:19 - several cities that were ravaged by the
15:23 - tornadoes that have nothing going on
15:26 - right now and whenever things do get
15:29 - back together they still may not have
15:31 - internet capabilities so this might be
15:33 - something that teachers could provide
15:35 - for those students computer downtime I
15:39 - am addicted to technology and I know
15:42 - several our students are also and this
15:45 - is a great way to kind of get their head
15:47 - out of the computer I'm big on hands-on
15:50 - learning kinesthetic learning it's just
15:51 - how I taught as a math teacher I was a
15:54 - crazy kooky teacher that everyone loves
15:56 - to talk about but my kids really did
15:59 - learn and sometimes it's nice to have
16:01 - some fun family activities something to
16:04 - bring the family together
16:05 - you never know the kid may actually be
16:07 - able to teach their mom and dad
16:08 - something cool about computer science
16:11 - next please
16:17 - I'm gonna walk
16:19 - through I'm gonna try to do three of
16:21 - these and these were just three of kind
16:25 - of my favorite ones and I like to pull
16:28 - in a lot of maths because I taught maths
16:31 - for a long time and I also like to pull
16:35 - in some music because that's just
16:38 - something different who puts computer
16:40 - science and music together I do and I
16:43 - went also going to have one that deals
16:45 - with exercise just trying to get us up
16:49 - and motivated so this first one is a
16:51 - product code check digits and I taught
16:55 - this lesson 20 years ago with zip codes
16:59 - and there's no prerequisite for it but
17:03 - if you want to go through the modulo
17:04 - lesson that helps and I'll talk about
17:06 - the modular lesson later and if you have
17:10 - any type an item it has a product code
17:15 - on it write UPC code bar code whatever
17:20 - you want to call it and on that code you
17:23 - have different numbers and what I did I
17:26 - pulled the numbers off of this code the
17:30 - first step is you're going to write your
17:32 - numbers out but you're going to
17:34 - alternate you're going to have the odd
17:36 - position ones first
17:39 - and the evil one position second so if
17:42 - you look at this number the very far
17:44 - left-hand corner there's a six so that's
17:47 - where that six came from and then the
17:49 - next number is a three that's where this
17:52 - number came from and you're going to
17:54 - alternate going all the way across now
17:59 - the bar code the numbers are actually
18:01 - embedded within those loans and that's
18:03 - something totally different also but
18:09 - you get to the end of it notice I didn't
18:12 - write the last number the last number is
18:15 - two that is your check digit and it's
18:19 - gonna come into play the last step trust
18:22 - me we'll get there it's gonna be a
18:24 - little bit of math but I know you guys
18:25 - are smart you can do it so first step
18:29 - you're going to add up that first row of
18:32 - numbers that was in green so I'm going
18:34 - to add those together I want to add all
18:36 - those together we get 17 now we're going
18:42 - to continue and we're gonna use the
18:45 - digit from the ones column
18:47 - the last digit so if you're really
18:50 - trying to focus on the math you'll focus
18:53 - on the ones digit if you just want them
18:55 - to get it quick to say okay you're going
18:58 - to grab hope that last digit which is a
19:00 - seven and it's going to come into play
19:02 - here in a moment your next step is to
19:05 - add up your second row of numbers now
19:09 - you notice that this Row is one less
19:11 - number than the previous line so you're
19:14 - going to add all those numbers together
19:16 - and when you add all those numbers
19:18 - together we get 27 now this example they
19:24 - gave us you actually have the same
19:27 - number for the last digit now I didn't
19:31 - come up with this example it came off of
19:32 - CS unplugged it's a little bit of a
19:35 - coincidence you might want to try
19:37 - something where it's not all the same
19:40 - digit so
19:47 - well that last number again the seven
19:51 - your next step
19:53 - you always multiply by three you're
19:57 - going to take the seven that you got
19:59 - from the last number in step two and you
20:03 - multiply it by three
20:04 - and you're going to get 21 you're going
20:09 - to take the last digit of that 21 which
20:12 - is a 1 then what you're going to do from
20:18 - your step 3 you're going to take that 7
20:21 - now unplugged CS unplugged I got their
20:24 - colors wrong this one is pink this
20:28 - number here should be pink this one is
20:30 - yellow this number should be Yoho I
20:32 - noticed that but I figured you guys be
20:35 - able to follow along so I multiplied 3
20:40 - times 7 from step 2 the last numbers
20:44 - study and step 2 then I'm going to add
20:49 - from step 3 that's 7 that we had the
20:53 - last digit to the last digit in step 4
20:57 - which is 1 and that gives us 8 you know
21:02 - with me
21:02 - that's the worst of the maths so now
21:05 - where does that checksum come in so
21:08 - you're gonna ask yourself look there's
21:10 - some algebra what plus 8 is equal to 10
21:13 - well we know the answer is 2 and lo and
21:19 - behold look and see what that check
21:21 - digit is - next slide
21:29 - so what does that mean or do you need
21:34 - some major help there is a video and
21:37 - it's a really good quality video that
21:40 - I've got linked to this presentation
21:41 - from CS unplugged and the teacher goes
21:45 - through this also I think she's
21:48 - Australian but she you can understand
21:50 - her very well now what does this do what
21:55 - why do we have a check digit or a check
21:59 - doing the checksum you know whenever you
22:02 - scan your product
22:04 - and it goes across there and sometimes
22:05 - it doesn't read right you hear this beep
22:07 - you know they'll look at it like I'm
22:11 - gonna run it through the again beep and
22:13 - if something is damaged to this if it's
22:15 - bent or damaged or like that paint can
22:18 - had something on it then they've got to
22:21 - do what manually enter in those lovely
22:24 - numbers and you know they're gonna kind
22:25 - of look at you like oh you had to pick
22:28 - the one thing like that it's a lot in
22:30 - those numbers so they'll put those
22:32 - numbers in now if they get the numbers
22:34 - incorrectly it'll ring upright that this
22:37 - was some ink for my printer but if they
22:40 - put it in wrong it might ring up that's
22:43 - a doorknob so when you put numbers in
22:50 - wrong you have four different kinds of
22:53 - errors and this is where I can actually
22:55 - tie it into accounting your felt four
22:58 - main types of errors you have if the
23:01 - internet and a digit value has changed
23:03 - that's called a transcription error
23:06 - because they put in the wrong value to
23:11 - the adjacent digits are swapped you how
23:13 - about what I call a dyslexic moment
23:15 - that's a transposition error a digit is
23:18 - inserted in the number that's something
23:21 - that's not even there that's called a
23:23 - commissioned error or a digit is removed
23:26 - from the number that means one is
23:28 - omitted so that is an omission now there
23:31 - is one thing that you can do with
23:33 - transposition errors if you're running
23:36 - your your code and it doesn't quite work
23:39 - out right if you take the number
23:42 - let's say it's supposed to been 56 but
23:44 - you entered 65 if you take those two
23:47 - numbers and subtract you always will get
23:49 - what none so anytime you have a
23:52 - transposition error if it's off by 9
23:55 - then you know somewhere you had a moment
23:57 - where you swapped your numbers next
24:00 - please
24:05 - now this next one is the Fitness one
24:11 - there are two they've gone on this slide
24:13 - but we're gonna focus on that last one
24:16 - that's called fitness unplugged all
24:19 - right next please
24:23 - so on the fitness unplug one I really
24:26 - like this one it's a whole family or if
24:32 - you have lots of kids it's a way to get
24:34 - kids together you need at least three
24:37 - members to be working on this so the
24:41 - first thing that you're gonna do as a
24:43 - family you're going to brainstorm some
24:45 - different fitness exercises it could be
24:48 - running on the spot running in place
24:50 - star jumps which is some strange looking
24:54 - jumping jack ski jump through you're
24:56 - jumping from the side to the side or you
24:58 - could be catching beanbags so that's the
25:02 - first thing is kind of brainstorming and
25:04 - collaborate then you're going to work
25:07 - together and draw on each of the cards
25:09 - now it doesn't have to be anything fancy
25:11 - it could just be whatever you've got
25:13 - around the house and you're going to
25:15 - write these on the cards you're gonna
25:17 - have a go or a start card for the start
25:21 - of the program now put mine in green
25:23 - because green is go and then you got
25:26 - four cards each with a different
25:28 - exercise on it so I did the running play
25:30 - star jump ski jumps and they catch the
25:34 - bean bag then you got to figure out how
25:37 - you're going to finish you get to choose
25:41 - strike a pose sit with your arms crossed
25:44 - or stand as straight as you can
25:47 - next slide then
25:55 - I go through all this detail a big
25:58 - discussion on what you need to do on
26:00 - steps three to six all you're really
26:02 - doing is placing your cards figuring out
26:05 - what they mean and discussing mainly if
26:08 - you have an exercise that maybe someone
26:11 - doesn't understand what are you supposed
26:12 - to do for that particular exercise
26:15 - that's to be a good place to discuss
26:17 - that way you are talking the same
26:19 - programming language now they talked
26:22 - about placing whiteboards I don't know
26:25 - about you I don't have any whiteboards
26:26 - at home so what you could do is just use
26:31 - a piece of paper that works just fine
26:35 - for a whiteboard or if it's nice you can
26:38 - take it outside and draw some squares
26:40 - with chalk on your driveway or in the
26:44 - middle the road you can put your cards
26:46 - down if you're outside you want to
26:48 - actually put something on it so I'd put
26:50 - a rocker or whatever you got to keep it
26:52 - in place and you need a hula hoop if you
26:57 - don't have a hula hoop you can use a
26:58 - jump rope something that you could make
27:01 - into a decent sized circle that would
27:05 - have two of your cards inside of it if
27:08 - you see in my graphic you see what that
27:11 - might be about of course you're not
27:15 - really telling anyone what what does
27:18 - that hula hoop do next slide so what
27:25 - comes next we get to use a little bit of
27:27 - computer lingo you got to set the
27:29 - parameters and a parameter all it does
27:31 - is tell us how long to do something how
27:34 - many times to do something so we know go
27:39 - but how many store jumps are we supposed
27:42 - to do
27:42 - how many ski jumps are we supposed to do
27:45 - to catch the beanbag but not how many
27:48 - and then should we repeat the ski jumps
27:54 - and catch a beanbag but not how many
27:56 - times oh that's what the hula hoop is
27:58 - for it's a loop you got to make sure
28:01 - that you choose reasonable numbers you
28:04 - don't want to do a hundred of anything
28:06 - orient unless you're just that
28:08 - it so you've got to make sure that if
28:11 - you're letting your kids decide this
28:13 - that they use a reasonable number
28:15 - alright next slide now you're going to
28:22 - write in the number of times X each
28:24 - exercise should be done and for the
28:28 - exercises in the hula hoop you need to
28:30 - repeat both of them how many times well
28:34 - in this example you see the three that's
28:36 - in the chord that's above the hula hoop
28:38 - so that is how many times you're going
28:42 - to go through the loop or how many
28:43 - iterations that you have and I snuck in
28:46 - a little bit of computer jargon do you
28:48 - have to use computer jargon no but you
28:50 - can if you know it just a big good time
28:52 - to kind of introduce it and then you
28:54 - would kind of discuss okay so if we
28:56 - repeat it three times we'd have 10 ski
28:59 - jumps and then five times you catch the
29:01 - beanbag and then you do that two more
29:03 - times next slide please
29:10 - then it's a fun part it's time to test
29:13 - it so I really didn't say about the jobs
29:18 - that each person could have you have a
29:21 - programmer and you have a tester so the
29:25 - programmer is going to watch to see if
29:26 - everyone is doing it correctly and the
29:29 - tester is going to be looking for any
29:34 - numbers to change or if the activities
29:37 - need more instructions when the tester
29:40 - says go you're going to start following
29:42 - your fitness app the programmer is going
29:45 - to ask the tester if he or she saw
29:47 - anything that could be changed or
29:49 - improved you can
29:53 - so discuss any computer lingo that you
29:56 - know at this point or you can just kind
29:58 - of just say okay we did it and we
30:01 - created our own program we were
30:04 - discussing our own programming language
30:08 - all right next slide now we get to put
30:16 - computer science and some music together
30:19 - using the modulo operator now I'm not
30:23 - sure how many of you know about the
30:25 - modulo operator
30:26 - it sounds foreboding but it's not all it
30:31 - is is that something has a circular
30:34 - reference next slide so what I'm talking
30:43 - about circular reference the months of
30:45 - the year are modulo 12 because we have
30:48 - four months after November is coming
30:50 - March 13 months after January is
30:52 - February and so on it's circular right
30:56 - same thing where the clock it is also
30:59 - going to be circular music so if you
31:07 - name the music notes the musical notes
31:10 - is modulo 7 if you start at note D
31:14 - that's in green on a piano and you count
31:17 - up seven white notes or white keys
31:19 - you'll end back up on D which is the
31:22 - same note but it's an octave higher and
31:26 - this raises an interesting fact that
31:28 - there are seven different notes an
31:30 - octave is it what is opt mean 8 hmm a
31:38 - mistake let's count it this way so
31:43 - you're going to count the start and the
31:46 - end so if I count the start d e f g a b
31:50 - c d 8 high octave so now if you get
32:00 - there are actually 12 different notes in
32:03 - Oktay because you have sharps and flats
32:05 - the Black Keys and you will have 12
32:09 - semitones that's what they all call it
32:11 - we call them half steps when I was in
32:14 - music theory and so if you start at D
32:17 - and you go up to an octave higher D it's
32:20 - a total of 12 different notes on the
32:22 - piano just like the 12 months in the
32:25 - calendar here next so the cyclic number
32:32 - relationship comes up when playing notes
32:34 - and computer programs which often use a
32:37 - digital representation of piano notes
32:40 - called MIDI so I'm going to try to wrap
32:50 - this up very quickly
32:53 - in a system middle c is note number
32:57 - sixty C sharp is 61 and D is 62 so an
33:02 - octave above D which is 62 you'd add 12
33:06 - and that would put you at 70 for every
33:10 - twelfth number corresponds to the same
33:13 - note name now I've got a little bit of a
33:18 - challenge for you I put a little bit of
33:21 - MIDI music in the middle of this so I'm
33:23 - going off the chart the X is going to be
33:26 - a quarter rest if it is in parenthesis
33:32 - that's a whole note the red pipes is the
33:35 - end of a measure so I gave you a little
33:40 - bit of code we're gonna do this in 4/4
33:43 - time anyone think they know what that is
33:47 - you need a hint see if I can do this
33:53 - without messing up even recognize that
34:07 - miss a last note that would be like
34:12 - Beethoven's fifth symphony next slide if
34:20 - you need to get in touch with me I've
34:23 - got some articles on code monkey blog
34:25 - how to explain algorithms to kids
34:26 - programming for six to twelve year olds
34:29 - I am on twitter at shelley thirteen ward
34:32 - you can join me on facebook at code
34:34 - monkey superfans or you can visit my
34:36 - class website Ward's wise walks at
34:40 - weebly.com thank you
34:46 - thank you so much Michelle hi how to use
34:53 - coal monkey or Corinne to incentive
34:55 - students and providing skills for the
34:57 - future it looks a huge topic but I
35:01 - really want to share with you my
35:03 - experience with my students so next so
35:10 - how do I incorporate con monkey nowhere
35:12 - Elementary School
35:14 - I begin with code monkey jr. before it
35:17 - was only available in tablet seven notes
35:19 - and iPads however right now is available
35:22 - for any device so I'm really happy for
35:24 - do that because any of my students from
35:27 - kinder I teach them how to use the mouse
35:31 - in this case right now the finger for
35:34 - the iPads and also the mouse so I
35:36 - believe so it's important to provide
35:39 - that kind of experience to in earlier
35:41 - stages for my students so I believe
35:44 - exposing the kids to computers early has
35:47 - if faker raising awareness for kids a
35:50 - struggles of technology and gives them
35:52 - the first experience or troubleshooting
35:55 - and sometimes they're frustrated because
35:58 - they don't so hard to use in it but I
36:00 - give you that confidence and I use some
36:03 - of my students they already mastered
36:04 - this tooth out there is a struggle so I
36:07 - already promoting then some kind of
36:09 - leadership skills and also teamwork
36:12 - another skills are really doing with my
36:16 - kids is critical thinking sometimes I
36:18 - ask them so I'm here to help you but I'm
36:21 - not here to answer the question so to
36:23 - give you the answer please before to ask
36:26 - me at your elbow partner to looking for
36:30 - the solution I'll he do it of course I
36:33 - ask my students don't give you the
36:35 - correct answer I give you some clues
36:36 - because really students they may need to
36:40 - think in little by themselves because I
36:42 - mention it all the time when you already
36:44 - in that taste or something is gonna be
36:45 - only yourself so you need to answer it
36:48 - questions for that so promoting critical
36:49 - thinking problem-solving war and
36:52 - creativity is one of my steps for that
36:54 - for my students so next
37:01 - so I know there ray resourcing code
37:04 - monkey is the beaver achiever
37:06 - that is awesome product because my
37:08 - students start thinking it's very easy
37:11 - but it's really the blocking and drop
37:14 - they are practicing already previously
37:16 - from Kota Oros crash they they see the
37:20 - character in this case the beaver moving
37:22 - out put it all the date drops and the
37:25 - woods and everything is fun for them and
37:27 - they finish happy for to that we do this
37:30 - last year with the our code and really
37:32 - enjoy it so thank you for to talk with
37:35 - my students and it's an incentive for
37:37 - them because I see the happiness when
37:39 - they said mr. Aguilar I did challenge
37:42 - number 17 I can have two stars Ryan I
37:45 - have three stars so it's exciting for me
37:47 - when I see the exciting for them as well
37:49 - to inside win-win teacher-student so
37:52 - next so for my upper graders third to
37:58 - fifth graders they already know a little
38:01 - more demanding with them because sighs I
38:03 - very sometimes struggle as a teacher
38:06 - they see my 5th graders is still typing
38:09 - with one finger I think so it's for
38:12 - every old teachers they struggle died in
38:14 - elementary middle school in high schools
38:16 - because I don't blame it everything you
38:19 - can do it is with ice telephone you can
38:20 - use one finger with a tablet you use one
38:23 - finger but at the same time I ask the
38:25 - students the real world recorded you
38:28 - have at least 35 to 60 words per minute
38:30 - to type in so you want to move into be a
38:33 - programmer you need to be a good type in
38:35 - so i reinforce them to say to know what
38:38 - let's go continue practicing because
38:40 - syntax errors in Korean is very critical
38:43 - because you are gonna be debugging and
38:45 - incorporated a little turn for them to
38:47 - start family residing with their turn
38:49 - for algorithm ugh in box and everything
38:53 - so I try to create that confidence for
38:57 - my students so next
39:02 - so like I mention it I started doing my
39:06 - students first
39:07 - oh well I'm so sorry I used Dom towards
39:11 - Matt for four and three traders because
39:14 - my colleagues in my school the same is
39:18 - regular do you can help us with
39:19 - something for my students because they
39:20 - struggle in math and said you know what
39:22 - I have a great product for do that so
39:25 - when they're coming to my class as a
39:27 - special class I saw my students twice I
39:29 - awake for 45 to an hour I put it this
39:32 - one they say let's go to Matt so dough
39:35 - mats they give you the challenge to
39:37 - start with a subtraction addition and
39:39 - they made some angles so it students
39:42 - practicing a little bit and my my
39:44 - colleagues they said okay they're
39:46 - labeled for proficiency in that there
39:49 - little by little is is better so thank
39:53 - you for to do that and say I don't do a
39:55 - lot because the students do by
39:56 - themselves by imagery train I hate to
39:59 - help you you need to find the answer
40:02 - so they struggle a little bit of course
40:05 - aside Kato I give you some clues and
40:07 - they found the correct answer with a
40:09 - practicing with the dome at and also
40:11 - another product after that is the banana
40:14 - tells because they use JavaScript
40:16 - I'm sorry use Python so for that it's a
40:19 - little more challenge for my students
40:22 - barrel they doing with great success for
40:24 - that next so like I mention it with my
40:32 - students I start for the blocky coat and
40:36 - I move upon blocky this crash is crushed
40:40 - junior iMovie to coda
40:43 - org fundamentals all the course photo
40:46 - mentals and I adapted the curriculum for
40:49 - coda or computer scientist cover it is
40:51 - the target audience for middle school
40:53 - sixth to eighth graders but I adapted
40:55 - for my fifth graders of course with the
40:58 - permission for coda or to do that so I
41:00 - attended a conference with a coded or
41:03 - for how to incorporate as a computer
41:06 - science discovery to my students like I
41:09 - said I always looking for opportunities
41:11 - to my students to exposure them to say
41:14 - you know what these opportunities for
41:15 - you or computer science you need to
41:17 - learn because when you're gonna be in
41:18 - middle school and high school you're
41:20 - gonna be see more about this so moving
41:22 - from scratch 2.0 because some of my
41:25 - students they want to continue practice
41:27 - calm but I don't have internet so one of
41:30 - the solution is to have the scratch 2.0
41:34 - saving and a pin drive and then putting
41:37 - on one of the computers for the parents
41:38 - and they take it at home and I give you
41:40 - an assignment had to do it at home step
41:43 - by step with a scratch 2.0 of course the
41:46 - 3.0 version you can save it in I USB
41:49 - Drive but uh Elise is the same concept
41:52 - if they already mastered a 2.0 it's
41:54 - gonna be easy to try to move it to 3.0
41:57 - after that I can have been looking for
41:59 - options for to start doing the web-based
42:01 - transcript a Corinne life for example
42:04 - right now called monkey they use that
42:05 - one bits voice is another great tool
42:07 - that use in it because they give you
42:09 - like thing lines of code but of course
42:12 - my students sometimes we'd have a little
42:15 - syntax errors they forgot to close the
42:17 - parenthesis or they forget to put the
42:19 - comma the semi color or to have the
42:21 - difference between the square bracket a
42:24 - corny bracket so I mentioned today and
42:26 - that's very important to you understand
42:30 - when you're typing and recognize all the
42:32 - characters and your keyboard
42:33 - you don't be confusing when you put a
42:36 - different or to the wrong a bracket so
42:41 - and then you see here in the link I put
42:43 - in soon article they ready for code
42:46 - monkey they have a lot of resources
42:48 - there you can maybe check it out later
42:51 - on and I give you all my resources that
42:55 - using in by grade so you are in pre-k to
42:59 - fifth graders I really encourage you to
43:01 - you don't have any program right now
43:03 - incorporating your school do it
43:06 - it's very helpful and the resources out
43:08 - there is computer science first for
43:10 - educators is also beats what say for
43:13 - educators they have a lot of resources
43:14 - guys next
43:20 - how can use Korea's incentive for my
43:23 - students like I mention is sometimes
43:25 - right now when I in the class regular
43:27 - class my students like to have playing
43:30 - with LEGOs so play with minecraft or
43:32 - play with roblox or they want to
43:34 - practicing with a leg or a beat wrist so
43:37 - they want to use you know I have as few
43:39 - as well so I have all these resources in
43:42 - the classroom for them but at the same
43:44 - time and said you know what today is the
43:46 - lesson from challenge want to challenge
43:48 - twinny
43:49 - i untie I'm sorry challenge what to
43:51 - challenge them at least you need to
43:53 - finish with three stars you finished
43:55 - that one you can move to have the option
43:58 - to do Legos and then you can do a Sphero
44:00 - or you can do minecraft but at the same
44:03 - time I encourage them so you know what I
44:05 - see you're practicing in where you have
44:08 - wanna start what happening you do
44:10 - improve it treat try to do three stars
44:12 - guys because that show me that you
44:15 - understand the concept you already
44:17 - realize what is the problem and you can
44:19 - maybe have an incentive for that like I
44:22 - said now for me for example Raynor the
44:26 - Immy trees they offer any color see
44:28 - Amazon they offer a free trial for you
44:31 - as a teacher and unlimited license for
44:34 - your students I highly recommend it to
44:37 - use the Elina you want to click there
44:40 - for me Lina
44:45 - decoder see color see the first one
44:49 - coders say yes thank you
44:55 - like I said this a must
44:57 - Amazon future engineer right now
44:59 - offering these for free guys and you can
45:02 - raise her and they ask you a couple of
45:03 - questions whatever you incorporated
45:06 - right now in your school how many
45:08 - license you need it and they reply right
45:10 - away to you and send it the sign up for
45:13 - as a teacher and you create new
45:15 - classrooms and I said is free so you
45:17 - want to take advantage for these guys I
45:19 - really want to appreciate it let's go
45:21 - back the other one I really want to say
45:23 - to mention to you right now is the s
45:26 - fear is also offering free resources for
45:28 - lesson plans for you unlock activities I
45:31 - know and also you have this fetus with
45:33 - you
45:34 - you can have that learning with a
45:37 - Minecraft education right now guys you
45:39 - want to click that Leena also I want to
45:41 - share with you guys
45:48 - minecraft right now is suffering free
45:51 - access for educators and teach and
45:55 - students so the regular lights and it's
45:58 - not too expensive is five dollars for
46:00 - the complete school year but you need to
46:02 - be a 365 user or microcell user to do
46:07 - that also little bits is offering a lot
46:10 - of resources for free guys this time I
46:13 - tried to rein us create a server to use
46:16 - for only for my class necks so today we
46:27 - cover some of these topics guys really
46:30 - want to say you have any questions
46:32 - something we covered the student
46:34 - engagement collaboration every unblock
46:37 - activities skills and incentives and I
46:40 - really appreciated a and here to help
46:42 - you guys thank you so much next alright
47:02 - so if you have any questions for us you
47:05 - can go ahead and pop that into the chat
47:07 - box I want to thank our teacher
47:09 - ambassadors so much for joining us today
47:13 - so we'll take a couple of minutes to
47:15 - just go ahead and leave some time for
47:17 - some Q&A and so if you have some
47:19 - questions you can pop them like I said
47:21 - in the chat box or inside of the Q&A box
47:25 - on page I did have a question for you my
47:28 - question was how do you deal with
47:30 - digital citizenship when students are
47:35 - commenting on assignments in your
47:37 - classroom so I've set ground rules with
47:41 - my students to make sure that they know
47:43 - exactly what they're supposed to be
47:45 - doing we
47:47 - have a policy in school especially now
47:50 - that they're home they're on video that
47:51 - the parents and the students know
47:54 - there's a dress code they whatever shown
47:59 - in the household is if there's a problem
48:03 - they will be reported on making
48:05 - substance abuse things like that going
48:07 - on so it's very well written out policy
48:13 - unfortunately because we have distance
48:16 - learning in the middle of the year I've
48:18 - spent a lot of time going over that at
48:21 - the beginning of the year
48:23 - Google's awesome has some great
48:26 - information that you can go through and
48:28 - that actually works with that PR deck so
48:31 - if you go to either the para dick
48:33 - website or the Google internet awesome
48:35 - website you can go through those lessons
48:38 - with your students so that they can do
48:40 - that before you actually go ahead and do
48:42 - video
48:50 - we saw lots of questions asking if we
48:54 - were going to be sharing out the slide
48:56 - deck after and we will be sending it and
48:57 - a follow-up as well as once you complete
48:59 - once you head out of the webinar today

49:04 - you'll get some professional development
49:06 - credit

49:12 - coming through
49:13 - so we'll go ahead and kind of move on to
