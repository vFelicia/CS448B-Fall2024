00:02 - be very careful there's a python around
00:05 - here I'm sure it's around here somewhere
00:08 - oh
00:10 - [Music]
00:12 - you're tickling me
00:14 - python is the name for a coding language
00:17 - and it's not as scary as it looks it's
00:20 - perfect for kids
00:22 - pretty doesn't it
00:24 - that's because python is really good for
00:27 - code readability that means that it's
00:30 - easy to look at and understand
00:32 - behind all that simple stuff are some
00:35 - neat mechanics like libraries and
00:37 - functions a function is like a block of
00:40 - code that means it's only used when it's
00:43 - asked to do something imagine a machine
00:46 - that uses functions to make smoothies
00:48 - the function for peeling the bananas
00:50 - only works when it's time to peel a

00:54 - part
00:56 - [Music]
00:58 - that's not all it can do it includes
01:00 - tools for data analysis machine learning
01:03 - and software development that's why lots
01:06 - of your favorite apps use python
01:08 - it's a great way to learn coding
01:10 - especially with me
01:12 - but it's also used in devices and jobs
01:15 - and amazing careers who knows where
01:18 - python will take you
01:20 - if you want to go on a python Journey
