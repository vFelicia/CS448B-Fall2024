00:00 - hi everyone thank you so much for
00:02 - joining me today I'm so excited that
00:05 - you're able to take some time out of
00:07 - your day to hear about code monkeys hour
00:10 - of code so first of all my name is Zoe
00:13 - I'm a customer success here at code
00:16 - monkey and today I will be hosting this
00:19 - webinar if you have any questions
00:22 - throughout message me in the chat and
00:24 - hopefully I will have enough time to get
00:26 - through all of the questions in the end
00:29 - also if you missed anything this entire
00:32 - webinar is recorded so you will be able
00:35 - to see it on our blog tomorrow
00:38 - for those who are not as familiar with
00:40 - code monkey code monkey is an Israeli
00:45 - startup that was established in 2014 and
00:48 - it is a game based platform that teaches
00:52 - kids had a code so in the beginning
00:56 - definitely we started with the coding
00:59 - adventure that's aimed for the younger
01:02 - crowd ages 7 and up and recently we
01:07 - expanded to the older kids for example
01:10 - one of our activities is a Python chat
01:13 - bot that's aimed for a grade 6 and up so
01:17 - the point of this webinar will
01:19 - definitely expose you to all of our new
01:22 - activities and we'll help you decide
01:25 - which hour of code activity you would
01:28 - like to use in your classroom so an
01:34 - intro to hour of code for those who are
01:37 - less familiar is is that it was
01:42 - established in 2013 and by code org and
01:46 - it was supported by the Obama
01:48 - administration and it has gotten
01:51 - millions to code and hopefully after
01:54 - this hour of code we will get even more
01:57 - students to code and this year it's held
02:01 - through December 4th to 13th so I'm sure
02:04 - some of you guys have already started
02:06 - hour of code today and in recent years
02:09 - it's also expanded to the entire month
02:12 - of December
02:13 - so I want everyone to know that they can
02:18 - ask me questions in the chat at any time
02:20 - and I will definitely read them and if
02:24 - there are any technical issues I will be
02:27 - sure to resolve them so I'm going to
02:31 - share my screen so the first thing is I
02:36 - want you guys to try to do this by
02:40 - yourselves as well so I don't know about
02:42 - you guys but for me it really helps to

05:17 - okay lower the volume here okay I'm
05:31 - going to wait just one second and make
05:34 - sure that everyone is up to par let me
05:40 - know in the chat if you have any
05:42 - technical issues okay amazing let me

06:05 - page and I'm going to choose an avatar
06:07 - I'm going to choose this younger lady
06:14 - okay so note hold on
06:20 - just cuz that was in the way okay
06:24 - so note that you have your classroom
06:29 - it's automatically created so click on
06:31 - your classroom and it will take you to
06:39 - your teachers dashboard so this free
06:42 - teachers trial is limited to 30 students
06:46 - if you have more than 30 students for
06:48 - your hour of code feel free to create
06:51 - another teacher account and it is
06:55 - limited to up to 30 days so you're good
06:58 - for the month of December and it will
07:01 - include the four hour of code activities
07:04 - that we are introducing specifically for
07:08 - hour of code code monkey you could find
07:11 - them in the courses tab
07:14 - and you will see here that you have four
07:18 - different activities that you can use
07:20 - the first one is the coding adventure
07:22 - second one is the game builder then
07:25 - there's the hour of code the Python
07:27 - Chapa and then lastly dodo does math I
07:31 - will go into more information on each of
07:33 - these activities later on I just want to
07:36 - point to your attention the revoke
07:40 - option so if you don't want your
07:43 - children your students to be able to
07:45 - play all of the activities because you
07:47 - want to focus on just one you can revoke
07:50 - the other activities and now your
07:53 - students can only access the coding
07:56 - adventure
07:59 - so here you see that you have zero
08:03 - students the group is empty so click on
08:05 - add students there are three different
08:09 - ways to add students the first is a
08:12 - create a signal account so here what you
08:16 - can do is enter the full name of every
08:19 - single one of your students and assign
08:21 - them a username and password this is
08:23 - great if you have under ten students
08:26 - more than that you do want to look into
08:29 - a bulk upload or share class code so
08:32 - both these are great for a lot of
08:35 - students the bulk upload does require a
08:38 - CSV file and you also need to pay
08:43 - attention not to include a header row in
08:45 - the CSV file the third is the share
08:50 - class code
08:51 - I recommend this if you do not have a
08:54 - CSV file of all of your students and you
08:56 - want to give them the freedom to create
08:58 - their own username and passwords so the
09:04 - way that your students can log in
09:06 - through this class code is by you
09:10 - copying or writing this code on a
09:13 - whiteboard or blackboard and tell your
09:18 - students to go to play coedmonkey.com
09:24 - again for those who are just joining us
09:26 - now I am showing everyone how to add
09:29 - students to your classroom then tell
09:35 - your students to click on sign up and
09:38 - remember how you chose the teacher
09:40 - option tell your students to choose the
09:43 - student option and then click yes I have
09:46 - a classroom code paste your code and
09:50 - click on enter now your students will be
09:54 - able to add let's just do student 1 1 2
09:59 - 3 add their in information save their
10:11 - information click on I save my
10:15 - information let's play save password and
10:20 - they will be automatically taken to code
10:24 - monkeys coding adventure in the meantime
10:31 - they will
10:33 - add it to your classroom okay so after
10:37 - you set up your students you would go to
10:42 - your courses and here you will see the
10:46 - four different options so for those who
10:50 - are less familiar with code monkey our
10:52 - coding adventure is our very first
10:55 - course and it's the basic it teaches
10:58 - kids as young as eight years old
11:00 - real cold real text based code and it
11:04 - does so with a fun monkey that needs to
11:08 - catch the bananas and in order to do so
11:11 - you need the students need a right code
11:13 - for example the number of steps the
11:16 - monkey needs to take to reach the
11:18 - bananas this is a really fun and
11:20 - interactive way to get into coding and
11:22 - is definitely different from all the
11:25 - other options out there especially
11:28 - because it not only teaches
11:29 - computational thinking but it does so in
11:32 - a really engaging way and teaches real
11:36 - code from the first challenge the second
11:40 - option is the game builder now this we
11:43 - recommend from ages 6 up grade 6 and up
11:47 - so mainly 11 12 year olds and and up and
11:52 - the beauty about this product is kids
11:55 - create their own games so as opposed to
11:59 - the coding adventure where you're just
12:01 - learning the first the foundation of
12:03 - code and the language with game built
12:05 - builder you're able to go from a
12:07 - consumer to a creator and make your own
12:10 - content so this hour of code activity
12:14 - leads the students step-by-step to
12:18 - create a specific game but they are
12:22 - coding this game now for our exciting
12:27 - new courses we have our chat BOTS and
12:30 - our dota those math courses
12:32 - so our choppa our pipes our chat BOTS
12:36 - specifically is our very new course and
12:39 - it's being featured for the very first
12:41 - time during this hour of code so I'm
12:43 - really excited for you to try it out and
12:47 - is basically a game where you and your
12:51 - students are able to code a chatbot and
12:54 - do so in the language of Python it's
12:57 - great for ages 14 plus or sixth grade
13:01 - and up basically the beauty of this is
13:05 - that you're learning Python so as
13:08 - opposed to in the coding adventure where
13:10 - we're teaching CoffeeScript which is a
13:13 - mix of JavaScript and Python
13:16 - it's like JavaScript in a sense that
13:18 - it's multifunctional you can build web
13:20 - applications websites games etc it's as
13:26 - easy to understand as Python so it's
13:30 - really a great middle but Python is a
13:33 - better a more well-known coding language
13:37 - so that's why it is also an amazing
13:41 - course to try out so the fourth activity
13:46 - is a coding and math course called dojo
13:51 - does math so in this activity students
13:55 - are able to practice math skills such as
13:59 - distances angles and measurements by
14:02 - using basic code so this is really great
14:06 - for teachers who want to implement some
14:08 - kind of hour of code activity but don't
14:11 - have the time and of course this is for
14:15 - a certain age group it's for ages 7 to
14:17 - 11 or third to fifth grade and it does
14:22 - align with the Common Core math
14:23 - standards so it's definitely very
14:25 - functional in that sense and it's really
14:28 - fun their students will meet our newest
14:31 - character our dodo so I'm going to now
14:37 - demonstrate the coding adventure so as a
14:42 - teacher what you can do I'm going back
14:46 - to the home page you can
14:53 - click on the activity and start coding
14:57 - the beauty of being a teacher is you can
15:01 - also jump around from challenge to
15:05 - challenge this means that if you don't
15:08 - have time you can definitely get a feel
15:10 - for every single one of our activities
15:12 - and not not worry about having to just
15:17 - start from the very beginning so notice
15:21 - here in the very first challenge that
15:24 - it's very intuitive here you have a
15:27 - keyboard and an arrow and it just grabs
15:29 - your attention right away to step 10 so
15:32 - this right side of the screen is where
15:35 - the real code happens meanwhile on the
15:39 - left side of the screen you will see the
15:41 - main stage where everything that happens
15:45 - that's written in the text affects the
15:49 - monkey and the main stage so let's click
15:51 - on run and see what happens so here's
15:56 - one of our adaptive hints could keep on
16:00 - trying and get a feel for this this
16:06 - definitely a very intuitive course and
16:10 - game I know that this has been around
16:13 - for quite some time
16:14 - I do want to show you guys a little bit
16:17 - more of of the teachers dashboard and
16:21 - tools that you can use to implement this
16:24 - game in the most successful way possible
16:27 - and then I will go into the other newer
16:30 - courses so what I do want to show you
16:34 - here is in I'm going back to the
16:39 - classroom in the teachers dashboard you
16:41 - could click on the progress tab
16:47 - and here you will be able to see all of
16:50 - the challenges available and as well as
16:54 - the solutions to the challenges so hold
16:57 - on I'm going back to a challenge that is
17:00 - part of the hour of cone so I clicked
17:03 - again for those who missed it I clicked
17:07 - on the number these numbers on the top
17:10 - row they do correlate with the challenge
17:13 - that they represent so I am clicking on
17:16 - challenge 20 to get a three star
17:20 - solution so I do recommend the pair
17:25 - programming system so definitely have
17:28 - your students try to help each other
17:30 - before sharing a solution this is a last
17:34 - resort but it's definitely good for you
17:36 - as a teacher to have as a safeguard so I
17:40 - do want to go into a little bit about
17:42 - the Stars and the grading system so
17:45 - because this is a brand-new student
17:47 - there is no progress but what you can
17:50 - see here is that there's a greeting a
17:52 - three star grading solution so the first
17:55 - star is acquired by by students if they
17:59 - solved the challenge and they got all of
18:01 - the bananas on the screen
18:02 - the second star is given if they solved
18:06 - all of the bananas and they did so in
18:08 - the most concise I'm sorry in the in the
18:11 - way that acquires that arm uses
18:13 - previously learned topics and the third
18:16 - one is as I was chart starting to say
18:18 - before is if they caught all the bananas
18:20 - use previously learned concepts and did
18:24 - so in the most concise short to the
18:26 - point way possible so this is nice you
18:31 - can see here the the progress tab and
18:35 - the answers for all of our courses so
18:37 - you don't have to worry and I will go
18:40 - into our dojo does math and this is a
18:46 - very handy so now I just assign it to
18:49 - the class so I'm going back into the
18:54 - main page and I'm clicking on the
19:02 - interesting okay so I will click on
19:08 - that's so weird I'm looking right now
19:10 - for the dollar that's math and I cannot
19:12 - see it on the activities so what I will
19:16 - do is I will just go with the chap
19:17 - course and I will later fix this issue
19:21 - so what you do is you click on start
19:24 - coding and the best way to implement
19:28 - this into the classroom is by telling
19:32 - your kids to just Google
19:37 - call it monkey and click on the very
19:41 - first website that appears so this is an
19:47 - easy way for them to access the game and
19:49 - once they're there they will be able to
19:51 - go to the course so this is our Python
19:55 - chat course and what you see here on the
19:59 - left side of the screen are the
20:01 - instructions and they're so important to
20:03 - read it is overwhelming to have all of
20:06 - these instructions but a lot of times
20:09 - you will be able to also see a hint a
20:12 - very helpful hint at the bottom so we
20:16 - know a lot of students don't like to
20:18 - read instructions or follow instructions
20:20 - so what they will end up realizing is
20:23 - that through reading the instructions
20:26 - they will actually be able to solve a
20:27 - challenge as opposed to just skipping
20:29 - ahead and and just playing around with
20:32 - the buttons so I would definitely it's a
20:35 - great way to really implement reading
20:38 - instructions in the classroom so meet
20:41 - code monkeys trivia chat bot welcome to
20:44 - Python Chapa in this course you will
20:46 - learn how to create your own trivia
20:47 - Chapa this means that by the end of the
20:50 - 16 exercises your students will have
20:55 - coded their own Chapa that asks trivia
20:59 - questions random like what kind of
21:00 - sports do you like and they will be
21:03 - learning Python simultaneously so I
21:07 - definitely recommend this for the older
21:09 - ages so that is everything for today
21:13 - thank you so much for joining this
21:15 - webinar on how to host an hour of code
21:19 - with code monkey if you enjoyed it then
