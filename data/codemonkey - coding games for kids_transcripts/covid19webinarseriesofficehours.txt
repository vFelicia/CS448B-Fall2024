02:02 - all right so we always like to start off
02:04 - just telling a little bit about code
02:06 - monkey and kind of what
02:07 - it is so codemonkey is a leading program
02:09 - for kids it
02:11 - provides online engaging courses for
02:14 - students to learn how to code in a
02:16 - gamified way it was developed for
02:19 - both schools and teachers in mind
02:23 - as well as standards aligned we are iste
02:26 - csta
02:27 - common core and also aligned with all of
02:30 - the
02:31 - states as well it is a ka coding
02:34 - curriculum really designed to put
02:36 - teachers in the driver's seat while
02:38 - teaching code monkey there is no prior
02:41 - experience needed to
02:42 - teach it as well as there is no prior
02:44 - experience
02:45 - needed to learn
03:03 - all right and from here talia is going
03:05 - to go ahead
03:07 - and uh take over so we are
03:10 - seeing her here in our classrooms
03:12 - dashboards page
03:14 - okay okay now i'm youtube i'm sorry
03:18 - it's okay hi everybody so
03:21 - um we want to give you a short um
03:24 - overview of the platform but mainly
03:28 - uh you know ultimately the the goal here
03:30 - is really leave time
03:31 - for you to ask your questions um
03:35 - we really want to thank you for choosing
03:36 - code monkey
03:38 - during this time we hope you find it
03:41 - helpful and joyful for yourself and for
03:45 - your students
03:46 - some of you might be new to code monkey
03:49 - so we'll go over some of the different
03:52 - features
03:53 - available for you as as a teacher and
03:56 - code monkey
03:56 - and then we'll also get to your
03:58 - questions so feel free to
04:00 - write your questions either in the chat
04:01 - or in the q a box
04:03 - um the team will we'll get to it during
04:05 - the webinar or we'll leave
04:07 - and we'll leave it for the end of the
04:08 - webinar sorry for after the
04:11 - demo so this is my um
04:14 - demo teacher account uh i'm gonna use
04:18 - this and here to the left we have
04:21 - uh the menu navigation so
04:24 - i'm just gonna go through over this
04:27 - quickly basically uh under courses
04:31 - this is where you as the teacher um same
04:34 - as your student can
04:35 - access the courses that are available
04:38 - for you as part of your subscription
04:40 - and you can actually access the courses
04:43 - yourself and play them
04:44 - the courses yourselves and we really
04:46 - recommend you to to do that even before
04:48 - you
04:48 - assign them to your students um
04:51 - and this is basically how your students
04:53 - will see their courses
04:55 - as well but only the courses that you
04:57 - will assign to them
04:58 - we'll see that later um we have here
05:01 - also the teacher resources which
05:03 - with a lot of great resources and we
05:05 - might dive into that
05:06 - a bit later um lesson plans are
05:08 - available for all of our courses
05:10 - and i'm gonna go sorry i'm gonna go to
05:13 - the
05:14 - my classrooms uh page right here
05:17 - and this is where i can see all the
05:19 - classrooms i have as a teacher and as
05:21 - you can see this teacher already has
05:23 - two classrooms in the classrooms list
05:26 - if i want to create a new classroom i
05:28 - click on the create new button
05:30 - upgrade new classroom button i put the
05:33 - name
05:33 - i choose which subscription i'd like to
05:36 - connect it to
05:38 - and i click on create classroom
05:41 - so as a new teacher you would either
05:43 - create a new classroom and connect it to
05:45 - your subscription
05:46 - or you might already have a classroom
05:49 - which is connected to the
05:51 - teacher trial which you've received when
05:53 - you first join code monkey
05:54 - and you might want to upgrade that
05:56 - classroom
05:57 - to a new subscription that has maybe
06:00 - more access to more content
06:02 - or has a longer duration so we call that
06:05 - upgrading your classroom to a new
06:07 - subscription
06:08 - um using that arrow uh this is how you
06:12 - can
06:12 - upgrade it um and choose the
06:15 - subscription you'd like to
06:16 - upgrade it to once you've upgraded the
06:19 - classroom to the new subscription
06:21 - all the students in that classroom will
06:24 - be able to access the content
06:25 - available in that subscription and let's
06:28 - let's dive into
06:30 - can i just hop in super quick um so i'm
06:33 - just
06:34 - following up on that talia did a really
06:35 - great job of showing you that we've been
06:37 - receiving
06:38 - a lot of questions about why you would
06:40 - want to upgrade
06:41 - so that just means that your classroom
06:43 - is attached to a different subscription
06:45 - so in order to get the full benefits
06:46 - from the kovic 19 subscription you'll
06:48 - just need to upgrade it so that just
06:50 - basically means that you're applying
06:52 - the new subscription to your classroom
06:55 - yeah
06:55 - exactly great thanks lina so after i've
06:59 - upgraded
07:00 - my classroom it is now connected to the
07:02 - new subscription
07:04 - and i'm just going to click here on one
07:05 - of the classrooms
07:07 - adventures in coding just so we can see
07:10 - what we call
07:13 - what we call the classroom dashboard
07:16 - right here it has six tabs here on top
07:20 - and i'm just saying here a question from
07:22 - sandra
07:23 - is there a charge for the upgrade so no
07:25 - once you have a subscription
07:27 - it has a number of seats that you can
07:30 - use as part of that subscription
07:32 - so as long as you have available seats
07:35 - um you're able to um upgrade the
07:38 - classroom
07:39 - once you do the upgrade action action it
07:41 - will also show you how many seats
07:43 - you're going to use once you do the
07:46 - upgrade
07:47 - we also have a great how-to video on on
07:49 - the upgrade and we can we can also share
07:51 - it in the
07:52 - in the chat um so i'm back to the
07:55 - classroom dashboard
07:56 - six tabs here on top this dashboard is
07:58 - available for each of your classrooms
08:01 - the first tab i actually want to show
08:03 - you is the students tab
08:08 - and this is where you'll see the list of
08:10 - your students so this classroom already
08:12 - has um 33 students
08:15 - and i want to add new students which is
08:19 - with using this ad students button so
08:22 - we actually have three ways to add new
08:24 - students
08:26 - you can create the student accounts
08:28 - yourself
08:29 - either create a single account so this
08:32 - is great if you have just a few students
08:35 - and you one by one add them to the
08:37 - classroom
08:39 - or by bulk uploading that them
08:42 - using the csv file you just create the
08:45 - file
08:46 - it has great very thorough instructions
08:48 - here you upload the file
08:50 - and the students are populated to your
08:53 - classroom
08:54 - make sure to provide your students with
08:57 - their usernames and password
09:01 - the third way and this might be a very
09:05 - relevant option during these days when
09:07 - students are joining from home
09:10 - is what we call joining using a class
09:13 - code so this is a great option
09:15 - if you know your students are joining
09:17 - from home
09:19 - they can either create their own code
09:21 - monkey accounts
09:22 - and then join the classroom using the
09:25 - class code
09:26 - each classroom has its own unique code
09:29 - so you're going to share that with
09:31 - your students and then they can either
09:34 - create their own
09:35 - accounts and use this class code to join
09:38 - the classroom
09:39 - or they can use one of their already
09:42 - existing accounts
09:44 - such as if they use their google account
09:47 - class link clever so different single
09:50 - sign-on options are available
09:52 - and you know that's great if you don't
09:54 - want your students to have multiple
09:56 - accounts on different platforms so have
09:58 - them use your single
10:00 - single sign-on option um and they will
10:02 - join the classroom using the class code
10:05 - so that's the class code um
10:08 - option uh sorry and
10:12 - as far as the class code option we do
10:14 - have a really great how-to video that
10:15 - you can share with your students on how
10:17 - to join using a class code
10:19 - and this is really important when doing
10:20 - the single sign-on there's been a lot of
10:22 - teachers that have created accounts and
10:24 - then the students add their own so this
10:26 - is how the students will get populated
10:28 - into your classroom
10:30 - yeah great uh we'll make sure to also
10:32 - share that
10:33 - uh link um in the chat um
10:36 - okay i wanna i'm gonna move a bit quick
10:38 - because we have a lot of great questions
10:40 - here
10:41 - um another thing that came up a lot um
10:44 - now that we are providing the
10:46 - subscription during this kobe 19
10:48 - uh period of time you can have a
10:51 - subscription
10:52 - uh connected to your account as a
10:54 - teacher but you can add your colleagues
10:56 - as co-teachers to the classroom um
10:59 - you go to the students tab tab you go
11:01 - all the way down
11:02 - and you can send an invite to your
11:05 - colleague once they accept the invite
11:07 - they'll see the classroom in their code
11:09 - monkey account
11:09 - and they'll be able to view the
11:11 - classroom just like you can
11:13 - access the students see their progress
11:15 - see the solution
11:16 - and also access the courses themselves
11:20 - last thing before we move to the
11:22 - questions
11:24 - is the courses tab because
11:28 - once you've created your classroom and
11:30 - added students
11:31 - you need to decide which courses you
11:33 - want to assign to your classroom without
11:36 - you assigning the courses
11:37 - they won't be able to access them so we
11:40 - have our coding adventure course so the
11:42 - first part of coding adventure
11:44 - would be assigned by default but all
11:47 - other courses
11:48 - you would need to assign to click assign
11:50 - to class
11:51 - in order to have it assigned to your
11:53 - classroom you can always come back here
11:55 - and
11:56 - unassign so we have here all the courses
11:59 - that are available to you as part of
12:01 - your subscription and you as the teacher
12:02 - can come here and choose which ones to
12:05 - assign let's let's look at a few
12:07 - questions that we have here
12:12 - so one question that we had here
12:16 - was
12:20 - i do not have the option in my trial
12:24 - and the up arrow is grayed out
12:27 - okay so the the up um arrow
12:30 - would be available only once you have an
12:32 - additional subscription so only if you
12:35 - have only one subscription
12:36 - then you don't have a an additional
12:38 - subscription to upgrade your class
12:40 - the classroom too so once you get a new
12:43 - subscription
12:44 - um you'll be able to upgrade it so
12:47 - that you'll see that the the upwards
12:50 - arrow would be not available for you
12:53 - would you be able to show them that on
12:54 - the on the page
12:58 - the upper zero the boxes where they can
13:01 - see the others oh yeah options that they
13:02 - have yeah great idea so i'm going back
13:06 - to the my classrooms page so this is
13:08 - where i see all of my classrooms
13:10 - and you can see here this brown student
13:13 - seats box
13:15 - if i click on view all i can see the
13:17 - different subscriptions that i have as a
13:20 - teacher
13:21 - i mean all the you know the different
13:22 - details such as the available content
13:24 - uh number of seats available how many
13:26 - seats have used so far
13:28 - and the start and end date of the
13:30 - subscription so
13:32 - this is a great place to go to see the
13:33 - status of your subscription and also see
13:35 - how many seats you have
13:37 - available so that's right here in the
13:39 - brown box
13:41 - um another question that we had here is
13:44 - when students
13:45 - join using the class code will they be
13:48 - choosing their user name and password
13:52 - yes they they would be so they have two
13:55 - options they can create their own
13:57 - account by
14:01 - typing in a username choosing a username
14:04 - and
14:04 - a password or they can use one of our
14:07 - single sign-on options
14:09 - um such as google or clever class link
14:12 - office 365 and join using their
14:16 - existing account so both and are we
14:19 - gonna
14:19 - show them how to do that yeah let's go
14:22 - ahead we have another question here
14:25 - regarding um
14:28 - students view so let's quickly show that
14:31 - as well
14:35 - and nick i see your question here i'm
14:37 - going to go ahead and answer this are
14:38 - the
14:38 - courses intended to be at the student's
14:40 - own pace or do we assign
14:43 - not what modules they need to do so um
14:46 - a lot of our um when we've been setting
14:49 - you up with the coveted subscriptions
14:50 - we've been sending you
14:51 - a scope and sequence so traditionally in
14:55 - a traditional
14:56 - online you know traditional class model
14:58 - ideally you would be doing the lesson
15:00 - plans with the students
15:01 - however in this case it's a little bit
15:03 - different you're not necessarily doing
15:05 - live lessons some teachers are able to
15:07 - interact with their students and some
15:08 - are not able to
15:09 - interact with their students um so it
15:12 - kind of
15:12 - we're kind of leaving it up to you
15:14 - however in the progress page you can
15:16 - actually limit the students progress
15:18 - i personally suggest doing that rather
15:20 - than having the students go at their own
15:21 - pace
15:22 - i would limit their progress to say
15:24 - challenge number 30. this also allows me
15:27 - to look at
15:27 - and evaluate the students progress and
15:29 - kind of have an understanding
15:31 - if they are able to really understand
15:35 - the concepts that are presented
15:36 - and if they aren't then i will have them
15:38 - to go in and do the skill mode for that
15:40 - additional
15:41 - enrichment practice um nick you can
15:43 - follow up with me after this
15:44 - and we can kind of talk through that a
15:46 - little bit more if you would like as
15:47 - well
15:48 - right lina can you see my screen now my
15:51 - uh
15:53 - can you see my home page uh
15:56 - yeah it's loading but yes okay great so
15:58 - i just want to show you
16:00 - um how a student student would log in
16:03 - themselves
16:03 - and also answering uh carolyn
16:06 - question to see the students view so
16:10 - i'm gonna click here on login
16:17 - oh sorry actually i'm gonna go to sign
16:20 - up because i'm a new user um
16:22 - who are you i'm gonna choose student
16:25 - and then do you have a classroom code
16:28 - well my teacher already already provided
16:30 - me with the classroom code so i'm gonna
16:32 - click
16:32 - on yes and i have this ready so i'm
16:35 - going to enter
16:36 - the class code which my teacher has
16:40 - provided me with
16:41 - i'm going to click on next
16:45 - and now i need to either choose to sign
16:48 - up using
16:49 - one of the single sign-on options or
16:51 - just enter
16:54 - a username and password i'm going to
16:57 - call myself supercoder
17:07 - okay great so last stop um as a student
17:10 - i can also
17:11 - uh save save this uh the username and
17:15 - the password that i created i can
17:17 - download this so i can have it handy
17:19 - next time i want to join in
17:20 - and clicking on let's play being
17:23 - redirected to my
17:26 - home page i can choose my avatar i want
17:30 - to be a flamingo today and
17:32 - this is my homepage currently this
17:35 - student has joined the trial classroom
17:38 - but as you can see it looks pretty
17:39 - similar to what we've saw before
17:41 - before from the teacher's view under
17:44 - courses
17:45 - this is where the student can access the
17:47 - courses
17:48 - first part of coding adventure is
17:50 - assigned by default but
17:52 - other courses would need to be assigned
17:54 - by the teacher
17:59 - okay i'm going to return to my teachers
18:03 - page
18:08 - okay let's see what other questions we
18:09 - have here
18:13 - so there is another question here if you
18:15 - assign multiple
18:16 - courses how do you or your students
18:19 - determine which courses students can
18:22 - view or start
18:23 - so um if uh talia goes into the courses
18:27 - page
18:28 - here oh not the courses page sorry in
18:32 - the
18:32 - classroom right
18:35 - to the classroom and then we can also
18:37 - show you on the student side
18:39 - also as well so in the classroom
18:40 - dashboard page here under courses
18:45 - so with our banana tales and our coding
18:47 - adventure courses
18:48 - they even if all the coding adventure
18:51 - courses are assigned to my students they
18:52 - actually work linearly through the
18:54 - coding concepts
18:55 - so if a student is starting on
18:58 - challenge number zero in coding
19:00 - adventure they cannot go to 210 and
19:02 - coding adventure part three they have to
19:04 - work linearly through so as they move
19:06 - through the courses will unlock as they
19:08 - go through
19:08 - the same is true with our banana tails
19:11 - course
19:12 - as they work through they can't go from
19:14 - challenge number one to challenge 150
19:16 - without having
19:17 - done the individual activities in
19:19 - between so even if all the courses are
19:21 - assigned to the students
19:23 - in those courses they have to move
19:24 - linearly through and why that is is
19:27 - because we are trying to build a strong
19:28 - foundation
19:29 - for the students so if i skip and learn
19:31 - about simple loops and move into for
19:33 - loops
19:34 - i won't have that understanding of
19:35 - everything that is needed in between
19:37 - like defining a variable and what an
19:38 - index and array is so there's
19:40 - certain concepts this does not apply for
19:43 - the platformer the frogger or the sprite
19:45 - animation course because each one of
19:47 - those
19:48 - are designed to teach a certain coding
19:52 - concept or not a coding concept certain
19:54 - game mechanics
19:56 - that will help them build and create
19:58 - their own game also it doesn't apply for
20:00 - the hour of code courses
20:02 - or our dodo does math course because
20:03 - each one are designed to be individual
20:07 - great okay and if we're here and we
20:11 - talked about the courses tab this is
20:12 - where you assign the courses
20:15 - let's hop on to the progress tab and
20:17 - this is where you as a teacher and
20:20 - your coaches as well will be able to
20:22 - follow
20:23 - your students progress in all of
20:26 - um the courses that are available for
20:28 - them um
20:29 - and this is like the teacher's best
20:31 - friend best friend because
20:33 - you can always go here to see how your
20:35 - students are doing especially now when
20:37 - you're not meeting them
20:38 - in the classroom you're giving them
20:41 - having them do a few challenges so you
20:43 - can go here and see
20:46 - and this table shows you your students
20:48 - here to the left
20:50 - um these are the challenges we're now
20:53 - in coding adventure part one um i can
20:56 - sort
20:56 - my students either by progress or by
20:59 - name
21:00 - and all of these stars these represent
21:03 - solutions submitted by your students
21:06 - um right here and these numbers on top
21:10 - these represent the challenges
21:12 - themselves so if you can
21:14 - see you can actually click on this
21:18 - and as a teacher you'll be able to
21:20 - access
21:21 - all the solutions for the challenges so
21:23 - that's also a great resources
21:25 - a resource for you you might not always
21:28 - know how to solve a challenge they do
21:30 - get quite
21:31 - quite challenging as you progress in the
21:33 - course
21:35 - and you can just access the three-star
21:37 - solutions
21:38 - for challenges in coding adventure and
21:40 - all the other challenges and you can
21:42 - also
21:42 - share that link with your students um
21:46 - you know if at some point it gets a bit
21:48 - tough and you want to help them
21:50 - um that's that's something that you can
21:52 - also share with them
21:54 - and also at the student solutions you
21:56 - can
21:57 - click on any one of the stars that are
21:59 - located here and you're able to see how
22:00 - many times a student attempted a
22:02 - challenge
22:02 - and you're also to see exactly how they
22:04 - solved it in real time
22:06 - what's really nice about this especially
22:08 - when teaching this
22:09 - remotely is that you can also share this
22:12 - with your
22:13 - students and it is anonymous so it's not
22:16 - like creating a writing sample or
22:17 - cutting the name off the top and the
22:19 - students can still see the kids
22:20 - handwriting
22:21 - you're able to actually share this
22:23 - anonymous solution with your students
22:25 - for that authentic conversation
22:33 - great
22:36 - talia would you be able to show them the
22:39 - how the courses are assigned on the
22:41 - student side how if a
22:43 - course has been assigned how it will
22:44 - show up for them
22:46 - yeah let me let me go to a student
22:50 - account
22:51 - one second
22:54 - and we just want to thank you guys so
22:56 - much for all of your questions that
22:57 - you've been
22:57 - asking this is really a time meant for
23:00 - us to be able to help you
23:01 - during this time
23:06 - hey yeah i have a student uh account
23:09 - open
23:10 - from your okay do you want me to show it
23:13 - sure
23:14 - yeah so i have a student from your
23:16 - adventures in coding classroom
23:20 - and i give you an option to
23:22 - [Music]
23:24 - show your screen if you
23:27 - stop share yeah i'll do that now
23:30 - okay
23:33 - okay so can you see my home page will s
23:37 - right
23:41 - so this is a student that has coding and
23:44 - venture part 1 assigned
23:47 - talia do you remember which courses are
23:49 - assigned did you assign all of them
23:52 - i assigned let's see this adventures in
23:55 - coding classroom
23:57 - so for example the banana tales
24:01 - part 1 and part 2 are unassigned at the
24:03 - moment so the students will see a lock
24:06 - and it will say course locked by teacher
24:08 - so in case students are
24:11 - are interested and curious to hear about
24:13 - it they might ask you about it since
24:15 - they see that it is locked by
24:16 - the teacher yeah you can also click on
24:19 - coding adventure part two
24:21 - this course is assigned but as lena said
24:24 - um is it a signed are you sure oh sorry
24:30 - okay yeah here's a good example so
24:34 - coding adventure is a sign
24:36 - students may start coding um
24:40 - however skill mode will only be unlocked
24:42 - to them once they start playing until
24:44 - they do that
24:45 - they have this message saying complete
24:47 - coding and venture challenge six to
24:49 - unlock
24:50 - and so the same might be to part two if
24:53 - it is assigned
24:54 - but student part one until they do
24:58 - complete it it will be locked
25:00 - and it will say that they need to
25:01 - complete part one in order to unlock
25:03 - part two
25:05 - yeah maybe maybe it's also a good
25:07 - opportunity to to mention skill mode
25:10 - um which are additional practice
25:13 - challenges
25:14 - that open up as students progress
25:18 - um in the in quoting adventure
25:21 - so if you have these students who
25:23 - progress quickly
25:25 - you want to give them some extra
25:27 - practice to practice the coding concepts
25:30 - that they've learned
25:31 - you can refer them to the skill mode
25:34 - challenges
25:35 - they have as you can see it looks quite
25:38 - similar to coding adventure
25:40 - just with a black uh background
25:44 - and we have this monkey uh we call
25:47 - gordo um in the corner with the
25:50 - sweatsuit
25:51 - um for training and practice
25:59 - okay
26:02 - and i just shared a link with all of you
26:05 - in the chat box here we did do a tour of
26:08 - courses explaining about each one of our
26:11 - courses and a little bit more detailed
26:12 - information about that so i just showed
26:14 - that in the chat box
26:15 - or on our kovid19 page where you found
26:18 - the information for this webinar
26:21 - is also located all of the webinars that
26:23 - we have done
26:24 - this far so i would recommend checking
26:26 - those out as well
26:29 - and we have a question here by doug can
26:32 - you assign courses by student as well as
26:35 - by class
26:37 - well doug currently uh courses are
26:40 - assigned per
26:41 - classroom uh but what we do see
26:44 - sometimes uh teachers might create an
26:47 - additional classroom because you can
26:48 - create as many classrooms as you'd like
26:52 - and you can actually move over let's say
26:55 - the more advanced students to a second
26:57 - classroom
26:58 - and then assign the courses a bit
27:00 - differently
27:01 - to those students so that's a option to
27:05 - use
27:06 - would you want to show them how to move
27:08 - a student
27:10 - okay let's see me share my screen
27:32 - okay so i'm going to go to my classrooms
27:37 - and i'm going to go to class 1 because i
27:41 - have a few students there
27:42 - and i want to move one of the students
27:45 - to another classroom so all those
27:49 - actions that have to do with students
27:51 - either editing their
27:52 - you can edit their username you can
27:55 - change reset their password
27:57 - and you can move them over you do that
28:00 - from the students list
28:01 - in the classroom dashboard so just by
28:04 - locating the student i want to move
28:06 - clicking on move and then just choosing
28:09 - the classroom
28:10 - i want to move the student to if the
28:12 - classroom the new classroom
28:14 - is connected to a different subscription
28:17 - i get here a little notice letting me
28:19 - know that this student will take up a
28:22 - seat
28:23 - in the new subscription so i'm going to
28:26 - move the students to adventures
28:28 - in coding if i had more classrooms i
28:30 - could
28:31 - choose here and now the student has
28:34 - successfully
28:35 - been moved to their new classroom
28:43 - okay great question and i hope i hope
28:46 - that provides a solution for that
28:48 - that need
28:53 - see we have any other questions
28:58 - okay i think we can also uh show you
29:01 - guys our teacher resources
29:04 - um we have some great materials here
29:09 - let me go over some of these
29:12 - so first here teaching with code monkey
29:16 - this is uh practical training
29:19 - and some useful explanations and tips
29:21 - relating to part one
29:23 - of coding adventure it's about 75
29:26 - minutes long
29:29 - so you can take that course right here a
29:32 - few videos you can
29:34 - access it when it's convenient for you
29:37 - right here
29:38 - and down here below we have the lesson
29:41 - plans for
29:42 - all of our courses as you can see
29:45 - all the way down so check these out
29:48 - they're right here these are pdfs that

29:58 - can
29:59 - view the different uh
30:02 - actions that we've shown you here and
30:04 - more
30:06 - really short how-to uh tutorials on the
30:09 - different
30:09 - actions in your platform for you as a
30:12 - teacher
30:14 - how to create a classroom how to add
30:15 - students using a class code we mentioned
30:17 - that so you can also
30:19 - share that with parents how to assign
30:22 - courses all the different
30:25 - how-to videos are here
30:28 - we have here some hour of code notes for
30:32 - our hour of code activities
30:35 - available for you here and under
30:38 - classroom resources you can access
30:41 - certificates
30:42 - uh really great q certificates for the
30:45 - different courses that you can hand out
30:47 - to your students once they've completed
30:49 - a course
30:50 - along with our media kit with access to
30:52 - a lot of great graphics
30:54 - and some classroom course posters
30:56 - hopefully soon this will be relevant
30:58 - you can hang this in your classroom so
31:01 - all of these are available
31:03 - under teacher resources
31:11 - we have your question
31:17 - emmy do you know how to answer this yeah
31:19 - talia i was gonna jump in
31:21 - so okay i have a question about google
31:23 - classroom and i
31:24 - i believe danielle had asked me before
31:26 - about uh had asked us
31:28 - about um assigning um
31:32 - assigning uh from codemonkey to google
31:35 - classroom assigning work to students and
31:37 - i
31:38 - answered that we are working on a google
31:41 - classroom integration
31:42 - at this moment hopefully that's
31:45 - something that you guys will be able to
31:46 - use in about
31:47 - three weeks uh and once it is ready we
31:50 - will update you all
31:51 - by mail uh so
31:55 - look out for uh for an update from us so
31:58 - her question is how will
31:59 - how will students be able to uh
32:02 - move i guess uh if you have them logging
32:05 - in with google classroom
32:07 - uh will that affect them um so i would
32:10 - just like to suggest that
32:12 - when we do have google classroom
32:13 - integration we'll be happy if you could
32:16 - just contact us
32:17 - to see how we can uh move the students
32:20 - with all their progress to the new
32:23 - google classroom
32:25 - and we will probably have to do that on
32:27 - a case-to-case basis so if you just
32:28 - contact us
32:30 - contact us support we can share the
32:32 - email now
32:34 - and we'll be happy to help you all right
32:37 - i'm just typing great
32:38 - and then i am just going to answer this
32:41 - question here
32:42 - from janie so where can i find state
32:44 - objectives correlated to code monkey
32:46 - activity so
32:47 - we do have all of our objective or all
32:50 - of the
32:51 - standards listed in the lesson plans but
32:54 - talia can also show you where those are
32:56 - located
32:57 - on the courses page
33:01 - um and then we also ha so we'll show you
33:04 - that why she's getting that loaded
33:06 - i'll answer another question here um
33:10 - victoria asked this question i just
33:12 - translated it sorry victoria my um
33:14 - spanish speaker um but the question was
33:18 - what does
33:18 - archive to classroom mean and
33:22 - do i release the seats
33:28 - oh okay i was going to have you answer
33:30 - that sorry
33:31 - go ahead go ahead okay
33:34 - so what does archival classroom mean
33:36 - that means that basically the
33:39 - when you archive a classroom it will go
33:41 - from being an active classroom in your
33:43 - classroom dashboard
33:44 - to being archived so what that means
33:46 - that you'll no longer see it there all
33:48 - of the student details and information
33:50 - will still be kept there
33:52 - but it will no longer be an active
33:54 - classroom correct right
33:56 - right so that that's correct so um
33:59 - once you archive it it's also we can
34:01 - also look at it is that as a way to
34:02 - organize your classrooms list because
34:04 - hopefully as you
34:05 - continue with us you might have more
34:07 - classrooms continue in the second year
34:09 - so more classrooms so
34:10 - you want to organize that classroom list
34:12 - and archive
34:14 - classrooms that are no longer relevant
34:16 - so by clicking on that archive button we
34:18 - can show you that again um
34:20 - that's how you can just remove them from
34:22 - the classrooms um
34:24 - list you're not deleting them they are
34:27 - in your archive you can at any point
34:29 - uh go there to restore them um
34:32 - once you archive a student or a
34:35 - classroom
34:36 - um this doesn't release their seats um
34:39 - so if the students already played
34:41 - um during the year then you archive them
34:44 - it doesn't release their seats
34:46 - you do have an option to delete a
34:48 - student account
34:50 - if the student hasn't made any progress
34:53 - um in the game so that is available for
34:56 - you and of course on
34:58 - you know special cases if there's a need
35:00 - if something
35:01 - if there was a duplicate or a mistake uh
35:04 - we you have our
35:05 - support email here so feel free to
35:07 - contact us
35:08 - um on our support our support and we'll
35:11 - help
35:12 - lina am i looking at the right place yes
35:14 - you're in the right place so on our
35:16 - codemonkey.com
35:17 - backslash courses here down here at the
35:21 - bottom
35:21 - of our footer there is a place under
35:24 - curriculum where it has standards so if
35:26 - you click on the standards
35:29 - document you'll be able to see or the
35:31 - link it will pull up
35:32 - all of the common core standards that
35:34 - are there however
35:36 - if you need a more thorough
35:39 - layout of the concepts specific to your
35:42 - state
35:43 - if you can either contact us at info
35:45 - codemonkey.com or
35:47 - preferably if you can contact the person
35:49 - who set you up with your subscription
35:51 - um we can give you that customized
35:54 - standards alignment document for you
35:56 - that you need for the courses it's
35:58 - pretty hefty document as very very
36:00 - detailed with all of the standards and
36:01 - things like that so
36:02 - if you need that we're happy to provide
36:04 - that for you as well
36:06 - great oh sorry
36:09 - yeah there was this question i know amin
36:12 - answered this but i thought it would be
36:14 - a good answer
36:15 - a good question for everybody if i
36:16 - assign code monkey junior and beaver
36:18 - achiever will it prompt students to
36:20 - start with code monkey junior before
36:22 - beaver achiever
36:23 - or will it be up to them so once all the
36:25 - courses are available to the students
36:27 - let's say i unlock every single course
36:30 - unless
36:31 - you guide them where to start they
36:33 - really have the ability to kind of go
36:34 - wherever they want
36:36 - so i always suggest keeping it pretty
36:38 - locked down so if you want them to start
36:40 - with code monkey junior first i would
36:42 - unassign
36:42 - all of the other courses and only leave
36:45 - code monkey junior as the option
36:47 - otherwise the kids you know what they do
36:49 - and same with us i just want to click
36:51 - everywhere and explore everything
36:52 - because they all
36:53 - have fun graphics and images and so i
36:55 - just want to go
36:56 - where i want to go right and i see two
37:00 - more questions here regarding
37:02 - the the archive um
37:05 - so just to clarify the way the student
37:08 - seats work so once
37:10 - you've added the student to a classroom
37:12 - they tech
37:13 - take up a seat in the classroom the seat
37:15 - is theirs it's a person's personal
37:17 - season you can't
37:18 - transfer it so when when you archive the
37:21 - student
37:22 - um you can either archive a specific
37:24 - student um
37:25 - through the student list or or just
37:28 - archive a whole classroom
37:29 - um through the classrooms list um no the
37:32 - student seats are not
37:34 - released so you cannot reuse them again
37:36 - if there's any
37:37 - um a special case here just feel free to
37:41 - to contact us and danielle is asking
37:45 - um once we archive but the student's
37:48 - progress
37:49 - email or info will continue for the next
37:51 - year for them to log in for the new year
37:53 - and new class correct
37:54 - so let me tell you that once you archive
37:58 - a student
37:59 - or a classroom um it's not like deleting
38:02 - they're here as you can see we have here
38:04 - an archive section
38:05 - uh once you click on it you'll see if
38:07 - you have any archive classrooms or
38:09 - students you'll see them here
38:10 - they're not deleted at any time you can
38:12 - restore them from the archive
38:15 - um we um and and then if they're
38:18 - restored and are part of a classroom
38:21 - with an active subscription um they'll
38:23 - be able to continue their progress their
38:26 - progress is saved
38:27 - um and they'll be able to continue their
38:29 - progress um
38:30 - next year
38:35 - we had another question this was in
38:37 - spanish so i apologize i just had to
38:39 - also translate it as well so i had said
38:43 - how many levels are there for code
38:45 - monkey junior i have very small
38:47 - students four to six um so the levels
38:50 - amit would you able to answer how many
38:52 - levels are on kovanki junior
38:57 - sorry how many challenges uh-huh yeah
39:01 - uh i believe we have 35 challenges
39:06 - at the moment for code monkey junior
39:09 - okay
39:11 - sorry okay i won't i won't go in
39:15 - yeah we lose track um
39:18 - but yeah as well code monkey junior
39:21 - also has um more a shorter
39:25 - teacher guide to it um also available
39:28 - for you
39:29 - um right here in the teacher resources
39:32 - so
39:33 - you know even before having your your
39:35 - kiddos uh
39:36 - accessing this uh it would be you know
39:39 - you should check this out as well would
39:42 - you want to pull up a lesson plan so we
39:44 - can kind of see what the lesson plan
39:45 - looks like
39:46 - yeah good idea oh andrea thank you so
39:50 - much for answering that
39:52 - your nurse thirty-one good you're on top
39:54 - of it you're one of our one of our
39:56 - panelists
39:59 - so um you know
40:02 - let me let me give you also a control
40:04 - here and you can
40:06 - show around the lesson plan okay great
40:08 - so all of our lesson plans are set up
40:09 - in a similar fashion
40:14 - why can't i do it okay good sorry this
40:16 - is a little delay when you're doing the
40:17 - remote control so
40:19 - um you're able to see the lessons
40:22 - here and so when you get to a lesson
40:24 - each lesson has
40:26 - basically a summary
40:30 - of the lesson itself
40:34 - and then it gets into the objectives
40:36 - that are presented and the components
40:38 - which are what concepts the students are
40:40 - kind of working on throughout those
40:41 - throughout that lesson plan you see the
40:44 - standards that are there for csta
40:45 - and then every lesson plan starts out
40:47 - with an intro which is
40:48 - an unplugged activity something to
40:50 - introduce the students the concept
40:52 - that's working
40:53 - then the part two is the play time and
40:55 - the last part is debrief
40:57 - and so this is all laid out here for you
40:59 - obviously
41:00 - a lot of teachers are foregoing

44:04 - to guide you through the process as well
44:07 - great um a question here i'd just like
44:10 - to quickly answer
44:11 - about unplugged activities uh so nick
44:14 - asked how many unplugged activities do
44:15 - you have a large portion of my students
44:17 - do not have
44:18 - home internet access making it hard to
44:21 - do online classes
44:22 - i do have a need of paper activities
44:25 - so um i just wanted to mention that
44:28 - during this
44:29 - uh these times we do understand uh
44:32 - teachers needs
44:33 - and more different types of activities
44:35 - that don't
44:36 - require a teacher being in front of a
44:38 - classroom right
44:40 - so we are working right now on trying to
44:43 - compile a few
44:44 - different activities you could do with
44:46 - your students either like in
44:48 - in this remote situation or without
44:50 - internet access so
44:51 - i'm happy you asked this question
44:53 - because um
44:54 - it definitely sure we need to provide
44:57 - some of these things so we don't have
44:59 - any at the moment but
45:01 - hopefully in the upcoming weeks we we
45:03 - can share them in the teacher resources
45:05 - and just to kind of follow up on that
45:07 - note we did do a webinar nick
45:09 - with our teacher ambassadors last week
