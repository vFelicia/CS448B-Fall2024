00:04 - welcome to who moved my mouse let's
00:07 - learn about mouse move events
00:11 - mouse events occur when you move or
00:13 - click your mouse
00:15 - for the next few challenges we're
00:17 - focusing on the events that occur when
00:19 - you move your mouse
00:22 - the function
00:23 - on mouse move is automatically called
00:26 - when you move your mouse
00:28 - and in the function you can code what
00:31 - should happen as a result
00:33 - so here's an example we have the on
00:35 - mouse move function and it has the
00:38 - parameter pause
00:41 - and you could see we're using the pause
00:43 - within the function
00:45 - so
00:47 - we are telling the monkey
00:50 - to turn to
00:52 - that position to wherever your
00:54 - mouse cursor is the monkey should turn
00:57 - to it
01:00 - the parameter pause
01:02 - holds the position of your mouse cursor
01:06 - so when you move the mouse
01:08 - pause is changed it's automatically
01:11 - updated as you move your mouse cursor
01:16 - you can access
01:17 - the x and y coordinates like separately
01:21 - access those coordinates of your cursor
01:24 - by using pause.x
01:26 - and pause.y
01:29 - let's look at a challenge
01:32 - here's a challenge with the monkey a
01:34 - crocodile and three bananas
01:37 - the code has two functions in it
01:40 - the on mouse move function which is
01:43 - called whenever you move your mouse
01:45 - and it has the parameter pause
01:48 - and the on key function which is called
01:50 - whenever you press a key on your
01:52 - keyboard
01:53 - it has the parameter key
01:56 - and in this case we're having the monkey
01:58 - step one
02:00 - so we're having the monkey step one when
02:03 - any key is pressed
02:06 - so how are we going to use the on mouse
02:08 - move function to complete this challenge
02:12 - so if we look at the challenge
02:15 - we need that crocodile to turn
02:18 - towards the monkey
02:21 - and maybe towards other things later
02:24 - so maybe we can use
02:26 - the position of your cursor to turn the
02:29 - crocodile
02:31 - so let's try that crocodile turn
02:34 - two the parameter pause
02:38 - so if we run this
02:40 - we could see look at that the
02:42 - crocodile's following my cursor
02:44 - so i can line it up with the monkey
02:49 - and now i'm pressing any key to get the
02:51 - monkey to move
02:53 - and
02:56 - there we go
03:00 - here's an example with the monkey a bat
03:03 - and three bananas
03:05 - we have the function on mouse move and
03:08 - the parameter pause
03:10 - within we have
03:13 - the bat dot set x this means we're
03:15 - setting the x position of the bat
03:19 - to the x position of your cursor pause
03:23 - dot x
03:25 - and we're setting the
03:27 - y position of the bat
03:30 - to 100
03:33 - then our on key function which has the
03:35 - parameter key is checking to see if the
03:38 - key is g
03:39 - that you pressed and if so
03:42 - have the bat grab
03:44 - what
03:45 - underneath it
03:47 - okay so let's just run this as is
03:53 - okay when we run this we could see the
03:55 - bats moving
03:57 - in the x position following my mouse
04:00 - but if i move my mouse in the y position
04:03 - the bat's not moving it's staying
04:06 - at that 100
04:08 - because that's what we have in the code
04:11 - so let's change that
04:12 - let's change the 100
04:17 - to be
04:19 - pause dot y
04:21 - so the y position of the bat
04:24 - tracks the y position of your cursor
04:28 - so let's go ahead and run it
04:31 - and now the bat is right underneath my
04:33 - cursor
04:35 - so now i can bring it to the banana
04:37 - press g
04:38 - bring it over to the monkey
04:41 - so grab
04:42 - and bring it to the monkey
04:46 - nice
04:49 - now it's your turn to use mouse move
04:52 - events good luck
