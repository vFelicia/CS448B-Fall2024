00:00 - [Music]
00:04 - welcome to or else let's learn about if
00:08 - else
00:11 - else is an optional part of an if
00:13 - statement
00:15 - else will run the indented commands
00:18 - beneath it if
00:21 - the condition isn't met
00:24 - so here we have
00:26 - an if-else statement
00:29 - so if the banana is frozen if that
00:31 - condition is met
00:33 - these three commands these three
00:35 - indented commands will run
00:38 - and then we'll jump to
00:40 - outside of the if statement
00:42 - however if the banana isn't frozen or
00:47 - this is false
00:49 - we will go to the else
00:52 - part of the if else statement and we'll
00:55 - execute whatever commands are indented
00:58 - below the else statement
01:01 - let's look at an example
01:04 - so here's a challenge where we have a
01:06 - banana between the monkey and the goat
01:10 - goats love green bananas
01:14 - and monkeys will only eat yellow bananas
01:17 - so
01:19 - we want to know we want the program to
01:21 - figure out if that's a yellow or a green
01:24 - banana and if it's yellow
01:27 - give it to the monkey or if it's green
01:30 - the goat should go get it
01:32 - so we have an if else statement to help
01:35 - us
01:35 - if banana is green
01:39 - we are going to we could say say green
01:42 - and you might want to run this when you
01:45 - get to this challenge before you start
01:46 - making edits so you can these say
01:49 - commands can help you out
01:51 - but here we'll say if banana is green
01:55 - okay then the
01:57 - goat
01:59 - could go to the banana
02:04 - but otherwise else
02:08 - we
02:09 - will let the monkey have it
02:14 - [Applause]
02:15 - okay so only one of these commands gets
02:19 - executed either the goat goes to the
02:21 - banana
02:22 - if it's green
02:24 - or
02:26 - the monkey goes to the banana
02:28 - let's go ahead and run it
02:30 - ah the monkey got it cause it's yellow
02:37 - here's an example where we have four
02:39 - frozen bananas
02:42 - so we know the goat needs to go to each
02:44 - of those
02:46 - and break the ice
02:48 - but then we need to make a decision for
02:50 - each banana do we want the goat to eat
02:54 - it
02:55 - or do we want the monkey to eat it and
02:57 - we're going to make that decision
03:00 - based on the condition
03:02 - of
03:03 - the banana being green or not
03:06 - so let's look at see how we're going to
03:08 - do this
03:08 - so here we have a for loop
03:11 - we're looping through each of those
03:13 - bananas one at a time
03:16 - each time we're going to have the goat
03:18 - go to it and hit it but then we need to
03:21 - make that decision
03:22 - so we're going to use an if else to
03:25 - decide who eats it
03:27 - so if
03:31 - the banana
03:33 - is green
03:34 - [Applause]
03:35 - okay so if the banana is green
03:40 - we're going to have the goat
03:44 - go to it
03:47 - now if
03:50 - the banana isn't green
03:53 - then the monkey
03:56 - is going to go to it
03:58 - all right let's run this
04:03 - okay
04:04 - it's green
04:08 - it's yellow
04:12 - it's green
04:16 - it's yellow
04:18 - [Applause]
04:20 - great
04:24 - now it's your turn to use if else good
04:27 - luck
