00:01 - okay everyone we are gonna go ahead and
00:03 - get started with today's webinar
00:07 - which we are so excited about so today's
00:09 - webinar is hosted by our
00:11 - code monkey team of ambassadors
00:15 - page you want to go ahead and skip to
00:16 - the next slide there
00:20 - um so before we get started just be sure
00:22 - to follow us on
00:23 - all of our social media platforms
00:26 - twitter instagram
00:27 - facebook you can also check out our code
00:29 - monkey blog which the ambassadors will
00:30 - share about here
00:31 - at the end as well as on linkedin you
00:34 - can also tweet at us during today's
00:35 - webinar as well
00:38 - next okay so today's webinar is moving
00:41 - from black from
00:42 - sorry from block based coding to
00:44 - text-based coding
00:46 - led by our team of teacher ambassadors
00:48 - and so i'll let them introduce
00:50 - themselves in just a minute
00:51 - but we just want to thank you so much
00:53 - for joining us for today's webinar
00:56 - our code monkey ambassador team and the
00:58 - code monkey team as well wants to thank
01:00 - you so much for
01:01 - pitching we go back to this one um for
01:02 - joining today's webinar we know that
01:05 - obviously this last few years has been
01:08 - anything but normal
01:10 - but our goal today is to share teaching
01:13 - tips and strategies from the ambassadors
01:15 - themselves from going through the
01:16 - pandemic and just some different
01:18 - strategies and
01:19 - takeaways and tips that they learned
01:20 - throughout this time so if you have any
01:23 - questions please feel free to
01:24 - pop those in the chat box in the q
01:27 - a section and also you can tweet at us
01:30 - during today's webinar as well
01:32 - if we don't get to your question during
01:34 - today's webinar we'll make sure to send
01:36 - you a follow-up email as well and at the
01:38 - end of today's webinar you'll get a
01:40 - survey link and the survey link once you

01:43 - for today's
01:44 - webinar who doesn't love some pd credit
01:47 - right okay next
01:51 - so we're going to get ready to write
01:53 - code catch bananas and save the world
01:54 - today
01:55 - so i just want to introduce myself my
01:57 - name is lena saleh
01:59 - i have been with code monkey for three
02:00 - years prior to that i had taught in the
02:02 - classroom for
02:04 - just a little over 10 years i am the
02:06 - professional development
02:07 - manager and the professional development
02:09 - and sales manager here at codemonkey
02:12 - you can always reach out to me on my
02:13 - twitter and i also do have my own
02:16 - personal youtube channel so feel free to
02:17 - check that out as well
02:19 - so we're just lucky to have you so thank
02:21 - you guys so much for joining us
02:22 - and i'm going to let our two ambassadors
02:24 - take it away
02:26 - hello everybody my name is javier hilar
02:29 - i'm the pre-k fifth grade teacher
02:31 - uh for peace for woman sir academy in
02:34 - fort worth texas
02:35 - i love to use um coding resources and
02:39 - one of my favorites
02:40 - is called monkey and ambassador since
02:41 - 2014
02:43 - and also i do after school clubs
02:47 - using code monkey and other resources
02:50 - for robotics and korean and so i love to
02:53 - share with you today my
02:54 - my journey from how to use it
02:58 - some of these resources the code monkey
03:00 - offer for educators
03:01 - for elementary students starting from
03:04 - first grader to maybe to fifth graders
03:06 - okay thank you
03:12 - hello welcome everybody i'm paige
03:14 - bestoff i'm from new jersey i
03:17 - teach elementary school digital
03:19 - technology and gifted and talented
03:21 - grades two through five
03:23 - and my mission is to provide all
03:26 - students with access to computer science
03:28 - and
03:28 - steam so we're going to begin our
03:33 - webinar with our objectives
03:37 - okay so today's webinar objectives will
03:40 - go ahead and cover
03:41 - this um but as you guys know over the
03:44 - pandemic it was thought that
03:45 - well not during the pandemic but just
03:47 - over the last few years coding was once
03:49 - only thought to be
03:50 - used for those older students but the
03:53 - pandemic
03:54 - just using the text-based you know
03:55 - coding languages but the pandemic i
03:57 - think brought a new
03:58 - perspective to all of you as teachers
04:01 - and
04:01 - just as you start to take more risks and
04:03 - things with coding itself so
04:06 - we're excited for our teacher investors
04:08 - to share those so today we're going to
04:09 - go
04:10 - over using block-based coding languages
04:13 - with
04:14 - young learners will cover the
04:15 - block-based courses of code monkey
04:16 - junior and our beaver achiever courses
04:19 - then we'll discuss using text-based
04:21 - coding for those upper
04:23 - grade levels of students and through the
04:26 - coding adventure
04:27 - space adventure and banana tales courses
04:33 - and just before we actually get into
04:36 - going over this slide itself
04:37 - we are going to just go ahead and take a
04:40 - quick little poll here we'd love to just
04:43 - see um what grade levels you're working
04:47 - with
04:47 - and then just kind of how familiar you
04:50 - are with coding itself and then we'll go
04:52 - ahead and go through this so we'll give
04:53 - you just
04:54 - just a couple of just about a minute or
04:56 - so to go ahead and take this
04:57 - poll here and then we will get going
05:00 - with the rest of the webinar
05:33 - all right so it looks like the majority
05:35 - of you had a chance to vote
05:37 - so i'm actually going to share the
05:40 - results with you so
05:41 - hopefully you can see the results you
05:43 - can see that majority of you do teach
05:45 - the upper
05:46 - elementary and middle school levels
05:48 - there
05:49 - and that some of you are sort of you
05:51 - know in the middle with coding and i
05:53 - think that's kind of where we all are
05:54 - and where
05:55 - and where we hope to kind of share those
05:57 - experiences with you today
05:58 - so we're going to go ahead and take a
06:01 - look
06:02 - here at um our courses that we do offer
06:06 - here at code monkey so we kind of have a
06:07 - spectrum we suggest
06:09 - grade levels k through eight obviously
06:11 - these courses can really be adjusted
06:13 - for where your students are their needs
06:15 - and their previous coding knowledge so
06:17 - you can see here
06:18 - um we move from block based to
06:20 - coffeescript and coffeescript is a
06:22 - shorter
06:24 - programming language basically it's not
06:25 - very syntax heavy doesn't have a lot of
06:27 - curly brackets and things like that we
06:29 - know that young learners
06:30 - even more advanced learners don't know
06:32 - how to put periods right
06:34 - don't know how to spell in it you know
06:35 - capitalize their names those types of
06:37 - things so giving them
06:38 - extra syntax like curly brackets and
06:39 - things just tend to confuse them
06:41 - so this gives them the opportunity to
06:43 - learn those text-based languages
06:46 - but without having to be tied down and
06:48 - then we move right along to our python
06:50 - so
06:51 - we'll kind of review a few of these
06:52 - courses with you today through the
06:54 - ambassador's point of view so
06:56 - yeah feel free to ask questions in the
06:57 - chat box
07:04 - all right so i'm going to start by going
07:06 - over what is block coding so hopefully
07:08 - some of you have experienced some of the
07:10 - block coding
07:11 - applications so blocks introduce
07:14 - students to coding concepts without the
07:16 - need to know how to type
07:17 - so students also do not know need to
07:20 - know how to read which is
07:22 - a huge help they can
07:25 - just follow along with what's the what's
07:28 - going on on the screen and they can drag
07:30 - blocks into the correct location
07:32 - the blocks at the youngest level are
07:34 - arrows and symbols and here's
07:36 - a picture here that show direction
07:40 - so as students move to the higher
07:41 - courses the blocks
07:43 - then will have words and symbols so
07:45 - students at even the earliest age are
07:47 - introduced to the fundamental
07:49 - concepts of programming operators loops
07:53 - and events
07:54 - so they think that they're playing games
07:57 - and they don't really
07:58 - actually realize that they're learning
08:02 - okay so two of the block-based programs
08:05 - in
08:06 - uh code monkey are code monkey junior
08:09 - and beaver achiever
08:12 - and we're going to begin by taking a
08:14 - look at code monkey junior
08:17 - so code monkey jr has friendly
08:20 - characters
08:20 - as you can see by the graphic fun
08:23 - graphics
08:24 - and students love the sounds and
08:26 - interacting with the characters
08:30 - okay so for non-readers or our youngest
08:33 - students
08:34 - in pre-k to first grade although my
08:37 - second grade students love code monkey
08:40 - junior
08:41 - so these are the concepts that are
08:43 - covered
08:46 - okay so i'm going to give a quick
08:48 - demonstration of what code monkey jr
08:51 - looks like so i'm going to go into
08:54 - the code monkey account and right here
08:58 - is our code monkey jr and again it's
08:59 - marked as pre-reader
09:01 - so the students do not have to know how
09:05 - to read
09:06 - and then they can see here that the
09:09 - monkey wants to get
09:11 - to the treasure chest and then they can
09:13 - just
09:14 - take their box and drag them
09:17 - up and press
09:27 - [Music]
09:29 - there is sound but i don't have the
09:30 - sound turned on at the moment
09:32 - so and of course we can hear your sound
09:34 - oh oh so i can't hear my sound okay
09:37 - so so he's hopefully he's not too loud
09:39 - so he's celebrating so
09:42 - no it's the perfect the perfect volume
09:51 - okay so then uh here's a sample of some
09:55 - students playing
09:56 - you can do it on the tablet i don't have
09:58 - tablets in my school so we use them on
10:00 - chromebooks you can use it on
10:02 - radio computers while we were home
10:04 - during uh
10:06 - virtual learning my students were able
10:07 - to use it on almost any device
10:10 - and of course you can project it up on
10:13 - your smart board if you have one
10:17 - okay the next one that i'd like to talk
10:19 - about is beaver achiever
10:21 - so beaver achiever is perfect for the
10:23 - first and third grade
10:24 - okay although depending on students
10:27 - reading level
10:28 - i definitely have older students that
10:30 - have used beaver achiever
10:32 - so i've used it with my fourth grade and
10:34 - some of my fifth graders
10:36 - there are some words here but there's
10:40 - also the arrows and symbols so even
10:43 - though that the students are introduced
10:45 - to words on the blocks they don't need
10:47 - to be able to read them
10:49 - so i've had anywhere from second graders
10:51 - use beaver achiever all the way through
10:53 - to my fifth graders
10:55 - okay some students need to start with
10:57 - block coding in order to become
10:59 - motivated and persevere
11:01 - so if they find that they're successful
11:03 - early on it encourages them to continue
11:05 - and progress
11:06 - with the harder levels so again
11:10 - even though my students are older than
11:13 - that first through third grade
11:15 - it gives them that motivation
11:18 - and that level of success so if they
11:20 - know that they're successful
11:22 - then they'll be able to go on to the
11:24 - text-based coding
11:29 - okay yeah yes uh like mention it uh
11:32 - paige mention it there's a baby red
11:34 - shiver and cold monkey is a good starter
11:35 - for little
11:36 - grades i use senate personally with the
11:39 - students the first time when i used to
11:41 - call monkey junior as
11:42 - similar to scratch junior but always
11:44 - more helpful more engagement and i see
11:46 - the
11:47 - uh how the students enjoy it so
11:50 - i really like it and i mentioned it
11:53 - the first time i see it is only
11:54 - available in
11:56 - ipads so in ios systems but unfortunate
12:00 - fortunately the code monkey always
12:03 - received feedback from teachers and from
12:05 - anybody they want to improve something
12:07 - so they improve it and they open it for
12:09 - any
12:10 - system so any chromebooks any uh
12:13 - windows systems desktops laptops
12:15 - telephones and everything so that is
12:17 - very helpful
12:18 - so the next one like i said beaver
12:20 - achiever is very helpful as well too
12:22 - because
12:23 - it's different it's working with sounds
12:25 - music and everything so
12:26 - students love it so i wouldn't say my
12:29 - students come
12:30 - how they challenge how they solve it and
12:32 - i really
12:33 - enjoy to do some kind of
12:37 - leadership skills in my class so when
12:39 - the students mastering
12:41 - i really i ask them to give you know the
12:43 - solution but i'll give you some clues to
12:45 - the students
12:46 - struggle to give you like kind of
12:48 - teamwork
12:49 - so that's i really want to improve that
12:51 - one
12:52 - so you notice here in my class i have my
12:55 - upper graders this is third graders in
12:57 - my school
12:58 - to assist me to go visit first and
13:01 - second graders when we have enrichment
13:03 - on fridays
13:04 - to go one to one a student integrated to
13:08 - first grader to teach them how to use
13:10 - the system
13:11 - so i believe so it's a great tool a
13:13 - great
13:14 - teamwork that you can maybe challenge
13:16 - your students tenth graders to teach the
13:18 - little ones
13:19 - to tease the kindest to teach the first
13:21 - graders so i promoting
13:23 - leadership in my school
13:27 - and this is another example how my
13:28 - students engage
13:30 - in on friday's enrichment i do robotics
13:33 - and also to coding classes using code
13:36 - monkey
13:42 - and you notice here they have three
13:44 - stars
13:45 - also for to see it you have complete
13:48 - successfully the challenge and this is
13:51 - an example how the
13:52 - uh vivid achiever works
13:56 - you drag in your locks
14:00 - and click the green arrow
14:04 - icon
14:11 - you see this is something that
14:13 - introduced my students to segmentation
14:15 - so don't try to solve the problem at the
14:17 - same time
14:18 - to live by the steps so you little by
14:20 - little students start saying oh my
14:22 - goodness that's true
14:23 - so you give you the option to to start
14:25 - the problem
14:27 - solving and fix and little pieces
14:30 - students gonna be understand the best
14:32 - concept and also the same time
14:34 - you introduce to them how to use the
14:37 - loops
14:38 - remember you can have a big lines of
14:40 - code and you can reduce it when you use
14:42 - the loop
14:57 - good job
15:00 - that's good so another thing that really
15:03 - empowered my students
15:05 - said the computers are not the smarter
15:08 - you are the smarter because the
15:09 - computers they can do
15:10 - anything without giving you some
15:12 - directions
15:14 - so that is something that my students
15:15 - all the time asked
15:17 - i can do it or the struggle of the uh
15:20 - sometimes frustrated but i said no take
15:22 - your time
15:23 - let's do it together and try to do the
15:26 - solution remember you encourage your
15:28 - students
15:28 - failures are okay there's nothing wrong
15:30 - with the failures because we're learning
15:32 - the failures
15:38 - right so now we're going to move on to
15:40 - um text base coding
15:43 - so text based coding is uh when students
15:46 - begin
15:46 - typing in directions instead of dragging
15:49 - in blocks
15:50 - so encoding adventure which is the
15:52 - sample shown here
15:55 - students can also click on these buttons
15:57 - that are down on the bottom
15:59 - and then they're still prompted to enter
16:02 - additional information
16:03 - so for example if they click the step
16:05 - button
16:06 - they'll still have to type in how many
16:08 - times they need to
16:10 - step okay since text-based coding
16:12 - follows
16:13 - syntax rules uh as lena had mentioned
16:17 - earlier the
16:18 - the curly cues and periods and some
16:21 - arrows and dashes and things like that
16:24 - okay
16:25 - so they are still um being
16:28 - uh familiarized with
16:31 - real world programming so students are
16:34 - able to challenge themselves by having
16:36 - to type the code
16:37 - and not just know which blocks to drag
16:41 - okay so again here is an example of
16:43 - coding adventure
16:45 - so once my students in second grade
16:48 - completed they uh this year they did
16:51 - code monkey junior
16:52 - they completed beaver achiever and then
16:55 - some of them actually got to move on to
16:57 - coding adventure
16:58 - so again second grade and these are
17:01 - students that i did not see the first
17:03 - half of the year i didn't even get to
17:05 - meet
17:05 - most of my second grade students until
17:08 - almost
17:09 - march or april and they actually were
17:12 - able to go in
17:13 - and learn how to do this so just because
17:17 - it's for um
17:18 - third grade and up doesn't mean that you
17:20 - second grade
17:21 - students can't get challenged and here
17:24 - my students work collaboratively so they
17:27 - can help each other when the code
17:28 - becomes difficult to master
17:31 - so on this uh pic slide here
17:34 - is uh pre-pandemic but i do have
17:37 - some other slides with pictures showing
17:40 - how they work during
17:41 - uh last year but they do work together
17:45 - collaboratively so that they can help
17:47 - each other
17:48 - and again not get frustrated
17:53 - yeah there's something like page mention
17:55 - it the
17:56 - code adventure is um targeting grades
17:59 - three to eight but you can adapt it for
18:01 - any grade level
18:02 - the challenge is 420 challenges that are
18:04 - divided in three courses
18:06 - 210 challenges are restoring more or
18:08 - consider introducing challenge to
18:10 - another students
18:12 - programming language using coffeescript
18:15 - the current concepts cover is called an
18:18 - inventory is using
18:20 - loops objects variables arrays
18:23 - for loops the coding adventure 2
18:27 - they use more advanced
18:30 - information for coding like functions
18:33 - conditions
18:34 - boolean logic if else for example and
18:37 - or and the last part of this
18:41 - current adventure is the using operators
18:44 - like no comparations function return
18:47 - values triggering events
18:49 - using the mouse so it's a great complete
18:52 - course so i highly recommend it for
18:54 - greatest
18:55 - the other one they want to talk right
18:56 - now is
18:58 - doral mats
19:03 - doromats using okay this one is
19:07 - okay this is gonna i was yeah i was
19:09 - going to show real quick coding
19:11 - adventure yes so just so you can see
19:14 - what it looks like so this is coding
19:16 - adventure part
19:17 - two and you can see that it
19:20 - they're still typing in it's a little
19:22 - bit more complex but they still
19:24 - are able to click on the buttons to help
19:27 - them move along
19:28 - all right go ahead javier sorry
19:35 - the other program they're using in my
19:38 - class is do
19:39 - do do dots math because this is some
19:42 - crossing curriculum the
19:44 - uh coding or in this case uh
19:47 - code monkey using it to reinforce it
19:50 - what is students doing with math
19:52 - and you also can ask the students do you
19:54 - using math is important in coding
19:56 - because they're using subtractions
19:58 - using divisions multiplications and also
20:01 - use
20:02 - geometry like angles and everything so
20:04 - for example i remember
20:06 - as my students so remember how you
20:09 - symbolize your multiplication
20:11 - when you're writing so you put a little
20:13 - x in computer so you
20:15 - need to define what is multiplication
20:17 - with the aster
20:18 - so is need to do learn these concepts
20:22 - because they cannot be saved you know
20:24 - what is uh
20:25 - multiplication is different when you're
20:27 - representing a computer
20:29 - when you made it in writing so body is a
20:32 - great
20:32 - result great great resource for
20:35 - reinforced
20:36 - math this is a
20:39 - targeting for second to fifth graders
20:42 - they contain
20:43 - 20 levels and dot dots math offers
20:46 - students fun game
20:47 - challenge that will help them practicing
20:49 - from second to great
20:51 - mathematics concepts
20:58 - banana tales is another great
21:01 - resource a great course from con monkey
21:05 - because allows students to create their
21:08 - own games
21:09 - to be creative because remember the
21:12 - students they need to understand they
21:13 - only know
21:14 - how to uh play they need to create they
21:17 - use the imagination they use the
21:19 - creativity
21:20 - to learn and they use is more like like
21:23 - i said for advanced
21:24 - classes and they have 75
21:27 - challenges in part one and you see it
21:30 - they have
21:31 - you working with the statements loops
21:33 - variables arrays
21:35 - in the scene and for loops the part two
21:38 - they use class variables
21:39 - scope input and also dictionaries
21:42 - and 2d list bubble stars
21:49 - how i can incorporate python and k5 to
21:52 - k25
21:53 - i have a gta students that all the time
21:56 - help me with my classes
21:58 - when the students struggle when i teach
22:00 - in coding
22:02 - these students using right now the
22:04 - program in python
22:06 - python is another program similar to
22:09 - javascript
22:10 - but they really want to see it you need
22:13 - to challenge your students
22:14 - when they want to expectation is higher
22:17 - and say you know what it's really i want
22:19 - to learn something else
22:20 - so don't stop the creativity for the
22:22 - students i really encourage them to
22:25 - go to move forward to learn more advance
22:28 - i believe so the python is teaching more
22:30 - like in the middle in high schools
22:32 - but it never starts early i believe so
22:34 - you create a great foundation
22:36 - in elementary it's gonna be give you
22:38 - better skills for
22:40 - the middle and high school
22:47 - right so this is a picture of my class
22:50 - um
22:50 - during the the previous year so here i
22:54 - have uh students this particular class
22:57 - here you could see that this was on this
22:59 - year
22:59 - that they're socially distanced they're
23:01 - wearing masks but these young ladies who
23:03 - are here
23:04 - they're actually standing up and working
23:07 - out the way
23:08 - that they should be moving so my
23:10 - students they look at the
23:12 - challenges and then they act them out so
23:14 - this way they can
23:15 - physically figure out what to do and
23:18 - again even though they weren't near each
23:19 - other they were still
23:20 - able to collaborate so someone had asked
23:22 - earlier on in the
23:24 - chat about pair programming so this is
23:27 - not
23:28 - true pair programming which is one
23:30 - device and two students
23:32 - however um they are working on the same
23:35 - challenges
23:36 - at the same time they discussed what are
23:38 - they going to go into which one are they
23:40 - going to work on because i let them
23:41 - choose
23:42 - and then they actually work together and
23:44 - they turn their screens and show each
23:46 - other what they're working on
23:47 - so um even though we were
23:51 - in in person we were able to do that now
23:53 - in the front picture over here
23:55 - this is another program that um we have
23:58 - on
23:58 - on code monkey it's called space
24:00 - adventure it's part of the hour of code
24:02 - and my second graders um not all of them
24:05 - but some of them were able to
24:07 - work on this challenge as well and it
24:10 - also um
24:11 - the second through fifth graders worked
24:13 - on it so here you could see
24:15 - in this picture that i have students who
24:18 - are at home
24:18 - so they were learning remotely they're
24:21 - sharing their screen here
24:22 - asking for help they're working together
24:24 - remotely at home
24:26 - and then the students in the classroom
24:27 - here in the back they're also able to go
24:29 - and help each other
24:31 - and so they walked around the room just
24:33 - like javier said that they were able to
24:35 - um assist their classmates and then even
24:38 - um
24:39 - remotely what i had my students do is if
24:42 - everybody at home wasn't able to help
24:44 - each other
24:45 - that one student who is in class would
24:47 - come and stand in front of the camera
24:49 - the webcam
24:50 - and they would go through it and help
24:51 - the students who were at home
24:53 - so this again they shared their screens
24:55 - and then they were able to assist them
24:58 - so it's very very collaborative
25:01 - really lets the students be able to work
25:04 - together
25:06 - okay one of the other things that i did
25:08 - was i created this poster um it's called
25:11 - tips to help with frustration
25:13 - i have this hanging in my classroom i
25:15 - also have it on my
25:16 - pinned on my google classroom page
25:18 - because students really know that they
25:20 - shouldn't give up when things get hard
25:22 - and these are some of the tips that i
25:24 - tell my students
25:25 - to muse so we
25:28 - uh and uh computer science
25:32 - do something called rubber ducky
25:34 - programming so here's my little rubber
25:36 - duck friend
25:37 - so my my students don't all have rubber
25:39 - ducks at home so one of the things i
25:41 - tell them to do is if
25:43 - they're at home and they can't talk to a
25:45 - partner they can't
25:46 - actually speak to somebody in class if
25:48 - they're working from home
25:50 - is to um talk to a stuffed animal and
25:52 - try to work it out
25:53 - with um just by thinking through the
25:56 - process
25:57 - so uh code monkey also gives hints
26:01 - so what they can do is um keep track of
26:03 - what they try
26:04 - write it down describes what's happening
26:06 - and think about what should happen
26:08 - and then go through and try to make some
26:10 - changes
26:15 - okay uh lena i think this is you
26:19 - um sorry um so you can see here and
26:22 - gloria agree with you paige
26:23 - always has great tips um so
26:27 - um so some of the concepts that are
26:29 - covered within each of these courses
26:31 - really kind of range so i know each of
26:32 - them mentioned
26:34 - you know different things the code
26:35 - monkey junior is really computational
26:37 - thinking their lesson
26:38 - those lesson plans in that course are
26:39 - really my favorite um so we have the
26:41 - beaver achiever and you can kind of see
26:43 - the
26:44 - sequences here i'm not sure why this is
26:46 - my error here
26:47 - there's really only three courses in
26:49 - beaver achiever there's 115 challenges
26:51 - that we just recently expanded and
26:55 - it's going to be enough content for more
26:57 - than a year for your students there um
26:59 - coding adventure goes pretty advanced it
27:01 - starts out pretty
27:02 - i'm just really teaching those
27:03 - fundamentals and then it gets into more
27:05 - advanced concepts like page had shown
27:07 - where they're defining functions
27:09 - um they're doing some boolean logic and
27:12 - then they really get
27:13 - into like onboarding and not operating
27:15 - um
27:17 - event driven things that are being
27:19 - triggered so when i push this key
27:21 - what happens so really just moving into
27:23 - those more advanced concepts so beyond
27:25 - challenge 75 that moves pretty quickly
27:27 - and gets pretty advanced
27:28 - there dota does math if you do teach
27:32 - at the elementary levels which it looked
27:33 - like majority of you did
27:35 - um the favorite one that i like to use
27:36 - is the dota just map angles you pick up
27:38 - a protractor and you actually measure
27:39 - the distances
27:41 - when i was in the classroom and i had
27:42 - students that were struggling i actually
27:43 - utilized this course with them
27:45 - it was the first time that they really
27:46 - understood within it what an acute and
27:49 - obtuse angle was
27:50 - and kind of just really understanding
27:52 - that measurement
27:53 - in a more visual way so it was nice to
27:56 - see those kind of light bulbs go on as
27:58 - well
27:58 - um and then banana tails javier
28:00 - mentioned that he uses this with his
28:02 - younger students
28:03 - anyone who's a little bit more seasoned
28:05 - i guess you would say in the coding
28:07 - programming language could do banana
28:08 - tales we've had younger students do it
28:10 - as well
28:11 - but just if they're not so familiar with
28:13 - it it can get a little bit frustrating
28:14 - when you don't know those sequences you
28:16 - know how do you do the syntax
28:17 - incorrectly so we always want students
28:19 - to feel
28:21 - we want them to feel ownership and feel
28:23 - excited about that
28:24 - and so that's kind of what we try to
28:26 - encourage throughout all of coding
28:28 - throughout all of the courses itself
28:30 - like paige mentioned space adventure
28:32 - um is our newer course but um probably
28:34 - one of our favs
28:39 - i just wanted to to mention i do a lot
28:42 - of cross-curricular
28:44 - work with my because i'm a technology
28:45 - teacher but i bring this
28:47 - into the into the regular classrooms so
28:50 - um when lena was talking about the
28:52 - angles when my students were learning
28:54 - quadrilaterals in the third and fourth
28:56 - grade classes
28:58 - uh they they use this uh dota this map
29:01 - as the reinforcer
29:03 - and a lot of our coding adventure as
29:05 - well so
29:06 - when they were first learning how to use
29:08 - protractors in
29:10 - their math class they then reinforced it
29:13 - by using the protractor and coding and
29:14 - venture and also in dodo does that so
29:16 - which is
29:17 - really really helpful and again all my
29:20 - note think that we mentioned it earlier
29:22 - reinforces those typing skills so
29:25 - even though that you know uh in the
29:28 - text-based
29:29 - coding they're practicing well where are
29:31 - the letters on the keyboard where are
29:33 - the numbers how do i find it where are
29:35 - those brackets and things like that
29:40 - yes and um
29:44 - nevermind lost my train of thought i
29:45 - think something what i loved uh
29:47 - um paige really led and created this
29:50 - webinar for you all today um what i
29:52 - loved most about
29:54 - paige's story is i think what a lot of
29:56 - us kind of come
29:57 - into uh when we start teaching coding is
30:00 - when you
30:00 - are your students kind of come in with
30:02 - no computer-based knowledge we sometimes
30:05 - feel that maybe they can't achieve we
30:08 - get nervous about them achieving at
30:10 - those higher levels and kind of taking
30:11 - those risks
30:12 - so i think what was really great is you
30:15 - know
30:16 - pages students the first time they ever
30:17 - see computers or any type of things when
30:19 - they come
30:20 - to her classroom in their um are they
30:22 - first grade page
30:24 - or second second grade we don't have any
30:26 - devices kbk one uh pre-k
30:28 - one at all so their first device they're
30:30 - seeing is second grade
30:32 - and so she started using fewer cheaper
30:35 - right um with the second grade we
30:38 - started co
30:39 - code monkey junior and let them start on
30:41 - junior because they didn't even know how
30:42 - to type their names
30:45 - and i think um and so and it just i
30:48 - think
30:48 - what page has learned from this year and
30:50 - what i love about her story is just that
30:52 - she was able to see
30:53 - you know what the students were able to
30:55 - achieve without really
30:57 - you know this year's it's not like you
30:58 - were sitting right next to most of your
31:00 - students they were really kind of
31:01 - achieving it and have to doing it
31:02 - virtually and kind of taking those risks
31:04 - and i think
31:06 - that's always the hardest part is taking
31:07 - the risk when you begin coding so i
31:09 - think it
31:10 - i think that's what's so special about
31:11 - both of our ambassadors and really all
31:13 - of you is that once you start really
31:15 - getting into coding itself you just see
31:17 - what the students can
31:18 - achieve and i really do think it ties to
31:20 - also just like regular achievement in
31:22 - their classes they're able to see
31:24 - how to sequence and really kind of tie
31:25 - that into other components
31:30 - okay if we we have a little bit of time
31:32 - so i think i'm going to show them the
31:33 - teacher dashboard
31:34 - okay okay all right and then we'll take
31:37 - some of these we have a couple of live
31:38 - questions so
31:39 - why page is getting that up and going um
31:42 - we had a question from
31:43 - one of our participants are there any
31:46 - programming
31:48 - paired programming lessons in the
31:49 - curriculum so there are a couple
31:51 - in a couple of the lessons some
31:52 - suggestions for students to work
31:54 - collaboratively
31:56 - but i think as programmers
31:59 - i don't think that there's any thing
32:02 - wrong with students sitting side by side
32:04 - and
32:04 - programming together i think the
32:06 - important piece is that they each do
32:08 - their own so that they can be
32:09 - accountable for their work because if
32:11 - javier does my work for me
32:13 - i'm never going to know how to do it
32:15 - independently and so we just always kind
32:17 - of
32:18 - we kind of encourage that collaboration
32:20 - and i think javier does that a lot in
32:21 - his classroom with his students as well
32:26 - so over here is the uh the full teacher
32:30 - before i was showing you the student
32:31 - version
32:32 - so here if you go to teacher resources
32:34 - you'll see that there's
32:35 - a bunch of different tabs my favorite
32:38 - one
32:39 - especially when i was brand new at this
32:40 - and i had no idea what i was doing
32:43 - uh especially with the coffeescript and
32:45 - the python was the solutions
32:48 - so as the teacher i'm just gonna go to
32:50 - one at random
32:52 - one of the higher up ones it will show
32:54 - you what the three-star solution is
32:56 - supposed to be
32:58 - so as a teacher you don't have to ever
33:01 - feel that you don't know what you're
33:03 - doing and not to do it so
33:05 - don't you as a teacher are a facilitator
33:09 - or lead learner you're learning
33:10 - alongside with your students
33:12 - so this is here to support you
33:16 - uh again um there's also um
33:19 - lesson plans so you can download i'm not
33:22 - going to click on them to download but
33:23 - you'll see that you can download lesson
33:24 - plans for
33:25 - all of the different activities
33:29 - there's how-to guides okay setting up
33:33 - classrooms
33:34 - adding students if you
33:37 - do any of the hour of code challenges so
33:39 - again my
33:40 - favorite uh one of them was where is it
33:44 - um yeah so the banana tails if you want
33:46 - to try out the python banana tails just
33:49 - for yourself
33:50 - you can try it out as an hour of code
33:52 - activity
33:53 - just so that because again i don't know
33:55 - any python until i tried this out
33:57 - so here it gives you more information
34:00 - about it
34:01 - how to set up a whole hour of code so
34:03 - this might be something interesting to
34:05 - do during computer science education
34:07 - week this week
34:08 - you show them something completely
34:10 - different okay and this you can
34:11 - definitely do
34:12 - all my third graders were evil even able
34:15 - to do that
34:17 - so those are some notes certificates for
34:20 - your students
34:22 - and some posters and things like that
34:36 - something that i really want to and
34:38 - reinforce you guys the
34:39 - dashboard help you to see uh the
34:42 - students struggles the students
34:43 - achievements
34:44 - what the students for example say you
34:46 - know what i see everybody
34:48 - struggling and number eight challenge
34:50 - let's go discuss so you can present
34:52 - it and so um
34:55 - from that have a conversation with the
34:56 - students and i see what is the struggle
34:59 - to reinforce them to everybody
35:01 - understand
35:02 - so you notice there they have little
35:04 - stars and you see the little blue screen
35:06 - that means
35:07 - they have a challenge so they have
35:09 - problems with that they give you a
35:10 - little
35:11 - graphic uh perspective what is your
35:14 - students doing it
35:16 - and of course you can see it what is
35:18 - students already almost
35:19 - finished everything so you can ask this
35:22 - student in particular you already
35:23 - mastered that
35:24 - so you can be my assist my teacher
35:26 - assistant in the class
35:28 - but remember as your teacher assistant
35:31 - or your
35:32 - student they help you don't give you the
35:34 - solution only give you some clues
35:37 - because like lena and paige agree
35:40 - we are here to reinforce every student
35:44 - learning at the same time so it is no
35:47 - good to give you the solution right away
35:51 - also up here if you notice you can turn
35:53 - on or off the hints
35:56 - and you can limit their progress so
35:57 - maybe you only want them to learn how to
35:59 - do the stepping and turning or
36:01 - um only work on challenges one through
36:04 - ten during that class time so you can
36:07 - and then for grading purposes for those
36:09 - of you who need to give grades you can
36:11 - click on the
36:12 - export data and then have their grades
36:16 - there's a gradebook here as well tells
36:18 - you
36:19 - what they completed gives you a list of
36:22 - your
36:24 - students their sign-ins
36:28 - and again you can assign lessons and
36:31 - then
36:31 - see the lesson plans so maybe i'll try
36:33 - to see if i can
36:34 - open that up just so you can get an idea
36:37 - so here's the
36:38 - the lesson plans are all here in
36:42 - slide format and your objectives
36:45 - your vocab your standards
36:49 - and gives you step-by-step instructions
36:51 - how to teach the course
36:57 - and the introductory part of those
36:59 - lessons it does have
37:01 - usually an unplugged type of an activity
37:03 - so that's usually introducing to the
37:04 - concept
37:05 - and then there's some play time which is
37:07 - the bulk of the lesson plan itself
37:09 - and then the last part is debrief so
37:11 - usually reflecting on something that
37:12 - you've learned
37:14 - um throughout the course and i know
37:15 - paige had mentioned that she used coach
37:16 - monkey jr with her second grade students
37:19 - i always love to use this with really
37:22 - any
37:22 - of the students because it because
37:25 - there's not really any barrier to entry
37:27 - there's not a lot of text tying them
37:28 - down it's really fun
37:30 - and it just kind of gets them going and
37:34 - the lesson plans in
37:35 - code monkey junior the unplugged
37:37 - activities those ones are my favorite
37:39 - especially for like the younger kids
37:40 - has a lot of movement and i know that we
37:41 - don't really know what this year is
37:43 - going to
37:44 - look like um as the pandemic rages on
37:48 - um so it's always just you know you can
37:50 - always take those also like virtually as
37:52 - well
37:53 - um so here on this slide here we have um
37:56 - our code monkey blog which i had
37:57 - mentioned um at the beginning but we do
37:59 - have both page
38:01 - and javier have both written their own
38:04 - blog
38:04 - posts here on why coding is important
38:07 - and best websites to learn coding
38:10 - both of i don't know what happened here
38:11 - with the formatting there but
38:13 - both javier and paige also lead our
38:16 - monthly
38:17 - twitter chats and so we hope that you
38:21 - can also join us for those as well and
38:22 - then we do have a
38:25 - clean monkey super fans group it's
38:26 - really our code monkey pln group
38:29 - and we do you know we really want to
38:32 - encourage you to collaborate as much as
38:34 - possible because that's the most
38:35 - important
38:36 - piece of teaching anything is just the
38:38 - collaboration that you can have
38:39 - not only that you encourage with your
38:41 - students but amongst yourselves as
38:44 - teachers
38:48 - um i'll answer this one question here
38:50 - one person asked does could monkey still
38:52 - have the computer science competition um
38:54 - right now we don't have the competition
38:56 - um in place but we do have some things
39:01 - in the works that we're hoping to
39:04 - be able to share with you all soon
39:08 - barbara had a question and maybe you and
39:10 - javier can answer this for students with
39:12 - no coding experience
39:14 - fourth and fifth graders would you
39:15 - recommend beginning with code monkey
39:16 - junior
39:20 - absolutely correct go ahead javier you
39:24 - can answer
39:25 - yeah absolutely i believe so this is a
39:26 - great starter because they're gonna be
39:28 - start moving uh the easy challenge and
39:31 - they're gonna be moving
39:32 - to a little more harder chargers so um
39:35 - maybe you say no cod monkey junior is
39:37 - easy so
39:38 - move it to a bigger and cheaper viva
39:40 - achiever is is a good example because
39:43 - cannot be started with the easy lines of
39:44 - code but they're going to be introducing
39:47 - them to
39:47 - using the loops i believe so they made
39:50 - any segmentation
39:51 - and reinforce them to how to do it but
39:53 - you don't lose anything if they like it
39:55 - maybe they finish
39:56 - all code monkey junior and then jump
39:58 - into
39:59 - um vivid achiever yeah i absolutely
40:02 - think that
40:03 - it gives them the motivation because
40:05 - they started with something that's easy
40:07 - to them they say oh this is so much easy
40:09 - this is
40:10 - fun if you start some of them on
40:12 - something that's a little bit
40:13 - complicated
40:14 - sometimes they get turned off and they
40:15 - don't they don't want to try extra hard
40:18 - and especially this year
40:20 - they're going to find so many things
40:22 - challenging
40:23 - that give them something that's going to
40:25 - be easier for them to feel really good
40:28 - about themselves
40:33 - and then the next question was can the
40:35 - lessons be assigned through google
40:36 - classroom so all of the
40:38 - coding adventure lesson plans are
40:40 - adapted in our lesson mode and so those
40:43 - can be as long as you're basically if
40:45 - your accounts are synced as a google
40:46 - google account then you can go ahead and
40:48 - you can connect that right to your
40:50 - google classroom so we do have that
40:52 - ability there so great question
41:02 - so we would love to go ahead and
41:06 - open this up to next page
41:10 - two questions for you i know some of you
41:11 - have been popping in questions as we've
41:13 - been
41:14 - progressing here but it's always nice to
41:17 - hear directly from
41:18 - you any questions or wonderings that you
41:20 - have we have these
41:22 - two great resources here really the time
41:25 - we want to honor your time
41:26 - and your questions just as much as the
41:28 - information that we've been able to
41:30 - share with you today
41:38 - the questions could be anything about
41:40 - computer science
41:41 - uh remote learning hybrid uh
41:44 - in-person learning i spend a lot of time
41:47 - my big focus in my classes
41:49 - is collaboration it's really important
41:51 - for me that my students are able to work
41:54 - with
41:54 - others so what are some ways page that
41:57 - you have been able to
41:59 - foster collaboration with your students
42:03 - because pages in new jersey so it's been
42:05 - a little bit different rules obviously
42:07 - in every state and every
42:08 - every county and every place um so i'd
42:10 - love to hear your perspective on how
42:12 - collaboration
42:12 - worked for you um and your students
42:16 - yes so um as i mentioned a little bit
42:18 - earlier
42:19 - uh that my students even though that
42:20 - they had to socially distance and as far
42:22 - as i know they will still have to um be
42:24 - three feet apart
42:26 - in september i still want to make sure
42:29 - that they're working with
42:30 - others so if uh they're in the classroom
42:33 - and they're not
42:34 - able to actually work together i let
42:36 - them work with a partner that sits
42:38 - nearby i don't
42:39 - i can't control where they sit so i
42:40 - can't choose their partners
42:42 - so hopefully um very what i try to do is
42:46 - have
42:47 - one student who's really strong at
42:48 - reading with a student who's not as
42:50 - strong at
42:51 - reading when we're working on the uh the
42:53 - text based
42:54 - so that and it's not always my
42:58 - best students who are the best
43:01 - at computer science and coding usually
43:03 - my best students are the ones who get
43:05 - frustrated first because they're used to
43:07 - being good at everything all the time
43:09 - and they really have to think about this
43:11 - this is not something that just comes
43:13 - easily the block based coding might be
43:17 - more intuitive but the text-based coding
43:19 - they really need to pay attention so
43:21 - those students especially in the upper
43:23 - grades
43:24 - i know i constantly tell my fourth and
43:25 - fifth graders we start um if you're
43:27 - respect referring to yourself with the
43:29 - letter i
43:30 - must be capital letter i so they need to
43:32 - know that they have it's very very
43:34 - specific that they have to type things
43:36 - correctly
43:37 - and they can't just wing it so i really
43:40 - try to pair my students
43:41 - um based on their
43:45 - learning styles that being said if
43:47 - they're not
43:49 - whoever they're sitting next to
43:50 - hopefully their
43:52 - classroom teacher has already uh
43:55 - fostered that kind of collaboration
43:57 - within the math and this
43:58 - and this uh in english uh ela classes
44:03 - so um they're they're able to uh already
44:06 - have
44:06 - a partner but if we were under um normal
44:09 - circumstances hopefully uh
44:11 - at some point this year then i just have
44:14 - my students they
44:15 - work by uh whoever they'd like to work
44:17 - with and they really do
44:18 - uh collaborate together no matter who no
44:21 - matter who they're working with they
44:23 - work together
44:24 - this year my second graders would uh
44:26 - just
44:27 - flock to each other whoever was on a
44:29 - different whatever lesson they were on
44:31 - and again my second graders went all the
44:33 - way up through
44:34 - coding adventure one which was amazing
44:37 - since they had never seen any
44:39 - technology before
44:46 - javier you have um students in your
44:49 - classroom that speak also different
44:52 - languages
44:52 - are there do you find that there's any
44:55 - um
44:56 - anything that prohibits them from
44:57 - learning how to code with um
44:59 - being different you also have a
45:01 - different language as well so
45:03 - i would love to kind of hear your
45:04 - perspective there too
45:06 - yeah i believe so coding is universal so
45:09 - you need to learn in spanish or reading
45:11 - in spanish or reading in english
45:12 - so have the concept have the base i
45:15 - believe so understand there
45:17 - so my students they're learning visual
45:19 - learners like me so when you show them
45:21 - the first
45:22 - exercise together they catch it right
45:24 - away so
45:26 - it's um the but the language is not rare
45:29 - for them because they already see it
45:31 - it's like in math two plus two is four
45:33 - so it's the same concept when you're
45:35 - using in
45:36 - in uh encoding i see the students and
45:38 - say oh i got the solution and sometimes
45:41 - they find a different ways when they
45:42 - don't use the loops
45:44 - but at the same time they reinforce then
45:46 - and understand better when the keyboard
45:48 - is important because like
45:49 - page mentioned sometimes the they see
45:52 - the
45:52 - uh parenthesis is almost the same like
45:56 - the bracket
45:57 - or the curly bracket or the square
45:58 - bracket but when i mention it to using
46:01 - incorrectly when they use
46:02 - the shift key how important is to
46:04 - understand
46:05 - how the shift key works so they see
46:08 - visualize and say oh my goodness that's
46:10 - that's the problem
46:11 - so good about your introduction then the
46:15 - concepts and say this is the buggy
46:17 - you're looking right now a bug
46:19 - oh what is mark also sometimes they they
46:22 - joking with me
46:22 - it's a flight there or something then i
46:25 - say no it's something like
46:27 - you finding something wrong in your
46:29 - program something running your and
46:30 - you're coding let's find out that is the
46:32 - concept for debugging
46:34 - oh i got it so and explaining the
46:36 - history of the debugging one is
46:38 - this miss hopper when they're learning
46:41 - that they're learning about
46:42 - this a little little buggy so this
46:45 - counts as the students already learning
46:47 - in an early
46:47 - stages because they are my goal is to
46:50 - prepare them when go to the middle
46:51 - school
46:52 - and maybe despite the interest in early
46:54 - ages to continue learning computer
46:56 - science in the future
47:02 - great feedback okay so it doesn't look
47:05 - like there are
47:06 - any more questions but just know that
47:09 - you can always reach out to
47:11 - any of our ambassadors you can also
47:14 - reach out to anyone of our team want to
47:17 - go to the next live page
47:22 - so um obviously we from
47:25 - both all of us we thank you guys so much
47:28 - for joining us for today's webinar
47:32 - next slide and like we said if you have
47:35 - any questions you can always reach out
47:37 - to info at codemonkey or follow us on
47:39 - any of our social media platforms really
47:41 - almost all of them
47:43 - even though every day there seems to be
47:44 - new ones right but we hope that you
47:46 - thank you again javier and paige for
47:48 - taking your time and for all of you
47:50 - teachers for spending
47:51 - your time with us today and we hope that
47:54 - you remember to write codes catch
47:56 - bananas and
47:57 - spread the word bye everybody
