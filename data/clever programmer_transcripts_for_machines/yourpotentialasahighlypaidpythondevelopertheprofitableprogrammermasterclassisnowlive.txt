all right hi YouTube going live everywhere real quick Sinclair we crashed on a Facebook yeah hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm welcome to another live stream we are going live today and today marks the second day of the profitable programmer masterclass being live so we are going to go over that just making sure everything is good on my end here descriptions get to go cool and then I'm gonna go live here this going on going live on all the platforms is rocket science guys so please excuse us here we're just trying to figure it out interesting oh I see what's happening it's okay roll power through it no matter how many technical difficulties get thrown at us start live video boom and boom what's up guys this is Kazi from clever programmer calm we are live Instagram we are live YouTube and we are live Facebook hi hi everybody this is awesome exciting to have everybody here and hopefully we get more people as time progresses just so everybody knows what we're gonna be covering the profitable program our master class that I've been working on for a while with my entire team at clever programmer is now live so this is going to be a livestream where I answer your guys's questions provide you value and let you know something amazing the free profitable programmer training series or the master class is live and available for you guys for free so I have it in the links you know start clicking on that thing and signing up and checking it out and in the meantime we're just gonna hang out chill answer some questions and we're also gonna touch on your potential as a highlypaid Python developer so I'm gonna leave you with some very powerful valuable pieces of information and we're gonna touch on things like your earning potential and how much to develop make what kind of development you could be looking at and and yeah cool alright thank somebody says sexy jacket thank you thank you thank you it's up kind of cold here actually and it kind of happened out of nowhere so that was kind of surprising but we're getting the weather under control yeah I see that for those of you guys who have me on Instagram and follow my stories you guys know we're hustling we have not slept we have been up well maybe we got like 30 minutes of sleep were just straightup grinding I have Sinclair in the office with me he's uh helping out a lot he's our new well he's helping out with a lot of video editing we flew him out from New York and he's just crushing it he's crushing on Instagram so a lot of the new stuff we're seeing on Instagram was with his help also the some of the new stuff that we're seeing on YouTube as with his help and that's great and yeah we're just putting together a lot of content for you guys and making sure that you guys get the best all right so working around the clock and yeah same thing with this thing we've been up and we knew had to go live at 1100 a.m. and that's that's what we're making happen right now all right so I'm gonna I'm gonna take on some questions answer provide you guys some value you know the usual high above shake high sourabh high our vase high Sinclair yeah yeah Dinesh says how to improve logic while writing codes and which type of algorithm we should practice more do focus on algorithms do focus on logic it's always good but again focus mostly on the practical side and focus on learning the practical things that get you paid and then the rest you know kind of leave till till later you know learn it as you go and get as technical as you need to but not more than that and then just move on so that's I'm a huge fan of being practical and being profitable and then you know as you make more money and as you save more time and you can nerd out and do all kinds of crazy weird exercises and joy but focus on focus on just getting those practical skills so you are ready to go just watch hi everybody total Lube Bruce Bari math tutor killer son miss laughs Kordich hi hi hi Kinsler dennis mcgee 'no kyle cruiser freak um hi everybody hi hi hi hi anybody on YouTube wants to use that feature call super chat go ahead use it it's pretty awesome apparently you pay me money on a super app from super chat and then you're like question looks super cool it like has all these colors and then it keeps your question there so it makes sure that I answer it and uh and yeah there's something something about super chat that just makes everything worth it even even if it's somebody sending some sense and if you're over on Facebook and Instagram ya keep showing a lot of love those little heart signs that are not that big of a deal for you but when you tap them just there's something about it it's just like that validation I love it starting to get those hearts coming up sweet sweet sweet I'm Android and Python developer great yeah so the job market is pretty cool you know one of the one of the reasons why we do use languages like Python you know there are a lot of languages but if you even go through my videos like what programming language should I learn first and I have this on YouTube and you know what I say is that language is just a tool to get what you need done because main thing you want to do as a developer is take whatever idea you have in your head and bring it to life and then change the life of hundreds to thousands of people doing it and in the meantime you're doing something really powerful and amazing but you get paid what you deserve doing it and programming language is just a tool to again bring that to life like for example you know English is just one language and then you have Chinese and you have Japanese and you have Hindi and you have all these different languages you can learn but the main thing is that with each language the big things are trying to do is express emotions express ideas you are trying to maybe get jobs you are trying to convey love emotions when it comes to apps and when it comes to building websites or building web apps it's similar you have to take what's in your head and translate it and coding language is just a tool we use but the one that I want to choose for you guys and help you choose I want to make sure that the tool you choose is the most paid meaning the most profitable I want to make sure that it's the easiest for you and that it's one of the most popular okay so three things most paid most popular all right and easiest all right and that's why we choose the language Python to do a lot of things that we do at clever programmer because there are tons of programming languages right you have C C++ dadadadada and the list just keeps going on but when I pick something that you can start in and get the hang of easy and then boom just keep going cool if you look up what an average Python developer makes you will find out that an average Python developer makes a hundred and seven thousand dollars a year okay according to indeed.com a Python Django full stack developer Django is just a framework there's nothing fancy it's super simple but it's like a Python programming language specific thing that you're using full stack developer makes over a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year on average and that's the average you can be on the higher end of that thing okay and that's again those are the average numbers now it depends how much time you spend into it and what kind of preparation you're doing but the main thing is that those numbers and those things are possible okay if you don't spend time and you're not good or you don't know how to make yourself stand out obviously you aren't gonna be getting any of those jobs but if you follow the process and you figure out how you can make yourself stand out there's a huge market out there okay and it doesn't require you to have some crazy experience it doesn't require you to have skill like all these years of you know building up your skills it doesn't require you to have degrees and certifications it just requires you to be able to show the other person that you can solve their problem and if you can do it and save them money they have no problem paying you if you are interested what I have done for you is I even put together my personal story of how I was a terrible Oakland community college student okay with a really bad GPA had a 2.0 GPA and with that GPA while going to Oakland Community College I made a hundred and four thousand dollars in one year as a Python freelancer okay and for me when I did that first of all I was like holy crap I'm maybe okay at something for me it was a huge like moment of selfconfidence and boost and I'm capable of actually doing something and I'm capable of actually not only providing for myself because that's just selfish right if you just think about yourself so for me but it's important to be selfish it's important and first you want to have enough for yourself but for me what was important was also to have enough for others around me and that was the big kind of moment I had and I wanted to be able to provide for my family as well and if there was ever my friends who needed help I wanted to be able to dare to support them obviously emotionally you know but also if I could do that financially or in some Enya or any other way so that was a big incentive big why of why I wanted to do something that you know it's great if I loved it but it's also important if I got paid for my time and also it helped me save time so I could spend more of that with friends and family and people that I care about so all of this including my personal story of being Oakton student who went on to make a hundred and four thousand dollars in one year along with your Python earning potential calculator I put that together in my profitable programmer master class that class is absolutely free so if you are here on Facebook on YouTube or Instagram and you're interested Instagram click the link in the bio right now YouTube everybody hi talking to you YouTube click the link in the description ok it'll take you to the master class and once you sign up it'll make sure that you get all of the parts of that training series ok so there are gonna be three parts and I want you to be getting all of them ok and the first one we're gonna talk about your Python potential that includes your potential as a highly paid Python developer and that includes your earning potential and I literally hand you a Python earning calculator that I used to use to calculate how many clients I needed to make how much money every month as a Python freelancer it's all automated so you can go literally plug and chug numbers and when you type them in it tells you how much you could be looking to make weekly based on 10 or 15 hours of work how much you could be looking to make monthly and it automatically calculates all of it for you all you need to do is just go pick how many clients you want and pick what hourly rate do you think you are going to be charging them so for example if you had one client at a very low rate as a Python freelancer average Python freelancer rates are 150 dollars an hour but let's say you don't feel confident in your skills you're a beginner and you're you don't you don't really see yourself charging hundred fifty right now that's okay you can be charging fifty dollars an hour okay there are jobs out there that are the world is filled with Python jobs even look at something like upwork.com and just search Python jobs and you'll find all sources sorts of jobs and if you're charging $50 an hour for a client that comes out to be about and and you're only getting to work ten hours a week with that client that's it okay that comes out to be about $500 income weekly extra that's $2,000 extra per month and that's $24,000 a year extra okay what can you be doing with that money so for monthly if you're making $2,000 extra wouldn't it be great to pay for your Hulu subscriptions and your Netflix subscription subscriptions right your office bills your I don't know taking girls out on dinner dates or going on that fancy dinner date right with your special one if you have a family taking out your kids somewhere taking out your family somewhere all of those extra expenses including your phone bills and all of that is now just covered for and that's cool monthly but I think about yearly with twenty four thousand dollars extra on the side you could be putting that in 401k you could be putting then Charles Schwab you could be literally starting up a new business all right coming up with a startup and now you have that extra cash for that business idea that you want it to do so whether you want to do Python as a side hustle whether you want to do it as a Python fulltime developer or freelancer again all of this and more is in the master class that I've put together for you it's called the profitable programmer master class again it is free and on Instagram it's in the bio on Facebook it's in the descriptions and on YouTube it is in the descriptions go right now click and sign up for it and I'll be reading off the people's names who sign up and if you have signed up come back and just say yes you did it or say you have signed up all right so say it an Instagram hopefully that'll give people the push to sign up and have their lives changed and be able to you'll be able to see your earning potential you'll be able to see what this could mean for you and for your family and you'll be able to see the potential this has to change your life okay and it gives you all the tools for that okay it's a stepbystep system so once you do it you know do let us know and it'll help push everybody else around you I'll create that accountability group cool awesome awesome I'm gonna be keeping an eye out for who's signing up and then I'll open up my systems here and basically what they'll do is they'll tell me who's signing up and then I'll call their beautiful names out cool cool let's refresh here real quick all right we're starting to get some new signups great a meet welcome on board we have as on welcome on board we have willow we have Chuck we have Matthew hi hi hi we have Gareth we have giant we have armor and we have new people coming in this is awesome awesome awesome awesome yeah the new part will be releasing it soon so be on the lookout for that that part is gonna absolutely also blow your mind alright I'm gonna take some questions from you guys and other than that we're gonna be chillin and I'll still be providing massive value to you guys and running and gunning through the questions section somebody says I'm 13 and began coding great great very great yeah it doesn't matter if you're young old how I like to say it is whether you're a high school student or thinking of retiring this class has the power to help you okay even if you don't think you're smart enough because I know that you know I'm not and I've never been academically smart enough and I get by fine at least you know for myself and you can too so somebody asks can you show us some projects that you have done with Python of course in the master class I show you projects that I've worked on in Python and we go in detail I even share with you actually some of the code so all of that stuff is you know available for everybody who reserves their spot for the master class because keep in mind guys I will be taking a master class down it's not gonna be up it's only gonna be up for the next few days and then right now we have released part one we have literally worked on this for so long again if you guys have been following any of our stories on Instagram or snapchat yeah we don't sleep we just work and we have been busting our ass trying to put this together for you guys and it's phenomenal it's absolutely mindblowing we have had the highest engagement rate if we have ever seen on any video ever yeah people really love it I mean even just go there and just look at the comments section it's crazy it's probably like the most comments we've ever had so we got great results but yeah and in that master class you know there's the first one your Python potential and then we're gonna release the second one and in those I also share with you exactly what I did I show you some of the code and I show you what created with it and all kinds of behindthescenes stuff it's hard to show it here cuz again you know I can't like hold a printed sheet of paper I'm on Instagram I'm on Facebook and I'm on YouTube so that's a little bit tougher but yeah we get more into depth so thank you Yasin Omari for your question I'm gonna take another question on YouTube and then I'll jump over onto Instagram and then I'll go over Facebook do we have to learn basic of Python for your upcoming course ah no you don't have to learn any basics this course takes you from zero coding skills maybe you just learn how to turn on your computer and helps start making you progress towards landing your first client and getting that first paycheck in less than 90 days of taking this course okay so from zero coding skills to landing your first client and getting that first paycheck in less than 90 days mmm okay let me go on the gram does your master class teach us how to make a living out of it like earning with Python of course the master class gives you all the whole framework that you need literally you get your earning potential calculator okay you will get a worksheet that helps you look at the specific Python projects you could be doing you get a worksheet that helps you decide whether what kind of Python freelancer lifestyle is right for you so are you gonna be a fulltime developer a freelancer or a side hustler the worksheet helps you decide how this could be helping you and your family okay and then what was the last part of the question yeah and then also in the master class I have some amazing surprises for you guys that I don't want to give away everything but you are gonna be getting some amazing things like man I like don't even want to reveal it but you guys are gonna be getting even a full on portfolio okay so there's a lot of things that are just gonna be given to you that you could literally steal and take away from the master class again all of that stuff is free so guys don't have me spoil anything anymore it hurts my heart with again we've put together a lot of time and effort to build this thing out for you just treat it like a Hollywood movie but for Python developers and upcoming aspiring like freelancers and anybody who wants to take ideas at it then you're in their head and bring it to life while getting paid for it okay so this massive value in here it's absolutely free have nothing to lose click those links in the descriptions and the BIOS click them and sign up alright okay now on Facebook I'm going to answer some questions how many hours everyday should I've spent every day to master the program the layout and the roadmap that I give you only has you spending few hours a week because I realize most people are busy I realize most people actually have lives and maybe friends maybe family or maybe just want to watch a lot of Netflix stuff by themselves that's okay but what I try to give you is that you know I get it you have limited time and not everybody is willing to put in twenty hours a day so this takes a more practical approach and even if you can put in two to three hours a week this can get your results in less than 90 days we have raga land he says I already am a developer fulltime I develop Android apps you think it's gonna help me change my career this program for people who are complete beginners you know again my main program that's gonna be opening up soon okay it's called create apps and land your first clown with Python that program is to help let's say take if you are a complete beginner to teach the coding skills you need to make those practical apps and also to land your client okay so tissues of soft skills to make money but let's say you're a little bit more advanced you can already make apps the value proposition for you in this course is if you have the skills and not the cash you know if you have the chops but not the cash as my mentor likes to say then this course teaches you that ok this course teaches you how to close those deals how to get clients and how to focus on more of that making money aspect and getting a return on your investment that's where this course is gonna be different than a lot of other online courses they're just all about like theory and blah blah let's learn about initializing objects and let's learn about objectoriented programming and let's learn about I don't even know there's just a lot of learning and as Tony Robinson Tony Robbins says you know learning plus $2 will almost get you a Starbucks oh sorry he says understanding plus 2 bucks will almost get you a Starbucks okay so it's food for thought and just understand that while learning is important there are no results and you have nothing to show for it at the end of the date so as you learn you want to make sure that you are earning as you are learning also that you're building practical things along the way so you can always look back and go boom boom boom this is what I've done with my time not oh I spent three months learn and I have nothing to show for it I've made zero dollars and I haven't been able to support myself or my family and my dreams are drying dying and becoming homeless pretty soon that's not a good way to go so make sure that when no matter what it is you're doing in life I don't care if you want to become a guitar instructor or shark hunter whatever it is make sure that you're following a practical path okay a lot of love on Instagram we're getting lots of love you are very welcome you're very welcome Raghu Lester John gambar ganbaru John Nace's says this is gold man thanks for sharing it out I really appreciate it you're most welcome sorry my thumb is really fat hides everything I can't see a question on Facebook so looking for questions on Instagram yeah the only have three lectures guys I mean like just ask like stop being shy this is what screwed me over and how all my years at high school and everything I'm like how much money did you make and your teach play money is a touchy subject right it makes people uncomfortable but at the end of the day while we do want to become great programmers and great coders one of our main desires let's be honest is also to be able to do what we you know the liking part enjoying part in helping other people part is good and we want to do that but we also want to earn not just for ourselves again for our friends maybe our family maybe for our future maybe just to have that security right and sometimes you do have to ask that kind of harsh question sometimes to other people and just go like okay you're teaching me this and you're apparently qualified to teach this class but you know how much money have you earned in the process of you getting higher to teach are you just teaching here because you have a degree in teaching and then you got a master's in teaching and then maybe you got a PhD and then you got tenure and now you just can't be fired and that's the only reason you're kind of teaching this whether it's to online courses or colleges or is it actually you're qualified to teach this you've been making a lot of money you're staying relevant which one is it so it's important to kind of ask that question and learn from people who have you know we're putting money where their mouth is and you want to follow somebody who's led that successful you know path so for example if you guys have other developers nearby you you know let's say you want to become a freelancer and you have other people nearby you who have achieved that you can just follow that path and it would help you okay you can follow that path if you want to become fit you know the work you know the worst advice you can get the most annoying thing is like if you go to a person who is not actually in good shape but they've been reading a lot of books on how to get in good shape and they're gonna talk to you about like caloric surplus and hypertrophy and how many sets you should be doing and how that's gonna have help and affect your convalescence period they're gonna make everything sound like rocket science and their advice is not even gonna help you get results whereas go to somebody who's good and then know how to get you where you need to go in Fitness for example and they have those results there's gonna be like doesn't matter go twice a week make sure you do this this and this at least for one and a half hour done you come back to two weeks later and you have all these amazing results to show for it okay that's the difference between a mentor somebody who's been there and done it and simplified for you versus somebody who is just there because of credentials tenure they couldn't find a job anywhere else you know let's be honest like even at UIC I don't want to say this professors name but I was going to UIC I and I I dropped out of college I realized that I was answering all the coding questions in class I had a higher paying job and more clients and my professors and that there were some students who are using my material in the class to learn and I realized the education system there's some there's some gap there and there and this is what made me realize it so even my professor at UIC he wasn't even a programming professor he was a professor for math who wanted to make some extra cash and this semester he started teaching programming he had zero passion and most of my friends who were in that major were actually quitting and dropping out of that major for me that's like the biggest crime ever you know it's just like you're just trying to do this to make a quick buck and whatnot and so you know again you can find those people they have pet though the ones who have passion the ones who have actually been there and that way you don't quit and things are a lot simpler that's why I hear so many people go coding is so hard and I'm too dumb to grasp it when it's not you I absolutely promise you it's not you anything can be complicated for somebody who doesn't know how to make it simple and just tell you in the simplest ways most things are a lot simpler than this seem you know even if you look at professional players or professional athletes the only thing that makes them elite is how good they are at the basics and what happens when you're going through these courses online week one oh we're just going to do hello world and do this little simple thing and then week two data science machine learning project analyzing sentimental analysis of tweets of different candidates making graphs and make sure that it's a streaming service kind of like Netflix but just your own version then top it off with something else that's insane you know maybe some image recognition and video recognition and add that in and you're like and then you go I'm too dumb but it's not really you right it's just a way that it's kind of taught and again it's not has it doesn't just have to do with college it has to do with in a lot of places how it's hot like that yeah so just make sure that the people you're choosing to follow have gotten the results and have the track record that you're looking for right what what you want and if not if that's not something specifically that you want that's not the person you should be following okay the easiest way to get the result you want is just like follow the person who has it that's it okay going through comments on Facebook guys on Facebook please do not spam chats because there are other people who are trying to actually ask questions so asama I need you to relax because you're spamming it with lots of questions okay and it's unfair to other people so please make it concise one question or hold it because I want to make sure I answer people's real questions okay the course will be starting in a few weeks Fahad in two weeks so keep a lookout for it all right so yeah it's really hard to go all the way up in Facebook so I'm gonna stop for a Facebook I'm gonna look on Instagram questions questions I'm gonna hunt your questions down somebody said Sasebo Sasebo Matt garwal ten says man I'm gonna enjoy butchering your guys's names because my name has been butchered for long enough so time for you guys to get that punishment now but he says hey brother I've gone through code Khadem II and practiced a bit too now should I buy some courses from Udacity slash udemy or your master class course will help me out um again why are you buying courses you know you have to make sure what your end result out of that course is if it's just more learning do it but just be wary of the results you're getting if you're making progress and you're connecting with the whoever's teaching it then obviously buy it it's a no brainer okay especially if you're gonna be getting their return on your investment back okay always always keep that in the mind right keep that in the back of your head let's say that you were looking at some courses on security and the job you're looking at and security pays you $60,000 a year and even if all these courses let's just say they somehow add up to $5,000 in that year of you taking them when you get that first job it takes care of that $5,000 and then you net 55 on top of that so always have that big picture but you don't have to go crazy investing because again I've also seen people who have invested $300,000 and gotten like two or three hundred thousand dollars worth of loans I have actually some close friends who have done that and they're literally in two hundred to three hundred thousand dollars worth of loans okay so certain things are now worth it and they don't really have anything to show for it and it's gonna take a many years to pay it off probably twenty or thirty years so yeah that kind of sucks so keep that in mind you know just make sure that whatever you're doing is like really results focused and is you know you're getting money as you're going along okay it's important to have that happen because otherwise you're gonna spend a lot of time running around in circles what's up Daniel how's it going Daniel Roman and I went to high school together we would sit in um what was it study hall and play a stupid card game oh my god it was so fun yes hilarious I already received I already signed up Stefan Watson says I already signed up for your master course was I supposed to receive a login there's no login you just go for that master class simply go to clever programmer dotcom and he'll send you but be on the lookout for emails because I'm gonna just send you out emails and that's gonna have the links and everything for you and it'll tell you where you need to go so if you've already signed up don't worry just look in your emails keep a close close eye like this that's it yeah alright let me see how many people signed up okay I'm not gonna I don't think I'm gonna bring out the big guns today but if we're not getting many signups you might have to bring out my favorite hat today man I loved his hat my best friend's mom made it when she came from Nepal and yeah she came after so many years we thought she would never come and then she knitted me this and that was awesome now I wear this and I even wore it when we hit hundred thousand dollars um when we hit 100 thousand dollars that we cool but I wore it when we hit hundred k subs on YouTube if you guys remember oh and by the way we had 100k subs on YouTube hell yeah now the next goal is I want to say 1 million but that's a very ambitious goal let's just celebrate 200k when we hit that pretty soon all right I'm gonna put this away this is the big guns if you're here dadadadadadada go down profitable programmer masterclass absolutely free teaches you how you can land your first client in less than 90 days get that allimportant first paycheck with Python okay helps you become a Python freelancer and if you want to become a developer using it Python developer or a side hustler it's perfectly fine for that as well again this profitable programmer in master class is free you have nothing to lose so if you are here stop wasting your time go down click the links in the description sign up ok we got a few more people to sign up that's pretty cool it's pretty cool let me check the situation that's going on and if you're signing up right now and you get my email just respond back something why you signed up and I'll read your response ok to everybody on the live stream kind of why you signed up and give you a shout out pretty cool we have let's see how many people on YouTube we got 176 watching right now on YouTube we have 20 on Instagram that's pretty cool we have 18 on Facebook that's pretty awesome let me see here what's going on with the emails what the emails oh why don't I read you guys I have an idea I'll read you guys the comments that we have gotten on our page for the your Python potential video so the Masterclass a profitable program or masterclass I'm gonna read you guys some of the comments we have on that ok so this is where people have calculated their earning potential the school we have about 300 comments far so we have a lot of PO autumn Ola from Yaba College of Technology it just feels like I made all of that up like literally right now that's what it feels like but it's a pretty cool name and he says that with with the earning potential calculator he will be earning $42,000 annually great we got Pankaj Shah from k iit University and he says my working potential will be minimum four thousand dollars a month so it looks like he's gonna be making about $48,000 extra on in the year we have Vinay Krishna who used the profitable programmer master class to figure out his Python potential and he says that I want to be a fulltime freelancer and I would like to create social media apps with Python and to him a successful being a successful freelancer means he can get clients attractions clients attraction with every bid he please places so meaning he gets clients kind of easily and he says that his Python Python potential is gonna be about $2,000 per month all right now let's read a few of them let's see we have Sheikh Mohammed Amin Ola he's a project coordinator at energy services at Krishi Technologies Private Limited and he says thank you cause II for giving me the opportunity to go through free sessions basically I'm an electrical engineer and completed my master's in power electronics I don't have much knowledge about coding but I want to be a freelancer and web development and data analytics please suggest me the right path he's in the perfect place for this because I talk about web development and I talked about data analytics and I talked about how web development could lead later into data analytics and a lot more in the profitable programmer master clasp okay men hi how are you doing oh sweet we got men yo stand clear you want to get dropped in on this too all right let's see rah GLE he says 12,000 what is that one thing he's saying a hundred and twenty thousand dollars with two clients and he says still I want to be a fulltime developer I already am a developer I develop Android apps I'm not a great quarter though I want to be one I really like your videos in YouTube I found that inspiring great Rawal is also in the right place cool we have Steve Mac he says yes I feel things are gonna be better already I'm starting with $60 per hour for a client and I'm thinking of a 20 hour week with about three clients and he's looking at a yearly income of a hundred and seventy two thousand and eight hundred dollars cool some people just want to make cool

would change my life I care and provide from a sick and elderly parents so this will help me to help them to with previously stressful jobs such as chief of forensics in a war zone or working for the mod gaming got me interested in programming as it was an escape for me at university I studied a bio medical degree specializing in genetics but I never felt confident working with computers back then I never thought I would have the confidence to even look at programming until I saw your videos you have opened so many different worlds for me worlds I never realize existed I'm definitely inspired by you Kazi thank you so much keep up the good work hopefully I will be able to apply some of my previous roles and experience to build something that will make a positive difference to the world if not applying it to medical science or military defence to help save lives I hope at least someday be able to even just provide a game or app that can make people happy or make their lives easier wow that's pretty powerful that's pretty powerful so I mean she says even just provide a game or apt I can help people have be happy or make their lives easier it could be as little as that you know and that would help her achieve her goals and if I can help her with that or you know any support she's getting where she's in the comments section and everything and it that gives her that slight push to start doing this I mean this is something that she would love and like she says I could be changing her life trying to go through some more here dead uh okay we have Jeremy trend off and he's interested in the side hustle portion okay so check out what he says he says I'd love to start off as a side hustler for Python development maybe I could turn this into a job in the future honestly who knows what the future holds being a successful Python freelancer would mean a great deal to me it would give me the confidence to be able to push myself to the next level of my life it also wouldn't hurt to be making a few dollars on the side to help support my daily life as far as my family I believe it would make them quite proud of me the confidence the success success could potentially give me could be a turning point in my life my monthly income goal would be around two thousand dollars a month for the time being my ideal work environment goals would be to charge $50 an
