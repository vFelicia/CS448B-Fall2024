hey guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm welcome back today we're going to do a challenge on Oxford comma challenge so we have done from lowercase up to the journal icing challenge up to here and if you haven't done that no problem just go back to my videos and do those challenges if you're on my website I'll put the links to all the previous challenges we've done so you could take a look at them and if you're on my website again you could code right there on the platform the link is in the description below if you're watching this on YouTube let's continue so we have this challenge and it says and we're going to do this live some again and I want to stress that I'm thinking out loud here with you guys I was about to cheat and look at it before the video so I could prepare myself and then come off really smart but instead what I'm going to do is just do it live so if I'm making mistakes it's okay you see me make the mistakes okay and then we just walk through it and step through it and build things all right I'll make a function comma Phi that given a list of three or more things return a list with commas okay so it could be three things or more things but keep that in mind the list that's given to us is definitely going to be three or more things which means that we don't have to account for two things or one thing or zero things okay that makes your coding life a little bit easier that's why I pay attention instructions sometimes you might do something that you don't even have to do and you might spend a lot of time doing that so if we get if we gave comma Phi the function a list like this trinket learning fun it should return it as trinket comma learning comma space and space fun okay that is very interesting so one thing I'm thinking about already is I could probably call the join function and join it with commas in a space but the problem that happens there is the last one won't have a space so for example here's what I mean if I open up a command line I'll show you what I'm what I'm talking about hello and Apple ok so if I do dot join method on this and run it with a comment of space you see I join it all haha hello Apple haha comma space hello comma space Apple but there's no end here so I'm thinking about how we would go into that now wondering if we directly tap into the list that's given to us get the last element prepend and the word end and a space and then just called a dot join method so here's what I mean if we tap into this exact list right and instead of this just saying Apple we make it and Apple and then we call the dot join method with the comma and a space does that work yeah that that works right haha hello and Apple okay so how would we change the last guy let's figure that out so if I'm given a list to access the last element I do negative one and I will say make this element what this element was and floss space what this element was previously ah so that's an interesting line what the heck does that do so let's do this oh and we shouldn't call things list like that because list is a builtin but whatever shame on you hour of Python all right so what we're going to do is we're going to call this list just list okay and then what I'll do is I'll use this line and then we'll see what happens okay and now we'll call list and looks like it worked okay looks like this line did exactly what we wanted it to do now let's go back here and what we'll do is just call the dot join method on this remember just like we said so now if I call dot join right and I join it by a comma in a space and I called about joint on that list looks like it is doing exactly what we expected it to do now let's do that return like this comment a space okay let's try it out so trinket learning fun should turn into trinket so it should turn into one string that says so it should go from a list of three elements trinket learning fun to a string one string that says trinket comma space learning comma space and space fun let's run it trinket comma space learning comma space and fun boom and to prove to you there's a space there I even highlighted it lions comma space tigers own space and bears beautiful okay so hopefully you saw how we got it to work that's okay if you can figure out on your own but now that you understand it do exactly what I said in the previous video go back to the drawing board and try to come up with a solution yourself a lot of coding challenges I see don't do this right it's one guy behind the screen who's already solved the problem and then they just try to like spit out the solution back at you which is cool I mean you can learn from it but I think it's important to see how you go about coming up with the solution so you know that's what I would do I would open up my command line try out these things see what it means and then go back to my Python scripts and add these things in as I build a project and make it bigger and remember if you want to build those apps like I show you in my old P course or in even my Python learn Python course that's free these are the skills that you need to be able to do those bigger projects so even if you're trying to take my app course you're trying to take any other online course or you're just trying to build apps on your own with Python or whatever you need these fundamental skills so then you can build whatever you want okay because if you don't have these you won't be able to build big apps and you won't be able to even build small apps right you've become really limited with your ability of what you can do if you want to change the world with code you better be able to do some of the stuff from scratch and be able to think about it that's it for this video I hope you liked it
