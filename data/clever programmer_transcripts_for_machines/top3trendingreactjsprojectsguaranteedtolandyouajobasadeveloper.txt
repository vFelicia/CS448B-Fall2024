a live demo link guys so when i when we say live demo link we're talking about a live working demo link so in a lot of the live sessions we actually talk about how you can deploy this using things like firebase um if and even if you've deployed an heroku app that is completely fine but if you we just want to have a live deployed app that we can actually play with so i want you guys to go ahead and include that link over here and then if you guys have like this isn't a mandatory step but if you have included a uh submitted your code to github then push it inside of a github repo and drop us a link here make sure it's accessible as well guys because some people tend to push it but it's a private link so we can't actually see it and if you guys go ahead and click this uh drop down right

and literally go ahead and tag me over oh it's over on this side so go ahead and tag me and cleverkazy and guys we get to see your stories so we actually seen a few of you guys who have built this um and we love that because literally it's a case of we get to start a conversation with you guys and it just means that it's more than just a number that we see okay um see your comments bleeping in okay so uh wait have you got the comments going right now okay nice um let me go ahead and one second let me just make a quick change guys one second so right so if you guys just want to drop any questions that you have before we get started on today's session then we can get started and go from there nice okay so let's go let's have a look at your questions guys see who's in the chat so we have hi i'm from london oh nice someone said sonny do you read those comments i do read the comments guys so if you have any interesting comments and you want to sort of ask any questions be sure to fire them in the comment section and i will hit you up if i see that somebody says arturo says damn you guys are awesome glad to see you there and also guys if anybody here right now is from the uh profit profit with javascript course so our course profile javascript let me know in the section i love to see our own students here and it's so amazing to see that and we can pretty much go from there so ahmed how's it going that's my beautiful girlfriend in the comment section always supporting nice mr mehi thank you very much sunny is awesome okay so guys i think oh and we actually have people from east africa nice i like to see that i love to see that for everyone from around the world okay awesome nice comments okay so guys without further ado let's just jump straight into some value today and let's go ahead and run with this i've got a bunch of things i want to go through today and pretty much the first thing i want to say guys is that if you haven't already got a portfolio what are you doing like you guys need like a portfolio is going to stand you out from the rest of the other developers so most people have a cv or a resume and we've all seen it guys we've all seen let me just get a let me let me get a simple sort of resume that we see that has comes up so we've all seen the typical kind of resume that everyone's talking about something like this right you're gonna have someone that comes up and they've they're going to drop this on the table and guys i'm telling you like i've been in the recruitment side of this where literally you we would look through it and we'll be like right let's see who this person is and guys imagine how many of these gets pushed across the desk every single day when someone's when a company is hiring or recruiting you pretty much again they're going to see this all the time all i can see at this point is just text i mean most of us quite like we wouldn't even like take the time out to sort of read this too much like so but instead if you saw one badass portfolio built in react deployed in firebase even has some redux attached to it then that's going to take my attention so let's go ahead and actually do a quick google search right now and let's go ahead and type in let's go ahead and check react developer portfolios and let's see if i can actually give you guys a live demo of some amazing portfolios that are out there right now um and also i saw a question uh earlier and a really good question actually and that's why like why should we have a portfolio and why like why should we learn react i see that question pop up quite a lot and guys the one thing i will say to you guys is if you are on the fence of learning react here is something which may change your mind so this is the average base salary of a developer guys in the states so a hundred and eighteen thousand dollars just just let that let that sink in for a second guys 118 thousand dollars if that impresses you guys smash the like button because literally in this in these live streams and in these sort of live sessions we're going to take you to points where you can start learning and you can get on your journey to earning that salary guys and it's completely something which is not is not like mindblowing like out of it's something which is not uh unfeasible and it's definitely something which you can you can achieve if you just put the work in um so awesome guys so like we said before we jump in we are going to be talking about apps like netflix like amazon and like the facebook messenger that we built okay and why you need these in your portfolio so without further ado guys let's jump straight in so i'm going to go ahead and open up a whiteboard so that you guys can actually get you guys can actually see a little bit clearer and before uh let's see if there's any interesting questions guys so we have uh elijah says okay this is a good point how many hours should a solid portfolio uh let's go ahead and put this on the background there we go how many hours should a solid portfolio project take and what is an optimal amount of these projects you should have a junior as a junior level so as a junior developer very good question um what i will say to that elijah is that and also i saw you in yesterday's live stream so amazing to see you here again um what i will say to that guys is honestly one there is no uh maximum cap if you can put more hours in put more hours in okay like put the put the time in because it's going to make the difference when it comes to like if if there's 10 developers applying for a job and you really took that love and consideration and put that time and effort into your portfolio that's going to show when it comes to that having that interview and even if your portfolio isn't that powerful guys the stories that you will have to share when you're debugging and doing all of that stuff that's going to actually be something to talk about with the person that's interviewing you and i guarantee that that's where you can relate quite a lot and get on so um what is an optimal amount of these projects to have at junior level honestly guys if you have three amazing amazing uh projects uh just like the ones that we demoed right here so literally like a messenger app and guys let's just quickly go through some of the functionalities on these apps so here we have a realtime database integration so literally we have smooth animation so like wow this actually works guys and also guys if you don't if you don't want to take it take my word for this go ahead and check the comment section right now i've dropped the netflix link so i've dropped the links to these two apps guys the netflix app uh over this one so you can go ahead and play it if i go ahead and click the dark trailer right here it goes ahead and plays a trailer which is awesome right so you'll play the trailer for that one and over here guys you can go ahead and actually check these out right now add a couple of items to your basket you can pretty much go ahead and you can mess around with this guys you can try and break it uh if you go ahead and sign in you can actually create an amazon account and if we leave the fields blank you see it even has some validation and things like that so this all works and you can even sign in and actually signs you into the uh to the thing so we're gonna look a bit more into that but to answer to go back to elijah's question guys three solid projects which demonstrate a variety of skills is going to be really really like honestly especially at a junior level that in my opinion is going to be enough to guarantee you a position at that point three solid projects plus some really good soft skills that is going to be enough to get you in into your first job uh and that is going to be more valuable honesty and guys i say this with absolutely i i don't stress i can't stress this enough yeah that like i came from a background of having a degree and having a masters i can't stress enough if somebody just like if if i could rewind that time and just invest in practical projects like these ones so literally like these kind of apps i literally would have done that and made such an amazing portfolio to demonstrate as opposed to just saying hey i have a degree because literally most developers now would have a degree but you know what the truth is it really doesn't matter anymore about age you're never too young you're never too old to start coding um so yeah like honestly a portfolio in that case three solid apps like the ones i just demonstrated are going to be more than enough guys and we will go into depth as to why um very shortly um so this quick run through of the questions um so let's go ahead and have a look so we have sunny what else do you usually use as a backend system for react besides firebase very good question um you can use node.js you can use any language really as a backend um you can use python as back and you can just java as a backend um but yeah you can pretty much uh you can mix and match when it comes to react react is more of a front end and so the back end can be powered by whatever you want it to be powered by um let's go ahead and say okay but where can we find our first jobs like freelancing websites or look for jobs on companies websites very good question very good question and actually what i would recommend is if you are if anyone is interested in this question we have two videos guys that answer this exact question and we're going to full depth on these videos one is yesterday yesterday's live session with me and nars on how to make um i think what was yesterday's live session go ahead and check it out in in the youtube channel uh yesterday's session we're going to uh we're going to a complete talk about all of this stuff and also last friday me and qazi did a um did a live stream about ways to make money um as a react developer so we actually broke this down completely i even shared my backstory as to how i became a developer so if any of you guys are interested in that definitely go ahead and go and give that a check and go and see what that is about and um yeah if you if you're asking this question i guarantee you'll find that pretty useful so be sure to check that out you hack nice uh okay so guys let's jump straight in because uh let's just go ahead and let's just give some more value here so uh so what i'm going to tell you guys is that the reason why you want a portfolio like this and the reason why you want a portfolio that demonstrates things like this um well let's go ahead and put this page up because that's a little bit nicer the reason why you want this guys is because it does all of the talking for you right it tells and like a senior developer or the person hiring you it tells them that this is my skill set and here is proof like rather than me telling you i could sit here and tell you that i can do this i can do that i can do this but you know what the minute you guys believed me was when i started to actually code and i started to show you and i started to actually present like all of these projects and things like that then you actually trusted that i could that i could actually um code in react right so it's the same with uh it's the same with an employer or a freelancing client or somebody that you're about to teach you have to earn their trust and you earn their trust the minute they start seeing apps like this and they're like whoa like that's actually is that the real netflix or is that like the fake one or like is that your clone and when you start showing like dynamic apps like this like and guys this is all people who were in the last live stream and they went ahead and just jumped onto this and everything just popped through here and just to show you guys how dynamic this really is if i was to open this up in another tab so let's go ahead and do that right now let's go ahead and do this right now so you can say and let's just say i was quasi at this point and it says welcome kazi and i was like yo sonny look at this guys you see that it's a realtime messaging app right now so like if you can sit there with an employer and show them this this will like guys at this point they're going to be like what the what what is going on like they're going to be like how did you build that it's gonna spark a conversation right and that's gonna get them interested and it's gonna show them like that you have actually got the skills to build something like this and pull it off right nice we should have a lot of people coming in now okay awesome so um yeah guys so what we want to talk about is pretty much like how these kind of projects can actually demonstrate your skill set and do all of the speaking for you like guys nobody wants to sit there and talk about like or listing out and guys that's my main thing okay like so let's actually go ahead and pull up a whiteboard right now so one thing i absolutely hated right is that when i would uh i would interview somebody applying for a job okay so i was actually working at a staff company i was interviewing people that were coming in for jobs so junior developers they would come in to the position and then they would do the following right so i don't know if you guys if you guys can see this let me know um in the comment section and i will because my screen completely goes white when i do this so i i used to see this right they would come in and they would list out a bunch of things right so they would list out they would just simply do the following let me go ahead and make this a little bit bigger guys so they would do this and this is something that you don't want to do so things you oops okay let's do let's go ahead and just say things you do not want to do in an interview okay and this is like in an interview or like when or in your interview or a portfolio so in an interview or port folio okay things you do not want to do in a portfolio and then guys it's just things that they're just like those those things you just you stay away from them okay don't do it so the first one i'm gonna say is pretty much a case of do not list so don't list out skills okay we see everyone does it i guarantee some of us right now have a portfolio somewhere where like we have a bunch of skills where it says hey i know how to use react i know how to use redux i know how to use flexbox i know how to use this and that guys don't do it because honestly like everyone does it and you need to be able to stand out from the crowd and this is going to be something which like it's not it's going to do a lot more damage than as opposed to what you think it's going to be doing another thing i would say is don't do is do not simply copy code okay the reason why i say this guys this is very important this one don't just simply copy code when you start copying code guys it becomes a yes okay look you might have a portfolio of like 10 different apps but one it's so easy especially like a medium or senior developer when they look at that so easy to quickly distinguish because all i would do at that point is i would just start throwing a sort of technical question i'll say okay like how did you approach how did you approach the database in the end that and then pretty much you would start to notice the cracks very quickly so you're better off having three apps so just three apps that you know extremely well rather than having a bunch of apps that you uh that you don't really know much about okay so don't list out skills do not simply copy code and guys this is my number one advice like uh honestly and it's even in an interview or if you're learning from somebody ask actually no that's that's something you should do um don't stay quiet this is my own little feedback and this one's a bit controversial guys don't stay quiet and what i mean by this i'm saying just ask questions this doesn't mean like whenever you're in an interview or like if you're in a reddit or a any kind of community guys speak up and the reason why i say this is because in interviews in portfolio like in portfolios i see too many like very like quiet and they want to keep everything like very neat and concise and the thing is guys you need to just you need to show your skill set you need to be able to ask the questions and not be afraid to ask the things that people are going to be typically afraid of so with that said guys the main two that i want to focus on right now is do not oops let's go ahead and do this so do what is that okay so let's go ahead and do not list out skills okay like do not do it okay i don't want to see like a list where you've got like uh okay so i know how to use a react so let's go ahead and do react so that's on my list now and i know how to use like redux and that's on my list now like stop doing that do not do that guys like just big no no okay and literally and this one do not simply copy code because literally this is the easiest thing this is by far the easiest thing to spot so definitely don't do that and guys just always ask questions always ask questions it's going to get you ahead don't stay quiet and i mean like do not stay quiet even inside your portfolio make that thing beautiful make that thing stand out make that thing look like it's just screaming that you want the job that you are proud of what you have built i see too many things like template portfolios and templates or cvs and guys just it just doesn't make you stand out from the rest of the crowd so with that said let's jump back into the code so guys if you guys are enjoying this so far as well please please please just feel free to smash the thumbs up button and let us know if this is actually useful to you guys and you guys are finding this helpful right now because that will help us figure out if we should keep doing this you know like i can a lot of you guys are showing us that you love this and that you're enjoying these live sessions so i want to see guys smash the thumbs up button it will help the video reach more people and it will help them actually sort of help this video be beneficial to more people and hopefully we can help as many people as we possibly can so let's go ahead and have a look at some questions um right now so i have completed projects but is it okay to use a template for my portfolio website good question um so yeah there is not like i said guys there's actually there's nothing wrong with using a portfolio a template for your portfolio website but you want to kind of steer away from it like it's just straight off the bat looking like a uh like a template because the problem is guys it's like a resume right like we looked at a resume earlier and look look at this guys if you saw a resume like this right now this is the same thing it doesn't matter if it's a piece of paper or website that we've all seen this before we've all seen this before and the minute you see it guys i mean this doesn't like spark any sort of like fireworks off in my head when i see this i'm just kind of like um this person is just another kind of average joe you know like they're not going to be the person that's going to deserve a salary like 118 000 a year right so you really really i would recommend that there's nothing wrong with starting off with a template a template is better than having no uh a portfolio so i would definitely start if it means getting a template's gonna help you get started then i would definitely go ahead and do that but definitely try to make that thing look as custom as personalized as possible okay and really really try and harness your skill set so that you're able to do that now let's go ahead and check some more so um i just saw a really good question but it just slipped my uh my screen so let's see i have created to do a netflix con and amazon clone as well from your live stream thank you guys oh amazing amazing to see that ashish um nice i love to see when you guys are actually following these live streams day to day so if you're enjoying that yeah smash the thumbs up button and let us know um thanks for answers sunny you are true legend thank you so much how can we build a good website okay this is a good question how can we build a good website without backend development so i'm gonna answer this in one simple way guys so the question here is how can we build a website without back in development do you know a secret guys these three websites right here so we have the messenger app we have the netflix app and we have the amazon app when you use firebase guys little little tip for you guys you actually don't need to do much backend development so this is like literally in these projects when i we didn't actually do any backend development really like this was all front end everything was react it was all front end um when you have things like amazon now you're probably wondering yeah but like sunny how did you handle the authentication like how am i going to create an account here guys check this out if i just go ahead and create a dummy account so let's just go ahead sony dummy gmail.com maybe and then go ahead and create your amazon account boom look at that hello and it signed me in and i'm already inside my account i can carry on using the app everything seems to work and it's all good right now guys and look guys notice how the navbar actually sticks to the top if you want to know that go check that video out um yeah so notice how guys this was all react.js so this was all frontend development okay and the beauty here and this is why like i really really am trying to push this in these calls is that when you start using firebase so firebase for many of you guys who don't know what firebase is is a suite of tools by google and i'm going to go through that in a second and sort of give you a demonstration as to what you can do with it and basically in firebase guys you have access to a bunch of useful things so you have authentication you have databases you have storage you have hosting like hosting so that's the that's literally how i've hosted the websites that you guys are looking at on the screen right now um storage if you guys didn't check it out before we also made a net an instagram app so that's literally an example of where we use this we have the realtime database so when you guys saw the todo app so um not the todo yeah the todo app or the messenger app that was using the realtime database in firebase and to handle the authentication that i just demonstrated right here so even when i click sign out guys watch this it doesn't even refresh that's how good react is look boom dynamic no refreshing no nothing and literally that just used the authentication on firebase and guys it worked it got everything set up and guys look at this you can even do machine learning so if you're able to demonstrate this let's go ahead and zoom in if you're able to demonstrate this um that you can use all of these skills then it's going to make you stand out okay so that's why i would recommend um yeah so to answer your question um you don't actually need to know a lot of backend development so i would actually for those of you who are wondering on like should i go into backhand should i go into frontend what should i really do sunny like focus on one area guys and if my my honest advice would be to focus on frontend development if you're new to development because it's fun it's quirky you can build cool websites um like the ones i've shown here you can build these kind of sites and get them up and running and um yeah you're going to get a lot more sort of immediate of a immediate response when you demonstrate these things as opposed to showing a little like a massive kind of algorithm that you wrote and then it just logs out a little line of code at the end i mean what are you going to find more interesting looking at an app like this or like a little console log at the end so that's why i would definitely go ahead with this so let's have a look um okay so it's freelancing a good start i will answer those questions i'm going to save those ones to the end i think right now let's actually carry on with the um the reason so there's three trending react projects and for those of you who are new so i can see we've actually got 100 more people that have joined the live stream today we are talking about the top three trending react js projects uh guaranteed to land you a job as a developer right so the why you should definitely have if you don't already have these have these three projects in your portfolio right now to maximize your chance and guarantee a position as a junior developer and i can i can vouch for that guys like if you have these three things and by the three projects we mean we have the netflix app we have the messenger app and we have the amazon clone um and yes guys if you guys are i've never seen this before this is actually an app we built in a live in a live call previously so go ahead and check that out um awesome yeah so guys feel free um so we've just dropped a comment here so feel free to drop any valuable questions that you want and i will be i'll be picking them up as we can um and also guys if you have recommendations for what you want to build then i'm just going to repeat what we what i mentioned earlier we are actually dropping personalized video feedback on every single person's project guys so i don't say that lightly i mean it like i'm not joking if you create a react project that you're proud of if you create one of these projects that we talked about in the previous live course if you've created this or you've got some other kind of project that you just want to show off to us and you want to show off and you want to get some video feedback guys for absolutely free okay like free there is no charge here if you go ahead and click the link in the description right now and you fill out the following form so if you click the link in the description you're going to go ahead and see this form you can go ahead and submit your coding project or your portfolio and we will give you personalized video feedback so yes me qazi a member of the team will literally give you guys personalized video feedback and all we have are some simple requirements guys please please please please please make sure your project is completed to the best of your ability so i don't want any like if you're going to do this halfhearted guys this takes a lot of time out of um for us to go ahead and that go through your videos go through your code bases all we ask is that if we can offer this for free for as many people as we can you just make sure that you submit things which you put your solid heart and effort into uh so that we can give you our uh your we can provide you guys the most value um so let's go ahead and have a look so yeah what i want you guys to do is just pop in your name your email address the title of the project upload screenshots guys and if you haven't already um when you are building your projects shoot an instagram story guys so shoot an instagram grab your phone shoot an instagram story if you're watching this right now pull out your phone i'd love to see who's watching this right now um and you can just tag us so just just tag tag me over here and cleverkazy uh and yeah let us know that you're watching because we love to start a conversation and do you know how many guys guys and girls i've been talking to from the live streams it's it's insane i love speaking to you guys um drop a live demo link so please deploy your app so we can actually play with it um and then yeah if you push the code in the github repo be sure to actually go ahead and uh drop the links in the appropriate boxes and we will get back to you with some personalized video feedback so yeah guys massive value drop over here so literally just go ahead and head into the the link in the description click that and make sure you guys get back and we will actually literally i'm not joking like i think it's going to blow your minds when you start getting that video feedback because we can actually really start to help you out so somebody asked on facebook it doesn't actually show the name but it says please where can i start as a first beginner very good question um i'd love to see who that was but for some reason facebook isn't showing us who that is so guys uh literally if you are new to coding and you want to get involved in it i'm going to quickly explain something before we actually carry on so the first thing i'm going to talk about is if you are new to coding guys what we cover in these talks right now is web development okay we cover web development and basically what we have in web development is it's very simple guys okay we have so i'm just going to put up a whiteboard here we have html okay so we have html so that's the one fundamental we have html we have css and we have javascript okay so we have html we have css and we have javascript now javascript so html is literally what you're going to have on the web page so it's going to be ever this is like the web page and then html is literally everything you see on the web page that is like how it's laid out how where you put an image how things are laid out but html by itself is ugly guys okay it looks like ugly i mean by itself it's not very pretty so we need some css css is how we make things look beautiful guys it's how we get apps looking really pretty it's how we get netflix looking like netflix it's how we pretty much got this app over here looking like the way it does right so that's um pretty much where we get that from now that is where css comes in so that's where you add a style sheet to your app but if we're just these two we have a very like kind of like a dumb application i like to call it and that is where javascript comes in guys so javascript is essentially the brains okay so it's where it's where the light bulb kicks in okay and this is literally where you're gonna have uh all of your clever stuff happening guys so everything that you see that happens clever for example even how i'm drawing on this page right now um is a is built is running on javascript right now so everything that you do which involves any kind of interaction or any sort of thing fancy how you guys are watching the live stream right now is through javascript okay now all of this so this is where react comes in so these three things are very very powerful okay but they have limitations you can only do so much with it so what the guys over at facebook did is they kind of grabbed this and they wrapped it in something uh in a lot and they used a they created a library called react okay many of you guys know it as react js so react js okay and now what this allows you to do is it allows you to build a very powerful single page app so we know them as spa apps okay so single page apps and guys this is where the money comes in okay so single page apps are extremely powerful and just to give you some examples of some apps so we have the likes of um so we have instagram so we have instagram we have tinder we have uber all of these apps guys uh use use react behind them and and they power them if you are on facebook so those of you watching on facebook know that facebook created reacts so they actually just recently rewrote the entire facebook code base in react okay somebody asked a good question so yeah so let's go ahead and finish this question first so please where can i start as a first beginner so just so you know that the reason why i was demonstrating that guys is that this is where you're gonna start as a beginner right i would recommend that you essentially focus on learning um oops let's go ahead and get rid of that so this you wanna focus on learning these things okay so you want to focus on learning um oops let's go ahead and undo that so you're going to focus on learning html you want to focus on learning css and you want to focus on learning javascript okay so these three things are where you need to be putting your time in so there are plenty of tutorials online um there are plenty of resources online i would use w3 school stack overflow those sort of things but you're only going to go so far right so you're going to hit an eventual sort of position where like you're like ah i'm kind of in tutorial hell and i don't really know where to go and then you're going to look at react and you're just going to be scared to start react okay and now we've all run into this problem okay and this is something which is it's not you shouldn't be shy of this happens to everyone and what i will recommend guys is that you join a community okay so uh oh wow and actually so we had prince glaives had a home i learned a lot from that explanation a beginner understood it amazing glad i could provide some value to you um and if you did like it then smash thumbs up button and i will be happy to drop more of those explanations but guys like i said so you have those as your essential foundations right but what i would recommend is that journey gets very very quickly intimidating it gets scary it gets very sort of disheartening when things don't go our way so what i would recommend is you join some kind of community and guys you're in luck we actually have an amazing community where i am part of the team over at clever um i am part of that team and i teach over at that team so we have me we have kazi we have nars we have jacob and guys that is over at clever programmer and we have an amazing course called profit with javascript guys and what we do here is we is completely beginner friendly so guys when i say it's beginner friendly i mean it is completely you don't you need zero coding experience so zero coding experience is needed if you're going to join this course so xero coding experience is needed you can literally join this course and just get started so we are beginner friendly completely beginner friendly guys there are 15 javascript modules that you can get started on straight away and guys this is where we get different okay so yes you probably have seen this you've probably seen like uh udemy courses that have like you know 15 courses or a bunch of courses but what makes us different guys what makes us different from everyone else and what why should you even consider joining a community like profit with javascript so the reason why i really think it will change your life by joining a community profit with javascript is because guys we have success coaches we have people who will give you their time and their dedication and they will give you personalized video feedback on not just one assignment guys on every single assignment like i'm not sure every single assignment that you submit in um profit with javascript you can get personalized video feedback and we have weekly live coaching calls guys so this is where literally you can work alongside me so i hold every tuesday i have a live coaching goal which is all about react and it's all about how you can maximize your efforts and how you can build an income and that leads me to our next point guys here we have how we basically don't just teach you how to actually learn all of the basics of web development but we also go into depth as to how you can actually go ahead and earn some and a killing with javascript so you can actually make a ton of money with javascript and we're going to teach you exactly how to do that so you have the modules where you can go at your own pace and you have the weekly coaching calls and we have up to four weekly coaching calls right now guys as well as these lives so if that's exciting then let me know in the comments right and we also have an exclusive slack community where you can reach out with me with nars with kazi with everybody so if you are a beginner and you do you find that you don't really know where to go then be sure to check out um the course is we have dropped a link in the description and you can go ahead and check that out and guys we do come with a 30 day money back guarantee so if you find that you are pretty much you know if on the 29th day you find it doesn't work out for you or it's not what you thought it was then literally guys you can pretty much you can cancel at that point you get all your money back so if you're a beginner then there's there's literally nothing uh that you can lose at that point um okay so for those of you asking about uh how much is and things like that just go ahead and click in the link in the description guys there's a link in the description which will take you to the page i just showed and you can go ahead and check out the course for yourself okay um so there we go okay so guys let's jump into why you should need to know these three trending or react js projects okay so the first project that we spoke about so i'm going to draw a list of things i think that's the way we're going to do this right i'm going to draw a list of different topics that i think as a react developer you need to have and if you have all of this so guys i'm gonna draw a list for you guys and i want you guys to take a screenshot of this list if once we've done it okay because this list is going to be the the thing that you're going to need to slowly check off and if you guys can do this and then you can build these apps these apps that i've showed you so the netflix app the amazon app the facebook messenger app they are going to basically demonstrate that you have these skills and this is what people look for guys this is what everyone will look for and this is what pretty much is going to allow you to land at that position as a javascript developer so let's go ahead and let's go ahead and list out those skills so first up we have um we have let's go ahead and check so yeah we have react.js okay so we all know about react so we've got react js so obviously it's a given it's the first one there we need to know it guys we need to know how to code and react okay the second one that we have is going to be um something that i would recommend you all learn is something within regarding css and that is flexbox guys flexbox is going to be massive and the reason why flexbox is so useful is because guys it's just going to allow you to build responsive websites okay so like we're talking websites that look like this so notice how when i resize this website do you see that guys it completely works in the way that i need it to work it's completely doing what it needs to do like nothing's breaking at this point right so if i go ahead and inspect this as a phone you guys can pretty much see like when it's in the tablet view look at that like look at the experience that you're getting there guys it doesn't break it doesn't freak out if anything look we've got this scrollable carousel at the bottom here and we've got this beautiful looking notice guys look at that as i scroll down how lovely is that transition at the top look at that like that smooth silky transition and like we can scroll through this everything's so nice and clean if i go ahead and click this link you see we get a drop down video and it just plays the video and we've got a live thing playing that so guys this is what we call responsive design okay and a lot of websites you will see this um in for example even here you can see as everything gets smaller it doesn't break guys it just simply restarts okay it restyles and it works accordingly and even here guys if we go ahead and inspect same deal right so that the app doesn't freak out it doesn't break but it just works really nicely so flexbox is going to allow you to be able to do these things okay so this is something that you really should get invest some time into so css in particular flexbox the next one is going to be something called the react so there's two things here guys there's the react context api okay now many of you guys who haven't actually used react so firstly i just want to kind of run through these points react is what is powering all of the these apps guys so all of the apps i've demonstrated so these three apps react is powering everything here so it's obviously going to be the number one skill that we have css flexbox allows us to have responsive designs and the third one is the react context api now for many of you who don't know what that is you may have also heard of something called redux okay now redux is simply going to redux is oh let's go ahead and do this now redux is so this right here is going to probably be one of the most valuable things you could learn to actually guarantee landing a job as a developer now what is the react context api okay so what is it and or what is redux so firstly i would recommend out of these two if you have heard of redux i would recommend that you actually go ahead and learn first learn the react context api and then you go ahead and learn redux because guys redux has a much sort of higher learning learning curve so react context api is actually going to be something which you can pick up relatively easily okay so it's relatively easy to pick it up once you actually understand what's going on and how it works and we actually have a tutorial of this in the amazon live build so you can go ahead and check that out and we pretty much show how all of that works now in redux is a it's a bit of a steeper learning curve okay so redux is something which is much harder so at this point my little hack for you guys is that if you can demonstrate that you know how to use the react context api then guys you can pretty much trick your way into a job because like at this point the react context api is so much easier to implement than redux and and you can pretty much demonstrate that because guys both of these things react context api and redux use the same patterns okay so if anyone's used that please let me know in the comment section i would love to see that um somebody just dropped a a very useful thing here they said learn grid and flexbox flexbox is great for onedimensional changes uh grid is better for better page layout amazing uh comment right there guys very very good point so let's go ahead and add that to the the sort of uh the list of things so flexbox and css grid okay they are two very very important things guys so really good comment actually steve mccarty thank you for sharing that um bootstrap as well guys bootstrap's really good now when it comes to landing a job honestly i would really recommend you learn these two things so you actually focus and put more time into flexbox and grid css grid because guys these two are going to be what actually allow you to go ahead and build custom websites now when you know flexbox uh well when you know i'm sorry bootstrap most of the time i find that i fight with boot traps so i've kind of stopped using it as much right um so steve mccarthy oh actually dropped another thing so he said so steve mccarthy is actually a cto i believe i saw a comment earlier so guys this is a really this is a comment from somebody who's actually in the industry and stuff he goes you can just use context we never use redux and that's a very fair point guys i've actually stopped using redux in a lot of my uh my my own projects because it's just so heavy like there's no need to have such a heavy sort of addon into react um and so i actually try and use uh i keep it very lightweight with the react context api um so let's go ahead and have a look um somebody actually asked okay so i will go into that question afterwards but somebody asked what the difference is between react and react native and if anyone else wants to know that drop a comment because that's actually a very good question and we will come to that in a second okay um so uh yeah so what i'm gonna do now is go ahead and carry on guys so there's a few more things okay so authentication so authentication is something that's pretty huge guys it's pretty huge for one simple reason we need it everywhere okay so authentication now when i'm talking about authentication i'm talking about yes like you saw earlier guys logging into systems okay so like here i had sunny dummy gmail.com gmail.com oh god what's going on gmail.com and here i do abc and we sign in and look you can see it signed me in so that is an actual completely built authentication system guys and the way i did that is i learned how to use something called firebase authentication so over here we have firebase authentication and what they allow you to do in firebase and we teach this in the live live streams and in the uh profit with javascript course which uh remember guys link in the bio if you are interested in joining us i teach this every single week in the react coaching course but what you can do with uh firebase authentication is you can actually go ahead and click sign in method and guys what's amazing is for those of you who haven't actually gone ahead and implemented a authentication system before it's a nightmare it's actually quite a big headache to get that done but firebase make it so effortless guys like not only do you get email and password registration get phone login you get google login you get facebook twitter github microsoft apple and even anonymous authentication which is amazing and also you can authorize just the domains that you want so that you can sort of protect your app if anyone's worried about security and guys they even go a step further so you know those things like when you forget your password and those sort of things right you can even have it's all built in so you can actually just modify the template here and you would literally just click on this link and this link would just take you so i'm going to go ahead and open that look oh okay that one's not deployed so it's not going to work but it's going to actually allow you to go ahead and just follow that link and reset your password if you were to implement that functionality in the website so all of this stuff guys is actually really really like it is it's gamechanging like i'm not joking when i say this it's game changing and whenever we sort of live demo this and we show people this the the sort of learning curve to this stuff is actually not that high but the the output and what you end up building like honestly like the fact that you can build this and you can have a database and you can have the react context api so again remember we spoke about the react context api this app right here is using it guys so i'll go into that in a second but just want to wrap up on that final comment as to around the authentication so like even if right now if i was to let's just go ahead and uh zoom in so you can see over here we've got sunny so as soon as i sign up guys if i click this this will actually deauthenticate me and sign me out and you see that there was no refresh it was everything was very quick and sweet now you can already start to see what i'm trying to go with here right so we have some authentication but like guys i remember i said earlier don't list out your traits right and the reason why i say don't list out your traits is because it's literally a case of if you can go ahead and show apps like this if you can go ahead and just look if i can if you could just give someone a link and say go ahead and by the way guys if you actually want to check this out for yourself the links for these apps are in the description so if you don't believe me and you think these are fake then just go ahead and check them out okay so um yeah what i want you guys to go and do is go check it out and yeah like if you had an employer and you said like he's like oh have you ever used an authentication system you could be like sure let me actually pull up my app right now and show you so you can go here sign in boom you can show them that you have complete authentication and guys even check this out right so look what i'm about to do right now so say that i have an email address right here so gmail.com and say like my password is too short and i try and click create an account password should be at least six characters that's all powered by firebase guys which is insane right and we actually go through this on the live demonstration previously so you guys can go ahead and check that out if you find that useful so the authentication is a big big big important topic that you guys will need to learn okay now the next one that i want to brush over is uh hosting okay so hosting so hosting so a lot of people i tend to see have uh applications they sort of have things built um but they tend to basically so when i say okay like perfect can you show me then what i tend to see is they would actually go ahead and be like yeah here's my github link just clone it just do npm start and just run it and you're like oh man like and then what would happen is you usually run into some kind of environment variable setup and guys like you just need to be able to show the app as easy as possible like right now if any of you guys go ahead and like click that link you can go and check this out yourself like and this is what i'm saying like not only are they going to be able to see what you have built right they're going to be able to go ahead and see what you've built but as soon as they look at this app they can see like straight away like remember those topics that we spoke about earlier oops we spoke about earlier so we had css flexbox and grid right straight away they can see here you've got some flexbox going on okay wow like this guy knows how to use flexbox then you can be like the react context api you can look sure this uses the right context api for those of you who don't know what that is uh essentially it's basically like a data layer okay so like for example i have the basket over at this side and the basket is a completely separate component to the uh home page so right here so if i go ahead and add a few things to my basket and add a few things over here you see i have access to it over here so essentially we're pushing things into that data layer and then i can actually manipulate them by using uh dispatching things called actions and notice when i remove the final one look what happens whoa you have no items in your basket and actually you see that subtotal at the side so if i go ahead and add a few more items you can see this look at that subtotal and actually tally's the upside guys so notice the price right here if i deduct 239 i should have 11.96 here i know i wasn't working out i just looked at the price so if we go ahead and do that i can see look pay attention to this over here so boom and look at that you see it updated the price right over here and everything worked in real time so now just from that um demo you can pretty much demonstrate that you know how to use the react context api okay and not only that authentication we spoke about you can pretty much demo this and you can then again talk about how you have authentication and you can use it and guys all of this is hosted right so we teach you how to do that so if you literally are unsure about oh you want you're interested in knowing how we do that check out the live sessions or if you're really interested want to go in depth pwj guys profit with javascript link is in the description and you can go ahead and join us and i will literally personally jump on a call with you right after this and we can pretty much have a chat and we can talk about how to do that and that's not a joke guys i will literally physically jump on a call with you guys and go ahead and and and if i get enough people we can start building something right so that's what literally i'm promising to you guys so let's go ahead and carry on so we have firebase hosting um so yeah uh just to give you guys a demonstration if you go into firebase hosting you can actually see over here you have like a bunch of deployments where i pushed the app out and guys i said it's so powerful because like say for example i deployed the app and something went crazy wrong and i broke everything i could just go here click this button and click roll back oh some of you guys might be able to see that but if i click this row back that will literally just undo all the changes okay it will undo the changes and literally it will save the day so these are really valuable skills okay and you kind of start to see like um okay so steve mccarthy says change the basket in the amazon applicator for multiples of the same item yes very good point so i will just put that here it's a really good point steve we can actually include a part two so if you guys are interested in seeing a part two for this and where we actually sort of gather so that what steve's saying is if we had like several of these books inside of the basket so they grouped some together so it would actually say six or like five books as opposed to having like just like um them stack on top of each other if you want to know about that or even how we can have like a checkout and a payment system then let us know in the comments and actually just like guys remember i tell you what right now guys if you want to see a part two of either the netflix clone so even the netflix clone so you want us to go a bit more in depth into this stuff so if you're going to go a bit more in depth into this or if you want to go a bit more in depth into the amazon app then let me know by literally grabbing your phone shooting a story tag me in it so my tag is right here where is it okay it's so hard to do this okay so yeah up here tag me in it and let me know because and just literally write like we want part two that's all i want right we want part two and that's it guys all i need to hear is we need it we want part two and i'm gonna build that for you guys and i'm gonna go ahead and build it free on youtube live and literally we can go ahead and get that running and up and running okay so if you guys find that and you if that guy's if that excites you guys drop some fire in in the chat and hit the smash smash the thumbs up button and i will be happy to go ahead and build that kind of stuff for you so let's carry on guys the next one that many of us know and love is something like this it goes something like this is databases okay now the one database that we all may have heard of is sql you've got nosql databases and the example of nosql database is something like mongodb and this is where you'll start to hear words like man stack okay now these are great okay but i highly recommend you just go ahead and learn firebase and in particular what i'm talking about is firebase firestore now why am i telling you to learn this because it allows you to have such a powerful app with such little setup guys now i'm not joking it's such a powerful app with very little setup so this right here the learning curve to this is extremely easy once you get it it's extremely easy and it's so powerful guys like this is so powerful it's insane like let's go ahead and look at the app that we spoke about um earlier so let's go ahead and look at the app that we spoke about earlier um so we've got this so let's go ahead and check this out so over here if we go type message and press this so if i go ahead and do this so i say like um yo hello guys right now notice how guys this is all in a db right now so if i go ahead and do this yo hello guys look at that it was real time right so that was a real time uh like real time we pushed it into database and it updated right so i can see loads of comments flooding in right now part two netflix oh yeah let's do this um let's have products from the database yes we can definitely do that awesome we can definitely do that guys um so what i would like to yeah so we pretty much have in this case um we didn't use a db for the netflix build for here we could definitely upgrade this to have products in the ndb here guys we actually used apis so that leads me onto my next point so um i will come back to the database point but like here right now is using how to use an api how to use an api now for those of you who don't know what an api is an api is pretty much it's called an application programming interface now do we care what what that means honestly like like no we don't really need to know exactly what that means but all we need to know is that when you have one service guys it's like let's say for example i had um so the way i pulled those films in so the way i pulled all of these films in was is was on a service called tmdb okay so we had tmdb so tmdb and this was a movie database okay now they had something called an api which allowed act with all of the data that they have and basically what i was able to do is pull that in and you see like i didn't manually enter any of this stuff like i just pulled this in from an api and i rendered it on my front end and pretty much look at notice the top right here if i refresh this guys look at this like um so that in that time it stayed the same but if i refresh it again look we've got a new top it's dynamic okay it's pulling from that api and here we have star wars and the clone wars and like you can see like guys it's pulling it dynamically and you can pretty much see um you can pretty much see the information being refreshed in real time and it's going to be pulling from that api bringing it in and it shows that you can use an api so guys that's what i'm saying here can you start to see where this is pulling together right so like here we have this is a going to be a completely like a massively valuable skill to learn right here and how to use an api because payment systems like stripe like like uh paypal all of these systems guys they require you to actually interact with their api so knowing how to use an api is going to be massively valuable um so somebody says can we build a large application with firebase yes we can definitely we can and actually we've already built a fair amount of applications with it so the netflix app was built with firebase the um amazon app was built with firebase so we had well these are all being hosted on firebase right now this app was actually had a firebase database inside of it so of course to answer your question yes we can um and if you guys have any ideas again shoot a story tag me in it over here and if you guys aren't following give me a follow because i do like to post a bit of content about all of this stuff and also if you want to keep in touch or you want some support or help then yep i would be happy to have chat with you guys um let's go ahead and check so now we had we talked about apis um i think let's go ahead and have a second look at the um so let's go ahead and double check over at this because this is actually a really interesting important point guys databases okay now databases why are they so important like why why do we need a database because in react what tends to happen guys is no it's what happens there okay so when you're on the amazon website typically when you add things to your database let's say i go ahead and add some items here and i go ahead and i add i need a new mixer i need actually i want an amazon echo i'm going to go ahead and grab a ipad pro okay so i go ahead and grab that click the checkout button so i've got i'm gonna delete that so i just got a few things here right now what happens is that even though this is using the react context api right now it's a case of right now it's a case of if i refresh the page react has nonpersistent right the react has nonpersistent um it has nonpersistent memory which means look what happens when i refresh guys look what happens it disappears okay disappears so we do we really really do need oh that's a really nice question somebody just asked so i'm gonna actually pin that right now and i will get to that in a sec um so guys we do need databases because um you see like this information like one i'd like to have this information in the database like right now all of this stuff is essentially stored in a database but we're pulling it from an api okay but for example these messages when you're in a messenger app like for example whatsapp you don't go into your phone and your messages are suddenly disappeared right you need to keep those messages you need to have them so knowing how to use databases is massively valuable and i would recommend that each of you guys go ahead and just sign up to firebase it's completely free click the database tab and start messing around with firestore so here you would just go here create database start in test mode and that will actually allow you to to sort of go into it and you don't need to do the production mode just yet guys click next and you can pretty much go through this and set up your first sort of database instance and guys here you can see it's a realtime database powerful queries and automatic scaling which means that no matter what if 10 billion people went on to this app it's going to work and it's going to scale because guys you have the power of google with this stuff now a lot of people might be wondering yeah but man stack merch what about mongodb what about express and things like that and this leads me on to uh this question oops i actually had two things pinned up so this leads me on to this question right here so guys what's your take on cloud functions by firebase so zacky very very good question okay it's a really really good question and actually this is something that i'm going to go ahead and add because it's so amazing that you've said that so let me go ahead and i'm going to go ahead and just pop this up for a second i'm going to go here and i'm going to go add that so serverless architectures guys serverless architectures or let's just call it let's just go ahead and call it serverless and what i mean by that is i'm going to add it underneath i'm going to say learn how to use cloud functions right now a lot of you guys would have seen something called express right we all might have run into it at one point express is going to be so like um so you so let me get rid of that so some of us would have heard about something called express or uh and that runs using node.js okay so express uses something called node.js right node.js and node.js is essentially just javascript but it's just for the backend so it's on the servers right so react and normal javascript runs on the front end and we have node.js on the backend express is where you have your own server right so imagine like we have our own server so let's go ahead and say like we have our own server and that's somewhere here and then we have our web page so like up here so this is our cool little web page right so this is our portfolio at the top and then this every night so say i click on a button on this web page it makes a request to my server and then my server might make a request it might send some information back okay now typically what we used to have to do is we'd have to maintain our own servers okay so we'd have to maintain our own servers but now with serverless architectures what we can do is we can actually build these amazingly powerful cloud functions guys and this is where serverless architectures come in and guys once you know how to use a cloud function so yes the learning curve is fairly so i'd say it's a medium level skill okay so it's a medium level skill like it's going to take you a little bit of time to get used to it but once you know it and once you understand what's going on with service architectures they're just more scary they just sound more scary than they really are guys and again if you guys do want to know that we i go into heavy depth and i will actually go into these uh and the coaching course on uh profit with javascript uh every single week so these uh weekly coaching calls right here i actually go into this uh quite heavily especially because a lot of my students have been asking for this um so i will be doing this uh especially i think it's next tuesday i'll actually i can cover this next tuesday so if you guys are interested be sure to go ahead and join profit with javascript link in the description make sure you go and check that out okay so um let's go back to that drawing that i was mentioning so yeah here we have react.js um yeah so service architectures so really good point by zacky talib and i think that might have been over the top of that so i if you guys can see that um here we have what i was talking about serverless and learning how to use cloud functions now what are cloud functions really good point and again guys you wouldn't be surprised that firebase also supports that right so firebase is something you need in your arsenal of skills and things like that right um somebody said how many people i know um okay so here like function oh that's a really good point so somebody said how many people were in yet and then he replied saying 10 billion right 10 billion people in the mouth like guys with with functions with cloud functions even if 10 billion people go into your app you have got google servers that will scale and handle that capacity right so literally you're going to it's going to work regardless of how big and how big is and things like that so honestly it will live is not clear maybe some connection issues guys if it is cutting out that's completely fine it will be up afterwards to rewatch um right so here guys here is pretty my cloud function is essentially a piece of code so it's a function which is going to be hosted online and it is going to allow you so a lot of people are asking what would you use your own backend instead of firebase so guys i would actually recommend you go ahead and just if you do so this is my advice to you guys right build your front end until you need a back end right so build your front end until you find a requirement for your backend and then go ahead and if it's a database that you need go ahead and use a firebase to handle your database right now if that doesn't solve all the real problems and you need some more functionality past that then i would recommend that you go ahead and look at something called um cloud functions so over here cloud functions right now this is basically where you would essentially write a function and buffering quite a lot it says okay so i'm sorry about that guys it should be clearing up soon um and basically what's going to happen here is is basically you're going to write a function you're going to deploy it online and then basically you'll get an end point so an api endpoint and pretty much you can call that endpoint and we use cloud functions all the time at clever programmer to get everything that we need working and it works and scales amazingly um so definitely definitely definitely something i would recommend you guys or learn um so really really useful stuff right there so guys recap of everything that we have right here so we have a react js which is going to be your absolute game changer in terms of making money so react.js is going to be your money pot guys it's going to be pretty much if you learn this one skill it's going to be huge for you guys um then you have css and in particular you have css flexbox and you have css grid and then guys we're talking about the react context api right so the react context apis let me just clean this up a bit so we have the react context api over here so let me just clean that boom boom boom boom boom there we go nice little tool right here so we have the react context api so definitely go ahead and learn this it's going to be massive value again like i said guys go ahead and learn the context api instead of redux redux has a much harder sort of learning curve if you guys like and enjoy the react context api then go ahead and give redux a try so start with this and then move over to that okay then i want you guys to go ahead and fit all of these into your skill set okay so i'm talking authentication hosting databases how to use an api serverless and how to use cloud functions now that sounds like a hell of a lot of things to do guys it sounds like a lot of things but do you know what demonstrates all of this in one page so like this is kind of cool right but this is a list right now if i showed you this you'd be like oh my god sonny there's so much on the webpage there's just too much to handle right you're just going to be like there is just so much here like this is what people see when they see lists it's just nothing's clear right but let's go ahead and break this down into those three projects that we showed earlier right so let's go ahead and break that down so we had react right react is being used in each of these web pages right now it's being used here it's being used here and it's being used here right look somebody's actually on hey nice good to see you there um so we pretty much have all each of these strings uh each of these three amazing apps being powered by react so that already sort of starts to put you into you know into that space of like earning as a react developer maybe you're not at the 118 mark yeah but like you're definitely in the space of a junior position at that point right then we want to talk about the react context api so we're talking about this right now the react context api is basically where look look at this this this uh demo pretty much demonstrates that you can use that you can go ahead and add a few things to your basket it works so there you go it saw some information like there you go it works really well everything gets updated appropriately you can demo it you can show your skill set off now awesome like you pretty much can demonstrate that you know how to use the react context api and once you know how to use that i've seen the developer will know that because you know how to use that it's very likely that you can pick up redux pretty easy because the two patterns are very similar okay then we spoke about authentication so authentication guys you can just demo this you can demo how you can sign in you can demo how it all works and how it uses firebase authentication to handle that right we have hosting that's very simple when you have three apps on your portfolio you can say hey all three of these apps are hosted so there you go all three apps are hosted they're gonna be live and you can pretty much show that you know how to host an app then we have how to use an api guys here we're pretty much like once you have this app built look at this you have the whole app built and it's pulling in from the tm db movie database right here so it's pulling all of these films in from here and it's using an api to do that right so you can pretty much show like yeah i know how to use an api and i know also by the way while you're showing that you'll be like oh yeah also i know about responsive design look check it out see how the top banner changed look at that works really nice and you can pretty much demonstrate that and you can show like how everything works really slick and really nice okay so we have that and then we have serverless and how to use cloud functions so in this case these three applications are don't actually demonstrate we did actually have a cool cloud function here where if there was any sort of bad language that was used here then it was going to actually it uses a cloud function to exit out but we protected that because we don't want anyone swearing on these live chats we want to keep it positive up in here guys um so yeah we want to keep that very fresh and clean but you can definitely quite easily go ahead and get that built as well uh into these apps so take away from this guys all of these skills that we spoke about here right all of these skills so like all of the ones mentioned here if you have all of those skills right then you can either one list it in a boring resume you can list it in a boring resume you can either like list all these skills out and yeah you can add some color to it you can make it look a bit colorful like this or you can just have it looking very dull and sort of you know like that right or you can go ahead and be like you know what boom here's my portfolio look how beautiful it is look for yourself give it a play around the person the the developer is going to come in and be like whoa like this is real time like and then you could literally play with them you're going to show off how you know how to use react you know how to use reactors you built three amazing apps that look beautiful with it you're going to show how you can use the react context api and you can demo it and you can pretty much play through it and say yeah sure like have a go with it you know what let's go ahead and buy something together you can demo all of that with him you're going to go ahead and show how you know authentication because you've got that up and running on your app hosting sure all three apps are hosted they can scale um and guys oh very good point by the way uh so i'm going to pin this for a for in a second this is a very um good sort of point here so i will go ahead and hide that for now but guys um yeah so you pretty much have those being demonstrated you have apis you're demonstrating how you can use your api here and you have responsive design so guys pretty much just by showing these three apps do you see the wealth of knowledge that you are demonstrating it's it's like it's insane like as a junior developer if i saw somebody rock up to an interview and be like yeah i've got some three apps i'd like to show you and they presented these three apps and they were able to run through i'd be like wow not only are these apps beautiful these apps are super functional and this guy's gone ahead and he's learning cutting edge stuff or this girl's going ahead and learning cuttingedge stuff like it's really gonna separate you from the crowd right now let's go ahead and take a moment to go ahead and answer some questions so we have david dunnington says have you got a react nate of course so it's very good question guys if you guys don't know what react native is it is essentially so you have react and then you have react native react native is how you build ios and android apps so let's go ahead and i'm just going to go ahead and do this so how do i cut this out so let's just go ahead and grab all of this so you can pretty much use react so react is how you're going to build web apps so you have react oops react i'm not the best drawer guys i apologize so we have react and then we have a reactor native okay so react native okay we have react and we have react native okay now react is essentially how we're going to build all of these beautiful apps so you can see this now guys the entire code base so when you have a react now react is you see it as that sort of oh god that's horrible like all of the skills that you're going to learn here so every all of the skills that you learn with react whether it's the context api whether it's um responsive design even or like anything where whether it be how to use authentication how to use like use effect use hooks so like even the hooks for example so react hooks um everything is transferable so you can cross this bridge guys it's completely transferable with react native so you can use all of that and you can use that to make money guys like you can go ahead and you make money with this and now for those of you wondering what is this like what is react native it's basically how you go ahead and build ios and android apps using um a react code base so essentially what you would do is you would you can code up an app in react and say you want to make an ios and android app from it you can just pretty much translate the code base to react native and you can basically take a react app so a web page where you've got a bunch of stuff on side of that web page and you can pretty much translate that to a beautiful looking iphone app so you can pretty much have a phone that's a little much my little iphone and you can have pretty much your app running and you can have your android or ios app working on that and you can have for example whatsapp and you can have like your little chat going and guys you can see that like pretty much like it's it's a massive skill guys so react is not only going to allow you to be able to code really nice looking web apps but also stunning really powerful um react native apps okay um okay so let's see uh i'll tell you what guys let's actually have a bit of a q and a now so firstly i hope that let's actually just wrap this up a little bit right so three apps that you guys need to have in your portfolio which i can guarantee you will land you a amazing an amazing permanent position somewhere or a freelance contract or somebody that you're teaching um facebook messenger app it's going to demonstrate real time db a bunch of things and it's hosted online this is just a cool app to show guys like it's a really cool app to show the second one amazon amazon build right we have the react context api we have authentication we have firebase hosting we have react we have a responsive design you see like everything sort of resizes and looks beautiful if you guys are wondering why slices off at the sides that's actually a good design plan to do that so that's something which you can look into and like again it demonstrates that you know those things we have authentication we have the react context api everything works really nice even the the the header follows us down you see that awesome then we have netflix netflix is not only a beautiful looking app it's something which shows like look at that animation at the top a lovely animation at the top it pulls data in from a api so everything's sort of fresh and it's pulling it in you see how it's pulling all of this in it's responsive it looks beautiful looks amazing it's mobile friendly doesn't matter if we're in a mobile or if we're in a desktop it works and pretty much like you can click something and play it at this point and it will just work right so these three apps are going to demonstrate so much more than you could ever show and then a simple resume okay and that's really going to separate you from the rest of the crowd right so if you guys find if you guys found that cool and useful not only are these three apps amazing but guys we have live streams on every single app and you can go ahead and watch those right now on youtube for absolutely free they're absolutely free and you can go ahead and check that out and see you go ahead and check that out and build these for yourself in those live streams um so guys if you think that's pretty cool then drop a drop some comments in there to let me know if you found that useful smash the thumbs up button if you think that is something which has helped you guys out and guys remember before we actually carry on to a q a i just want to go ahead and remind you guys that if you guys go ahead and do build those projects remember if you want personalized video feedback on your projects go ahead and check out the link in the description uh where we will pretty much be going through uh all of your submissions so the link in the description is is it's one of the first links in the description we're going to go through all of your descriptions uh all of your submissions sorry and we are going to go ahead and give you personalized yes that's right guys we're going to give you personalized video feedback something that has not been done before guys like this doesn't happen on youtube channels i haven't really seen any other coding youtubers do this like we're going to go ahead and give you guys personalized video feedback for all of the submissions that you uh send over to our way and guys remember take this seriously like we said we do get a lot of submissions with this kind of stuff so really do upload a screenshot and like and and deploy it so yeah i'm just sharing this so i want you to upload screenshots live demo links um tell us which project you're coming from what you learn and anything else that we want to know and also let us know what topics you want to we want us to cover and upload upcoming live calls so me carsey me nars nars and jacob we've got the whole team that is going to be jumping on here right now okay um and guys if you guys enjoyed that and you want to kind of push your skill set further and you feel that you want to be a part of something bigger then guys link in the description and you guys can go ahead and check that out and guys i'm just going to mention it one last time profit with javascript it is literally game changer guys so i'm going to go ahead and get rid of this so profit with javascript guys it is a game changer where we have pretty much we are going to take you from being a complete beginner to landing your first client or position a lot of our students right now have actually got jobs they've got fulltime jobs and i love love love to see that guys so when i see our students get jobs it makes my entire day like it makes my entire year for that like when i see somebody else that is making like money from the skills that we've been able to teach them it just blows my mind okay and it actually like it really really does give me like such a high um yeah and we pretty much have weekly coaching calls guys and these are really valuepacked like these are honestly worth so a lot of our students say it's worth a 10k coding bootcamp like the equivalent of a 10k coding bootcamp um and guys we pretty much we don't just teach you how to code we teach you how to make money with it and that's what really separates us from everyone else out there and guys i can't stress it enough if you enjoyed this corn you found it useful and you want to get involved then guys 30day moneyback guarantee you can pretty much go ahead and check out the link in the description join and cancel on the 29th day if you're not happy with it so go ahead and give that a go um and you've got a bunch of stories on here about but these are pretty much these are actually clients that we've had uh and students that we've had on site on the course itself and somebody actually got a hundred and ten thousand guys so remember when you guys were like i can guarantee some of you guys were shocked when i showed you this right someone landed a contract for 110 000 guys like that's amazing that's insane like if anyone if you guys find that amazing like just drop some fire right now nazari drop he actually got a 110 000 contract like it blew my mind when i saw that so guys as i mentioned link in the description give me a check out if you're interested right so we are going to go on to a q a now so pretty much we're going to wrap up with a final q a and this is going to be a chance for me to be able to talk to you guys and be able to answer any questions that you guys have so let's go ahead and jump right in so guys just pretty much any questions at this point free fire if you want uh we're gonna go for about 10 minutes and we are pretty much going to answer any questions that we can in that time frame so let's have a look at what you have so somebody said build a portfolio with react 100 guys if you have a beautiful portfolio and you actually said this portfolio was built in react and it's deployed on firebase can you see how that's literally going to speak a thousand words in itself because it's literally going to be like oh the actual portfolio's built in react so definitely some good advice from alexandros right there um let's go and have a look so hi versatile this side from where can i learn javascript so as i mentioned you can pretty much either one watch the live streams there's plenty of free content out there we actually have plenty of free content on this channel um if you want to get involved in something more and you want to get involved in something which is like more sort of fulfilling and more sort of like community driven profit with javascript you can check that out in the description and also i would highly recommend that you actually go ahead and check out the live builds that we previously done uh in the last few days for where we built the three apps that we spoke about today and the ones are going to guarantee you a job as a developer okay um let's go and have a look so edwin asked a good question he said do you mean that for this type of project it's better to make our own back end and upload it to our own server and hosting so honestly guys at this point don't do that i would say go ahead and build projects show that you can code and react use firebase make your life super easy guys firebase makes it so easy to be able to actually deploy um an app to a website so if you watched some of the live calls uh previously we pretty much had we we got the app running and then once it was built we were able to deploy it super fast like it was unreal how quickly we got that thing up and running in the air if you want to make a change to it you can deploy it and everything will go really nice and smooth so yeah to answer that question you don't need to build your own backend use firebase as a nice quick solution to get that working uh that's really nice uh let's go and have a look so what is firebase uh yeah so firebase is a really good question what is firebase um so i think let's pin it right now so what is firebase so we have firebase is a suite of tools by google guys it's a highly uh wanted skill and it's coming up i can see a lot more job openings for it um it has authentication it has i'm just gonna go ahead and draw on the screen right now so it has it's a suite of tools by google it has authentication it has a database which is a realtime database guys where it literally gives you the functionality of this where pretty much as you type in and as you send messages you can see other people's messages which is awesome you have storage which is how we actually coded up an instagram clone previously in the week you have firebase hosting so you can pretty much deploy your app so like these three apps are hosted online right now and available for you guys you've got firebase cloud functions which are amazingly powerful and super scalable and you also have some amazing other stuff so you have like crashlytics analytics if you want to track how your company is growing you've got a b testing cloud messaging this is all in that message so like notifications sending notifications from a react native app um and guys remember and by the way it's worth mentioning that this is completely free so most of the stuff on firebase is completely free for what you're going to need so actually hosting your websites is free okay so that's going to really benefit a lot of you guys and make sure you definitely make take advantage of that um yeah and also you guys you've got machine learning so that this is a really really cool use case so like if we go ahead and click learn more i think they have an example here where they talk about it um you can pretty much have things like look you can have image recognition you can have like um like if you pass it a picture of like a picture you see it shows you what like it's got a sun it's got a cloud it's got sky hills it's got birds inside of it really really powerful stuff guys and this is all done with the very very simple uh installations and things like that so extremely powerful with firebase so uh bhagav asked is react jess and firesaw a good modern tech stack it is the most underrated i'm telling you guys i am predicting this react.js and firestore is a match made in heaven so a lot of people are going crazy with the man stack which is mongodb express react uh and the m uh actually i even i can't remember the exact thing but a lot of people go crazy over that yes you're gonna need to know that but react.js and firestore guys is a match made in heaven the apps that we built were just simply you can't build those things that quickly um with the previous way of doing things
