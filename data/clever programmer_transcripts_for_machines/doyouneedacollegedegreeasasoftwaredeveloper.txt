why I dropped out of college as a programmer if you are trying to become a doctor or a lawyer then you might need college and you might need the degree otherwise it's impossible but if you want to become a web developer a full stack developer frontend developer maybe it's not so necessary understand that you need to actually earn your way out of it so what do I mean by that if you're considering dropping out and you're like hey there are a lot more practical things I could do in the real world I can work on real world projects get real experience instead of just learning Fury well don't just pack up your shop and drop out the first thing you need to do is prove to yourself that you're capable of surviving on your own personally for me while I dropped out was because I started getting freelancing opportunities and I was already doing software development work outside of college what ended up happening was I was starting to earn over six figure income while I was going to college
