as much as you hear me say or other people say end of programming it might not be 5 to 10 years from now now even when we say end of programming it really might be the end of traditional coding jobs and how they look where you have software developers sitting there writing code it's going to morph into you becoming a project manager or a product manager who's going to be writing to AI to build things and you're going to be overseeing it like you have a bunch of Junior developers under you and then when there are bugs you might go and check it out and see what what's happening but the bugs are going to be start being less and less likely as time goes on as it starts to get better and even debugging it might actually not be you coding debugging it might be giving it instruction letting it debug hey why did you start it on port 8080 you should have started on Port 7000 hey why we using mongod DB we needed you to use Firebase for this you know that that level of debugging kind of like you would when you're interacting with the developer so coding is an exciting time you should still learn it it's incredibly valuable but start using these AI tools and Chad GPT tools that
