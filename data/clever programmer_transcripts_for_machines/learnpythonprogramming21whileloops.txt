hey guys how's it going in the last video we talked about four loops in this video I want to cover wild loops while loops are not used a ton in especially in Python but they're very important and let's talk about them because once you start to understand the concepts of while loop then it's for loops essentially let you write it in a shortcut but one thing that's nice about while loops just to give you guys a little intuition of when to use while loops and for loops generally you want to use while loops for things that you don't know about when they're going to end how long they can run for and you want to use for loops for things that you know how long it's going to take for example if you want me to do pushups and you don't know how long I'm going to get tired you want to say something like while not tired keep doing pushups okay and then that way while loop just keeps running until the person is tired and then once the person is tired it stops for loops you would you need to specify a range so you would say do 20 pushups and then you can stop so you would use a for loop for that okay while loops you don't know something for loops are better if you know something okay but I'm gonna right now show you a while loop that mimics a for loop okay so I want something to happen hundred times and then I want it to stop or something okay so let's just start with a simple example that counts so let's say I want to do okay so let's start off with this I want to say my count is zero I start off with something that is at zero and then it keeps printing something up by one so I'll say how long do I want to run for okay let me add at the top here in the while loop notes for you guys again I'm using repple dot I T so then when I'm done making these videos I can actually post a link so you guys can actually go through the notes yourself so I'll put all these notes I'll a granade these notes and put it in the links below and then you guys can just use them okay so while and then some condition and then if that condition is true true then then body right or then this and then it keeps looping okay it keeps looping back and forth but once it's out of it when the condition is false then it ends so it's like an if statement but it keeps happening over and over again so if you want if statement to keep asking some question that's how you should think of a loop all right so I'm going to say and remember just so you know condition example would be like five is less than six this evaluates to true or false okay so this evaluates to true right five is less than six another example would be another example would be six is greater than five or let's make it so it's like this this evaluates to false so conditions are everything that at the end of the day evaluates to true or false so if you took this condition and put it in here write this for loop this while loop will like run forever because it'll always say five is less than six all right now let's keep going while count is less than how many times would we want to run let's say want to run a hundred times then I want to print what the count is and what else do I want to do if this statement says 0 is less than 100 it'll come down here and it will print out right so for example in the start I made count to be 0 so if I do this and put 0 for account as your account here it's going to print that out to the screen and then what's going to happen once it's done printing it out to the screen we are going to go back to this loop and is going to ask is going to put condition here again right or yeah sorry count is going to put College we're going to have count here is going to check this statement again and again we're going to have zero four count is going to ask the question is your less than 100 it's going to evaluate to true then it's going to execute this part of the code which says print 0 because count is zero and it's going to print out zero again then it's going to go back to the condition is going to check if count is less than 100 since count is zero again it's going to go back here it's going to set print zero okay now I'm gonna run it and watch what happens I'm gonna stop it and I think I might have crashed my computer haha hey there huh so my computer just kind of crashed pretty bad but hopefully that gives you a little sense of what happens I should have friend this in my terminal but yeah it took it like ten minutes to come back and I had to rewrite the notes and everything so let's go back so this is a problem called infinite loops where you write something or it doesn't match the condition like this thing if it doesn't ever turn false your loop is wrong okay if that thing doesn't turn false your loop is wrong alright because that means that your loop is going to run forever unless you put in this thing called break but I don't want you to do that generally that implies poor logic so let's just keep going through this alright so we want this to turn false at some point and we don't want to keep printing out 0 every time right so what should we do if we leave this at 0 it's this right if I leave this at 0 this whole thing is going to evaluate to false if this is and as I'm sorry I'm sorry this is if this is going to evaluate to true every time ok it's going to value to true every single time because 0 is less than 100 now it's going to keep saying true and the loop is going to keep running if I change this to 5 this thing is going to evaluate still to true if I change this to 9 II this whole thing is still going to evaluate to true what happens if I change it to 99 still evaluates to true now what happens if I change to 100 this part of the code the value is to a false and we are done with the body of the we're done with the loop and therefore we don't execute the body of the while loop okay if I needed to add something else in my notes for the while loops is this go back to while loop right I would if this condition is true then do this and then go back to the to top of while loop okay so we want this thing to turn false at some point here's how we're going to do it okay I'm going to say count is equal to count plus 1 so I'm just going to add 1 to count every single time how you read this is that what count new count is what count previously was plus 1 so the first time we go through the loop count is 0 it prints out 0 out to the screen then it prints out then count then what it does is it says count is equal to accomplice 1 so it says count is 0 plus 1 so the new count is now 1 okay then it goes here and it goes ok is 1 less than 100 yes it is so it prints out 1 then it goes here and this really says count count is equal to calm plus 1 so it says 1 plus 1 is 2 then it makes this guy too right then it goes while 2 is less than 100 print out 2 and what it says here is count plus 1 count is now 2 so 2 plus 1 you get 3 3 and while count is less than 100 count plus 1 then count turns to 3 and this part turns to 3 it prints out 3 this part turns to 3 you get 4 and then ultimately when it gets to 100 it stops so let's just print this out and let's run it and you can see it went from zero all the way to 99 and then it stopped now what if we wanted to do something fancier right what if we wanted to do something where it goes from 100 up to 1 and then instead of printing out 0 it prints blast off so I want you to try that challenge and I'm going to go ahead and do that right now so you can pause the video try it yourself and then watch this part I'm going to do this stuff in my terminal because I don't want stuff to freeze because it's really annoying and then I have to redo the whole thing again when it freezes on rebel IT so but I will put all of these notes for you guys at the end of the day so if I do a while loop right so let's try it from you go from 100 all the way to 1 and then it stops first thing I want to do is since I want to print out from 100 I don't want count to start off from 0 I want the count to start off from 100 another thing I have to keep in mind is instead of incrementing I have to decrement so I have to account for my comparison operator flipping as well so I'm going to do while count is greater than 0 right then do something so I'll say well count is greater than 0 print count and I want to do count is equal to count minus 1 now let's give it a try and you can see that it prints all the way up to 1 and then it stops so that's good ok now I want to write a statement where once it's 0 it prints off blastoff so let's write those lines of code again so I'm going to say this I want to say this guy I want to say do this and then decrement but I want to do something special this time I want to say if count let's just type it up again while count is greater than zero if count equal equals zero I want you to print see if you can catch they're in this logic but print blast off otherwise I want you to do what I want you to print count right and I want you to decrement regardless of anything so I want you to do count minus one so this part is not in that if else block because I want this part to happen no matter what we do okay so I could either put it in my if block and in my else block or I can just choose to put it outside and that's what I've chosen to do and you can see it grows from one hundred to one and then it prints why doesn't it print blastoff hmm that's weird right what's the logic there that it's not printing blastoff well let's think about it we have this situation here right we have this greater than sign here so the only way the body of the while loop runs is if this condition evaluates to true well what does this condition evaluate to in this case it's when count is zero it this whole part evaluates to false right when count is zero that part evaluates to false if that part evaluates to false the while the body of the while loop does not run so when our count becomes zero after it gets decremented on this line then count zero greater than zero returns false which means that this if condition doesn't run therefore the blast off never runs so we want to make sure that when count is zero the body of the loop should run this part should run it should print blast off and after that it should not run again so here's one addition that we need to make to our code okay so let's go back and type count is this right the only addition that we need the only thing that we need to add to our code is May account is greater than or equal to 100 okay and then everything else we can keep it the same if count zero then I want you to print blastoff else I want you to print out what count is and then I want you to decrement count regardless right I want you to decrement count regardless of the situation let's run this and you can see that it goes let me make it bigger something for you guys and you can see it goes from 100 all the way or sorry 100 all the way down to one and then ultimately it says blastoff okay so hopefully this gives you a little bit of a better idea of how while loops run the codes will be down below thank you guys for watching I'll see you in the next video
