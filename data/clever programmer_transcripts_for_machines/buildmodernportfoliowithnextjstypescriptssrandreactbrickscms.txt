have you ever wanted to build a portfolio as a developer or an upandcoming developer that could land you a job and actually give you a very high chance of doing so you've probably seen a lot of videos on portfolios or at least their thumbnails popping up and lots of people doing them this one is gonna be different and this one is going to teach you a lot of new things you never knew existed this portfolio is going to have it all it's going to be powered by next.js you're going to have server side rendering along with the power of typescript you're also going to have tailwind css for your styling you're going to have a content management system you're going to have react stories so you can actually see every single one of your components in a playground play with it test it tweak it change it and do whatever you want you're going to have image optimization that comes out of the box you're going to have full seo capabilities you're going to have an admin interface and you're going to have a full backend where all this data is stored it's going to blow your mind how simple this app is going to be and you're going to have this app up and running in maybe 20 to 30 minutes or less i promise you that this is one of the best and most creative solutions i've ever seen to this nobody's ever talking about it and i really want to show you how to do this with next let's go if you want to watch this the first price you have to pay it's like a toll road smash that like button hit that like button turn it white that will lift up the doors to see the rest of the video no i'm just kidding you can like it or not like it i love your beautiful face anyway with that said here's what i want you to do if you want to code this along with me grab that rebel fork it why because we're going to give you all the assets the images and everything that you'll need access to and it'll also set up next.js out of the box for you so just make sure go in the description click that rapple link it's going to say join.replay.com cp portfolio click that fork it you'll get all the assets and then you can actually code along with me right in your browser and it has javascript and nexus and everything is powered by replit so let's go all right once you hit that link it's going to bring you to this page right over here just make sure you hit fork and once you hit fork it will actually allow you to edit this code and do whatever you want with it so let's hit fork right now all right now that we've forked this okay you could see it says fork this blah blah and then it says dash one at the end okay which means now i can i should be able to write my own code in here if i want perfect you should also have this assets file and this assets file will have some images that we will need for this portfolio and stuff like that okay now let's just walk through this portfolio together see boom you go in rafael full stack developer i like to build amazing ui ux experiences right you got the testimonial segment right here which looks really slick and powerful introduction to who you are this will be very important if you're trying to represent yourself as a developer you want to tell them who you are you want to tell them about a little bit of your personal life as well i only have one sentence here so it's not too much right and then i go hey here are my preferred weapons of choice these are the things that i like to code with whatever so now they instantly know about you you can click my github takes you there so we're just going to do a walkthrough and an overview of all of this and how this actually is working now keep in mind all of this is next type script there's server side rendering which is why it's so fast this is currently deployed online already on digitalocean so you'll learn how to do that as well with and i'm going to show you one last part which is going to blow your freaking mind okay so we're going to show you that now i can go here and it says hey here's my coding projects and it highlights all your coding projects and the reason i wanted to make it like this is so you could show off what stack or tech you're using for this along with a description of your project and what your project actually was and then you can link them to the demo so they can actually click and then go ahead and just view your app or they can hit the github repo and it'll take them to the repo because it's very important because if somebody's coming to your thing they want to be able to do both and vue demo is a more important one here's another app that they could view demo or like check out the repo here's another app that they could check out or repo and this is a portfolio you're going to be ending with after this tutorial is done it'll walk you through my experience section for anybody that's viewing it so i'll walk through where did you work how long did you work walk through that and it's very simple and sleek that's what i love about it and then here we also have your testimonial section so this is where you're going to put your testimonial section and then lastly a call to action so this part is very important for a call to action right my linkedin hey want me to build stuff for you now another cool part about this portfolio is it is a 100 mobile friendly so not all tutorials out there are mobile friendly but this one is if you view it on your phone it looks gorgeous and it doesn't matter how small you make it or how large you make it it knows exactly what to do and here is the best part you can just edit it look at that i can just point and click and edit i can just point and click and edit look at that so how the heck am i doing then this again is the next app it's not wix this is not squarespace i'm point and clicking and updating my app i can update the image right all of this update any of these images so how do you build an app that can do this and how do you build a portfolio that can do this this is going to be super impressive not only for yourself and you're going to enjoy it but for anybody that you actually show this to so i'm excited for you but with that said let's actually jump in and start coding this bad boy up now i want to show you a little bit more of the demo of this right so it's so easy to add things to this i just hit this plus button right over here and boom i can add whichever new section i want i can add this if i wanted this to go up i can move this section up i can start writing in here if i want to remove a button i can remove it i want to change the text of the button i can change it i can make it go full width now here's another cool part in react you have these stories right react stories is this very popular library a lot of people use you also get that built in so take a look at this right all of these units there's story right there and you can see your components by themselves and again this is all react this is not anything else you can see these components right over here okay and then these components let you add things or remove things if i want to add a feature do whatever i want so this playground lets you play with your components you can custom code them up some of them already come a lot of these actually come built in and i'll show you how these come built in and then some of these you could build yourself like your custom ones and this is super easy to actually do as well so this is unbelievable i wish somebody told me about a resource like this when i was building my applications because front end it makes your life so simple you could still code as much as you want custom and you could use all the power of react and next and use apis and integrate a database and all of that but content management just being baked in and being given to you out of the box is very very powerful so now let's go ahead and code this up all right so we're gonna have you sign up for digitalocean and here's what you want to do you want to click the link that i have in the description below or you can just go to it and it's try.digitalocean.comcleverprogrammer they've created a special landing page just for us so if you sign up from here you're actually going to get a hundred dollars of credit for 60 days and it's going to be a free trial so all you're going to do here is just pop in your email okay or just hit one of these sign up with google or github okay and again it's a 100 special so that means that when you're building this app you get to build it with me for free and then it should bring you to this page over here checking for bots apparently i'm not a bot so just take a look at this right this is just to verify that you're an actual real person so just go ahead and add a card okay you could do it with google pay or whichever one since i have some of my information google pay i'll just do it google pay all right so i just went ahead and added a card manually and now we're on this registration page cool and we don't really need to do anything here we could click deploy a web application okay and boom we'll just click that all right it should bring us into this and you can just leave this as is we don't need to touch this anymore until the very very end okay that's what we're going to be deploying so i'm just going to go all the way back to where we were starting to code now in order to get started one of the first things that we'll actually have to do is we'll have to install a couple of libraries okay so let's go ahead and do that now all right now the first thing we'll have to do is we'll have to get r next setup and we'll have to get this amazing library that actually does all of the heavy lifting for us it's called react bricks so let's go to react bricks and let's get that set up okay this is mind blowing react brix is actually what allows for visual content editing and it's just an amazing piece of software that i've discovered and over 2500 companies are using it so you can see it's pretty stable and a lot of companies are using it now to install it it's this easy all right that easy so we're just going to copy that npx create react bricks app so let's copy that let's go back to our command line and in our shell i'm just going to go ahead and paste that all right now let's go ahead and hit enter now starting to ask us some questions you want to proceed yes we want to proceed all right now as the installation process continues is going to install next this is going to install tailwind css this is going to get typescript set up and ready to go this will have everything all in place the code that it will generate will also come with server side rendering so again all of the heavy lifting is already done this is amazing now if you get this error right here which is hey please tell me who you are you could simply just copy this line right here paste it i'm gonna hide myself real quick and you can paste that line that we copied from here and then we're just going to put our email in quotes like this so we'll just say like that and copy this other line as well with the username paste it and we will put our name like this okay let's hit enter and now let's try installing react bricks again so i'm going to hit install and it says do you already have a react bricks account let we're just going to go ahead and say no that we don't okay so i'll write an n you should you can create an account before this that's really up to you okay so if you don't have an account this is not gonna go and go forward okay so make sure that you go ahead and create an account so i already have an account okay so on react breaks all you have to do is go here try for free doesn't ask you for a credit card or anything right put in a password i'll just say fake i've already created an account already with them so i don't need to create one from scratch and then there you go all right this will actually bring you right in okay so i have an account with them already so i'm going to go ahead and run that command again npx create react bricks app and i'm going to say yes i do have an account so i'm simply just going to hit enter here it's going to say please enter your react bricks account email so i will enter that email just like that it will ask me for the password hopefully i remember the password fingers crossed boom there we go and i'm gonna go ahead and create a new app okay and it's gonna say hey what's the app name and i'll say portfolio youtube app okay so that's gonna be the app name pick the default package name as well so i'm just gonna hit enter for the package name so let's hit enter and wait okay folder name yep just pick the default folder name and then we don't need to start with an empty project you could if you want we want to start with a website and blog with tailwind so it already comes with stuff it says hey which framework do you want we want to go ahead and choose next as our framework so i'm going to go ahead and hit hit enter on that and let's see what happens okay is it loading yup and then it goes do you want to load default content we'll just say yes load default content and now it's just going to take some time and it's going to download the starter package it's going to set up all the configurations it will set up all the app credentials for you it will install all the dependencies and it will set up even a git repo for you that you could use so now it's going to go ahead and do those things and as soon as it's done we're going to continue making progress on this app now this is taking a little bit or a couple of minutes to install don't worry there are a couple of things that we'll need to install and set up as dependencies so don't freak out nothing to worry about just let it take its time and then once it's set up you're gonna be ready to go all right there we go so now our app has completely finished installing it's ready to go so i'm gonna bring myself i'm gonna leave myself out of it or just move myself up a little bit so you can see my commands that i'm going to be writing but all we need to do here is simply go ahead and do cd and we need to go this was the folder that this app is installing reactbricks created portfolio yt app and if i go inside of this it has set me up with all of these files okay this is the entire structure it set me up now i need to cd into that and then go ahead and do yarn dev so let's cd into portfolio app and then let's go ahead and do yarn dev and let's see what we get so i've done yarn dev it looks like something is opening up fingers crossed and i'm gonna hit this url right over here so it can open it can open this in a new tab okay so once the app is loaded it'll show up there all right so if you get this error right here this is totally normal it's just saying hey you don't have a home page so we're gonna go ahead and click edit content and edit content should bring you to this page that says slash admin at the end of it okay and then once you're there we can go ahead and fix this problem it'll bring you to this page so go ahead and sign in i'm gonna put in all my information and i'm gonna hit log in all right now that i've logged in it should bring me to this page right here okay and all i have to do here is create a new page right there click and just call it home and i can just hit this tick mark right here okay and that's it that should do the trick and now if i zoom out just a little bit if i click that toggle you can see it's allowing me to add my first block and there you go this is a perfect place to start for us now before we keep coding this app up right this is our editor right here this is where we're at if i refresh this you're gonna see that error is now gone okay so this is the editor editor version if you want to get a preview link and see what your app looks like you could do that too or just grab this url right here right for example just click here that should just open it so one tab you should have your actual app and the second tab you should have the actual editor version where you can actually edit so i like that workflow now going back to this code here and just kind of understanding how this works react brix has something called the concept of bricks and in bricks you can actually make your own custom components so here's an example of your own custom component which is called my hero unit dot tsx all right and i'll show you what it looks like so if i go in here and i hit playground inside of playground when i scroll down over here you can see they're all these components right here already made like how the react stories library helps you do and if i hit my custom hero unit that's the custom hero unit that you have and you can actually even change it right here and it changes the code that you can see at the bottom so this allows you to play with your component that you've created so you could create your own components or you could use the components that the react bricks ui library they have a ui it's almost like a marketplace where they're pushing all their components and you're just getting access to a lot of these builtin components that are very nice and already made for you okay so perfect so i'm going to leave this one in playground so the first one is going to be here the second one is going to be in the admin third one is going to i'll just leave it in playground so we can check out different components now let's start working on this okay so i'm going to hit auto save so i have auto save enabled and that way when i'm working i won't forget to save anything okay and we'll start off with a hero unit and if you hover over and leave it for a second it'll even show you what those components are going to look like once you add them so we're going to start with the hero unit and here what we're going to do is i'm just going to say let's go back okay i'm going to say hi my name is and i'm going to make it gray and then here we're going to go ahead and say your actual name so rafikaze is my name you could put your name here right and then for the color we're going to give it a ocean gradient so that was nice and they make it really easy now i'm just gonna say i am a full stack dev okay and then for the copy i'm just gonna go ahead and write my copy here i'm gonna say i like to build amazing ui ux experience for humans a little emoji and currently i'm focused on empowering people to learn how to code and change their future perfect we'll add a little call to action so i'll hover over this and i'll remove this one and for this one i'll just say do you want to work with me okay and then we can actually pop in a linkedin url so i'll hide myself here so you could see and i could pop in a linkedin url right there so that way when they click it it'll take them to my linked all right let's bring myself back and i don't even really need to hit save on this auto saving but you could hit save anyway and now let's go to our home one right the one that's like live and currently working so let's refresh and let's see if there are any changes or anything that has actually happened yet boom look at that how fast was that we just did it we point and click came here and this is on the you know the deployed version or the version that will be deployed and it's already up and running it's that fast okay now there are a couple of things that i want to change like for example i don't we don't want the header and we will not even really need the footer for our portfolio so let's go ahead and take care of that so i'm going to go ahead inside of pages or sorry components let's go inside of layout and inside of layout let's get rid of footer and let's get rid of header and if we go back to our app it'll update shortly but we won't have the footer or the header anymore boom there you go the footer and header is completely gone and if i click this link it does take me to the linkedin my linkedin you could have people go wherever you want if you don't want it to be linkedin you could have it be something else it's totally up to you now what i want to do is i want to make this fully dark theme so what we're going to do is there's a little hack that we could do that's actually really cool and it will force it to actually be a dark theme so inside so let's go inside of our pages right over here so click pages and inside of our pages we're going to create a new page actually so let's just go ahead and close our blog and let's close our admin so our pages just looks like this click on pages and we're going to create a new page in here and it's going to be underscore document dot txt x it's very important you actually name it like that because that's there's a special little hack that we're pulling off in next.js to do this okay now here i'm gonna go ahead and i'm gonna say import and we'll do html with the capital h okay so this is another gotcha head with a capital h as well main okay and we're gonna get next script just like this okay and i'm gonna go ahead and say from next slash document now here's what we're going to do i'm going to say export default function and this function is going to be called document and then we're going to return and i will say html and then inside of this html we're going to say class name dark okay this is the trick that allows to make the whole thing dark just leave head empty for now and then we'll go body and inside of our body we'll put our main tag and it's selfclosing and we will put our next script tag and this will also be selfclosing tag and that's really it now once we do that should take care of making our app dark mode enabled all right there we go so let's take a look boom dark theme is enabled and it looks way better already in the dark theme now just keep in mind if some of this stuff doesn't load right away it's okay this takes a while so just make sure you refresh or you can kill the server and start it again like yarn control c to kill the server and then you are in dev to start it again and then just keep going back and refreshing until it's up and running so we got our first brick right here and it's working now let's go back to our editor so again remember even if you don't have the header you can still go back to edit mode by just simply going slash admin here and slash editor and it'll bring you to the editor okay that's it it's just a url so now here okay and i just enabled this is just for us to see okay what it looks like in different colors so we're just going to click this and stay in this one now what we want to do is the next thing you want to do is we want to add okay if we look at our final version our final version looks like this right so we want to add this section over here now you can use this section and you can change the logos to the companies that you've worked with and i think that would look fine okay that would look good so now click plus here and then we're just gonna choose customers and once you choose customers it's gonna bring that there okay so that's good that's what we want now if you want the color to be the same you could lay out and make it black okay or you can make it stand out up to you i just like it very subtle like this i just like leaving it at this okay the next thing that we're going to need to do is we're going to need to add this about me section right underneath us right underneath this so let's hit that plus and for that about me section actually we can actually just use another hero unit for that or we can actually use a text and image so click text and image and then in the image what i actually want to do is go ahead and move the image to the left just click left and then image on top on mobile so that's really helpful we're going to add shadow and we're going to click this right over here and what that will allow us to do is add rounded corners to the image so it'll make the image look really nice instead of you know like a square looking thing which doesn't look that pleasant to look at perfect now for the image where are we going to get these assets remember we gave you all of these assets right over here okay so you can pull these assets out from here you could download them right you could just hit download on this so right now the image that we need access to is my face cozy face so let's go ahead and hit download so we got that jpeg and now let's go back and i'm just going to go ahead and change this image and i'm going to go into my downloads and i got quasi and i'm going to hit open and that's it and again our seo see how easy that is we get the uploader and our seo is right there as well so let's go ahead and hit done and let's see our our guys show up perfect so guys showing up you can see that the there's rounded corners right there which is really nice okay and then i'm gonna say all right let's select this i'm gonna say i'm rafikaze we'll highlight this we'll click that select that and highlight it okay and then i'm going to put a coder thing here and i'll say i've been coding for nearly 10 years i'm a senior software developer who loves building full stack applications and learning new technologies i've also helped help millions of people learn how to code okay you could put whatever you want that's what i want to put here what matters to me and now i'll put a little fun fact and if this ever happens that's okay just hit x refresh and just come back so that happens from time to time or if and if it ever says like rebel is unable to wake up that means your rebel crashed here okay so just go ahead and cd into that folder portfolio app and then just hit yarn devs make sure that you cd first and then you hit yarn dev okay not a big deal once that gets up and running we'll be back in the editor and we'll fix any of our problems that we faced all right now we're back in the editor so let's go back here and i'll put a bulldog emoji or dog rather dog emoji and i'll hit enter okay and then i'll say when i'm not coding i am the proud father of a baby bulldog she's two years old two cats and a bunny okay my now on to the coding part okay my preferred weapons of choice and i'll put this guy right here and then to get those get to get these guys watch how easy it is okay so i go back here and just simply click feature all right so i'm going to click feature four times let's go like this and let's make them all blue okay and then i'll say javascript node we'll go right there and say next js slash react redux context and then for this i'm going to say firebase and i've actually been meaning to check out superbass as well so let's go firebase superbase all right so now the about me section is actually done and it was that fast let's add that divider in now okay so i'm gonna go ahead and add that divider in so we'll hit that plus sign at the bottom and then let's go hit horizontal rule we're done with that i'm gonna type in my coding project so let's go back here all right we're gonna choose hero unit we're going to remove this badge we don't need that we're going to remove we're going to select all of this and hit delete we will take that button delete it we'll take this button and delete it so delete both of the buttons and we're going to change that copy and it just says my coding projects and then the type attacks it shows it to you here but in your actual app it won't show it anywhere so let's go to our actual app and let's hit refresh and let's see if all of these changes are in fact taking place or is it just we're doing stuff and nothing is really happening so let's take a look boom look at that our header or our main hero plus our little testimonial logos social for social proof are showing up the about me section is showing up perfectly fine okay and we now just need to add a little button underneath that so let's go in here and watch how easy it is to add a button just simply click button so we'll click button and for this button click it and then we're gonna say my github so this should link to my github and i'll make it a outline so it's not solid because solid basically says hey click this is really important this is not that important so we'll make it like slightly outlined and then we'll put the link to our github repo okay and we'll say open a new event window so just select that perfect let's hit save that looks that should look pretty good and then let's get to work on adding our coding projects okay so these are the projects and this is how i want them to show up so i'm gonna go here plus sign this is crazy this is yes it's point and click but this is still react and next and you could customize it using next and react and typescript and underneath the hood is next and typescript and react and it's also they're hosting the backend and cms4 units allinone to me this is mindblowing like i really wish i knew this and i could use it for other things but for building things like portfolio you can update your portfolio so easily like everybody else who's just custom coding every single line of their portfolio is a nightmare for them to update it people update their portfolio every three years or four years if it's this easy you can update in a second you do a new project just add it in huge advantage so let's go back to the final version and final version we have web3 exchange tracker and it's a text in an image so we're going to go ahead and choose text image all right and let's see where the image is so images on the left hand side so what are we going to do we're going to click image we're going to choose left for we're going to choose image shadow image around corner and image on top on mobile so now already again this is mobile friendly right so if you were to scroll this image already knows to be on top and how long did this take us like almost not long at all a few minutes and we're good to go all right so let's go ahead and now add the project image okay which project are we looking for in this case we're looking for the coinbase one so i'm gonna go ahead and hit download on my coinbase project and click here and then we're gonna add in our coinbase project all right let's say quiz app done so done with the seo right there it's enter all right and we'll leave it as large and i'll say web3 exchange tracker okay or whatever you want to call it and then for the copy i'll just copy this and paste it so we don't have to write it all from scratch oh that was weird there we go all right and now underneath this we're gonna go ahead and link the github repo so i'll put a link and we'll say github repo so this is where i'll actually put the link to this repository okay you could put the link to any of your github repositories so i'm going to go to the final version click that copy that github link come back to ours and bold it and link it and paste the github link so now the github linking is done now i want to add these features to it so let's go ahead and add those features i'll just add something dummy underneath just so i can scroll properly all right so to add those features just click feature four times so feature and then we want it all to be blue just click it and then click blue all right and then what do we wanted to say we we say that our stack is next.js for this we also use solidity in this project let's go say solidity we use sanity as a headless cms and then we also do authentication with metamask so let's put that there a crypto conversion app like coinbase using nexjs solidity third web sdk sanity as a headless cms authentication with metamask and style components for styling now if you want to go really far and add these logos that would be really impressive for whoever's viewing your portfolio but if you don't want to add that just add at least the image of the app that you've built that would be fairly impressive so look this looks so beautiful right you have the project you have what the project does you have the link to the repo you have the key features that stand out so i really love that about it now the one last thing i want to add is you want to add a button underneath it okay and the button should say view demo so we're going to go here make it outline we'll say view demo and we want to link to the actual app itself so i'll click here i'll grab that url for the actual app and we'll paste that right here okay and you could use your apps here okay you don't need to use my apps here you could use whatever you want or just copy my links at least for now to make it work okay and i'll hit save let's go back and take a look at our app outside of the editor mode and let's just make sure that all the changes that we've added so far are actually showing up so let's scroll down boom i got my hero i got my about me my coding project the image is taking a second so we'll give it some rest and then hopefully the image once it cached it's probably quicker okay so let's i don't know where the heck the image is but everything else is showing up so that's a really good sign boom there we go the image is showing up look at that that looks beautiful and now what we want to do is we want to have multiple projects we want to have a medium style blogging app and a facebook one so i'm gonna go back and all we're gonna do here is let's just duplicate this bad boy so this is gonna be very easy click that copy button okay and i'll just duplicate the block so duplicate the block and duplicate it one more time so now you have three projects you can show off i like these two alternate so let's go to image and let's go image on the right to project here on the left image on the right on this one and we'll leave the last one as it is perfect so now they're alternating so that looks really nice second project we will call it medium style blogging app so let's go ahead paste that there i will grab the copy from a file version a blogging app like medium using nexus solidity actually we don't have solidity in here so i'll paste that in here and we'll remove solidity and third web sdk because we don't have that and we also don't have sanity for this and we're not using styled components okay so blogging app like medium using nextgs and tailwind css okay let's just say that say tailwind css next.js and then are there any other like key features of that app for now they're not that many so we can oh yeah there's authentication with firebase or we can say firebase so yes authentication and database with firebase okay so that's another key component and we can actually say another key component is user and tickation all right boom there we go now repo and the demo make sure you link that properly i will just leave this as is and for image go ahead and change the image so we're going to go back to our up and we're going to get not the coin base one cause we don't need that we're done with that we need the medium one so go ahead and download it let's go back here to our editor click and we're gonna find medium and click it and then boom all right i didn't update the seo you can update seo as well medium app and let's hit done there we go okay and if i want this repo to be working perfectly then i want to copy this make sure that i link it correctly so paste and then let's get the demo copy the demo link go here hover over it paste and hit save anyway just so it's saves all right and then the last one is a web3 social media app on salon on blockchain okay so basically building facebook on solana blockchain so let's go ahead and write that for the image let's go ahead and download the facebook image i'm going to download let's go to our app let's change this image and we're going to go ahead and choose this facebook one right here let's choose that book and we're gonna say facebook app and look at the speed we're moving with right doing this much frontend work would take you forever normally this part of the tutorial has already taken us like four hours or two hours or three hours and it's ridiculous so front end get it done fast still slick you can customize it more if you want to or need to the full stack developer this is a dream honestly come true let's go ahead ignore my dog if you hear any barking it's my baby bulldog and there you go it's a facebook clone app built on solana blockchain leveraging the blockchain technology you're able to create posts authenticate the user base on their wallet and post comments all on chain okay now for features blockchain is definitely a feature we want to highlight we want to highlight the fact that we're using solana here okay slash rust okay we're using sanity as a headless cms so that's important and then we also have next.js and yes this does have authentication as well okay so there we go now we're gonna grab the repo link so i'm gonna go here pop in our repo link and we'll also grab the demo link it's a demo link all right let's go ahead paste that there and we'll say open a new window so for all the demos like all the links make sure that they open in a new window because you don't want your user to like go somewhere else when they click it they should just open everything up in a new window it should still have access to your portfolio beautiful so we're done with all of that now what else is left we need to get to our experience part okay so let's hit plus here we're going to add in a horizontal rule and then oops where did my horizontal rule go so let's click this let's add in our horizontal rule okay i hope i don't know why it's not adding it okay let's try adding in something else let's try adding in a hero unit which we have here so that's good and we're going to remove the badge we're going to remove all of this copy here i'm going to remove the buttons okay click the buttons and then click remove and we're going to change the size of this tile size to medium and here i'm simply just going to say i'll try to make myself small so i'm not in the way of anything but you can still hang out with me because i'll put myself right there all right so we develop beautiful application instead of that we're going to say my experience all right and there we go okay that's it so we're done with that section now let's add in i'm going to add again leave a hero unit at the bottom so i can do stuff and now all we need is a bunch of hero units actually so watch this i'm gonna go here choose a hero unit and this is gonna be really clean so just replace that here with best buy okay and i worked with the geek squad department to help with customer service and fulfill order slash refunds you could write your own copy there whatever your experience was we don't need any call to action so simply just remove them and instead of this we'll say the years we worked so we'll just say 2018 to 2020 we worked at best buy boom so we're done with that now let's duplicate that okay and let's go maybe 20 oh the years are messed up there okay i see so we'll go 2019 for best buy then we'll go 2019 for the next one we'll go 2019 to 2021 or 2020 is fine and we'll say apple and i worked with them to build out an apple music integration into homepod mini using their sdk perfect let's paste that over here and then let's add one more hero units oh actually don't do that that's silly go ahead duplicate this and we'll go 2020 2020 to 2022 or you could say present if you're still working there okay so you could even put present there and now we'll say meta right previously facebook so that's another company you're working at let's just say and we can make these medium if you want so if you don't want them to be like massive you can make them medium and here i said i worked on designing and implementing the oculus vr landing page i optimized the performance using nexus and lighthouse that increase the performance by 378 percent so let's get that popping okay let's just hit say beautiful now we need to add another divider so let's add another horizontal rule and after this we need to add what clients say working with me so let's add another hero unit let's remove this we don't need this remove the buttons don't need that okay and let's make this medium and i'll copy this right here we'll paste that boom okay and here's the here's what essentially the clients say so now we're going to add a new section and we'll click testimonial okay and for testimonial you can say whatever somebody said about you as a testimonial maybe it could even be a teacher that something said something great about you it could be a boss that says something great about you at a job that's not even developer related necessarily make sure you have testimonials because they're really going to help you land the job that you're actually looking for i think it's a very key component don't miss out on them don't get lazy on this stuff put in the effort make it look beautiful work on it it'll help you land the job once you get one job for 60 70 80 90 000 a year you're good you're making progress so here instead of matteo frana or whatever it says i will say david riccosi said this about me okay and he's the cto at let's say clever programmer okay and now let's go ahead and get the clever programmer logo let's get david's face image let's change this let's go to downloads and put his face image i'll zoom in so we can see his beautiful face and beautiful hair and we'll say david david let's hit done okay and then let's go here we'll change this to be the clever programmer logo instead ep logo let's hit done and there we go now let's go ahead and refresh this bad boy and take a look scroll down we got our about me section we got our coding project showing up if i click the github repo it does take me to the github repo if i go back let's wait for the rebel to wake up unless we killed it by mistake all right so those links work my github link works let's check the demo the demo is up and running let's check the demo for our medium app that one looks to be also up and running let's check the demo for this this is up and running it's just that we made the facebook clone so good that it thinks it's a phishing scam it's not you can just hit unsafe site and boom you can go straight to it okay so that's up and running our the github repo link is good to go my experience for every where we worked and then what my clients say about me now at the end let's just end it off with a nice little call to action how we have here so what you could do is you could actually scroll all the way down we'll hit plus and we'll finish it with let's see call to action all right and call to action you can make it large you can make it medium or small whatever you want we'll keep it small because small looks great and let's paste that there want me to build stuff want me building stuff for you hit me on linkedin all right hit me on linkedin and my linkedin that's all we got to say right there my linkedin and then just make it sky blue and we'll paste our linkedin link and there you go okay this is your brand new portfolio and look at how fast we did it honestly like that was lightning fast right if you go fully fast without even that much explanation you could get this done in 20 minutes after watching this or if you're doing this with me and the whole thing is ready to go if you want to customize it you want to add your own flair to it you want to add your own custom components remember you can go ahead and create so first of all you can mess around with components right here so you can mess around with layout and everything right here that's one thing the second thing is in react breaks is where you're going to write most of your code and you could play around with your units you could create a my hero unit and add changes to it so for example if i change anything in this unit saying we are clever programmers let's just say we say now if i go into our playground and we refresh that component that we have custom hero unit right it says we are clever programmers it brings that up and if i go into our editor and we try to add in a new block and i hit customer hero unit this is our custom hero unit that we have so if i go back this okay let's go here and let's delete it and let's refresh real quick and then let's try again so that was our custom hero unit and you can make different changes to it as well so let's go all the way down let's delete this let's add a new one custom here a unit right it says we are clever programmers that's so it proves us the one that we added right now on the right hand side you'll see that it says you can choose big padding or you could choose small padding how's that happening if i go back here you can see that we have side edit props so what are the props that you want to decide we only have one padding that's it and on padding we say you could choose the value to be big or the value to be small right padding big or small what do you want default is big okay so that's how we're choosing the styling okay and then boom if i remove that from the i could if i remove that from there or i could change the label to huge padding okay now if we come refresh this and go back right huge padding small padding huge padding so you can clearly create your own components you can clearly add them to your app okay so if you keep creating your own components you could keep adding your custom bricks here so they have their website break right that's a website break they have a blog brick they have a hero unit and then you could keep creating your own custom ones and just keep popping them in here keep popping them in here all right that's where we got the hero unit from which is our hero unit and you could create your own custom components keep popping them in and then do whatever you want so you can see that the power of it is really like infinite anyways i'm blown away that this type of tool exists i hope that you enjoyed watching this and building this out with me gotta get the set ready and if you enjoyed it make sure you smash the like button so this video goes out to as many developers as possible make sure you subscribe to the channel so you can learn more about different tips and techniques with javascript next web 2 web 3 and take your journey to a whole another level with that said i love your beautiful face and as always i'm quasi if you don't know me and i'll see you in the next video now for the final step we're gonna deploy this app so let's get it poppin let's go to our package.json right over here okay package.json and inside of here we're gonna just add literally two lines of code inside of the scripts put a comma here and we're going to add in another script and this script is going to be for export so we're going to go ahead and go export and we're going to go ahead and say yarn run build and next export and then mv out static so that's one thing that we need the second thing that we actually need is let's go here and we're gonna go ahead and do engines so let's go ahead and do engines just like this and then we're gonna say node and let's go 14 point x on that okay and then put another comma so make sure that you have engines and comma here like this so these are really the twoish lines of code that we needed to write and that's it on the coding end all right so now that we're actually ready to get this app deployed all we actually need to do at this point is we need to just download this folder so we're going to go right over here okay you can click here and we'll just download a zip the whole thing all right and let's open this bad boy up we're and we're going to make this as simple as possible to deploy it so they're not a lot of there's not any confusing steps okay all right so there it is we only need access to this folder right here portfolio yt app we don't really care about anything else so here's what we're gonna do we're gonna go into our github and we're just gonna create a brand new repo so let's hit new repo and we're gonna say yt portfolio app you could call it whatever you want and then i'm simply gonna say create repository okay and then all we want to do here is upload an existing file and we'll just drag and drop our folder here now if it doesn't actually start putting it in here what we're going to do is we're going to just go ahead and delete node modules because that ends up adding a lot of extra files so remove that and then let's go ahead and put it in and now it should say hey uploading blah blah of 38 files or 37 files however many files there are and it should start downloading it putting it in the repo okay and so we'll say finish building portfolio app all right let's hit commit changes and now it'll take a few minutes to process the files so just be patient here wait a little bit and then once this is ready to go we're literally one step away from making this entire thing work okay so you can see there's a folder portfolio it app okay and when i click that everything is inside of it so there you go now let's go to digital lotion and we're going to do is we're going to hit create app okay so if you weren't in there just make sure you choose apps and then create app we're gonna go to github okay and make sure that you give it if it asks for your permissions just go ahead log in with your github give it all the permissions that it needs and then for source directory let's try doing slash portfolio yt app or actually what was ours yeah portfolio yt app that's the directory right and it's inside of the branch main yes it is and then which repository is it it's yt portfolio app so it's actually a different one okay so i'm going to go ahead and edit my permissions and let's give it all repositories okay so if you've done that already then great but i hadn't done that earlier all right so let's choose the repository in that repository called yt portfolio there we go all right let's put the folder name and then let's hit next and let's see if it figures out what it needs to figure out yes it has so that's really good now go ahead and hit next for resources we're good on resources for global we're gonna go ahead and hit edit okay and we're just gonna add in a couple of api keys here that are going to be helpful all right and this is because we need access to certain environment variables that know how to go into your react bricks and pull out the data so let's go into our app let's go to v dot local and here you need to access your api key so let's go copy the word api key let's go to digital ocean paste that right there okay let's hit another one right here let's copy next public id let's go back to digitalocean and paste that right there okay and then let's copy this entire thing go back to digitalocean and paste it for the api key and then copy this entire next public id go here and paste that all right now let's hit save so now those two environment variables are saved that's good that's what we're looking for yep that looks great that looks great let's hit next all right and then just go down hit edit plan okay and you could pick the cheapest one all right so now if you're here on this page let's not pick pro because we don't need to pay 12 or sorry 24 a month for this we could have a pretty simple basic this is not a static site so we won't be able to choose a starter plan but if you did that would be free but we don't have that we're gonna pick something really small like the five dollars a month one okay so it's gonna be uh five dollars a month but you get to deploy your app you get to see it you get to share with everybody and i think just that experience of knowing how to do it and even putting on your portfolio that you've deployed something with digitalocean a lot of people and recruiters know digital lotion so that'll actually give you a like up okay let's go ahead and review all right so now just hit back okay so we've edited our plan all right and then we're just gonna go ahead and hit create sources and then once it goes through then our app is ready and then that app can be deployed okay so it says it has been created and now it's gonna push it pushed the deployment and now it's building so it's going to go through the process and then once it's fully built and ready to go you'll be able to go to it and if you ever want to just get rid of your entire app completely you could always go at the bottom and you could destroy it okay so you can hit that button they'll destroy this digitalocean like app slash container and then you won't be ever charged for it or anything like that okay but i still think it's worth a shot to do this and then be able to see your app once it's built all right if this is loading don't worry about it guys it takes a little bit of time so give it a couple of minutes go for a walk relax go for a jog run a marathon have a good time and then you can come back it'll still be there it'll probably be almost done at that point okay grab some tea because the finishing touches so we needed to take some time build up that ritualistic experience so when it's finally live you feel this cathartic experience right because it wouldn't be fun if it just got done fast so relax enjoy go walk around and then come back and we'll be good to go all right there we go the deployment is done let's click it and let's see if our app is indeed live so let's click that link right there let's go and boom look at that you guys your app is up and running okay i'm going to scroll down over here beautiful look so slick here's about me section if we click my github it should take you to the github link my coding projects if we click the demo it should take us to the demo beautiful my experience part is there where i've worked previously what the clients are saying and then hey here's my linkedin you should hit me up so there you go your app is completely deployed you've built it from scratch you have a point and click editor built in with next typescript server side rendering content management system image optimization mobile friendliness dear lord get any better now with that said i hope you've enjoyed building this application as much as i have had fun i hope you had the same amount of fun with that said i love your beautiful face this is qazi and as always i'll see you in the next video
