guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer knockoff in this video we're going to talk about some a lot of stuff hey you what is up how's it going missus Kazi from clever programmer calm with tons in with what stuff calm how we said what's up what alright my boy over here just flew in from Chicago and one of the things I want to talk about in this video is the ability to make a change and to actually act on it and then to go through with it because of the record this is my first time finding it out yes yes he didn't even know where I actually make this video so there we go one of the things that a lot of us struggle with is how do we actually change our environment we hear it in psychology books we hear 20 Robbins talk about it or you know whoever your personal development whatever guru is or selfhelp book they'll say change your environment go somewhere else but a lot of people they'll say that I have my home somewhere right you'll associate a placement home you have friends there you have relationships there so how do you break out of that to go into a new environment and how do you make those tough decisions how does it actually feel like today he just actually flew in right now okay I literally me and my friend most of what we just picked him up from the airport so what we'll be able to hear you know when I'm talking with him you'll feel you know whether I don't know if there's pain I don't know if he how he's feeling about it but you'll not only be able to hear that in his voice in his eyes see it but you'll also be able to understand how he made this decision to do this because like if he can make this decision maybe it can inspire you to you know you're in some other country or in some other city and you know something that you need to do and you need to change your environment whether it's you flying out and going somewhere else or changing your environment of friends it's a hard thing but uh hopefully after watching today's video it'll make it a little bit easier for you to actually overcome it let me ask you bro go shoot oh shoot I'm here what caused you first of all to want to fly out here to LA and not stay in say Chicago well it's all about progress you know like number one thing that I think everybody should focus on is always like moving forward in life and selfawareness is really important so for me I have noticed that you know when I was in Chicago I wasn't doing as much you know I was I was just just doing enough just being okay with being average and you know like reading like books like 10x Grant Cardone like at mine let and all these guys you know you can listen to them you can like read their books you can like listen to their podcasts and do all that but at the end of the day it's like you know listening and learning is fun but that that doesn't mean anything you know like until you actually like take action towards whatever goal you're working on so for me like I'm nowhere close to anywhere like of my goals like and like nothing close to it any of them like health wealth family relationships everything okay so you know it's very stagnant again like it all depends on you you know it's not because of California it's not because of freaking LA to be honest like I feel like Ellie's over height but but it's more about like people you know and I know that this guy right here anytime we're together okay every time and any time in the history of us being friends holy history of being friends the deepest dream history here you know every time like we've had fun and we get done you know like we we make like leaps and bounds of progress like when most people they work on something hard and they're progressing their progression is like linear right linear like when we're working together are our progressions like freakin xsquared like literally exponential yeah that's that's really why I mean it's it's tough you know it's tough like moving out from from your apartment from your house that you have lived in for so long with friends around that you're you're you've been comfortable with you know that you're comfortable with the routine that you're comfortable with but you know comfort is often not what you need you know from for me it's it was so easy to push it off like I pushed it off for so long like so many months I suppose like move out like glass octooctooctopus ultros so I just closed my tap whatever whatever I was working on I just command space ch enter and command T and you were united and sure everything's autocomplete it and I just booked my ticket you know I just booked my ticket because I know this is the right thing to do because I know that just coming here and being with this guy right that flex right before you did that it's getting jacked you know being jacked but but you know just like lifting I know I'm gonna like I'm gonna hit my lips now I'm not gonna like miss my days because of some some random excuse or because you know I couldn't make it to the gym or because I had to do some video or whatever it is like cuz you know this guy just knows I'm lying like anybody else I can kind of fool them you know this guy knows bro come on bro come on bro I'll call you that's some bullsh some so yeah that's a that's that's really it you know just the right thing to do I honestly feel like if people are true friends with other people they should call them out when to see them lacking in some way right it doesn't mean you lecture them it doesn't mean you all like are a teacher or whatever but like if you see your friend lacking right in some way let's say your friend is not taking care of their health as well as this should and you can maybe help them then it's your responsibility to kind of give them that push and your friend should give you that push to when you need it right like for example for you know I'll give you a business example for clever program or the profitable programmer the the course I have I needed to make a sales page for that that describes the benefits of that product to offer my story and it's hard like writing those sales pages is very very hard and it takes a very long time and I never wanted to really do it and I did everything I could to avoid it and then you came a few weeks ago to the lame and it allowed like he called he's like hey you know why isn't your sales page ready like you should actually kind of be working on it and then we started talking about it and I started thinking and thinking and it went from like a onepage sales page or one page offer to Oh a 46 page sales page like you know it inspired me to like just put in a ridiculous amount of work and and then when people see it now they're like wow this you know if it's not the right course for them it's very easy for them to tell but if it is the right course for them now it's incredibly easy to tell and they're like wow I can see how this course works I can see how it's different I'm in and a lot of that happened because I was honestly inspired and motivated and when you were here you felt you were motivated to add more modules put in more work right for your course and your products if you guys don't know him what's your channel tell them what's dev Tom so what's dev calm right so he's running that YouTube channel and he's helping those people become frontend developers and he has a course on that and so it inspired him to just like put in more work but you know business is one thing and it's one aspect of your life but then there are many other aspects of your life right like if you every time I would sit down and I would put down the values I have and this is something really really important okay that I want you to understand when I put down my values I always put health first then I put business then I put the relationships and then let's say I put experiences okay now that's what my value system says right except I'm a liar because I'm not sleeping I'm not getting enough sleep I have poor sleep I'm not eating the right amounts of food I'm not eating as many times I shouldn't be eating I'm not going to the gym I'm not I'm doing a lot of sedentary stuff like I'm sitting in front of a computer writing emails creating new content and all that stuff is great but like if health is truly my number one priority I am a liar because my actions aren't see if I meet you and I have to believe between what you say and what you do I'll always believe what you do and if what you do isn't in line with what you say then you essentially are a liar right but I had to look within myself and so I saw that my health goals weren't on point and I'm lucky I'm a liar and that and my business goals were kind of on track so I didn't feel really like a liar in business but you know when it came to relationships or certain other things even experiences I felt like I wasn't really moving forward in that direction and there is something to be said about like what actually makes you happy you know if you're actually happy you know there's there's this like fine line there because how would you describe the difference between being complacent and being actually happy do you know what I mean right like for example when you told me that you know your you were like you figured out a certain way you're like hey I can do this I can make money just by doing this certain thing and it almost made you feel like you were being you know complacent or happy exactly and one thing I want to say on that is the way I kind of define it is like look a lot of you like if you're watching this there's a lot of potential inside of you and if you're doing something way below what your max level is then I honestly think you're being complacent right you don't have to define happiness with like you not working because we can be working and be happy right like honestly right now I'm making this video I mean working working really makes you happy when you don't work or don't do anything and it just it just like drives you crazy it it's not like like a parent like you know like black and white it's but it just like slowly kills you like it's very subtle and you don't like notice it right away but you know you you don't put in that action one day and then that did one day turns into two days and then three days four days and then you know weeks months and then you look back and you just feel det you just feel down your your your confidence is down you're like everything is down and at that point anything you touch it's not gonna really end well right so keep going keep going no a hundred percent I want to like know that pain that you felt right or if there was any and I think there was pain of one just leaving you know are the memories just like walk through that actual process see if you can kind of tap into that because people watching I feel like you know they go through that stuff I got and people feel like there's no people feel like you and I or maybe you like don't feel anything you know and it's important for them to understand like hey if you're one just because I'm on YouTube doesn't mean I don't have those same emotions or just because he's on YouTube doesn't mean he doesn't have those same emotions I kind of bounce back pretty quickly so once I came to Cali LA you know I look at the weather just look at the Sun man just look at look at this Beach I mean it's it's it's beautiful you know so when you when you're in a when here in a place like this I mean it's kind of hard to you know feel down now being that being said you know when I was in Chicago and actually making that decision it was really hard because with that apartment with that house with that environment with that city a lot of things not really things like memories were attached to them you know like and it's not like crazy party or crazy thing that I miss or I you know I was getting sad over or whatever it was mostly like those little subtle things you know like going going up to my friend and saying hey want to get some drinks or you know going to the bar or just playing playing video games like don't start what we would do is just like close the room set the air conditioning on like perfect temperature go to the gas station right before okay plan everything out you'd get water would make sure we have water we'll make sure we have Red Bull or monster so then we can play for like hours and hours and then it will get in close the door in that perfect way like sometimes you know we don't want to close it all the way so that the room doom doesn't get too hot because there's multiple computers running like in a small room like three four people you know so and those things you know those memories those little memories like and us like sitting in and like him sitting on my bed and then I'm like on my chair and we're deciding to go skydiving for the very first time like in four days we're like all right let's do it and those things are or what I miss you know it's not it's not so much of like the city or other things it's just it's just a lot of memories attached with it and you know it's and it's not it's not even a big deal like I know it's not even a big deal because right now what I'm what I was feeling because right now I don't feel anything right I know this is good you know like I know that what like I feel peace right now I'm at like my heart's at peace and I feel really really peaceful because I know I've made the right decision even though it's hard to make that decision right to moving like to move out and doing all that like just thinking about it is like oh man I gotta do this I gotta do that I got to do the paperwork I got to do this I got you got to move it move out where if what are you gonna do with the car what are you gonna do with this you know what are you gonna tell your parents like so many logistical issues and you know it that's how I was thinking about it for so long but deep down I knew that you know all I needed was an avalanche and by that I mean like you know I'm I'm someone who needs a lot of push to do something you know real quick Steve Pavlina you guys should check out the blog he calls it plotters versus bursters Bursar's are are fascinators our chronic procrastinators and I am a bursar I wait till the deadline is there or I'm about to fail school or I'm about to get like my parents are about to dump me or something and that's when I get that burst of energy and I do something and plotters on the other hand are they just plod along they don't need a lot of push a lot of energy and they just do it there's nothing bad between the two but how I describe Mustapha is that his power is plotting because he can start something and you can just keep going like when he goes to the gym he's zero motivation and he like he did it one day they're always kind of cool and then just like never miss right right whereas I need to constantly every day before I get into the gym and spent three hours actually building up momentum or watching something to just keep that fire going so definitely check it out by Steve Pavlina great great article you want to continue or thought yeah avalanche and you know I'm a big procrastinator burster right so I need an avalanche okay that's that's how I usually picture it when I see the avalanche I still don't do anything okay if it's like up there like coming from the top of the mountain I'm still like I got time you know most people okay since they're like they're human and they can think right they're like holy [ __ ] an avalanche is coming got a run got it got to take action right me no I still got time to like you know prepare a bonfire get myself warm get a jacket on eat some like get something to eat Tilikum right still calm methodical and I only move when the avalanche is like right here like right right behind me okay it has to be that close for me to take action so for me without too much of about the Avalanche really what I'm talking about what the Avalanche is that when I when I was making this decision even though it's really hard I didn't have an avalanche I didn't have anybody pushing me so what I had to do was create my own Avalanche so what I did is I just bought the ticket I had no clue that I was coming here like a few days ago no idea at all I was initially planning to like come here in the next few months right just like back in October in a few months but I knew it's not gonna happen and I just had to make my own Avalanche and guess what like moving out took literally less than a day albeit like my friend helped me out a lot but you know less than a day and was done like cleaning like all my stuff were out I fixed like oh I did all my paperwork in less than a day and it just got done in like two days and then I had a date left over just to relax and then I just came here note to the people who are bursters like us just give yourself deadlines put yourself in a situation where you're just forced forced to do something so for example for Tenzin it was just booking the ticket to come to LA you know or booking the ticket and then it's like okay because before like he said he wanted to take you know oh yeah just give me a week or another week or another and then it just it's very comforting it's relaxing it's something that you know and it it's a cycle just continues and the day after day passes you never really feel like you have to do anything but then when you give yourself a deadline you you feel like you have to do it whereas like a plotter he would just like start packing like a one item a day and just like consistently just keep packing and like you know exact week he'll be done packing there was zero pressure and then he'll just be like on his way okay so how would you describe this right you like you how are you feeling about in terms of your growth in every aspect of your level did you feel it was growing or did it feel like it was lacking and if it was why do you think that that was the case well definitely not growing at least the level that that I want the level of growth that I want nowhere close to it so it's more of again like I said like I mentioned earlier it's more about more of like being average and being okay with it that's what scared me the most above all you know just because in the beginning when you don't do something you feel bad right you miss a mislead missed a day in the gym or you know you don't do something or you procrastinate one thing you feel bad about that but once you do it again and again and again what starts happening is that you don't feel bad anymore at one point you just stop feeling bad and then you start rationalizing you're like hmm I mean finance is good life is good at least I don't have diabetes at least I don't have diabetes at least at least my PR was 265 at one point squat at least you know and CeCe I'm not dead right so you start rationalizing and you don't feel bad anymore and you're okay with being stagnant that's pretty complacent right that guy that's what got me scared the most and you know I was contemplating and thinking about that for so long and it still gives me the heebiejeebies like it's just like like just thinking about that so Wow I was in that state you know so so when you're in that state you know again like I'm I'm kind of happy because again I was aware enough to know that I was in that state so hence I made the decision to come here right so but you know again it's it's not just coming here that's going to change everything I just know that when oh when I come here and I'm with this guy when I'm with people around like people around me who have the same vision as me people around me who think the same way that I do back back home you know even though I have really good friends even though I my life was you know a lot of people would want my life to be honest with you just not do a lot of work and just do the things that you want like binge watch anime or binge watch like your favorite show for days on end or you know play video games anywhere you want any anytime you want right a lot of people want that but for me that's that's not my ultimate life right that's not my like highest level of I don't know like the ultimate life you know I what I want is balance I want all the fun I want like playing video games I want all that but I also want no work right also on I also have my business goals I also have my health goals and you know the the harsh true story is that you know I'm nowhere near where I want to be so that's that's pretty much it and yeah real quick if you had to define like how confident you feel at this point how confident would you put yourself in terms of what just overall like do you feel more confident like if for example compared yourself to like let's say a year ago year and a half ago to now do you feel like you have you feel less confident or more confident I feel like confidence comes from your work ethic so like I said earlier what I was saying about when you keep when you miss something and when you just procrastinate after a long time you you lose confidence that's that's that's 100% and this is right now it's definitely not the level definitely not my highest point okay I've had I've had days where I where I thought I could do anything okay I'm nowhere close to that but just coming here just be making that decision maybe more confident like if you just cut if you just compared me to like three days ago and versus now me you'd be like what what just happened did he like take drugs or something there is he on cocaine or something it's it's that big of a difference you know it's like these small actions it's not about like making huge you you know moving out and that might look like something huge or whatever but it's not really you know it's you just I just bought a ticket and just came here that's it but it's the little action when it accumulates over a period of time weeks months that makes you more confident you know 100% I want to take a second here to talk about like we're selfesteem and confidence actually comes from so a lot of the times people think confidence comes from like somebody skydives and that builds their confidence and somebody goes rollercoaster and that builds their confidence and they watch horror stuff or go to haunted houses like do something dangerous and that builds up their confidence well that might be true at a superficial level temporarily you feel in that state of high but that's not actually your deep inner confidence it doesn't build there a lot of the times your confidence builds from an ed my let talks about this and Tony Robbins talks about this is your self values and your self ideal when those are in line okay where your actions are in line with yourself ideal that's where actual confidence comes from okay so for example if you see your ideal self in a great health great shape and you take action every day to take care of your body take care of how you look put time into it you'll start being a little bit more confident because you're trying to do it for your health and every day right another thing that I'd my let talks about is a private how many private promises you keep with yourself okay so let's say that your goal is health and you're going to the gym that's you keeping a private promise with yourself consistently you say I'm gonna show up at 5 a.m. or 10 a.m. somewhere and you showing up at that time it's not just honesty what's actually happening is that you're practicing keeping a promise with yourself and the more of those promises actually keep with yourself it builds proof in your brain that you are not a liar and what you say you actually get done and that's why people are confident you can see in their eyes that they're confident their eyes have like a little bit of a glint in the shore of themselves right it's that and regardless of how you feel what your emotions are like you know I talked about this you know I feel like a lot of people are just like leaf in the wind they go about their day like how it feels right so now anything through dillydallying there's just like a leave they're like Oh like right now I'm just gonna like walk or right now I'm just gonna like go to this party and have fun and I'm gonna like go to the talk to this one person like three hours and like there's nothing wrong with any of those things but because none of the actions that took took them somewhere closer to their self ideal right so for yours for example your self ideal might be fearless like you wanna have less fear it might be out you want to be a leader you want to be more you want to be powerful you want to be strong you want to have more money you know and so if you do nothing throughout the day that moves you closer to any of those things at the end of the day you're not gonna feel very confident in yourself right because every time you're like goddamnit I keep saying I want those things and I never have them and so then you get more and more lack of confidence and that's where it truly comes from you know the reason why Conor McGregor or Zlatan Ibrahimovic are so confident is not cuz they won all those fights that's not actually where his confidence was built okay why is he still confident than after losing to Nate Diaz his confidence should just vanish in thin air the reason is that every day he tells himself he's gonna come to 500 a.m. right the reason why Conor McGregor says work ethic my confidence comes from my work ethic that's it I know the work onput name he goes work ethic and why is work I think is what gives him contrast every time he tells himself I'm gonna show up to the gym at 500 a.m. and I'm gonna you know work till 7 a.m. and he just does it day in and day out regardless of how he feels whether he's sick or not whether he's injured or not he every single day whether he goes on a vacation whether he's with family whether he's whatever he'll find us a way to get it done that's where his confidence comes from a lot of the times people think confidence comes from him winning a lot of the times people think rich people's confidence comes from from them making money they're like if I had this much money I'd be that confident know that person was that confident before he got the money then he the money right that person with that confident before he had a 130 record in UFC and then you got the 130 record in the UFC okay so your selfesteem and your confidence actually comes from the private promises you make yourself and how in line you are with your values right so you know that sometimes some of the times the reason why there are times where I feel like less confident whatever right but at this point in my life right now I feel pretty motivated and overall I'm not at my peak of motivation but I feel pretty motivated and I'm moving in a lot of the directions where the the values that I have now there are a lot of things that I need to improve and you know kind of 10x how grant cardone would say but you know I have I still feel like I have that motivation like if you zoom into my eyes right now just like zoom in right now just look into my eyes and if you're watching this video right now just comment below and just let me know like did these eyes they feel like I don't have drive I don't have ambition or how did it make you feel when I'm looking at you how does it actually make you feel maybe give me some goose bump you know and you know and I want to talk about this like you can honestly see in a person's eyes how their drive is how that ambition is and how happy with their with their life right they might superficially say oh I'm happy in my life I'm happy with everything that I have but it might just be like a broken record that they just keep regurgitating but they don't actually believe in it right they don't actually believe in it's something that they just say but I feel like you can tell a lot by a person's eyes and the scariest thing for me to see is when you have somebody who's talented when somebody who can achieve so much when somebody has incredible amount of potential but then they go through the system or they go through social conditioning or what other people like kind of bring them down because you either have anchors around your engines as Darren Hardy says and compound the fact and if other people are bringing you down what ends up happening is you'll have these really amazing people they're talented they're amazing and then you see the you see the glint in their eyes kind of lonely disappear so slowly go away and they're alive but they're actually dead way before they're physically gonna die and that's like that's honestly one of the things that scares me the most and I see that in you know a lot of people you know you look around go to you can even go to like a place like coffee bean or Starbucks and you can see they're people who are working there some of them they still have ambition Drive want to do a lot of stuff in latter lives and there's some that you can actually look into their eyes and it's almost like they have given up and they're resigned to life okay so when those kind of things are happening you know let it be a trigger for you and kind of a red flag for you that your motivation and those things you know if they're if they're going away that has to be a red flag you have to kind of immediately change that it's equivalent of like drowning the only thing is that you don't actually feel like that it actually feels really comfortable right actually feels really nice and cozy and fuzzy and not only warm know like being complacent being happy with you know what I mean or like your ambitions leaving your your Drive leaving you it's not like you don't feel like you're drowning you know what I mean you kind of feel like it's everything is okay everything is just fine everything is just awesome but it's kind of like quicksand you just keep going in going in going in you don't realize it right away but you you're gonna realize it maybe you know a few weeks months or if it's like really bad then maybe years yeah but yeah that's that's not a place it's not a really good place to be in yeah scary place to be in so here's what we would like to wrap this up as if you're watching this so far right there are a lot of things that we shared and a lot of emotions that we shared but what I want you to leave with is not a feeling of confusion and overwhelmed but rather one of your motivated and excited no matter where you are if you have Drive in a mission right now keep that fire burning but the message to you is don't be around other people who kill that fire like you need to stay somewhere where that fire keeps burning right I like add my light sets if you are a hundred and ten degree and somebody around you is eighty degree or they'll warm up to you and they'll become ninety degree or a hundred degree or right but if you're around just a lot of like fifty degrees then eventually your temperature will go down so you want to be mindful of that if you're ambitious you're driven and all those things and if you feel like you don't have that same ambition that drive you're like hey man I don't really feel that what is that then then not maybe but I guarantee you you have that drive inside of you you have that giant within you you have that wolf that beast inside of you that's kind of just tamed and taught to just relax and chill and put your dreams on pause then it's enough and be grateful and whoa why do you want more those are just two other people and why aren't you happy with this why don't you just get a pension at the end of thirty five years of working at the same place and that's so good compared to like the people in 1920s who didn't even get a job or worked in really terrible conditions in a mining place and so there are different routes you can go right but I would urge you that look you have a lot of potential inside of you right you're watching this right now and you've watched it so far and you if you've understood this so far there's clearly a fire within you my it might just be tamed right now so to burn it basically come to frickin LA right and you know and and come to our let's just like a free tour for everybody let's just run a free tour that would be awesome I'd love to do that if you're actually from LA do type that down below so if we won't ever want to run a free tour we actually will but that was kind of a joke that now is the serious thing I just tried to do halfjoking but if you want to build that fire inside of you right and it's not there we'll just look around you it's because the fire in the people around you isn't there so just be around those people that kind of have that far you don't have to be around people who are like in tents and can't live life be around people who are in tents and still enjoy the same things you might right so you can be around somebody who's like jacked but still loves don't starve together the video game you know awesome video game you can be around somebody who's incredibly intelligent but still loves to go jet skiing every weekend you know so all you have to do just find those people just go and do that you know you owe it to yourself and it was incredibly hard decision for him right you could probably see it in his eyes if you zoom in even even if he doesn't say anything it might be a hard decision for you or not right but you owe it to yourself to make that leap make that decision maybe it's not changing where you're living but might be changing your friends around you or if you're a developer it might be changing the people around you maybe you want to be around people who are coding more right that's essentially it okay so that's the action that I would like you to take if you're burning hot be around those people find more people who are burning hotter than you and if you're cold right now again be around people who are burning hot and the same things you want to be burning hot in okay you can still find great friends or also have passion and drive and motivation all that stuff okay okay actually do it alright comment below this video you have any parting words basically to sum it all up all right boo take action in action these two you know you be not not confident okay and ya be around people that you want to be around like people who have the same vision as you not just people who you you know are comfortable with being around that's it that's it bro keep it with that said leave a comment below if you enjoyed this video and engage in this conversation with us we'll jump in and we'll comment I promise like this video subscribe to the damn channel if you haven't already with that said as always I love your faces off and we'll see you in the next video do
