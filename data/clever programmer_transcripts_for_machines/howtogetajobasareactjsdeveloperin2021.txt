guys what is up how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com and today we're going to talk about how to get a job as a react js developer in 2021 i have some really phenomenal resources i want to take you guys through and especially from a perspective of a recruiter and i'm now going through a process of hiring tons of developers and i want to share a lot of key insights with you guys today i'm on a call with the profit with javascript squad so guys do me a favor and uh unmute yourselves where's zoom yo you guys guys and just say hi what's up guys let's go yo we got the whole squad in the house awesome so welcome youtube family welcome zoom family and the pwj family and with that said let's jump straight into it so um pwg pwj gang can you guys see my screen right now where it says learn react.js with me so the resources i want to share today oh through the camera i thought i shared the screen oh okay okay cool yeah there we go there we go so i want to share some really good resources today so one i want to talk about how to get a job as a react gs developer and what your proposals and stuff should look like right here on upwork i want to show you guys what type of portfolio projects should you have on your portfolio that catch the attention of developers and land you jobs i want to talk about some great resources to make your designing skills next level um like these ones some resources to be able to launch your projects online really really fast and and from uh from a perspective of a recruiter of what you can be better prepared for when it comes to going and getting these job interviews does that sound good with you guys beautiful awesome so let's get started with the first thing all right so one thing i want to say is as i'm now being a recruiter and going through tons and tons of job applications and by the way you guys are welcome to apply to the job application if you guys want as well the link is clever programmer dot actually what is it cleverprogrammer i think.workable.com.workable.com so if any of you guys want to apply feel free to apply it's open to everybody who's watching it on youtube as well so uh there you go but so as i'm going through it i'm realizing a lot of like what types of stuff am i ignoring what type of stuff am i not really looking at and what type of people am i declining versus the people who i am okay cool what type of people i'm giving a chance to so whoever is on this call by the way guys just mute yourselves if you have some sounds going on in the background so anton was somebody who stood out when he actually applied to my job posting there were a bunch of people that did not stand out and i rejected them and one of the things i want to share why he stood out was of his project everybody's going to talk a big game they're all going to say i have a lot of experience with react redux and they're going to say these hot keywords right because these are like the hot technologies right now have you guys heard of redux and things like that with the react yeah yeah so this is one of those things that a lot of people will talk about but i want to see what your projects look like so here when i went to take a look at this project this is a solid project on a portfolio it's very clean it's fast and it's simple would you guys agree that this looks pretty good so this made him stand out for me another types of projects like um i saw that really stood out and blew me away i was like wow this is a person i want to interview and get on a call with was uh were the type of people where they had um they would have um you can log in so like the design here is what do you guys think this design is pretty cool right and what's cool is that there's a demo login so most times i go into these apps and if you want to have an app guys please don't have recruiters log in with the right credentials so many times your apps will not get used simply because you have authentication that the recruiter who's trying to check your projects doesn't have access to okay so it makes a ton of sense to have a demo login over here on the left maybe also go ahead it will be also called just like privacy issues to recruit us on this website or something that's right that's right i think that as well i'm like um you know i don't know this person i don't think i'm gonna put in my password right so on the left hand side you can see this they have a pretty slick ui ux experience here and already visually i can tell that this developer really knows how components are working so because i can see here on this left hand side i can see all of this stuff here where the leaks are and then this is being rendered on the fly without me having to refresh when i click this it's a pretty slick ui when i go and i try to create something enter the name of your league let's profit with javascript gang let's put a hopefully it doesn't break um and guys please don't spam their thing because they're not expecting any traffic right so like if you're watching this don't spam it please all right so we created a league and i think it's going to get populated over here on the left hand side it takes a little bit of time to populate but it does end up doing it ultimately that's what i realized so that was one thing that i was like that's a little bit slow what what what is the back end is it uh uh his back end i don't know this person's back end i i don't know i would have to once i'm in an interview i'll ask him when i'm when i'm but this person did get a chance to get an interview from us so when i'm speaking with him um he'll probably go into detail behind his code and um how he went through it by the way do any of you guys want to you know right now you guys are on this call do you guys want me to go through your portfolio or your projects do any of you guys want me to do that yeah yeah yeah yes no um okay but you can go through it yeah uh did you drop it as a link yeah yeah in the chat box okay so let's take a look at it oh it was it's fast it's really fast yeah basically yeah uh again wow that's it it's really really i mean i love the speed of this and it's it flies and you need to just type in test just type in test heroku.com oh so if i saw this my real i'm gonna be is it okay if i'm just gonna be really honest with you guys here on this call if i saw this i would actually give you i would actually reach out for an interview most a lot of developers don't have this stuff on there they have broken links or like really really baby projects that i just ignore when i see like really small projects it's like the simplest todo list app or something that i feel like they just picked up from a tutorial but this has multiple pages that i can go through it has rod register login none of the functionality seems broken and um even when i go to each thing like how you were saying it was pulling uh git repos for you know sven when i went and it was pulling it and it looks like it's actually working so that's a really good sign to me so this would actually get you a um interview i really think so but this is not here i'm still working on my my portfolio yeah another group well yeah that's my feedback for you so sorry thank you so much really good job another app that this person had on their portfolio really like blew my mind and i was really excited about this so i went here it's no nosy robin hood so i'm like okay let's see how it works right now there's demo and i was already excited i'm like oh demo version because as a recruiter i hate signing up to all of these just to test them and i just ignore it so your app will not get used by a recruiter if you don't have a demo login so always have a demo login then i click the demo login and let me in look at that that's a pretty sick front end right that's pretty damn good it is cool let me do that let's do that all right and as i was going through it if they're using a charting library that seems pretty on point um i would okay so let's see what happens if i try to let's see if i need to move this here so let's see what happens if i try to change the wow it's responsive too right really responsive so that's a really good sign when i see that it's responsive and can i buy new shares uh okay so let's type in tesla and type in that okay so freaks out over tesla let's see does it freak out so that's not a good sign but honestly uh if somebody has a dummy project and it's that deep that's good enough like i'm not going to be nitpicking this and making sure every single thing in here is perfect as long as i see this i can see they have good frontend skills i see they have you know especially for a react.js developer i'm really looking for frontend skills one of the things guys that's one of the biggest turnoffs is poor frontend skills especially if you're trying to apply for react.js developer job your main thing is to provide a good ui user experience so when your frontend skills are not good and i go to your portfolio page and it looks wack that already kind of doesn't end up giving you a chance does that make sense i would worry less about a perfect cheat sheet i would worry about more like hey can i make an app that's like that looks very close to this thing i mean you know can you start off with just using html and css to design something that looks like this that would be a great start and then going next level and because it's not just you need more technologies to be able to build this right it's not like now redux can really make this happen or there is new context api that's making this happen this is just design skills so in order to improve your design skills one of the platforms i recently found which i you know this is not a promotion or anything i just found them two or three days ago i just signed up myself for them i think their design is absolutely incredible on this platform and so if you want to improve your design skills you can sign up for something like this or go to a free resource i don't care like there's dev ed there's plenty of free resources so if you don't feel like paying you don't have to just go and find something online but their design skills are like i've never seen better design skills in my life so that another resource that's good for inspiration is this because if you want to wow the recruiter you have to understand that most times recruiters are not the best developers themselves so before you can wow them with your code wow them with your actual project who here has a github do you guys want to drop your drop your links to your github profiles right now and show you zoom chat i'm going to take a look at it so uh github is another really good resource all right so let's take a look all right so tarva dropped his i'm gonna uh i'm gonna give you real feedback okay whoever's dropping i'm just gonna give you real feedback on it so here i'm gonna go instantly when i look at this i'm like okay he's modeling when i see clones i'm like okay he's getting this from some tutorials okay so even though these are our tutorials on youtube that i have had a lot of people actually apply to our jobs using the tutorials that they've built from our platforms it's funny but uh there's nothing crazy wrong with that but one thing i do know is you you've showed me that you can uh follow a stepbystep guide somewhere and build something still doesn't show me what you are doing so right now when i see this i'm like i'm not sure what he's up to right and then i go to your githubs and i'm like that's a 109 contributions this year you have to mute yourself brother when um all good all good thank you so oh yeah because you have two two uh things you're using got it so here are 51 contributions i see i look at 2020 i'm like only 109 contributions this entire year that's not that good can i make somebody cohost here if you can help me manage the sounds all right i made you cohost as well joe okay just um any anytime there's a sound maybe sometimes people forget to turn it off okay cool so that's great so here yeah when i see 20 contra when i see 109 contributions that's good 51 0 0 so i imagine you really started in like 2019 um and then really in 2020 i want to see more contributions i this is not enough contributions okay so like for example even if you take a look at mine right it's been a while since um i've been coding a lot less now compared to how much i used to code like right now i'm running a company as ceo i'm not sitting there writing code i hire react developers right i'm not actually doing that much coding but i have 91 contributions if i go to 2019 or 2018 right uh wait this is my profile what's going on there we go so 2016 you can see i was super active right so it doesn't need to be this crazy but it should be somewhere here where when i look at your ear i can see oh this person is coding a lot they're learning a lot whatever it may be so it's a good sign not the only sign but if i see your portfolio and it doesn't look that good i'm gonna give you another chance by looking at your github so if your github or your portfolio both let me down then i'm just going to move on that makes sense at tarva okay oh there's also i have a question if you just so hold on so tell me again what your question is so if i go to your home page of github or what yes so here right here if you just see i have my hand less contributions so as a recruiter i might if i see something kind of interesting that catches my eye um you know if you have some type of like right now i don't know why but i just don't feel like clicking on any of these because they're php this is android so like i'm just kind of avoiding them right now but if you have projects i might click on them and look inside i'm looking for you know can you also code on your own not just follow tutorials really important and what are your skills and how do you do it so what i'm going to do is when i go to you know say i go to your portfolio i'm going to actually even click on your commits and see how you're committing and i'm going to see how many commits you have done and i'm going to see what you've done in those commits so here's your initial commit right this is what you did in your initial commit and then whatever you did in your next commit but generally i don't want to spend that much time just because we have so many job applications so unless there's something really good signs i'm seeing already i'm going to not go that deep into it so when you okay one thing i recommend is if you don't have job experience which almost every single person that's applying to our thing doesn't have job experience as very limited job experience you need to have really solid project experience if you have really solid you know you're doing tons of projects you will get a shot if you can prove that you're coding and you're hungry not just through your words but your actions because github doesn't lie you will get a shot but you know if it's only tutorial based stuff that you've then you won't really get a shot they'll move on make sense okay so i would definitely like to see some more of your projects even if they're not that great right i want to see some of your additions in here um who else shared their so let's see here we got is it george or jorge cisco okay jorge you got it all right so good photo so taro another thing put a photo i have this funny saying no photo no employment um put a photo like it's so freaking helpful you have no idea uh even i'm doing a little bit of recruiting right now and me and daniel were going through it and we ended up developing such a strong bias towards like uh somebody having a photo versus not it's not the only thing but you have to understand okay we're gonna be working with this person for a really long time right so it it actually helps to see your face or to see you smiling or something you're like oh okay cool so the culture fit is actually more important than even the technical competence so i don't know if you guys know this but like they did a study of uh 20 000 hires and they mentioned it in this book called the hiring for attitude okay that's what the book hiring for attitude and uh in this study what they found is only 11 of the and they did a study of over 18 months of each new hire and what they found is only 11 actually failed uh because of technical competence okay 89 of the people and when i say fail what that means either resigned or were terminated 89 of the people failed because of soft skills okay so what does that mean this is broken down how they broken down into is like coachability um temperament of that person in other words how i like to put it in really simple terms is vibe check did they pass the vibe check or not okay so what's that person's vibe what's their personality like do you see yourself wanting to work with them over a long period of time or do you feel like they're going to be a really good technically skilled you don't want that right you guys don't want to work with somebody who's like intellectually superior and like tries to make everybody else feel down so that's the last type of person people want to work with so that's what they found was leading to this most companies a lot of their interviewing process is actually mostly culture fit and then they go into the interviewing process of technical skills if you hear nasa's story some of his interviews didn't even have any technical portion to it right so uh very important a lot of the people that work on our team at clever programmer nobody ever really had to go through a technical assessment it was mostly like what's the culture fit what's the level of the culture fit because people can still train you so good photo finance developer capable of or freelance developer i'm sorry okay cool using proper communication with clients got it and uh so i i think i need to i need to change that because i i i kind of used that yeah i was thinking i'm like this looks like i was laughing i was thinking about that right now hey what's up bro just mute yourself for now please awesome happy new year oh happy new years yeah that's actually awesome in sri lanka too so amanda uh it's happy new year's for him that's amazing guys isn't this exciting that we're getting to celebrate the new year's together like i actually think that's pretty freaking cool right that's awesome that gets me so hyped up like thank you guys for actually being on here i appreciate you guys so much and uh antonio that's actually a really dope background i just noticed so causey yeah you you so far along you talked about github and he never mentioned linkedin is that one thing that recruiters don't look at no i look at that too so i'll click on the resume and then i'll click on linkedin yeah i will definitely recruiters look at it for sure that's a that's a good catch so uh but i'll tell you what i look for i'm looking for like i'll go and see what's your you know usually people have their photos on there so i'm gonna go see okay what's your um you know what what's your personality like do you seem like a friendly person i'll see what you're writing about what's your past experience and i might look at your endorsements endorsements is one another thing that's kind of important so yeah here if you had a portfolio jorge i would want to definitely take a look at your portfolio um github wise for me this is you know there's just not a lot of action going on sometimes you know people are working on private repositories i understand that that's possible but if your portfolio doesn't catch my eye and then i go dig deeper into your github and that also doesn't really catch my eye and i feel like there's like um kind of you know new level projects that you might be doing then i'm gonna be likely to skip past it if that makes sense so for me personally i definitely want to see more code or more projects i think that'd be a great sign okay cool so projects is i need to go ahead i'm sorry i i need to start doing more projects i mean and add them to my profile yes please and add them and like okay so let's say i go to one of your uh let's say i go to this right well if i'm a recruiter and i go to this i want to see a link to to check this out i might not understand the code that much so i want to see what this is about and what what's what's on the website i want to see that uh as well and when i look at the code it it doesn't seem like a lot of code so you know i i can't really figure out the your skill level from this project so that's one thing i recommend you guys any projects you have always make it really easy to to um always have links okay so i can click your thing and check your demo uh make it so that there's a readme this does not have a readme that's another like bad sign so readme should give me clear instructions on what this is and how i can use it a link to the actual working application huge things guys you get gets you massive points uh where would you have the video i'm sorry so if you clicked on the app right so like here yeah yeah and then you went you said in the about um okay that's a tough one i would i would give the recruiter an option because recruiters like i have to go through 50 job applications or 100 job applications you know and i only have like 20 minutes 30 minutes of time so on average recruiters won't take more than five to seven seconds if there's a link of your app i just get to use it and check it out really fast if i have to go through a video that might take me a long time and your explanation of going through it so i'd recommend if you want to do that put two options right like here's the what i would actually recommend is in the readme i would put a guide on how to use this or what this software is and i would put that demoing the app i think that was that would be really great if it's you demoing the app and you're like here there's here this project is there a way i can mute everyone and then thank you so if you want to talk joe just go ahead and mute yourself so yeah i would recommend adding like a demo oh crap i got it i would recommend adding in the demo like a little video demo of the app that's a great sign hey here's how the blog page works here i'm using react routers to switch between the pages that's why you don't see a refresh here i'm using redux to manage the state that's why when you're going between this file and this file you know the the data layer has you know this is managing the state and blah blah blah so as you're going through the app that's how i would recommend to to do it if you were demoing it okay so great let's um yep so that's one thing i really liked about anton he had bunch of projects and then he had i mean this is by peloton so when i see peloton i'm like okay that's a big deal to have your name with peloton but i definitely still another thing i um thought was great about anton is he actually submitted a cover letter most people don't submit cover letters so he went above and beyond on that and whenever you submit a cover letter i'd highly recommend to try to make it to make it um as specific to the person that you're applying for the job you're applying for as possible okay so this is for design i really recommend yeah like learning some design skills guys they are so valuable and even if you have a simple app that's not the most complicated app on the planet you have to understand that as a recruiter uh i'm seeing what catches my eye i'm scanning really really fast so if i go to your portfolio and it's money and it's it gets me the information i'm looking for fast that's all i need does that make sense right and then once i see what your things look like then my next step is to jump into your code a little bit but in the start not so much in the start i'm just like visually seeing so these are some great resources you guys can write down about like shape.so is one good resource for illustrations and design and angle.sh is another good resource and it works well with figma and sketch and all of that so learn some basic skills just be dangerous enough you know you don't have to go crazy with this um a resource i discovered a few days ago which was awesome is stack blitz and they are i think in react documentation they actually refer to stack blitz as well so it's it's pretty legit platform and it's the only platform i saw that allows you to put things together really really really fast so if you're building a react project or whatever it is this allows you to it's the most lightning fast one that i've found and another really cool thing about them is one click it allows you to host to firebase so the whole time you're creating your app it's showing up here and it's live so already do you guys see that link it's not just localhost this app is already hosted so anybody can go and check it out so if i change this to say hello atharva you know or hello react js lovers but heart sign here right and save it if you go to this link this app is already hosted and this app is already uh running which is super cool so it really makes it easy for sharing it already has the react project like create app thing done and you can very easily see what dependencies your project has and if you need to install any so source good resource that i i highly recommend that you guys you guys use do you have to be a member though to get to be able to save your um your ads um to save i don't think you have to be a member i don't know why i became a member i started paying for it but to save i don't think you need to be a member because that's cool yeah yeah you don't need that code sandbox is another one they're both really good but stack blitz was just faster it was lightning fast and it actually is using visual studio code so you can just download your extensions and whatever you want just like how you would in in visual studio code another thing i want to talk to you guys about is who here knows about class components in react raise your hands or say aye cool so a few people who here knows about functional components in react okay cool so these are both good things to know about and understand if you know functional components don't skip on classbased components make sure you understand them because a lot of tutorials are in classbased components okay i thorough i'm sure like you probably looked it up in a lot of them still classbased right yeah yeah so many jobs are still using this right like and functional components is the new way to go so a lot of jobs still are on classbased components and then they're trying to move to functional components so uh no that's uh associated with uh react js but i think in react native you probably have them as well i imagine yeah you actually have them you can use it yeah whether you're doing react js or react native i think they're both there functional versus classbased components i think the only main difference between react js and react native is instead of those like html elements you're writing those like yes you're writing those like view and whatever right viewport and those types of i mean yes yep all right so great so that's good now let's so yeah this is a good resource to be able to do that and like look if you forgot how to export a function or you forgot some syntax it gets you up and running right away so you can always see what the boilerplate react app looks like without any of that additional you know additional code okay cool so make sure you understand you know the difference between you know when i when i write classbased components will look like class you know app extends react.component that's kind of what they'll look like if i'm not mistaken and then your classbased ones will look like this our function base will look just like that it'll be like function app whatever or what you might also see is this type of notation boom all right cool so that is a good resource and uh let's go here this is a great resource for you guys to go through and understand so this is a react job interview from a recruiter perspective i actually use this to prepare better for the interviews that i was doing with people okay so it has some key questions in here that it asks and you guys should know these questions when you post the link in the chat if you don't mind sure thing um and if any of you guys are watching this on youtube if you could please post this link on youtube as well that'd be great awesome thank you i just posted okay uh and if david is here if you can ask amanat for the 30 day react challenge link that would be cool too all right so these are lists of questions that are good these are not the only questions so if you prepared for them that does not mean you are now ready to get any react job there to give you a sense of you know what's going on okay so there are some questions that you guys should know about that are important so a lot of questions are behavioral questions that you will be asked i ask these all the time can you tell me about your previous job how did you fit in with the team now in in the book hiring for attitude what he says is it's bad to ask leading questions so some recruiters might not ask you leading questions so do you guys see the part where it says how did you fit in with the team that's a leading question do you guys understand what i mean when i say that yeah no leading meaning it needs so like for example what if there were 400 times or let's say what if there were 499 times where you did not fit in with the team okay but there was one time so there was only one time you did fit in with the team when you ask me this leading question i will give you this example where one time in my life i did fit in with the team does that make sense yep if i don't ask this lead in question as a recruiter then it's up to you to answer it and if you don't answer that and you don't tell me that then it probably might mean that you did not really fit well with your team uh but they will ask you i just want you to be aware that they will ask you openended questions okay so when that happens just make sure that you're answering truthfully and over communicate don't under communicate okay so they might be looking for you know you talking but you also talking about maybe how you went above and beyond one question i ask is could you tell me about a time uh you know you had a difficult situation with a coworker somebody who's a negative person might actually or as a problem maker instead of a problem solver they'll be like oh yeah there was this one time i worked with joe it was just he was just so negative and he was just so down and like you know you couldn't get pa anything past joe so eventually i just like thought okay you know um i i should just give up and and uh you know and then we just agreed to disagree and that was it so that's what does that sound like somebody who's a problem solver or problem maker problem problem maker right but if there was somebody else who was like hey yeah joe you know he had a negative outlook uh but i went and i saw that joe wasn't feeling good about this but i explained it to him from my perspective and i really worked with him to see maybe some benefits of this project and eventually joe was on board and joe actually even helped us like crush it on this project now does that sound like somebody who's a problem maker or a problem solver problem solver that's a problem solver right so that's the type of stuff that you're looking for here and there are a bunch of other questions then at some point they they recommend asking technical questions too right so some technical things that are good to understand for you guys there are a bunch of technical things here that you guys can look at so you know they'll ask questions about what's the difference between classbased components and functional components right um in a classbased component where is a good time to call the api and load data so those are um important as well all right so let me just highlight this one boom okay cool so that's good and then what do i have here hiring for attitude that's a good book for recruiters uh yeah you might you might get some insight but that book is like pretty advanced in a way that like it mostly talks about things that most recruiters are not doing you know and like it talks about how to solve that problem with recruiters and like what types of questions to ask for and so i'm i'm learning how to be a better recruiter but yeah read it and maybe it might give you some insight just overall from you know if you guys want to keep it simple on your end and not have to learn everything on the planet get really good technical skills with react understand how it's working at a really deep level so yes building clones will help you but on top of that what's going to really help you is a really solid understanding of how react works how does it work under the hood you know what are props what are states what's prop drilling how do you what does it mean when somebody says lifting a state up of the app so there are technical things that you should understand as well above and beyond that understand how to answer behavioral questions that's really really key okay so i cannot emphasize that enough most of the you you won't get into the second or the third round of the interviews until you're answering your be the behavioral questions that they ask you so if they identify that you might be somebody who's a problem maker they're not going to move you on to the next rounds so yeah actually joe now that i'm thinking about it it's probably a good book to read because it does talk about what good answers look like you know versus what bad answers look like so they actually give you a big list of good answers and bad answers and that that's usually really helpful as opposed to a disadvantage right yeah that's true you do that's true so uh what i want to do right now is open it up to you guys and whether you guys want to ask me questions or whether you guys want me to go through your portfolio definitely jump in and i would love to do that you know whether you want me to go to your portfolio or your pr or your github yeah i would like you to go in mine i posted it in the chat okay so nakanji wants me to go through your uh portfolio so i had a question okay so this is the thing i also covered in my video but uh what if some person just comes to you and gives you a portfolio so hopefully you can be of two type so i'm talking about the domain name so it can be atarwajostre.com or it can be through this dot heroku so does it make any difference as a recruiter you see netflix from our herocoat.com in the url will it sound unprofessional to you i personally don't care that much about where you host it i i mean about the domain name yeah i know that's what i'm saying like domain wise i don't really care that much about the domain i maybe a little bit of bias like when i see herokuapp.com i'm like is this person a student you know are they just like recently learning this stuff um and often times when i do see heroku app.com and when i see these ones it it does turn out that a lot of them are like students and stuff so it's it's a little bit of a bias but that could also just be me as a recruiter uh so if you you know but i would focus more on the types of projects you're building rather than your because if you have good projects and it looks damn good i don't care it could have a whatever domain name and it'll still be good okay so looking at this here let's see oh oh crap my bad sorry guys so looking at this project here um or or the uh github so one thing i recommend for you guys is code stacker has this really good video on youtube him and i should do a collab if somebody wants to send him this part of me talking about his channel please do i'd love to collab with him at some point he's i love his videos they're great so he has one on github readme you guys should definitely check this out and uh you can make your profile look awesome so for example this is what it would look like so this is an example of what your new github profile would look like you know if somebody lands here and see this that's much better than them just seeing the repos would you agree right so uh take advantage this looks really good right so make it make your github look like this i mean when i see 1500 contributions that's a really real i mean that's really good sign right that's somebody who's like coding actively i can even see here whether it was commits or code reviews if it's commits that to me that means this person is actually coding right like if it's simply code reviews and they're not doing that that difficult of tasks um i also like to see contributions so i see that this person contributed to actually a few different um wow so let's see renderless readme stats okay so let's go here so it seems like this person actually contributed to that that's a really good sign unless that's his library if it is that's pretty freaking sick but yeah there you go so if you watch that video that video tells you how to make your github profile like that okay jesus that's aggressive all right so let's go through more do you guys have more portfolios you guys want me to go through so let's see here we got um awani has a portfolio as well so let's take a look at it and if you guys have portfolio websites you know send me those as well so if not just your github so send me that so if i look at this as a recruiter i kind of immediately know uh this is somebody who's a student or learning right now which is you know there's nothing wrong with it but um you know contributions wise awani great job this was really great amount of contributions in a short amount of time so keep that up okay and are you there by the way awani yeah yeah yeah okay so good job on the contributions let's see previous years if you did anything so a little bit here and there but this year it seems like it's the year where you're actually focusing on coding so good job contributions i definitely want to see or sorry uh yeah yeah definitely see so yeah i would say you know um you're probably new to coding how new are you i have a huge break in between like i used to work but then i took a break okay so if you can work on some projects that are your own i think that'd be a really good sign because if i go through your projects that you've worked on then boom you know that's like like for example if i go to my uh what is it repositories actually i'm gonna get out of here for now just because if i can find it i don't know if it's a private repo or not let's see private so like for example if you're going through this project right this is not some big clone of some kind of app but this is a python django project and if you go through it you'll see oh okay 265 commits if you go into insights the insights will also tell you like how much how much people were committing and what's the code frequency so there's a lot of code that was added and deleted over a period of time in 2016 and if you even go through this project there's a lot going on and you can see the code so you can go through it and you can be like okay so this is what's happening here let's go look at models okay a lot is happening here right that's that's not when you see just that one file that to you doesn't seem like this is somebody who just started coding right and it also might mean that this is not just a uh project that somebody found on um like a random website this is like a fullon project that they're doing from scratch and then there's like tons of documentation that goes along with it and that was just one file out of all of the files that i've shown so this is a really really massive project so this project alone can be pretty good for like if i wanted to go in the job market this alone would be pretty good for landing me jobs for a really long time so it's a it's a good that's why if you guys instead of working on many many projects if you spent three months six months nine months working on one project i think that's that's a really smart idea because you don't really improve that much development skills honestly guys when you just keep working on more projects you will improve your skills a lot by just working on one project for a really long time okay so would recommend that really strongly okay go for it timothy so first of all thank you so much for doing this for all of us um javascript was it possible that you could um you want me to put the link for what you were talking about how to like navigate through the github uh okay so that video oh what did i do with that video thank you um did i not put that can somebody please put that video uh it's by code stacker and it's called github or readme somebody could please put that in the chat um code stacker github readme that's the if you youtube that it'll come up somebody can put the link and then uh outside of that my uh frontend skills are bad okay my ui ux skills are not that good i myself am now trying to learn and improve my skills so i'm personally going through uh this these guys uh this guy's course right now you know when i look at his front end i'm like this is the type of front end i would want to have on my website it just looks freaking gorgeous like look at this every single thing is just made with so much love and it's so good you know so i am going i'm going through this personally to improve my skills if i could recommend you something you know there are probably a lot better people than me that would give you better recommendations but one thing that i would recommend is have inspirations so like i know that you probably use dribble but whatever you're building try to build off of some inspiration that looks really good for me even though i'm bad at ui ux because i have a good eye in what looks good and you know what is simple enough and what looks good enough that alone makes me really good at it because i can just copy i can see what those are looking like so i can model it in my own design so that's one thing i would recommend outside of that i think that course is a really good place and uh yeah tommy hopefully that that helps a little bit yeah happy new year awesome let's see alan allen benjamin so are you here alex i'm here oh do you guys have this new chrome update which sucks as well that always crashes yeah yeah oh jesus um yeah goodness oh these logos look delicious okay so let's go here we got alan benjamin okay um dope photo really nice suit if you can have a simpler photo where you're smiling might be better just because if i'm on a screen that's not as big as mine or i'm on a phone i might not be able to see you that much so i think it might look better like that um outside of that on the portfolio side let's see so 56 contributions so you know it seems like uh i want you to have more contributions for sure this is you know to me it seems like you recently started coding around september is that right or no well okay cool yeah and then in terms of your projects like make your ma have some interesting projects that you know like when i look at them they're not because a lot of them it seems like they're from tutorials which is okay but what i recommend is you know sure gets get uh amazon clone or something like that from a tutorial but there's nothing stopping you from forking it and turning it into your own full projects and adding in like fullon ecommerce functionality adding in a dark mode and a light mode you know adding in fancy cards one thing that i was laughing at and i'm thinking about making a series on when i get my design skills better is um a 2050 series so what it's going to be like is it's going to be amazon and airbnb but in a futuristic 2050 design or what i think would be a futuristic design so i would just try to make it look really damn good um you know and uh just something that's fun and unique so i would recommend having doing that so these projects are your own and then let me go here also when i go to your projects there's no readme and there's no link so to me it makes you seem inconsiderate because if i'm about to hire somebody on my team i'm like it seems like this person doesn't really care like doesn't really if you were on a team with my other software developers i wouldn't want you on that team because i'd be thinking this is the guy that's not going to ride the readmes is going to do just his own thing and there's no documentation isn't making it life any easier for any other developer so i'm out so i would highly recommend to add additional readmes wherever you can add in links to the project so you know if if i'm a recruiter and you built this clone then definitely make it easy for me to see it okay okay um i don't know if you guys are familiar with readme but this file whatever you have in it right will show up down here center yeah it's uh it's a markdown file so if you guys know a little bit of markdown you can easily do it uh with markdown but yeah you can you can do it from wherever you could change it from github you could change it from your local environment push it to github but you know one thing i definitely want to see from people who are new like if you're new at least show me you're really really hungry so if this is really filled with green really good sign if there are projects outside of the amazon clone that also shows me you're hungry and you want more and you're doing coding on your own not just copying from somewhere or modeling from somewhere and then it's like okay i'm gonna do just enough to have a portfolio to get a job so try to go above and beyond it and that's a really really good sign okay but good job you have tons of repositories that you're working on and you have tons of coding stuff you're doing so that's really good and let's see what's happening here 60 days of react okay cool that's good and let's see okay adding nycd to digital clock okay so i'm not sure what nvice nycd is so you know um i think sometimes it's helpful to add your commits in a way where they're readable so if i go down to your commit level you know can i understand what you're doing because if you're working on on on my team as a software developer i definitely want you to be adding stuff that makes a lot of sense right so then we can easily backtrack or understand what's happening in the software so for you a lot of what i will say um benjamin is do you go by alan or benjamin got it so what i would say benjamin is a lot of um you can't go wrong with adding documentation readme and like links to your projects i think that is where i really would want you to focus and start there i think especially for beginners you guys you have you know if you're um in a beginner or intermediate or you don't have ton of job experience i cannot stress enough how far read good read me's and good um documentation will take you it will take you so far because you can be not a great developer but i if i know you're considerate and you care so much about the team and you're making it easy to use i know you're going to be a pleasure to work with so then all i have to do is bring you on the team and let the senior developers take you on board and mentor you does that make sense have them guide you through the process and make you better so those are my thoughts on this cool i just dropped my portfolio i just deployed it right now oh you did okay so let me actually share the screen again and chat portfolio all right let's do this a tharva oh fancy fancy schmancy so that's cool okay and how does it look in mobile okay are you sure it looks good on the phone no i wanted to fix it okay so recruiters sometimes are going from the phone too one thing so let me see if i can do this see if i can okay i'm trying to find somebody's portfolio and i could find it that'd be really good so codes.com okay there we go so this was a really good portfolio this gentleman got an interview from us and i had an interview with him um this is really good so i would model this you guys keep it simple honestly if you try to add too many fanciness or too many animations and you don't even have to add this animation like you can you guys can keep it much much simpler than that and i would highly recommend that you guys do because when people start adding a lot of animations and a lot of fanciness that's where you go wrong and it doesn't actually look as good it just over complicates it so keep it really really simple i saw this i'm like okay really simple really clean i came down to projects super easy to understand what his projects are boom skills this is beautiful to look at right these are the skills that we're looking for great so good skill match you know these are the tools this person understands great and then contact so i recommend having a something simple as a good starting point and then you can improve on that so no atharva if i saw this i would really quickly hit the red x and i'd be out so i think that where you're going wrong with this so like if i'm looking to hire a front end developer their front end needs to be good so here it's right like you see the aspect ratios of the images the images have really low quality right yeah right so like really low quality images not really easy to understand what's happening it doesn't pop out so this is where you're going wrong you have to model something that is good so right now i don't know who you're modeling but try to model somebody you know that's that's doing a good job of it um a bunch of images even here like seems squeezed i don't know why like even a contact me button there looks like it's squeezed um you know this image aspect ratios are completely off so i would start off with a simple simple website that is functional and it looks good and that's it i would add additional fanciness later on but like as soon as i go to developers where the portfolio is not looking that great and it's a ui ux and like react developer i get out really really fast okay i could be doing it in an unfair way but i get out fast okay cool um all right let's see are there any other so hell okay are you here so hello so hell what's going on i i'm muting you right now because i'm not understanding what's happening okay so yes i'm here now okay okay cool all right so going through this okay full stack web and mobile developer this reads too long so you know it doesn't look that great and you know this seems like it's not properly aligned don't know why that is maybe maybe this part should be matching down here with the text editors part something seems uneven about this uh okay so clone clone dope and then let's go down okay clone so yeah it just seems like you got some projects but other than that like it's i if i saw this portfolio i would i would not i would decline okay so yeah i would work on your react skills and guys make your portfolios look good go look at a youtube video where somebody builds a portfolio watch how they do it build a good portfolio because if you don't have a good portfolio you're gonna get skipped over and it's just unfortunate you might have really good projects you might have all this stuff gonna get skipped over for you you i would recommend you build some of your own projects too because if i don't like your portfolio and how it looks and the design looks bad i'm already like not considering you then when i see the projects and they're all clones i'm definitely like okay i'm out i want to see stuff that's you know um that you also have done so let's go here to to github and let's see what we find in github okay cool picture um let's go all right and you know not a lot of contributions and um okay so when you're making your repos also make sure they're spelled correctly so like edit ter is misspelled as well so that's also not a good sign so for you to make it a productive conversation work on your actual reaction skills make your portfolio look good and add some of your own projects got it yes thank you for portfolio and http no javascript okay i mean yeah you should still be able to make it look good without anything else outside of html and css okay all right cool so i would work on uh frontend skills more all right um okay where is it can you link me again please this is nice so i'm immediately wowed so that's a really good sign okay uh if i'm a recruiter and i'm immediately wowed it's a really good sign so if i were one of you guys on here i would screenshot this right now and i would try to build something similar to this on my github really really good time to screenshot this already okay good so i know that code stacker teaches you how to build it like this but it's important to then go and actually do that all right let's go down okay decent amount of contributions this is good all right navbar react you got gmail clone you got linkedin clone travel agency 50 projects 50 days okay so you you've been working you've got 71 commits in december nice some good work latest youtube videos okay so what does that mean are these your videos or whose videos are these hi everyone with the new video oh these are your videos nice okay where did it go wait what happened all right cool so yeah that's really really good if you're also explaining it and helping i mean dude if your recruiter sees this they're gonna interview you guaranteed if i saw this i would reach out and interview you um yeah it's pretty good and then you know you got good uh contributions you got good stuff going on yeah you're definitely gonna get an interview based off of this all right thank you awesome and you know if we could if we just go down and break it component by component okay you're a full stack developer good react javascript node.js and firebase okay okay master react complete learn contribute to open source projects okay cool so fun playful intelligent technologies visually i can see all the technology so as a recruiter i don't have to scan through his portfolio to see what tech stack he uses right i can immediately see that react in javascript and firebase is part of his stack so it's a good sign all right let's go back boom uh gurong you want me to go through yours right now okay should i do roasts should we turn this into a roast you guys ask you guys for a medium roast light roast or a dark roast or a decaf oh man what joe you don't want me to do it or you want me to do it no no no if you want a decaf then you don't get a then you just get the sweetest one all right who here is in 1980s right now and making the dialup sounds let's mute everybody please thank you i'm muted everybody got it thank you awesome so here we go what i don't know did we get him did we get the guy hello okay hopefully we got him whoever that was um okay so no this is a this is a no for me nice photo though you got a great personality okay so damn the kova tracker looking that's looking nice oh yeah this covert tracker is definitely going to get you guys job opportunities this is freaking sick why is it all red yeah this is a really good freaking project to have man yeah from a recruiter perspective now i see the value of that project and why it's so freaking powerful nice nice nice nice good good good so i would work on the okay so you you'll i think that's you just keep yourself muted because there's a lot of background noise but just type in your chat you know just respond through chat or ask questions through chat but what i will say is improve your frontend skills so you know get better at css and get better at html and like understand how to make your website look nice model something that looks good and simple and guys the easiest way to go wrong is trying to do too much right so like adding this stuff in the background adding all this stuff in the background easy to really easy to go wrong if you just have white background or a black background you can't really go wrong that easily just a simple black background guys one type of text keep it really really simple also another thing right what's up with all this space that's not being used so you want to make sure that that's there oh that's cool some kind of react component animation here cool so yeah i would definitely um rebuild this page completely and you can model johnny's page okay this is a phenomenal page to model that's great so something like this keep it simple you can go and view his page source and see how see how he's doing it okay so that's what i would recommend all right vishesh has to go awesome well happy new year to you and um let's see is there anybody else who wants to go through it or are we good guys is there any other questions you guys have for me while i'm here i don't have a portfolio but i have a youtube channel uh not right now for youtube uh who was that um okay okay so you posted it got it let's go all right so hardeep uh smile in your photo you look like a serial killer no i'm kidding definitely smiling your photo okay you have great personality you're smiling already so you look pretty badass you know i'd be intimidated to work with you as a developer i'm like this guy can code better than me and he looks better than me and he's angry like this is intimidating so just add a smile in there and that would be great more contributions okay definitely say add improve the level of contributions this is good the greenery i see here is good clones are good but make sure you're also building some of your own projects all right um let's see okay tracker so you guys see the difference right for example it's really easy to scan this and know everything tech stack and all of that here i don't even immediately know that you it's you do react see what i'm saying it's not really immediately obvious to me unless i start reading the description of your github profiles so this is why this is beneficial for you to have something like this okay okay let's go through 2019 no 2020 or 2018 not much all right so to me it looks like you recently started coding i don't know you might have been coding for a while no i just started recently okay so so i want to see some of your projects in there and do you have a portfolio or no no okay so definitely build a portfolio okay okay okay awesome so yeah so my recommendation to you build some of your own projects code more i want to see like 900 commits from you or a thousand plus commits from you in 2021 you got it better portfolio better whatever you'll be ready okay resumes are really important too i've totally forgot to touch base on them i don't know why because i think we had already so much to cover do any of you guys want me to take a look at your resumes um okay drop the link okay so let's go through it okay smile more if you can okay like happy you know like it's it's really crazy guys how much it makes a difference people don't understand but it really really makes a difference okay if you're just happy and you're smiling i can see your teeth really good thing it gives you a little boost it's not gonna be the thing that gets you hired but it gives you a little boost not a lot of contributions so it's not that great man what oh dentures okay i mean i think you'll still look great it's it's probably not as bad as you think but if you're really insensitive or insecure about it it's okay just smile and just be a really good coder and you'll be fine okay so i went so that this will get you decline wait hold on yeah i think this is sick so that would get that would be enough to get you um declined okay so if you guys have like this is one of the biggest pet peeves guys for recruiters like you guys will put links but they're not updated and they link to somewhere where it goes to die all right it's really frustrating because you have limited time as a recruiter you click a link and boom it's dead or it's not updated or the site is down or the site is too slow if you guys do heroku app just one thing be careful heroku has like a freaking 40 second timer for the website to open up the first time it's so slow so try to this is why netlify i think is a good sign because like that's fast right that's pretty fast okay good so this is good go here boom boom i see your tools data qa full stack okay work nice uh visit website so let's see dope so i can see the website so here's what i would improve here i don't care what translink does this is not about translink this is your portfolio i don't i don't care that they are dedicated to creating and sustaining i'm a recruiter i don't give a what translink is i only care about this person that i'm trying to hire does that make sense yeah so i i want to see what you did you could have just done nothing and linked their website to me right now it seems like you did nothing and just linked their site so what did you do for them i did an internship at this company um i used python so like for example this is just a really short example right i would rather say something like this i would see okay so you did an internship you used python and you did some data visualizations for them you use postgres so here i want you to actually get technical in what you did right like i reduced their load time from uh this is one thing that a lot of people do and it's smart thing to do like are it their load time from 803 milliseconds down to 17 milliseconds i don't know what you did for them right but if you can quantify it that's a really good sign okay i'll change this one so boom boom i would definitely change all three of those in which you did that would be a great sign another thing i'd recommend is let's see what is this so here are those clickable by the way they're not clickable right what i would recommend is actually just put the tech stack here that you used so i would put the logo of python and i would put the logo of uh postgres and i would put the logo of if you i don't know what you use d3 sequels i would put the logos of them and here as well if you can um you know see if you can put logos instead that are visible like this right like these are established logos and tools so it's a really good sign to do that because like you can speak with this but it's much better if i see your tools visually okay okay um okay cool wanna work with me nice okay this is pretty good oh nice you work for zoho so you have quite a bit of experience i would definitely highlight more of that somehow okay so you know i don't know if like yeah the only job it is i would still put that i would still put that somewhere you know your internship with python and this and uh communicate what technologies you're using because tons of new people are landing like you know johnny he's never gotten a job as a software developer actually so think about that right but he's got to interview with us so he did something that worked yeah okay so i would model i would model what works very closely i wouldn't try to worry about being unique being creative i would try to model it very closely if it worked then model it and just then work on improving your skill set okay thank you you got it all right mike torres um where is mike you on here mike okay okay got it awesome so um got it let me go and uh you want me to check out what first your github or what uh okay so that's a really good sign to me you got good amount of contributions this year that's really good and um i can also see that you're recently coding as well i always want to see that because if i see a dropoff after september or whatever i'm like are they losing interest in coding what's going on all right you got bunch of clones node app 2020. so let's see what's happening here so thank you for having a link and caring about other human beings so let's see if it works now this is another test yeah so this is why if you guys can avoid heroku app avoid it it's just such a slow load time right like you could be a great developer but if you have such a slow load time it kind of shows oh this person doesn't know about speed you know and like performance is really really important all right so let's go through this note uh what am i supposed to do what's happening here whoa okay so it just took probably some time for it to be generated all right whoa okay this is pretty cool but i don't know why everything moves okay let's click it that's dope yo what's going on man okay that's pretty dope that's actually really cool that's a cool app i like it um do you have uh any deeper level projects that you've done ah um yeah to be honest okay got it so yeah this is um what i like about this project is this is the project i would really pay a lot of attention to because there's a lot going on here and it seems like a deep project now one problem might have happened is you might not have learned that much because they might have gone at a really fast pace and had you build this but still like i want to see deeper level projects that you worked on and so when i see clones i like them but i also know that they're probably you know you might have modeled it from somewhere so i always want to see your ability to code if that can be highlighted i think that's a great sign okay yeah so like even when you guys have this type of stuff where bashes had his in the start if you guys have some of your own projects that you're working on i would recommend highlighting those right around here okay so some of your own projects you're working on i think that's a good because not everybody's making youtube videos so here put projects you're working on boom that's phenomenal okay other than that let's see your portfolio and what that looks like so let's go miketourez.com okay so it says not secure so see if you can figure out what's going on with https it takes a second to load i mean it takes a really long time to load so just be aware of performance issues looks great so it looks really good let's go here is are we sure it works really well on mobile too seems like it does nice job okay nice okay that's really good how you show your projects is really good okay you would get in you would get a you would get an interview you would definitely get an interview with this i would do only things i worry about and i would really recommend this and i keep coming back to this guys everybody gets caught up and being really fancy keep it keep it simple because you're going to run into a lot of issues we're going to load really slow and you know it doesn't mean you're a bad developer but if a recruiter doesn't even wait till it's finished loading they won't be able to see your skill set okay so highly recommend to make that faster okay and uh just remove any complexity it's okay you have to if you want to remove animations keep it simple and then just go through it and then it lets me get through to all the good stuff faster okay um let's see here okay linkedin oh linkedin is great linkedin is looks really good see if you can throw an image up here and have some logos in there like your tech stack i think that would bang i think that would be like really good so kind of like how you have um your portfolio image right the laptop so let's see so kind of have this image in the background but one thing so i imagine like a laptop and stuff right and the dark overlay but on top of that see if you can add your techstack logo so your mongodb or firebase or react logo javascript logo i think that would look phenomenal because then visually as a recruiter i immediately know what i'm hiring for right now i might actually think wait is this guy looking for a job in i.t is it for programming like what is it it takes me a second okay all right uh freelance web developer okay um okay so you have some experience as a developer that's a good sign let's go here a lot of people do this thing on linkedin that i see a lot open to work i don't know i don't really know how effective that is but if you guys want to do that you can just something i've noticed a lot when i'm recruiting okay you got some endorsements that's good cool so yeah your linkedin profile looks looks good there's a lot of stuff happening here which i don't really see how it's so super relevant to what you do as you say coding is much more than a passion but then it's like music and high school band director and jazz and dj and mc and dj business and wedding and um i'm scanning you see like i'm not reading i'm scanning yeah so change colors css from yellow to pink um you're you're spending a lot of time going through really like basic stuff i would i would rather use this for some something else and more relevant to coding yeah yeah i would i would go more meat and potatoes on it like recruiters go crazy over this type of stuff right like when i'm scanning for keywords visually if you can write it in a non like seo like not in a your hacking seo way but more like you know i i used um js designed the front end for the new company and i also integrated jquery and bootstrap to help with the front end and we integrated you know we were using git version control and we had heroku and vagrant to manage the environment like if you actually write that out really fast that and and right here that really catches my eye okay because that's remember recruiter i'm scanning fast so by
