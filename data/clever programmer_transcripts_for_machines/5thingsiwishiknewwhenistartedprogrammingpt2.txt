now so like a hundred days of documentation right which means like documentary is the journey and amanat is really one of those people who does it right they do it he does it as you should because he's had days where he's been stuck on debugging he's been days on things have gone really well and he documents everything because that's the reality guys and that's actually what happens so whether it's instagram facebook youtube um and also this i really want to add up and add on to this right by just writing some content as whether it be like i don't know how to write a component in react whether it be like how to style something with flexbox by writing that out and by teaching someone else it you're going to actually reinforce your knowledge of it massively right and that's exactly the benefit exactly it's like it's like that um when you actually teach someone you actually learn much more than when you try to learn by yourself so when you try to teach someone you know a certain thing let's say you want to let's say that you know you want to post a an instagram post on you know react to basics right yeah you know you're going to learn the you know the really big fundamentals the very important amount because you know you got to teach that right you have to know that before you teach yeah and so that actually forces you to learn even better right so that's why you say like record your entire journey post things online i know ahmad is doing a great job right amanda for example he is from with all that he is doing he's also now getting coaching clients literally and is actually making money at that point so yeah crazy stuff seriously do it and trust me you were um i don't think you will not regret that yeah exactly our lovely comment by here he said sunny is going to inspire me thanks a lot bro because of you i'm not oh that's good thank you so much amanda and i really love your journey and keep doing what you're doing bro nice um uh we also want to add one more thing here guys uh it's not just about like sharing the journey right by doing that without realizing you're actually going to be building like your own personal brand okay so there's one thing working in a company there's one thing freelancing and doing this sort of stuff but if you just get involved and you start sharing your journey i promise you guys without even trying you're going to actually slowly build a bit of momentum and traction as to our following you're going to get a natural following of people who are interested in coding and interest and you're going to get like a more likeminded people sort of naturally start to surround you why this becomes really useful is because when you start growing your social media presence let's say you start offering coaching sessions and you want to have you want to start teaching people onetoone and you want to make a little bit of extra pocket money you just need to add one story on instagram and immediately you've got a thousand people that are gonna see that right and they're all coding people they're all like people in the developer community and i guarantee if you just get one person who replies to you that's potentially one person you can start teaching and you can start making that income from so it's not only going to benefit you in terms of learning it's actually another source of income so it's actually going to be a really powerful thing for you exactly exactly just there's so much opportunity guys seriously there's a ton of opportunity out there on social media online use it for your own good go out there put yourself out there right because the only way that people can see you is if you put yourself out there right and so if you do it you are more likely to get something back something like you know there's a there's a saying put good energy out and good energy will come back exactly i live in that right now and like nars is living there he's living breathing proof of this guys like if you go to one of his coaching course you come out of it feeling like you're about to wake up like it's crazy like it's like a rave in those coaching calls it's so we are dancing guys we are dancing those coaching calls by the way you like in description profile javascript linking by you check it out but literally we are dancing those coaching calls well and we have a dance party at the end of the coaching call obviously we get down to business which is a very important part but at the end of all those we have to have we have some fun you know we put getting put you know what we do right now is this crazy stuff you know what we do right now is we have this thing right now where basically we i put on a song and then we have we have to switch it up but one person will lead everybody else the move they have to do so let's say like like i'm doing this move everybody else will have to do this move for during the dance and then and then i put other people on the spotlight so basically we do rotation okay here you do it now you do it now and so everybody basically just gets to like lead the lead the whole uh leave the life that's cool dude i don't know how nars does it i finished my coaching course and i'm like exhausted and everyone's like where's our dance why aren't we dancing seriously yeah and i'm like god damn it okay let's start put somebody blow the track let's get it going it's so funny up in here you know yeah oh yeah that's too good man that's too good then yeah so guys if you found that useful make sure you let us know in the comment section and smash the thumbs up button uh we would love to just take some time out now to actually do a q a and let you guys just ask whatever questions you want to fire at us and guys feel free to ask whatever you want and we can just go ahead and pick them off right now how's that sound yeah let's go ahead get some questions and then we'll give you the answer you give us the questions and we'll hopefully give you the answers exactly just do that by the way by the way uh sunny there's a request here yeah i think sunny should dance by miraban so so sunny so sunny i'm gonna put you on the spot look how many likes are we at like if this video hits a certain number of likes then i'll do a dance no no no no no no don't make it out of this no no no that's not how it's gonna be that's my girlfriend's stirring trouble right there come on come on show us what you got come on well i i did let's do something let's go up oh roll it roll it guys i just can't compete like nas is a dancer my girlfriend's a dancer i'm a coda i i i swim around in my chair that's me oh that's so funny sunny you come to l.a i teach you how to dance no problem i'll tell you what i'll take you up on that now so we'll do that we'll do that okay okay okay okay i can actually i can do salsa oh no it looks like it's lagging i'll use an excuse oh man that is so funny oh man that was hilarious but seriously let's let's do some salsa nice you wanna do it you wanna do some salsa uh when i come to l.a we'll do some salsa oh i'm not like right now all right fine fine all right none of the time but anyways guys let's go ahead and answer some questions you know if you guys want you know if your question is you know let's let's get signed to dance that's a good question as well but but yeah let's see what questions will come up because like you know what one thing one thing i know is like uh oh somebody asked nakul asked i want to do you want to put in i was like i want to apply for react.js internship what strong part should i should i have like what strong suits should i have do you have issues the question really good question yeah so uh react.js internship what strong parts should i have so it's really good question thanks for asking that call i would recommend that you pretty much um understand so in react you have two types of uh two ways of writing components right you have class based class based and you have functional the first thing is i would recommend that you learn uh very very thoroughly how to use both right because that becomes an immediate valuable skill to have you can go into a company and you can say right even if the code base is class based and and the difference here guys is one is just the older way of writing things one is the newer way of writing things but the newer way is really nice but most code bases have the older way so a lot of companies actually pay you to come in and just go ahead and change everything to the new uh the new stuff without breaking things in between right so if you can do that then uh that's definitely a valuable skill so i would recommend learning about class based and functional and then i would go ahead and pick up all of the fundamentals like react hooks i would look at the react context api so um for many of you guys who haven't used react before this could sound like buzz words um but if you are looking at react then just get a pen and paper on these down so it's react context api react hooks um and once you know about react hooks i would look at something called redux and once you know redux yes you're at a point where you're pretty much ready to jump into your first position so once you overcome that pattern and if you guys do want to look at an example of redux yesterday's live build of amazon we actually cover that so go and check it out if you are interested yeah and i would also say react jsx right jsx yeah right that's the one right yeah reactive effect which is the way a way to to write html using using basically react using javascript basically using react that's another another big point i think yeah i think to learn yeah that's that's definitely that's actually quite an essential thing you need to understand how to use jsx yeah yeah and what is the css i forgot because i used to use css where i actually used i built i built css with javascript as well what is that that one called i forgot um oh so there's a few there's css is sas that you made no no no there's one was like react build i forgot about that style sheet anyways maybe i could bring up some later time yeah okay so um if you if you guys have any questions around that drop them in the comments because that's actually a really good question somebody actually said something um i tried to pin it okay yeah this one here vikrant seth said help so there are times when coding we feel like giving up in between what should we do at that time so nashville take that one yeah so actually a lot a lot of students will actually actually get this a lot from students um in terms of you know hey i don't kind of you know i feel i feel like i just can't do it um like my answer my answer to this is is honestly like i'm not trying to think kind of what to say in terms of like you know to actually give you some actionable things to do um one thing one thing i would say is this is not an actual one but like one is don't put so much pressure on yourself like why are you putting so much pressure on yourself that you know because the reason why you don't feel like you know you feel like giving up is because you put so much pressure and you know on building something or you put so much pressure that you need to understand something so quickly that now you feel like well you know i can't really get it that fast and so now should i even learn it at that point right yeah but if you don't put too much pressure and you make it so much more about hey this is a fun thing to do let me see how i can learn it and let me put myself to the challenge to actually try and get it okay if you think of it more so it's just a fun thing that i'm going to learn instead of putting so much pressure i have to know this i have to get this to get a job and everything then it becomes a lot harder yeah but if you are stuck in that position where you know what i feel like i feel like giving up one release yourself of that pressure two two find um like i said find may potentially find a actually here's one thing that i would say is find small wins yeah because wins give you confidence so for example let's say actually i would recommend this situation do like a small youtube tutorial for example okay and code along with that person maybe join a course like part of a javascript link in the description join the course for example right and start getting small wins okay maybe it's you built a small program maybe you built a small you know uh card for example maybe you build a small a small like a weather weather application right anything that gives you like a win like sparks interest it's like hey i got this let me get let me see what else i can get i got this let me see what else i can get and by giving yourself momentum right by giving him this momentum you can basically br you can basically go a lot further and now use the momentum basically just keep going and keep going and keep going so that is kind of like i said i would say my answer to that yeah what about you really really nice like how you put that um i would say like perseverance guys for me is is gonna be the number one key thing because like in coding like that you you are i'm just like i'm gonna put it out there you are going to hit some really tough times where you will be at your computer for hours like you will be stuck at your company of hours and it doesn't matter if it's like a very simple error or like a really sort of complicated era like i've been stuck on my computer sometimes for the most basic things guys i've probably spent like eight hours once like figuring out like how to loop through an array properly right like i said and i was like oh my god like and now you'd see me like and this is what i want to really sort of like kind of draw a straight line over is that you're going to see me now in tutorials and like nars coding and you're going to be like wow they just seem to like know everything they know how to write all their code but like guys that's after going through like god knows how many hours of like sitting there banging our heads against the keyboard like like oh my god i want to quit i want to give up i'm not built out for this like it's a normal feeling and the number one thing i will say is just keep on moving forward like keep on going like don't just do not quit because i guarantee and this is why i love coding so much that rush that you get when you overcome that problem finally at the end that rush is unlike anything else like i to be honest i'm yet to find something which matches it like when i'm sat there bugging for like eight hours and i finally get my code working and then you deploy it and you do all your stuff and then you can go about a day it just sets you off from such a good mood and it's like the best i know yeah it's like it's like you realize oh man i missed a semicolon and that took you about eight hours to figure out yeah like at one point you're like really mad but you're also like hell yeah yeah exactly like in the beginning you're kind of like in this this weird place of like i'm really angry and disappointed with myself but i'm also like the most happiest i've ever been yeah yeah there's a lot and i think there's a very big joy i get personally like from building like a project like like like right now for example guys like really cool project that we're building right now with students actually check this out hold on maybe i can send you a link hold on hold on maybe you can actually share this let me see um we're building kobe tracker guys we are building a covey tracker and it's actually me and sunny are going to be doing by the way this is like a really cool announcement me and son are going to be doing a cover tracker building a cover tracker with react next monday next monday so drop in the comment below if would be excited to build something like this because it's something that's completely new right it's going to look amazing it might actually look something like this so actually let me see let me let me give you a link that you can probably show to them as well yeah uh so guys let us know in the comments while nars is finding that if you're excited to build a covert tracker uh it looks amazing this app looks really nice and we're going to show you how to build it and this is a complete beginner tutorial guys so it doesn't matter if you don't know how to code you can go along with us and you can build this as well and you can add it to your portfolio so okay go ahead right let me open this up for you guys so we've got no here we go so this is something that currently our students are building right in the profit of javascript so again if you want to build something like this and know that deep down on how to build this in the live coaching call so for example with me and sunny right we get to ask questions link is in the body make sure you profit with javascript you will not regret it yeah so here we have it guys um we have the covid 19 tracker so you can see like we can select countries from the drop down so if i go ahead and click this well you refresh it you're refreshing refresh it hold on okay refresh it start amazing and you're just not showing the actual case there we go there we go so hold on is it it's still not no i mean it might just be a delay i think my could be the internet connection is it working on your machine guys yeah yeah yeah interesting maybe uh sort of like but what you basically can do guys is you can you can select from this drop down you'll be able to select like the united states or the uk and it will show you not only it will show you like a live breakdown of country by country with your number of covert cases but it would also zoom into the map dynamically so imagine like it would literally zoom into the map at different points highlight the uk with this really nice circle illustration of depending on how many people have been infected with uh coronavirus and it will show you like stats of that thing and you can basically from this drop down click like international and this map reacts dynamically to that so it's going to be a really really nice build and again you guys will be able to add this to your portfolio so let us know in the comments if you find that exciting and if you are ready to do that and we will build that for you guys on monday can you open this up in safari try this up in safari actually yeah let's give that a go yeah let's try it i'm very curious why it's not showing up the cases on your side this will be interesting let's have a look um no let's go ahead and check if there's any errors coming back see guys this is this is the magic of coding guys there you go jquery is on jquery is is not different it's not defined interesting um oh maybe the shot oh maybe because it's very location based because i'm getting there's a cdn that's getting jquery okay all right okay okay oh nice yeah javascript yeah guys if you haven't already check this out make sure that you guys go ahead and check the link in the description uh if you've enjoyed the video so far and you found that some of the advice that we gave you is pretty useful then you can go ahead and check out this is pretty much where me and nars live we live inside of the community and guys we own this course yeah we live here like very much inside of this course like we offer a bunch of so not only do you get personalized video feedback from all of the homework submissions that nas sets every week in your coaching course so you get live feedback you get success coaches you get weekly javascript and react training calls so that's all of the javascript fundamentals and pretty much from a to z in javascript with nars and with me you'll be building uh fun little react apps that we can pretty much go in and and guys like when you build these apps you pretty much have like you can message me on slack you can come and show me your code i love to see what you guys build and yeah you can message us through slack and also guys these are it's all cool knowing how to learn how to code in javascript right but the main thing we want to do is show you how to make a killing with that through those skills yeah we're going to show you how to go from um being able because like this is the problem i find in most of these tutorials they teach you how to do stuff but they don't actually teach you how to actually go ahead and make some money with it right so we have plenty of different methods and our students are actually making a fair amount of money a lot of the students right now which is really nice like i love seeing um when students share their success stories with us um so yeah if you do want to go ahead and like you can just come check this page out it's in the link in the description and you guys can go and check that out for yourself awesome yeah check it out if you're interested if you by the way we do have it we have a 30 day money back so if you don't like it return it but you know i think i like it in either case trust me just yeah yeah you're going to like it just just trust me just trust us exactly nice um let's have a look at some of these uh things uh comments so we've got i spent a week okay so devin gray devin grey actually joined the other day so he's new to the course i believe um so he said i was a week trying to deploy my website to a server wondering why i can see it my euro only to find out my website was pointing to the wrong url yeah and then he and then he said he added another one he goes i was laughing at 4 am from happiness when i finally oh man the happiness you probably got this is it's so good yeah exactly like it's really gonna take you like it makes you so happy guys let's have a look um oh no this one might be good for you like uh so what are the best ways of flying or finding uh clients for your product so yeah i think we'll answer this in the way of finding clients um for like uh freelance projects yeah yeah so i think i think that in terms of finding clients for your freelance projects and i've done freelancing for a year the number one thing that i would say is honestly probably when you're first starting out it is through people that you know like you'd be surprised like how big your network is like what i would say and this is pretty much how i started is i literally started asking people like that i know hey do you know anybody who needs some work done hey do you need anybody who needs some freelance client work okay and the reason why the reason why you ask that question you basically you ask around for the people you know is because it's the trust factor yeah you're a lot more likely to get a job if someone trusts you versus if you're like hey i don't know who this guy is i'm not gonna i'm not gonna pay him right so the biggest thing in freelancing guys is honestly trust like that that is what that is basically if i if there's someone who you know there's someone who i know okay who maybe is a bit more expensive okay versus someone who i don't know but it's actually cheaper i'm gonna go with someone who i know yeah right so trust is a big fight so the first way is to find is through people you know that's part one part two is you can go on on websites like freelancer.com and upload.com and you can find them there but most important thing is build that connection build that network go to meetups see other people that is how you're going to get your freelance clients so yeah that is going to be my answer for that items honestly yeah and that's so powerful and i said because like guys like i thought initially there would be websites i'd have to go to but the truth is when i started freelancing it was all through word of mouth like everything was through word of mouth and i was like whoa like it was just somebody would randomly give me a call and say like oh hey you know so and so and i know that you can code and you can do stuff and i'll be like oh yeah sure like i can take this on let's have a look and you just start a conversation and before you know it like things are happening and you start working on these projects so like no i said go to these meetups go to these conferences and sort of be a part of these groups and communities and you will naturally start to see those conversations start to come about exactly exactly yeah awesome let's have a look at some more questions um right somebody said there's something said do i have to learn javascript in depth like recursion a lot all like to get a job and react uh do you see that yeah yeah so this one right here so ajinkya said do i have to learn javascript in depth like like recursion and look okay so good question so honestly recursion not necessarily is it a a valuable skill to have yes is a valuable skill to have i mean like it's cool to know how often do i actually use recursion i mean that's how often do you use recursion like clearly i use recursion you know how many times a day zero times a day [Laughter] it's one of those cool to it's cool to know how to do it but actually using it yeah i mean i i don't really use recursion too much i mean that the one time when i do find i actually need to use recursion it'll be super rare and then i would be like oh that's pretty cool i i use prevention that day like it's one of those things it's not it's definitely not an essential so i would actually focus on the fundamentals and then go ahead and jump into react and you can sort of have some fun yeah yeah i would say i would say recursion um things like that is that actually going to be very important when you guys get into interviewing with big companies like google and like facebook when you get into that zone you will have to know like algorithms you know recursion right you know um basically you know uh breadth first search depth first search binary surgeries all that stuff that you know i hate i don't like and that i don't use you're gonna still have to know that unfortunately for the for the interviews so yeah if you're gonna if your goal is to look at you know big companies you are going to have to learn it i'm sorry but you will you know especially for companies like google facebook and things like that but to be honest like i would very i'd really recommend because like even though i said you started with smaller startup companies and i did the same thing i started with smaller startup companies and then i ended up going the freelancing route and then i joined the team um so it really you really need to kind of decide as to like what's your sort of goal like if you do if your goal is to get into companies like google then i would recommend i would always kind of recommend just just like we said guys just stop just start get the fundamentals down to start getting those things ahead and then when you need to know those things start to address them then right like if you're going to apply to google know that yes you're probably going to need to know about like a bunch of different algorithms and efficient ways of doing things but before that a startup company that's getting off the ground that has a bit of funding isn't really going to be asking you about algorithms they just want to know can you help them build their product or not all right so and they're gonna be begging you they'll be begging you please help us yeah they'll be begging you and at that point they'll be like right like if you can start tomorrow like start tomorrow if you've got the skills to do it like so there's literally like that's the sort of conversations that you need to be focused about before those ones yeah um ashkan just dropped a really nice comment he goes i've joined the course a few days ago and i strongly recommend it to people who lost in tons of tutorials amazing stuff dude you'll thank me this is all you need better than boot camps amazing if you guys want to go and check the the course out link is in the description by the way nice love it love it i love seeing stuff guys wait who by the way drop in the comments below who has actually just got the course today i'm just curious if you actually in the court if you got the course today drop in the comments below i'm very curious yeah love to see that definitely would love to see that um okay this is an interesting one nice so stoichio says how you guys started programming so okay okay i'm gonna go first uh yeah i'll give it a go so when i was i started coding when i was 17 i believe or 16 or 17. um i always found that the it class so like excel spreadsheets and things like that in school was just never challenging enough i kind of was naturally like enjoyed it so much but i wanted to like start to build things on my own accord and the first programming language that one of my teachers showed me was pascal now i really like sort of like yeah i couldn't invest out here like pascal was my first language and then i was like okay this is kind of cool like it's a bit challenging i like what you can do with this and then i literally bought a book off i had an ipad at the time like the first ever ipad and i bought a java book and i pretty much sat there went through that java book and i pretty much just i literally learned a fundamental about how to do something in java and i wrote a little loop and i basically made it loop ten times i made it 100 times and then i tried an if statement and i was like if this loop is on the 50th iteration don't show it like are you just making how many how many loops did you write sunny how many i went loop crazy i wrote so many loops and i just did so many weird things but like it helped me learn java and then i just took it and i ran with it like i built i reached out to one of my cousins who had a car shop right there the car manufacturing shop and i was like oh like you're currently using like a you just everything's paper based so i went ahead and i built them a java like a java interface like that like a nice like little ui and that had a sql backend and i basically so i took all the information so i actually ended up gathering like user stories from them without realizing at the time and i didn't know what user story was i didn't know what any of that stuff was i just kind of started asking what their requirements were and i just built them a system and the guys and that was the first time i realized like i kind of the way i looked it was i was like i've seen this done before like i've seen websites that do the similar things so i know it's possible so how do i get there and i just kept going with that and every time i wanted to do something i was like i know you can push data into a database i've seen it happen before but how do i get there and i just kept doing that before you know i had a full build and uh and yes that took a lot of frustration and several million hours that they had to compete but that got my journey started and then yeah like i just pretty much from that point on i did go to university wow i would say uh you don't need to like guys it's all about practical knowledge and sort of learning that way how about enos first thing actually before i continue with mine actually guys drop some fire in the comments because that was one heck of a story drop some fire in the comments for sunny because that was one heck of a story and especially my i would drop there's i would drop some fire for sunny for you him building making user stories because that shit's good yeah yeah i didn't even know what jesus story was for that man um but yeah like like for me basically i would say it's actually a very interesting story as well like i kind of started in high school so i think when i was like 16 years old 16 years old and and i started in high school right and and we had in high school we had one web design course so this is at the time i was still figuring out who who was gonna be like what i wanted to learn yeah and we had only one web design course this is a course that we use for dreamers so we use dreamweaver we are in this course yeah and we built some very basic html sites okay so i took the course initially enough i loved that course so much i just i love this idea of like you know taking this thing in your mind and this idea that you have like an idea in your mind and actually putting it to good use yeah like that was like blown like that blew my mind yeah you know like like yeah so like i love that part and i just kept doing it i kept doing i can't building size capability size with gmover i remember like this this course that i had this one course you're only allowed to take this course only once like only one semester yeah and that's it i'm like but i want to take more i want to do more so i literally i kept asking my teacher like what can i do what can i do can i retake this course again again again yeah and guess what yeah i can't retake it i kept retaking the exact same course every single semester for two straight years i just can't retake exactly the same because i wanted to at least be in this right i didn't want to just stop i literally want to be in this and i just kept retaking i kept retaking and basically the next thing you know next thing you know basically what i end up doing is like um and they initially enough i got to a point where like they didn't have any seats for me because i could not register for the course i had to register manually yeah and so what i ended up doing is i ended up buying myself a laptop yeah and they they had like a storage as like a locker room like a storage room right on the side and that's actually where i will learn so i will basically the beginning of the class i'll go into the storage room yeah i'll bring up my laptop and i would actually work and study from that laptop in the storage room really dude they we need to make a film about you that's that's crazy man holy crap yeah yeah so so and literally and like basically what i end up doing is like i end up helping helping the teacher i was the two teachers assistant you know building more websites and then final year my senior year and in high school guys my senior year in high school i decided to make to rebuild the school's website like the whole high school website i decided to rebuild it for fun like i didn't even tell my teacher i didn't even tell my teacher i just literally came in one day i'm like yeah so yeah i built the school's website you know i wanted to see how it looked like she's like what you did what what she loved it like she loved it and it got to a point where like basically i ended up basically working with another student and we made that site mobile friendly and together we rebuilt the whole school's website and that site was on the school's website for three years straight man damn bro oh we actually went up holy crap that's amazing oh my god that's so cool and i got coupon code and i got a coupon for buffalo and i know you love coupons sonny so guys if you're wondering why now i said that so before the the the sort of software that we're using to stream this right now i went ahead and bought the prophet like the pro version right and i was like yo nas have you got a coupon code for this right now and he was just cracking up because guys i mean it doesn't matter how much you make if you can use a coupon code use the coupon code we should be sponsored by honey you know that extension you know right that's an amazing story nars and honestly guys if you found that super cool let nas know in the comments because that is amazing man how like you can actually have your own like creation on your school website that's so sad yeah that was really nice that was that was super cool yeah and like the basically got congratulated by by i was actually i almost i almost got detention it almost got suspended from school but that suspension turned into into getting it shaky like the coupon code it was weird it was like and then the principal liked it just like it was weird man but it was good it was good that's crazy and uh tarik said a very nice king nas and saying the same time oh that's wicked thank you very much frank the bunny says you can't fool me that's not cozy yeah we maybe we are kazzy maybe we are kind of maybe guys maybe maybe there's a face mask you know yeah i mean how did who knows right yeah you read everywhere let's have a look any more comments oh man this is good guys love the comments love it love your uh i love the fire they give you guys they gave you so much fun i love the fire yeah i love seeing that honestly i didn't know pascal was your first language i'm sorry i'm sorry son honestly i know man like i remember writing now i was like even like i can't remember i think like you thought like a semicolon was strict if you code in pascal like that is unforgiving and i i've coded in c plus plus and and like yeah i mean oh to be fair c plus is uh that's a that's an interesting language if anyone if any of you guys have coded in c plus plus let me know in the comments because that's uh that's a tricky language to get your head around yeah yeah no no no no that's one of those ones that you use it to get like uh i made this little embed little you know circuit boards i coded yeah of course the c plus plus on it right and it had like a motion sensor attached to it really and then when you walk in the room it just triggers a motion sensor and then through that little circuit board it's connected to the internet and it pings off a message to like something called a it's called an mqtt server right and then you just have it i had a little raspberry pi running python which you're just listening and then if it started listening it turned on the webcam and it started recording the room really so it's like basically like a live camera yeah yeah and i have the whole security camera yeah i had the whole thing required i won't do it now because on youtube but it's on a private youtube link so i send that to you afterwards it's crazy yeah really do it i want to see that i want to see that man yeah it was a university assignment so i'm definitely i look a bit different but it's a funny thing nice actually what if you can show it to everybody maybe drop the link for everybody to see yeah yeah i can drop that thing a video from like a few years ago to be fair i look very similar to how i i know a little bit slimmer in the face oh man so that's that's actually a really good question what should i be what should i um what should be my approach to become a full stack developer and a good competitive programmer i like that that's a good question yep so what should be on my approach to become a fullstack developer and a good competitive programmer um now do you got any insight for that um yeah i got an answer you wanna start this out start this out yeah so okay so for me a full stack developer so initially when i went into my first row i wasn't prepared to be honest for a full stack row i was more prepared for like i had done a bunch of back end developments so i was actually really weak on the front end so my background was java so i actually did a lot of stuff in java um but then they required full stack they required like you'd know java and you knew javascript and things like that and guys just if you get confused front end is what you're seeing on the website back end is what you typically have on the um on the sort of server stuff and um what i would recommend is just keep your like keep that mindset open at all times but what's really nice now guys is that if you learn something like javascript right you can use it for the front end and for the back end which is really cool right so like that full stacks problem that we used to face as to like oh i can use like web dev i can do like html css and javascript from the front end but my java is super weak that problems kind of got a little bit lifted now because you can code in javascript you have no js now for the back end um so you can transfer that knowledge and then while you're building your front end and you're sort of building your javascript skill set that can be transferred to the back end and then you vice versa like so you can sort of alleviate that now so what i would say is my approach here would be pick and stick with one language like we said earlier so in this case i would pick javascript and just really harness your skill set on that because you can actually become a really good full stack developer just with javascript yeah yeah sure that how about you know that yeah i would say i would say like the role path like the road map to kind of like becoming a full stack developer is that obviously guys right in the full stack developer what do you have you have the front end right which is what you see on the website that's the front guys and then you have the back end that is where the server logic be that's where all the server logic is so if you think of facebook okay i think of facebook facebook what has the frontend application that's what you see the backend logic is where all your information is stored it is basically you know how you get information you know that's how basically your front end shows all the data you know shows the news feed it shows your pictures right it is because all of that and all the logic is actually saved on the server on the back inside and the backend api and if you want to learn basically both the front end and the backing which i highly recommend because both of us are full stack developers and it's actually very valuable knowledge uh to have and actually has got me you know a lot of great opportunities is like if you let's say if you're doing javascript okay if you're doing javascript okay and you're learning how to do frontend and you're learning for example react now try you do a node.js which by the way actually something we teach in profit or javascript we teach you guys how to become a full stack developer we teach you guys how to build apis using node.js okay so first you want to learn for example react to frontend and then you want to couple that with a backend which is for example like node.js and build apis with that so those are two parts if you want to go the route now another route you can go is you can be i can build reactor yes but i can also go the jingle route and actually build my back end with django okay with django as a backend api now i would highly recommend for you just to make it simpler start do node.js okay build your backup with node.js if that if you started out with javascript if you start out with javascript i'd highly recommend try on node.js like literally guys so many companies use that you have no idea honestly one great example is netflix i don't know if you know but netflix actually actually used node.js for the whole backend api system oh nice all of their logic all their logic is built in node.js which is really cool awesome so exactly so hold on i just yeah so i literally was looking i was looking at that and i found it out i'm like holy [ __ ] that's cool you know nice but but yeah but like like if you're doing javascript you know learn javascript learn front end and then you know build the back end and then once you've got those two parts my friend you are sailing exactly you are sailing and that's pretty much it like you know there's not much more to it yes you just you you just there's not much to it you have to know both parts and that's it yeah and the more projects now you the more projects you now do with those bold parts the more experience you get with that like in profit the javascript for example we teach you how to build a blog with a front end and a back and use node.js we teach you how to a google maps store locator with a front end and a back end we teach you how to build a twitter clone with a front end and a back end we teach you how to also make how to also make a chrome extension with a frontend and a backend so you can see a lot of the repetitiveness of frontend and the backend which gets to full stack development yeah so yeah drop in the comments below who wants to become a full stock developer because i know you guys are who wants to come to the post a developer also if you want to become a foster developer what are you still doing here join profit javascript you're not you don't want to miss out on that trust me exactly and for those of you guys who are a bit confused as to like how do you join you just go ahead and you just go ahead and tap that button right there after clicking the link in the description and it will take you to the next step to join the course um and also guys just worth mentioning we do have a 30 30day moneyback guarantee so there's actually nothing to lose here guys like just join it give it a month and on the 29th day you can cancel it if you're not happy with it you can completely just go ahead get your money back and it's as simple as that like literally you can do that and you have lost nothing and if anything you've got 29 days worth of free training right there so i would like at this point i i mean like if you haven't already check that out go ahead and click the link and and give that a try yeah and i guarantee once you're in there we like you'll see just how much value is actually given and it's just on yeah guys yeah yeah and even if like i said like if you don't like it you can always just refund it 30 days money back guarantee you know while you're in there you have the coaching call so you can pretty much just learn from us during those 30 days but i would you know you're going to be you're going to want to go more than 30 days trust me that's just like that's not even a question but anyways yeah nice yeah so um i actually i just saw a really good question but i've completely lost that uh if it comes back got some good questions we got some good questions out here man oh that's it right so nars actually just mentioned guys about netflix right and how netflix use uh uh node.js for the backend uh if you guys are always wondering and you've got like some kind of curiosity it's like how do you build netflix like the front end how do you build the back end guys we actually did that we did that i think it was like a few days ago oh yeah and uh so if you're going you can go ahead and right now you can go check out this link right here so um if you literally pause the video here if you go to this link right there at the top of the screen you can actually go ahead and see this and this is live and this is something we built and guys it's a complete fully functional working netflix app so we built this and this is built in react um so like just to go to show you sort of what you can build by harnessing and yeah like you can do all of this and guys like we said like this front end was built with react but the back end is also like you can have the whole backing powered in node.js so really really powerful stuff by just harnessing your skill set on on javascript he was telling us he was watching netflix with amberly the other day and he uh funny story happened so he was watching it and he had the netflix clone open on the right and the actual netflix opened on the left and he kept clicking it wondering why it wasn't opening the film and he was like oh my god i'm on the netflix club so uh i know the story so when you get those kind of problems you know you built a decent website that's good that is good stuff man oh my gosh that is good stuff awesome um right so best platform for mobile apps guys it's really good question here uh we can actually mention something here called react native so if you do let him react guys you can actually transfer all of that skill all of those skills over to something called react native which is whereby you pretty much code the same code base so you have react but it basically compiles so your code one code base gets like translated into two different co code sets so you've got like ios and an android app from one codebase which is really nice and i've coded in that before uh and actually interesting story so my first job that i went to i knew react i was in i barely knew react i kind of just got in there and they sort of learned on the fly but i had no exposure to react native but because i knew react you can pretty much pick up react native really quickly um so yeah so that if that was an answer to your question it's a really really nice way of doing it yeah um cool go ahead and see is it necessary is it necessary to learn javascript for web programming or learning django is enough uh what is that question uh let's see avinash avinash asked the question do you see it yeah oh yeah yeah there we go you got it okay so it isn't necessary to learn javascript for web programming or learning django is enough um what would you say to that sunny so personally i don't actually know django so i have not coded in django before um i've done i've done python work so i've done a lot of python coding um but not actually touched on django so not at all um is it like my my answer to this would be if you want to go into web development i would really recommend that yes you would probably need to know javascript because it's the main language around the web development space um and and like the whole sort of market share is going towards like sort of react right now as the most wanted library right now guys uh and it's powered by javascript um so i would really recommend it's not really a case of is it necessary it's kind of the whatever the market goes towards so if like react is popular now and then like let's say in a year's time or in two years time something else becomes popular like it probably will be based around javascript because javascript is getting more and more powerful um so i would recommend uh an answer to this pretty simply yes i would recommend that you do learn javascript um and if you currently know django then really cool like uh that's really really like it will actually give you a head start if anything because you're
