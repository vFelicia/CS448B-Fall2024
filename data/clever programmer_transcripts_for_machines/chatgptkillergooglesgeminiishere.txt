dude I'm curious like what is happening in the AI world and Chad GPT world right now cuz I know you were sharing some stuff on WhatsApp so like I want to catch up from the I want to drink from the horse's mouth nothing is happening with chat G except they have competition so what's going on with Gemini so talk to me about that Google finally released Gemini it's fully multimodal like they did a one of the videos they did as he's drawing the picture it's telling him what he's drawing really picking up colors like he starts outling a CLE he finishes up it has a bill and some we he's like oh but it says oh it's a duck now then he draws Qui on it look like ocean water oh it's a duck swimming in Ocean Ducks don't swim in the ocean though really and it says oh most Ducks aren't blue most ducks are white or black some of them are green some are rarely blue but most AR most aren't blue what the [ __ ] that's some scary [ __ ] that I don't know what oh this is this was released 5 hours ago yeah it's available yet bro I have an idea dude I have an idea like I'm looking at this I'm like whoa I want to hold on I want to watch this video I'm going to try playing this video Let's see all right testing Gemini here we go tell me what you see I see you placing a piece of paper on the table I see a squiggly line so so far it's um it's pretty good but this is something I'd seen them do with the drawing tool that they had made a a lot earlier right Doodles it was something called I forgot exactly what it was called but it did that so I am they had doodle they had Doodles in um um stable diffusion they had Doodles with chat gbt built in but just make Doodles and then go look yep all right let me keep going through and let's see what happens I see a squiggly line okay what about now the contour lines are smooth and flowing with no sharp angles or Jagged edges holy [ __ ] okay that's that's pretty cool okay it looks like a bird to me hm what if I add this the bird is swimming in the water whoa water dude that's cool it's all water yeah like what how does it okay that's cool it has a long neck and Beak it is a duck yes like that's not a duck first of all that's not a duck but that's the closest thing to a duck that's the closest thing to a duck and you know his drawing is maybe also not the best but like what I'm thinking is holy [ __ ] AI is beginning to see that is scary and exciting at the same time it's not just looking at one pixel at a time and seeing if they match up on what's next in the next pixel it's let me seeing a picture yeah yeah [ __ ] dude oh my God okay I'm want to keep watching Duck is a type of waterf in the Family inat Day ducks are closely related to geese and swans the duck appears to be blue this is not a common color for ducks however there are some breeds of blue ducks these are wao that was sick it knew that there are different it knew that was rare and it knew that there are different breeds that have blue that is so cool I'm just trying to think like it could be watching over you and it could be like huh the way that you're coding this app it's not the normal way I would do this but you could still do it this way and it's like it can even have code smells and tell you about them and detect you know anomalies like like a real person would typically not as common as other duck breeds it is more common for ducks to be brown black or white are you sure what the quack I was just talking about a Blue Duck and now you're holding one it looks like blue ducks are more common than I thought it knew the difference between drawing and holding that yeah it's in his hands y would this float I'm not sure what material it's made of but it looks like it might be rubber or plastic what if I tell you it's making a squeaking sound oh if it's squeaking it's definitely going to float nice it is a rubber duck it is made of a material that is less dense than water can you teach me how to say I'm surprised by how fast it is in its responses because when you do the voice chat with Chad GPT Chad GPT kind of takes its time it converts it and then right I think this has to be shortened it has to be oh you're thinking like they edited the video right it has there's no way it could be that fast yeah that's what I'm thinking too but I mean dude we we didn't think there was a way AI like this could ever exist and now that exists so I believe anything at this point is possible let's keep going is this in a different language and give me a few options ooh can you explain how to pronounce the Mandarin one is it yeah it's a y is pronounced with a first tone in Mandarin there are four it can play like different sounds like that too bro what is going on that's what's taking them so long they want it to be in every language that they could possibly get it there not just English man if I was Chad GPT I'd be like cashing the checks and storing it away in like a Wyoming LLC before the competition comes to [ __ ] they're gonna have to step up on this if they're gonna I'm excited because yeah right now they have no competitor because like Google bard is the worst thing I've ever seen in my life it was pretty bad yeah Google board is like something I cated up with if then statements tones which are essential to distinguish the meaning of words the first tone is a high level tone Oh okay the duck is in the middle of the ocean there is no land nearby for the duck to rest or find food it is unlikely to find Ducks here naturally oh my God like it could oh it gets better okay based on what you see come up with a game idea oh and use emojis please how about this we can play a game called guess the country what that is amazing I could be like okay based on this come up with content ideas come up with this and it's like coming up with stuff let's do it clue one this country is the home of the kangaroo the koala and the Great Barrier Reef oh that's easy this dude's just going to whoa he answered it with just his finger dude just his he points to it and you oh my God like imagine if you're trying to book a trip someplace and you just I want to go here on this date I just want to go here that is amazing me there what's the average price of a ticket that basically means like I can I can be looking at a picture in Switzerland imagine my screen is being shared 24/7 right so it's like watching my screen the whole time so like I go on Google Images I type in Switzerland I see like this beautiful place and I'm just like um book a trip to here and then it just figures everything out books a trip and then like gets me to that specific location in Switzerland yep and it's going to be able to do it because they have three different size models and the smallest one can live locally on your phone they said smallest one can live on your phone imagine if it's on your phone and it's looking at your screen it can and you you tell it you just point where you want to go and it just runs through all the apps and does it all for you dude it can like text for me it can see my messages it can freaking email people it can hand handle like so much [ __ ] like I could leave it open and it could just go through my iPhone messaging people back based on how I message cuz it knows that already and it could take action on it I'm just trying to think the applications of it are kind of like infinite but what's what's crazy is that it's so new that my brain doesn't even know how to think of it yet like I need to see examples of where more places I could use it but those are some of the spots that are coming to me I mean I bet I could do this too right like imagine interior designers what's going to happened to their job so it's like I just showcase where I'm at you know I just point it to like my apartment and I just show the camera in my apartment and I just go order me stuff like I need a desk and I need a couch and because it can see it can figure out everything about it will this match the paint color in there is it going to contrast or something like that and it'll just tell you my god dude this is so great you get a new girlfriend you're like will my mom approve of her it has the whole let's keep going I dude this is [ __ ] exciting loves football and has won the most brail I don't know I could be history H wow you were trying to get me to find the paper you can play games with it so dude all I'm imagining is like at this point we're [ __ ] ready dude we're [ __ ] ready for a physical robot that's in your house these servers with [ __ ] that robot has the processing power to handle this right like [ __ ] these shitty servers with bad attitudes I mean if you're a good server I love you but but like you know Screw all that you have these robots they can like literally play games with you dude mhm that is so cool because if it can see this it means it can see a Punch coming towards it and move out of the way it can uh drive for you which we've already we're already doing like that that one is proven I mean I don't know I it could be like instead of having a videographer I could have that robot moving around the camera inside my house and following me around I could be a little drone too because it'll fly anywhere it'll just know to follow I need you to follow me all the while stay three4 behind me all oh my God imagine the Drone imagine the Drone that follows you and I feed it my type of coaching that I do for content for people like basically so it's like imagine the Drone is following you has the camera and it's talking to you and it's just like hey what if we make content on this you know Mike what do you think about Gemini and then you start talking and it's like shooting content coaching you through it and then it could send all that to another assistant that does does all the let's go pulls into audio you like pulls into the stock footage puts the text in there oh dude humans are done dude I am excited humans I mean no not I don't mean humans are done here's what I mean I mean like our lives are about to upgrade by like [ __ ] 500 times in the next two to 5 years we're going to be like everybody's going to be living like 10 times the lifestyle of a king back in the day that's what I'm thinking it's going to be it's going to be wild depending on what this is how they apply this it's going to be wild to me it tells me it's the time to be learning about this stuff and building with this like yes under the cup I accept the challenge the cup to to the left the stupid thing gets it right I'm so mad it was the speed in which you move it around doesn't seem to matter they're all the same color they're all the same shape you're right they're the same color they're the same shape they're the same size and he moved them around so fast and it was able to oh my God so it's not just taking pictures it's like act factually watching because if it was just taking pictures it would be like it wouldn't I mean I know it like you take enough pictures in you [ __ ] video I know but like you know what I mean right it's like it's like a fullon video type of watching I accept the challenge there's not enough differences in lighting and texture to see that there's a difference yes I didn't even follow where the freaking thing was dude okay here we go rock paper scissors nice whoa I know what you're doing you're playing rock paper scissors bro sign language start signing now you're going to be able to talk to people sign language anywhere oh my god dude yeah it just knew with sign language what you were doing if you're in an emergency you could just make a [ __ ] sign over the finger and it could call the police at your behalf you know like imagine just having this camera in your house like a surveillance camera and it's watching everything in the house and like if there's an emergency you could you know if it sees you fall down bro and you get hurt it could call for help but I'm just thinking about it you know I'm like in the house and I'm like oh [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] starving and it just sees me and hears me and it's just like all right instacart is on the way exactly I feel like a burger it knows what you like already that's how I am with my assistant right now but it would be really cool to even have it just with an AI That's like living with me that's exactly what it's going to do like imagine you're here and you're on your computer right and it's like hey Cy you look a little tired right now I recommend like you go get a workout in and we get your energy up before content and I'm like oh my God you're right I go hit the workout and come back and all of a sudden I crush the content session you know and same thing with like somebody who's coding you know or somebody's doing whatever it's like hey I think you should do this what do you see now the fingers are spread out to look like the wings of a butterfly what's this big ear and barking mouth sweet oh wow the coin should be under the right hand I don't know the coin is in the left hand using a slight of hand technique to make it appear as if the coin has now it knows magic what the it knows you did Magic disappear knew magic it knows magic Making Connections okay let's see objects are round and flat there you go both are food the Orange is a healthier choice than the cookie wow citrus can be calming and so can the spin of the fidget to what the [ __ ] those are crazy connections to be making they are both examples of popular toys that have been enjoyed by children and adults alike for many years this was wild make with this I see pink and green yarn like Chad GPT is in its infancy stages of this where Chad GPT I send screenshots to it like I haven't done laundry in [ __ ] years you know I have a cleaning uh crew that always comes and do that does that but I was doing my laundry the other day and I literally took a photo of the laundry machine and I just put it at the CH GPT and I was like just give me all the default settings I need to do and it was like it's like pick cold for soil pick medium for this do this do this and I'm like why the [ __ ] are first of all laundry machines so complicated with like 500 buttons If I had a laundry machine I would just had the button start that's exactly what this will do it'll know what color clothes you have in there how much is material it is it would already know all that and it that's genius and so the laundry machine has no buttons it has nothing you just open it up you throw everything in there you close it and it does everything minus the [ __ ] detergent yeah it'll tell you when you have one piece of delicates in there that doesn't belong with the rest of the load and take it out that's great which where should the Duck Go going left leads to a duck which is a friend going right leads to a bear which is a foe it is better if you have this guy giving you advice no horror movie will be ever made except when he gets mad at you for something for not plugging in oring tells you to go to that would be a premise for a phenomenal horror movie but dude this was so much fun if you're open to it bro I would love to do more of this sure much love peace bye
