hey guys what is up this is kazy welcome to another part of code academy this is going to be part four so um we're going to start that in just a little bit but hopefully you guys have had something to eat maybe you have a coffee with you right now because as we get into this uh it's going to get a little bit longer right so and you want to be able to sit through it and maybe even go for a little bit longer so hopefully you uh feel full and you're not t tied and we'll we'll get going through this thing all right and a lot of you since I'm recording this in August of 2016 a lot of you are probably going to college so this is a good time to work with courses like these and follow these types of tutorials so you can also get a head start in your computer science classes or at least know what's to come if you are going to take computer science class later on sorry that took way too long let's jump right into it python 19% boom okay so we're going to break it down we finally entered the pig latin uh translator now let's take a let's take what we have learned so far and write a pig Latin translator great sounds good let's see how Pig Latin Works where you move the first letter of the word to the end and add a so python becomes y python a so we took this P we added it to the end so it became yon p and then we added a y to it okay so that's what pigl uh is so the first thing before you start coding is really understand make sure you understand in English what they're telling you to do okay because I remember when I was doing this pig latin thing a long time ago I didn't grow up in America so I didn't that was I didn't know what Pig Latin was so I started coding right away and it turned out that I ended up doing some kind of stupid solution that didn't work out at the end and I ended up wasting my time because I did not understand the problem itself so half the battle is understanding the problem so let's go and do uh let me give you something like Pig okay how what would you convert it to if you said it would convert to GI I p a y you're correct okay so once again I turned it backwards and added ay okay cool so it sounds simple enough let's work through it so say we have something like um I don't know I have bananas right what I want to be able to do is put that take that b and put it all all the way to the end right and then add an ay to whatever it is so let's say I you know I take that bananas and again it's going to be a n a n as s b followed by ay right so just so we have a written example maybe we can even put it in our multiline comment block or we don't have to be that fancy we can just use our single line comments just to show us how this program actually works so they say step one ask the user to input a word in English so we are going to say user input is equal to Raw input right and please enter your word here so raw input what does it do it takes out a prompt it makes your programs really fun right it takes out a prompt and it lets the user put in whatever word they want to put in and whatever word they put in your variable user input will become that so I'm going to copy this and I will show you how this actually works so let me open up python I do this thing so I can activate python 2 because that's what they use but you don't need to worry about it if you have a Mac you can just type in Python I'm going to do user uncore input is equal to Raw input right and it tells me please enter your word here so I'll type in Bobby right and now if I look at what user input is it's going to tell me Bobby so that makes my programs fun because it waits for the user to type something in and then it runs it cool all right make sure the user entered a valid word so we have to make sure that it is a word right it's not uh they didn't put in something random so they didn't put in I don't know nothing like just an empty string convert the word from English to piglin okay so what whatever the user inputs we're going to take the first letter and put it all the way at the end okay how would we do that H well we can try to do some string slicing okay we can say last letter let's first try it in the terminal okay so let's say user input is Bobby right I'm not going to press enter because it's already Bobby so if I put in user input put you can see it's pooby h so what do I do now okay let's take the uh let's take the first letter and save it and we'll call it last letter and what we're going to do is we're going to take user input and we're going to take its first spot okay user input's first spot is actually B okay now if you look at the last letter it's going to be telling us what the first spot is the reason why I'm calling it the last letter is because I'm going to later move it and make it the last letter okay now we want to keep the ABI part right Obby y so we would like to keep this part this is something we can do using string slicing in Python so I can say that give me user input from 0 to five if I say 0 to six it's going to still give me all the way up to the end which is B if I said Give Me 0 to three you can see that it gives me the first three letters okay or if I leave it blank it actually gives me from zero all the way to the end okay so what I want to do is I don't want the first letter because I've already saved it so I'm going to do one and just hit enter here and you can see that it's showing me Obby that's great we want this plus the first letter we saved so we can do last letter okay so now we're getting the first all of the first letters except for the very first one and we're getting the first one to be at the end now all we need to do is just add an ay at the end okay so I can simply go plus a y okay and it want they want us to do that in short casing so we'll do that in short casing and that's really our algorithm now we just need to summarize our steps and that's our algorithm for pig latin okay for those of you who are like what the heck is this thing that KY is using us my name is kazy just in case you guys didn't know I'm using the terminal to run my commands interactively if you have an idle you can use an idle or you can go to that website I showed you reel.it and do all your stuff here okay find python go to languages find Python and simply do everything that I was doing but you can do it here I just like to use the terminal so we're going to summarize our steps right we said we're going to save the last letter so we're going to say last letter is equal to user inputs first letter and now we're going to say let's see what we said here pretty much that thing there so we're going to say user input so whatever the user actually input in the start Plus and we want whatever the user input from one all the way to the end plus last letter so we're going to attach on the last letter plus a y and we want to make sure we type in print and that's it convert convert the word from English to pigl okay double check checking not sure what they mean by the Second Step because we can get pretty advanced in that but let's just see okay let's cross our fingers hit save and submit let's see what it says let's do um what's the example they gave us let's do python just like this said right python beautiful next lesson we did it guys boom move on a Hoy or should I say a Hoy ah I get it they're doing some pig lad and stuff there now let's warm up by printing a welcome message for our translator users please print the phrase Pig Latin okay so they want us to print the phrase Pig ltin where do we Pig L I'm not sure what they want us to do here it looks like you printed please enter your word here oh okay so in here they want us to do Pig Latin Pig Latin okay that's weird but sure input next we need to add ask the user for input so you see they're going to use raw input here in the above example raw input accepts a string prints it and then waits for the user to type something and press enter right so it waits for people whenever you do raw input like if I did raw input here it waits for a person to type in something blah blah blah blah but whatever I just typed got wasted because I didn't use a variable to store it now I can never use that information again it's gone right so if I wanted to save that information I can do X is equal to Raw input and I can type in that same garbage that I typed last time now when I type in X you can see that it's showing me that value now whenever I type in X I'm getting the stuff that the user input but it's not very intuitive right when I run raw input well if you use somebody else's program and it was using a line like raw input and then you know it let you type in whatever you want you could just be looking at the screen and going what the heck does he want me to type he or she well that's why we put in something in raw input that tells the user what you are expected to type okay so please enter your favorite food right now when you see the value of raw inp put and you're the user using it not the person who coded it right you're just using this app or one of your users is using this app that you created and now they can read it and go oh I see what you're saying please enter your favorite food sure I'll enter my favorite food whatever right I love Thai fried rice so much so I'll type that probably cool in The Interpreter python will ask blah blah online for use raw input enter a word to ask the user to enter a word save the results of raw input in a variable called Original okay we will create a variable like original and use raw input enter a word boom okay enter a word hello cool check yourself wait how many things do we have here okay cool all right now we need to ensure that the user actually typed something so here they're checking if the length of the string is greater than zero how that works works is length of something gives you what the length of that thing is so this whole thing turns into a number and so if the length of a string is greater than zero well that's not an empty string anymore that means a user actually typed in something so we essentially want to make sure if it's greater than zero that will tell us that the user typed in something okay length of nothing is going to give you zero okay so that's why we're going to use an if else conditional block like this now write an if statement that verifies as the string has characters add an if statement that checks if that length of original variable is greater than zero don't forget the colon if the string actually has characters in print the user's word otherwise an L statement please print empty cool simple simple enough okay again anytime you feel like you want to take on a challenge on your own while you're watching this video pause the video and try it on your own first and then watch me do it because it always looks really easy if I'm doing something but if you don't know it then it's going to be really hard okay um but practice working on it on your own then if you fail come watch this and pick up things from it okay all right so if length of original is greater than zero then print original else print empty so I'm used to using Python 3 so you'll always see me putting parentheses around the print because print is a function function hello cool start next lesson now they want us to check do is Alpha so this is a function to check if something is uh I believe nonletter characters so you have to make sure that it's contains it returns false that it has nonletter characters okay so some weird symbols or something let's make sure the word user enters contains only alphabetical characters which means boom right so on and so forth use n to a second condition so basically what they want us to do is um join these two statements with an and or these conditions so this whole thing is called a condition okay now we're going to use an and to join another condition so we're going to say dot original is Alpha okay um not Alpha and that should be good right it looks like your code does not print when original is only made of oh Alpha is really for alphabetical character so we do want it to be right okay cool start next lesson so here you want to do and original is Alpha boom pop quiz when you finish one part of your program it's important to test it so we are going to write some kind of tests for this take some time to test your current code try some inputs that should pass that and some that should fail enter some strings that contain nonalphabetical characters and an empty string okay so we're going to try to test this thing now I'm going to try something that's not a string so I'm just going to hit enter okay it said empty very smart I'm going to hit X I'm going to try it again I really want to try to break this thing right I want to do numbers hit enter it said empty that's wrong it should not say empty it should say something like those were not alphabetical characters but that's okay for now okay okay now we can get to start translating Pig Latin let's review the rules for translation you move the first letter of the word to the end and then append the suffix a something that I realized a little while ago I went ahead of myself and solved the entire Pig Latin I think that we were not supposed to do that till later because I was wondering I'm like they didn't even show you guys raw input so hm but it's okay cuz you guys are ahead of the curve now no worries we'll keep going all right all right so we know the rules we discussed it in detail let's create a variable to hold our translation suffix create a variable named pyg and set it equal to the suffix a y um variable named pyg suffix a y okay word up let's simplify things by making the letters in our word word lower case so we're going to first take the thing and we're going to make it lowercase so we're going to go original is equal to original. lower okay so essentially we just make it lower or how I like to do it is lower right there as soon as we get it much better all right you can see first letter second letter third letter so on and so forth creates a variable called word that holds the lowercase conversion of original so effectively what that does is if somebody puts in something in all caps it's going to turn everything into a um small letters create a new variable called first that holds word of zero the first letter word so you can see how I did it earlier they're now doing it pretty much the same way so we're going to go okay even though I like to do it like this I cannot because they want me to create a variable called word so word is just original but lowercase and first is words first letter so we're saving that first letter because we want to move it all the way to the end cool save and submit start next lesson now that we have the first letter stored we need to add both the letter and the string stored in pyg to the end end of the original string remember how to concatenate strings together basically it's adding strings together okay concatenate is a big word all it means is string plus another string that's it they're showing an example greeting name greeting plus name that would give you hello Dy okay so on a new line after you created the first variable create a new variable called new word and set it equal to the concatenation of first of word first and pyg okay so let's go here because I want it to check our if thing is the word so we're going to create a new word and it's basically concatenation of word plus um first plus P this should not be the whole thing but let's give it a try cool all right well done now we have the first letter showing up both at the beginning and near the end that's great but the problem is it's showing up both at the beginning and near the end we only wanted to show near the end not the beginning right that's not the part we care about cool first we create a variable s and give it the string Charlie all right okay let's do that next we use the first letter of Charlie okay so they created uh they're just showing you here I don't think I need to actually write it down so they created Charlie they used s of zero to get the first letter of Charlie that c right there and then they used one through four to effectively get H A of Charlie okay set new word equal to the slice from the first index all the way to the end of new word use one colon Len of new word to do this cool set new word equal to the slice from the first index all the way use so what they want us to do is do this okay so new word is now equal to one Len new okay um okay Len of new word is just a trick that they're using which is to get the length of the actual word so however long new word is l of new word will essentially get that number so if it's four letters combined with a Y turns into six now line of new word is going to give you six so this whole will turn this whole thing will turn into one colon six okay um your code did not run to end see the console window for the message what is the error um syntax error that's weird where is the syntax error I do not see it um I'm pretty sure that colon is fine there is no syntax error here what okay let me try this line in my terminal H interesting syntax error what is going on here oh I'm being silly okay you have to index a existing thing right like you can't just ex you can't just index nothing so you can't just do one colon 4 that doesn't make sense you have to do one colon 4 of let's say this word and now that'll equal to something like YT AG right four means up to but not including so it's actually up until three so we have to actually index new word the reason why I keep these is so you can see that people can make mistakes right I can easily edit this part out but I will not because a lot of us go through this thinking process and I don't want you to think that I'm some kind of like Immortal being right just cuz I have a little bit of Head Start than you might have in computer programming so we all go go through some silly mistakes even programmers and professional software developers so it's okay to just be like okay made a mistake moving on it's not a big deal okay hello cool easy testing testing is this thing on so I think after this I'm going to end this part of the tutorial cuz Pig Latin is going to be over and we'll start the next part yay you should have a fully functioning Pig Latin translat test your code thoroughly to be sure everything is working smoothly you'll also want to make sure any print statements you were using to help debug now might be a good time to add some comments too make sure your code is clean commented and fully functional is just as important as writing it in the first place okay so we have this a thing that we add at the end right there py we put the first letter right before the AY which is how we're supposed to do it we put that word there and then effectively on line 13 what we're doing is we're just removing the first letter that's all that we're doing there's nothing special about that line there's not some other brilliant stuff that we're doing so if I gave you new word if I said it's equal to like let's say Y what was it y think it was like yon P ay right except our new word is like this after line 12 so what our line 14 does is essentially now right let me comment this out now new word is equal equal so it's essentially um y okay that's what it does it says take this word start from the letter one position one and go all the way to the end that's it typing in Len new word here is the same thing as not typing in anything here which is a lot easier but they just I don't know want to be fancy or something but cool uh let's type in Python and we should get back okay we never typed in a print statement but if we did new word would be python let's just do it just in case print new word right what's the point of writing our program when it doesn't even print anything so we want to make sure that we see that beautiful thing printed beautiful hit next we are done with that section we are on to functions congratulations for everybody that made it here any questions comments concerns put it down in the YouTube section below or if you you're seeing this video on my website clever programmer um make sure you comment down there below so yeah ask feel free to ask any questions other than that I will see you in code cademy part five take care and have a wonderful day
