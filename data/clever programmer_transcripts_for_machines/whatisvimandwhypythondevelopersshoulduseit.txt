let's give this one a try let's see if it works let me know if any look cool I'll wait so it's excellent connection yeah do you see me speaking like saying hey Cobb hey guys this or no cool ok I hope that it is working now I hope that you guys can see my face and that you guys can hear my voice sorry about few of the technical difficulties we are still trying to figure out this new system but if it works I'm saying if it works it's gonna be nice you guys gonna get some fresh fresh content hello ponpon from Columbia hello Fernando from Mexico hello sunjai hello Jonathan Gor re so at this point I'll trust that this is working and essentially just go from there hello technophile from india welcome everyone in this video i want to talk about what is them and why python developers should use it so vim is a really freaking powerful tool now all it comes down to is how and why you should use it ok so what what is it what is it at all so let's talk about that I'm gonna I'm just going to show more than I speak that way you'll really be able to understand what it is and what it does let me just make sure that the screen is showing up alright Frankie if you could just let me know if my picture in picture is showing up at the bottom right with the screen test that'd be great thank you or if you could even put it somewhere record well none is laughs it's fine to get your good yeah perfect perfect thank you all right so let's kind of jump into it so I am building I'm working on this todo list app with Python and I was just messing around with it I put it together really quickly using Django and do you don't have to really worry about the app that I have here just worry more about them how I'm using them okay so let's go here and oh you guys can follow along by the way you guys can go to repla and use it if you want you can even go to this link and get this app so that's kind of cool right you can actually use this exact app for free enjoy all right now if you're here I dropped a link in the chat if you guys want to use it now if you're here what you want to do is go to settings and inside of settings a lots of people are coming on I think as you can see that you can go to settings and you can click them all right now them is enabled so what does them allow you to do ok so a few things I'm going to just start with very simple things I'm going to give you the 80/20 principles of what you actually need to know there's a ton of stuff people will teach you that I never even use there's just a few keys that I find myself using very commonly and then that's it all right so first up I want to show you that if you do DD you type in DD this deletes a line okay so for example if I go right over here and I hit DD it has removed the line all right but I have to be in vim mode so if I hit I I go in insert mode okay if I hit I I go in insert mode if I hit escape I go in this mode the vim mode now if I hit DD it removes the line now this is pretty useful when I hit you it brings the line back so why don't you just give that a try with me right now doo dee dee delete that thing hit you so it comes back that's it another thing you can do which I like is if you delete a line so I said you do Dee Dee on here again you can do P and P pastes so this is super cool sometimes you want to change the order of a line you're like hey I want to move this line from here and move it below this one okay DDP that's all it takes DDP okay pretty cool all right what else now let's say you want to go to the end of this line okay so I'll show you okay I will put you in insert mode which is super useful and scape will put you in vim mode which is super important all right so let's just practice that cool I'm just going to look at chat and see if you guys are practicing and if this yeah like you I just want to see if you guys are practicing so far the repli'd link is in the chat guys alright okay annoying people in the chat you know just we need somebody to moderate the chat it's kind of it we need golden honey back in the chat again sort of me needing to moderate it okay cool so you have escape mode you have insert mode you can delete stuff okay that's but you gotta practice this with me otherwise you're not going to keep up with what's going on so hit scape hit I hit scape hit I should practice that yet comfortable with it them is more about getting comfortable with it rather than going crazy learning every single thing about it okay what else can you do that is pretty important okay so I showed you delete I showed you escape I showed you insert you want to move how you move around is with H so H will move you left all right J K and L so H will move your left J will move you down K will move you up and this will move your right now this is the part that's most confusing for people so what I want you to do is kind of just like go in vim mode so don't be an insert mode going vim mode so that means hit escape make sure you have the key bindings for vim enabled and you can just go to rep lit alright and just open up Python so you don't have to be in my thing you can just go to repla and open up a Python thing that's all all right so let's say you hit escape and you're in this mode now just practice moving around so okay I'm going to say go up up up up so every time I hae say up you should be hitting K up up up let's go down down down down so that's JJJ okay and then to move left and right is essentially H so you practice that a little bit I'll practice that a little bit okay now all this stuff seems really obfuscated but I want to I want to really tell you what actually ends up happening once you learn vim like what's the benefit why should you learn this you can literally you can do your projects twice as fast which means that as a freelancer if you're freelancing you can you can get paid twice as much all right so that's the longterm vision for while you're learning this now here are a few things to be aware of that will happen for sure you're put your productivity for the next two months will drop will drop down to will drop down by say 60% it's almost like when you're learning a new language so if you went from your language learning a new language in you know in human languages your productivity will drop and it will be really frustrating so it'll be really a very frustrating experience but once you actually learn it then your growth is going to be exponential okay so growth becomes exponential within one year you'll if you're working at a job you'll be able to see an ROI you'll be able you'll be able to see an ROI you'll be able to write 1.75 X to 2x more code which really means that if you're trying to learn and you're a beginner and a lot of you who are on my channel are beginners you will cut down cut down your learning curve from God like three years of time down to one year of time all right because you'll literally be able to make the same amount of mistakes in just a much shorter period of time which will allow you to improve at a much more rapid pace so I'll say this this is why you should learn them all right so that's the thing I want to put there now here is where we're kind of doing our technical training part of it if that makes sense okay what's going on Oh my brother is here cause wait what's up man and yeah thanks for reporting and it's kind of annoying yes throw the toxic people out it just kind of throws me off my game okay so how has it been so far is it kind of making sense Carlos's uses them every day great JavaScript developers great okay I'll throw in the link again if you guys need it throw that in boom okay so first of all does it make sense guys why you should be using them like I just want to make that clear like that make sense or if yeah if that makes sense to you guys because if you understand what the benefit of it is then you'll learn like you you're smart a lot of you are really smart people I've spoken with a lot of you guys and especially when it comes to the developer world world I know you're a self learner I know that you can think on your own time and pick up skills I know that you have the skill of researching down and self learning down so if the main thing is if I can get the benefits across to you of why it would be helpful for you then learning it as easy part okay learning is the really easy part so this is all your movement this is your movement okay I'll do that and these are some of your this is I mean this is just essential so I'll put this at the top you you must these are must I mean this is them itself like otherwise you can't even use them if you don't get these keys down okay and then I'm going to give you so yeah I really want to give you the 80 20s of why you should use them okay the next thing you need is really the P is really awesome paste this is something I commonly find myself doing so DDP you know it and then you do undo so I'll put that as well you do so if you guys notice how I'm moving around it's pretty frickin insane I'm using vim obviously so for example how did I do this I just deleted and deleted this entire line and started writing from here right what would most of the people do start deleting like this or if you're trying to be fancy you like highlight it but you're still having to now use the mouse move the keyboard around there's a lot that you might be doing that I might not have to do alright so you undo super important so I'll do DD and then I'll do you cool P is for paste okay other ones they are really helpful or let's say that I want to change where it says context dictionary I want to change this variable name so instead of context dictionary maybe I want to call it box so what would you do you would go and you would highlight it and maybe you're right box or you might go here and you might change it right like you might do it like this but what I like to do here is I change the inner word okay so how I do that is see iw so iw is like a modifier so when i do c IW c i w okay one at a time literally one at a time c IW this lets me change a word so if I do this I can change the word eventually it becomes my habit so I don't think about like boom boom but this requires a lot of time and practice so I'm gonna call box that easy okay so saves me a lot of time let me go and see what's happening in the chat completely makes a lot of sense I understand and I live it's everyday benefits great great okay now another important one that I want to write down for you guys is yank so that's why why so if I want to copy a line let's say I want to copy this line why why and if I want to paste it I'll do P and you to undo so why why P cool why why P that's it pretty simple this is yank yank and paste go together you know they're really helpful these are these are some of the most helpful ones if you want to go here and change this word what are you going to do quick question for you drop it in the chat if you know how to change a word quickly if you want to learn take active part in this so if I'm asking you how do I change that word let me know right now exactly what you're going to do without having to refer to what I wrote if you just CI W great job really quickly if you have to copy a line what are you going to do if you said YY awesome all right oh sorry for the other one you show says CI w yeah I did say that cool okay if you have to delete a line what are you going to do DD okay so I know that very quickly is starting to be lots of things about my goal in this video is really to just give you all the most common things and then that's it you know there's just a few more then you're good you're all caught up alright then it just need to practice and practice prep like day in and day out but I'm literally going to give you the stuff that will help you 95% of the time and then everything else is just fancy stuff that's it I use my vim with PyCharm so I actually don't even need I don't even need them the text editor because my philosophy is why why use vim text editor when you can use a modern day IDE integrated development environment which is a million times more powerful such as PyCharm and then you can use them inside of that so pycharm allows you to use them so why not use pycharm with vim it's just so much better okay so here we go cool so if there's ciaw which is change word quick question what's di W real quick delete word okay so if I wanna delete this word I can just do that but the reason why I showed you CI W is usually when you're trying to delete a word you're trying to replace it with something else so that's why I gave you CI w because when you do because if I do CI w here it not only deletes it but it puts me in insert mode which means that I can now start writing okay so if DD deletes the line what does CC do it allows you to change a line okay so with CC you can change a line with DD you can delete a line now a few other things okay Capital D allows you to basically allows you to delete from where your cursor is quick question what does capital C allow you to do change from where your cursor is okay so what does that mean if I'm in context dictionary and I just want to change what's after this equal sign I can just do what command C or shift C sorry okay if I want to delete all of this then I just do shift D that's it okay other ones that you need to know are aokay a I'll also put insert so this is useful sometimes because if I want to go before the e then I will do I if I want to go after the e then I will do a now where this modifier comes in handy is if I did capital I this will insert the four line and can you guess what capital a would do insert after line that's right so for example if I'm in vim mode and I do shift I I'll go all the way to the start if I do shift a I'll go all the way to the end that's also where it becomes really helpful oh another really important one that I'll tell you and this goes in movement super super helpful would be when I'm traveling I see yeah I'm going by yeah so I usually go by e that allows you to move to the end of each word okay so move to end of words I barely ever use W so I won't even mention it but W allows you to move to the start of words I mean I use it sometimes I'll put it here move to move by words all right so there you go now another one that's super useful is that will really be helpful for you is B so move backwards by words super powerful okay so you can do BB BB okay so between BB and E and W it's really helpful to move like that boon lots of answers coming in vim and B what is the difference hmm not much difference TD yep Tony wants to make a pyramid with hashes nice Tony just join profitable programmer that's awesome okay so let's go here and do this format because I'm OCD okay so I'm thinking about what other wants to give you okay because I've found when I'm travelling through all this this app is cool too it's okay username is admin password is admin like hello stuff to do homework coding this is this is coded in Python by the way Jango so if you want to use this app feel free to use it all right let me think what else is useful for you so go to the end go to a beginning go by words go backwards delete another one I find myself using for movement a lot is ctrl D and control you so this is like allows me to move fast through the thing because it just moves me up by pages and down by pages so really helpful so I'll just hold ctrl and I'm tapping D and then I'll just keep holding ctrl and keep tapping you and that's it okay so okay going to the beginning going to D and yeah so this is really the crux of it if you get DS right I mean this is essentially 80% of what you need to do trying to think what else is useful for use of CI double use useful di WNYW so again you can notice the patterns right see it's change so constantly everywhere you'll see any set type of C stuff i dub you as a modifier so you just do c IW just changes the word you know di w deletes the word let me ask you what why i dub you does so real quick drop in the chat before i answer it what does y IW do if you said it Yanks the word great job so yank word okay because it's just yank just really means copy okay so i'm just gonna write that it just means a copy word copy word they just use yank in their terminology that's all it means so you know if i'm going here on a copy the word done now if i pasted it it pasted that word that's helpful okay another useful one is r this allows you to replace so for example if I want to replace T instead of hitting a to go in insert mode then hitting backspace and then typing in T what I can do is I can do ar e R T so are just kind of lets me do it on the fly now this is like more micro optimization you know I would not put this in the 80/20 so you know I'll call this like 80/20 and I'll put this in like fancy stuff alright you don't really need this but this is helpful this is just like optimization but really this is the this is all of that is ad part of the 80/20 right so you will put in 20% effort here and you'll get 80% results from these let me check on the chat what's going on Hudson says remember me what's up Hudson um can I do your course the profitable programmer 2.0 at my own pace yes you can you can do it at your own pace definitely it's yeah just if you want to go slow go slow when I go fast you can go fast just go at your own pace okay what else we got in here Tony to do nested loops it's not too complex just a test it just depends what you want to use them for but yeah the nested loops are they're fun they're fun okay let me think about what else can I offer in this that still is part of the 80/20 so that like I'm telling you the stuff that I use all right I'm telling you the stuff that I commonly use its exhaustive the amount of things you can learn but I don't recommend learning all of them just learn the stuff that you really need to get going okay so you got e you know B you got shift a you got shift I which you know practice that right now actually so shift I shifted just keep practicing it keep drilling like if you're on this live stream and you're hearing my voice just keep using that as like a drilling exercise because the more you practice this stuff the better you'll become if you use it like this weird tool and you give it so much respect you'll never learn it you'll get better at it in a really slow way just look to make mistakes look to really up and have fun all right so the more mistakes you make and the more you crash and burn stuff that's better you'll improve like that so shift a scape shift icescape shift a shift I escape shift a escape shift I cool EEE BBB BBB okay all right change this word oh crap didn't mean to do that hit scape hit you di w delete the word oh crap didn't mean to do that hit you shift I escape delete the line okay delete this line paste it underneath this one so DDP delete this paste it on top all right so that's another one that I'll show you which is cool P is like pasted on top okay and most things have a shift version of them so I believe redo is shift you I believe let me actually try that hello I guess not I don't know what it is it could be like sometimes I'm not even thinking about the things I'm typing I'm just my muscle memory is just builtin so I'll just do them without really ever thinking about it and if somebody's in the chat who knows about it you're a feel free to drop something that I may be missing or something that you use that's helpful so Carlos if you want to add something that'd be great ah module that's awesome man welcome yeah module used to go to our Chess Club yeah welcome welcome and yeah Python is awesome so definitely go and take advantage of things okay yeah if you guys will find a tutorial useful for how I actually made this app the todo list app and what I did I can definitely do that for you guys at some point for sure cool that's a that's what I wanted to share I think that takes care of a lot of what this is about let me see if I can fork this nope doesn't allow me to create a fork of it trying to create a fork and put it in the description ah 10 10 plus DD yep yep yep that's a good one that's a good one too for sure redo is controlr yep yep yep yep okay cool so redo is definitely important so let's add that do conceit eo+ are okay that I all I use a lot I just literally like muscle memory so yeah redo there you go that's important another one that's cool is I'll put this in fancy stuff is if you want to delete two lines actually this is this is useful so you can do this okay DD delete two lines 10 DD or you know 10 DD deletes 10 lines okay so for example if I am here and I want to delete line 63 and line 64 so I want to delete context dictionary variable and this return statement I'll press and then I'll do DD that's it if I want to copy something like this fancy stuff and paste it 10 times 10 PP cool let's say 10 P or 30 P pasted it 30 times really dope stuff you can do with this so that's another one okay let's see if I'm missing anything else Oh am I not using the Yeti that would be the most depressing oh I am I am using the Yeti I'm using the Yeti change inside parenthesis see I let me see that one see I okay so that would be useful let's say if I had multiple things oh that's nice oh yeah I love learning stuff like this okay cool I'm putting that down that's awesome I like that one a lot thank you who shared that one yo rishabh shout out to Rashad aha awesome Rochelle I see you man that was awesome I'm gonna put that in fancy stuff because I didn't know that until now and I was getting by fine definitely super helpful what else we got change inside brackets CI cool okay great oh yeah X is another one I use this helpful I'm going to put that here this is helpful because if you want to like delete something you know let's say there's an extra word here like that and you don't want to get out of vim mode to go eh and then press Delete I mean that's really expensive right like you're doing so many things justly you just do X X and then it deletes it hacker says what do I do if I want to be a full stack developer but because the financial issues can't pay for your 2.0 course that's totally fine there is a lot of stuff on full stack online learn it and then once you start earning an income you can join my program and my program what's the main the main difference in my program is just that it will show you freelancing stuff and most places won't show you how to do freelance freelancing or earning an income from coding so that's the main difference of my program yeah so for now you can just enjoy all the free stuff I have tons of YouTube content and you can you can go through that alright hackers is happy papa Python Rishabh is saying thank you yep you're welcome I'm and thank you for sharing that that was super useful cool all right that's all I got for you guys this is a great guide a quick question if anybody wants a downloadable cheat sheet of this or if you want yeah they're a downloadable cheat sheet or all this in one area emailed to you or something you know just let me know in the chat and if we have enough people maybe I'll I'll do something I'll do something about that okay I might put that in the description of this video or something alright thank you guys so much I love your face and if always I'll see you well hold on hold on I got it I got to do the cool stuff I love your face this is cozy as always I'll see you in the next video
