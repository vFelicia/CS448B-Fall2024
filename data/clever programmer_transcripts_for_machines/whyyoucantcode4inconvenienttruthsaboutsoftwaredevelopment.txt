truths about software development and why you can't code right now or why you're having a hard time with coding this is my advice for you from me as a developer from the past 10 years guys guys welcome welcome to today's live stream hope you guys are hope you guys are having fun hope you guys are enjoying it we're going to be talking about the four hard truths about software development and why you may be having a hard time right now just in general with coding right so this is something i want to cover the past few a few months now now let's actually fully get into it okay i'm not going to waste much time i'm just going to go straight into it the number one reason now before i fully get into it actually i'm gonna tell you this the fourth reason is the most important reason so make sure you stick around till the end of this video because the fourth reason is the most important reason why you have a hard time coding right now and also i might throw in a bonus so we'll see right awesome all right let's get to it my friends awesome so what is number one reason the number one reason is very simple okay it's you're in it for the one reason initially you're in it for the reason what does that mean well a lot of students i talk to a lot of students i talk to they might be in it because well they want to simply just make money i hear a lot of students say you know what well nas i just want to be rich i want to be on the beach and i want to be coding all day and that's it listen it doesn't work out that way this is a normal career just like any other career this is a hard career to be in it's a very difficult career to be part of right that requires a lot of problem solving a lot of patience it requires a lot of hard work from you and it creates time for you to get into right starting out and this is not easy so a lot of people think that you know what i'll be a freelancer and i'll make millions of dollars i'm sorry it does not work out that way just doesn't so this is why i think number one thing you need to understand is what is the reason that you're into this if you're in this because you know what if you're because okay i actually kind of like this i actually enjoy this and this is the reason why i want to try it in doing this that's a good reason then this will keep pushing you towards the struggles of actually coding but if you're in it just because you know what well i just want to be rich that's not a good enough reason unfortunately right so this is why you're not pushing through it's the reason why whenever you have challenges in front of you you're not able to get through them right so that's number one i want you guys to comment down below right now what is your number one reason for why you know why why you are you know what is what is your number one reason for coding or for getting at this comment down below i'm very curious okay hey what's up guys guys that's not kaiser nas for clever programmer here awesome sweet sweet sweet cool by the way awesome let's go continue on so that's your number one reason for why okay next up is you're not surrounded by other coders okay what is that that means when you are coding you want to make sure you surround yourself by other people who can push you right you are currently alone fully you're currently coding in your own house you're trying to do this fully by yourself right and the thing is you do not have anyone else who can inspire you to do it this is why i highly recommend for you guys for anybody here for example who were you are trying to get into coding or into development surround yourself find people who are also doing coding now the question you might be asking us where do i find those people good question there's a lot of there's a lot of ways you can find them the one but one for example is well there's for example let me show you right here this is meetups.com so meetups.com right you can find them there right maybe you can find maybe there's a college around you maybe there's college groups college groups who knows right any group you can find right so even for example i know if you just tap into google for example coding you know meetups road ups meetups this is what you'll get like it or not i'm not going to lie all of my jobs literally came from me knowing people you want to network in this business and you want to connect in this business this is the reason why a lot of you will actually be able to either survive and go into it or you won't and you'll give up and you'll go back to your old job so find other people who are doing this right they will inspire you they will push you and who knows they might connect you with somebody that might get you the job that's literally how i got all of my jobs my first job was through connection i went i went through a group i went through a meetup in my college fine i found a few people found them reached out to them boom got them my second my second job was literally also through connection i asked a friend of mine hey can you potentially send in my resume he's like yeah sure no problem sent him a resume i went to an interview got the interview right it's things like that that will make you an actual great developer and that should succeed in this in this development world okay so find the people around you to push you and to inspire you and to connect you right there's a ton of them out there i'm sure you can it is a matter it's just a matter of you actually putting the time into it so that my friends is the second reason why you are having a hard time coding right now all right number three number three and what is that it is number three is going to be you're not challenging yourself enough now before i get into number three i wanna tell you guys for those of you who are looking to actually find a coding group around you we are currently doing a fiveday coding booth game a free fiveday cleaning boot camp starting wednesday uh starting wednesday this wednesday it is basically five days though you'll be challenged five days of kickstart your javascript career you'll build three amazing projects a sas product a game in javascript and you also build a landing page with 10k so if you want to go ahead and join it's completely free event fully five days live go ahead and click the link below there's a link below to join this free fiveday boot camp and i'll see you there all right trust me it is going to be an amazing time probably something doesn't exist anymore yet so yeah anyways number three is going to be you're not challenging yourself enough right what does that mean well a lot of you guys are quitting way too fast you don't have enough the patience to actually go through with it right what do i mean by that well let's think about it you have a problem in front of you right you're coding okay great i'm coding you got this thing maybe i'm watching youtube tutorial and everything's all good right that's your process for example here let me show you the process here's your process here's your process you're coding right here okay you're coding this is your process let me see that's your process right i'm coding right that's your process next thing you have a problem that's your problem right now when you have a problem that's going to be the question of what do you do you do next there's either two pathways one is you go to the research mode or second pathway is you go into panic mode panic mode and sometimes you go into both which happens right that's the second reason now personally me i know my process and i go into research mode right at that point right i research i can be something booster for literally for two days three days to one week right because something it's a problem for example that you might not know how to solve maybe for example you're going through with it maybe you want to build a feature you just don't know how to do it and so you just give up you end up asking a bunch of people hoping they will give you the answers but here's the thing you need to understand the learning comes from you actually learning by yourself right the learning actually comes from you debugging from you doing a bunch of research because if crazy enough as you do all this research on the internet you're taking things that otherwise you wouldn't so rarely enough you actually do not want a straight up answer instead you want to put yourself in the uncomfortable situation to be able to do what to research right to find out things and this is how you're going to learn and most importantly you're going to get confidence in yourself knowing that you know what if i did research one thing i can research another thing and then boom this will allow me to biscuit solve any problem that i want so that's going to be a way to challenge yourself so if you're challenging yourself right or any problem be patient give yourself a few days a few hours a week if you have to then maybe you can ask for help from other people all right that's good number three so my friends now number four what do you think number four is right i'm at first personally very very um this is something i'm very passionate about this number four right here okay so number four is is the following it is you do not know the fundamentals you don't know the fundamentals around coding you're trying to skip ahead you're trying to skip ahead all the way to the top it's like it's like this it kind of looks like this right so let me let's just say uh we're doing we're building a house right so if we build a house right here's your house right it's got the deck it's got the floor it's got the roof right it's got the doors and the windows all of this right it's got the few windows boom boom boom looks like it's a funny funny looking house right don't mind it so what's happening right now with a lot of you guys is you're building the roof without building this you're basically you're going to react js you're building a bunch of applications from tutorials right you're building a bunch of great you're learning react js projects oh my god look at what i just built i built this react.js clone and stuff that's so awesome i'm like great man but if i ask you one simple question to do something for me you probably can't solve it by yourself you probably can't if i told you to merge two race together would you be able to do that fully by yourself without looking on the internet i would i will bet you 90 of people will not be able to so this is the reason why this right here is the issue the fundamentals when you build the house the first thing you build this is what the foundation it's kind of like when you build anything you put the people the car you build the the foundation of the car right which will hold it together right after that you build everything else right that's the whole goal here right so this is why a lot of you guys are building this a roof this is if you go straight to react gs if you skip javascript and you scrape and you strict to this this is what you do you're building you're building a roof on top of nothing instead you want to do is you actually want to build the fundamentals so what does that mean data structures sure we want to be able to do problems right you won't be able to understand how to write functions right variables right but fully what i mean by that is actually doing it fully by yourself i don't mean just you you know just you uh seeing things and you thinking hey you know oh yeah i know variables are great but if i told you to create a variable for me right now can you do it maybe not i don't know if i told you to create a function that will loop through an array can you do it i don't know but a lot of students can't unfortunately even though you're building crazy projects here this is right here the number one reason why you are not progressing in your coding career okay is the reason why you're not coding at the level you want to be coding and why you get stuck so often potentially so what you want to do is you want to focus on the mentals and on that note by the way if for those of you who do need that kind of help for those who do want to learn the fundamentals and maybe you want to need some help around guidance and so forth we do have a full stack mastery boot camp for those of you who are interested right we have a full site mastery bootcamp that goes through that right that fully takes you through the fundamentals it teaches you the data structures the algorithms that makes you really good and actually understand what coding is so if you're interested we have an application below to apply for full stack mastery boot camp apply down below we have a ton of students like aunt martin huda and so forth a lot of students who are going through the process and are getting jobs are getting jobs as developers because they've learned those fundamentals that we're talking about right here these fundamentals they learn this and so for them now actually building projects is fairly easy i mean that's not still not easy but it's pretty much much more doable so this is if you're interested again we have a link down below for you guys to go ahead and join other than that i have one other thing for you so guys what do you think about this so far i have a lot of people in the comments let me see i have a lot of people in the comments that are asking let me see let's see what are you guys saying i am from hello where are you guys from hello hello and graduating in business from it and have no clue somebody said i'm graduating look at this i'm graduating in business information i have no clue about coding i'm anxious for applying for a job now see this is the crazy part is a lot of you guys are going into these coding spaces and you don't even know much how to code which is very unfortunate right let me know if you're in that you're in the position i'm very curious actually hey that's how you i'm doing good i'm doing good awesome guys so i have one more i have one more bonus point for you one more bonus point one more bonus point okay so what is that what do you think it is so what you need to understand is here's a bonus point boom it is you don't have a problem solving process boom so a problemsolving process in coding is a very very important process for example my process is very simple right if i am presented with a problem okay boom my mind goes to one simple thing my mind goes ok nas let's go ahead and get you into the coding mode so what i'm going to do is i see the problem i figure out where the problem is right i use a bunch of console logs or print statements to actually get into it so for example if i look it up for you or if i actually print it out for you it kind of looks like this right let me kind of screw this first for example let's say there's a problem right there's a problem okay great okay my next question is where that's the next thing i figure out is where is it okay so i do a bunch of print statements a lot of times so print i do a bunch of print statements right i figure okay i print statements and figure out exactly where is my code breaking okay i start to i do a little more testing i test to figure out if actually that's the problem the problem is actually in that piece of code okay once i figure the portion out i usually start doing research right i start doing research in terms of through through google right through stack overflow through google stack overflow and so forth right so i go through all this research process to do that okay and i repeat and i repeat and i repeat this process nonstop until i figure it out literally until i figure it out and i have this process and the last process for example let's just say nothing works my last process as i go ahead and i ask people i ask other people or what i do is my last last last resort which i i really try to avoid is is i actually asked a question stack overflow ask the question step overflow so if this is something where you're struggling right figure out what your process is and be religious to that process knowing hey you know what if i'm stuck in a problem i got my process down i have it written down let's go through the process and give myself time more support to actually go through it and to resolve it so write it down what your process is actually comment below what your process is around around researching and around researching you know a bug or just coding problem solving general write this down let me know down in the comments below and then just use it that's the most important thing but guys other than that that's pretty much it this is your four hard truths about software development and why you are having a hard time encoding guys and this point if you guys have any questions i'll take a few questions here in a little bit for a little a few minutes until i have time let me see if you have any questions let me see let me see let me see let me see if there's any questions right now so far hello everybody hello hello good to see you guys by the way good to see you all let me see one of my questions so um okay as a biologist the scientific methodology helped me a lot with the logic and fundamentals of programming that's awesome yeah so if you that's what i tell a lot of people is if you have problem pro like if you have good problem solving skills and you have know the logic around you know somebody said somebody said i suddenly cry that's funny i inspect tools then stack it i cry too well guys crying is not gonna solve a lot of problems okay so make sure that you're actually working towards your problem best way to learn data structure is good question so best way to learn data structures is going to be well it's honestly going to be through practice it's going to be a lot of practice there's a really good book called um it's literally called um crack in the coding interview it's an amazing book that will help you a lot a lot uh let me see where was it where was the question or the question there we go yeah so like i said i think there's a book called crack in the corner interview practice or dance and then of course practice a lot through hacker rank i know lead code and so forth awesome uh i'm about i'm about an intermediate developer selftaught but i often still get stumped building projects wherever uh whenever i go and stack overflow i feel like i'm using a crutch is that normal no it's completely normal so i think that you know using a crutch kind of like stuck overflow is completely normal i still to this day use it i don't know the answer to every single question of course but you basically what you understand is as a coder you are a googler you you stick over all the time the most importantly is like stackoffer won't exactly give the answer but you at least will give it kind of like a hint so what you're still doing is still problem solving it's kind of like you know what if you have a problem or if you want to research something back in the day you go into a book right same situation here you go into a book except the book is the whole internet and so it makes things a lot easier for us that's pretty much it some says i sleep on it that's a really good one actually then then bum so actually i sleep on it that's good a lot of my answers quickly enough actually come from when i take a shower when i sleep you know and then i exactly kind of know what i'm doing that's a really good one let me see stuck overflow all day every day yeah hello nas hi stick of the old day every day you know it why we have a learn something i also cry joanna says that's a good one too haven't cried before trust me somebody said uh in my start development training they say break it down piece by piece one step yes very very good yes i try to break it down as much as possible right so you break down little problems into chunks and pieces and that's how you solve them that's pretty much it okay awesome let me see on that guys that's pretty much it that's all i have for you today uh around the four hartrus around software development like i said guys those five things you want to keep in mind the whole time right know your correct why challenge yourself a lot surround yourself around a lot surround yourself around other coders you know of course learn the fundamentals and make sure you have a right problem solving process and that that is pretty much it my friends hope you guys have a great day and i'll see you guys in the next one have a good day peace out
