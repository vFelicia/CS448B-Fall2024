that was fantastic brother so what I will say is the first thing you got to do is make sure your coding skills are you know the first thing I would focus on for you is making sure I get my CODIS feels really tight and that doesn't necessarily mean you have to spend like three years or two years becoming a professional software developer it just means that you like one month deep dive into coding you can really condense your time so if you just go deep dive as much as you can I'm talking like four hours or more a day right if even more like when I was doing it I was doing fifteen hours a day just because it's so fun and I just I just deep dive that's how I do anything so but it'll condense your time you know whereas everybody's spending five years picking up that skill bro like it'll take you one to two months to get pretty decent at it so I have my free I have free courses on YouTube you can like look up my thing and look up my name and start with them you'll get a lot of value out of it but just like really deep dive and consume everything from it spent [ __ ] yet you spend three to four months if you've been better yeah spent three to four months like going in hard for sure I mean you have the right mentality dude because most people are trying to play this really shortterm game they're like I'll code for a week and then I'll start making money and it's like [ __ ] no that that's not how it works but but if you invest a lot of time and a lot of hard work and you just are consistently putting an effort for three to four months you're gonna be in a great place at that point I would start looking into oh it's for you I would start looking into coaching other people in coding yep yep like teaching other people basically so there are online platforms like wise ant and take lessons and code mentor where you can be charging anywhere from $25 an hour to like $50 an hour or more real talk if you really put effort in one and a half months of serious effort you can start teaching yep no I mean think about this I started really coding in 2016 now I have a business in 2019 for me the return almost [ __ ] instantly I like to stay really close to the revenue because you might like I know for a fact like you know people's dreams die when they can't figure out how to generate an income from that thing yeah yeah man I'm gonna guide you through the process like you can you you just have access to like my direct phone line so you can message me and I'll help you and guide you through the process but bro I promise you if you actually in like really [ __ ] hunker down and invest into this this is very very possible and for you like think about who is paying people to learn how to code their complete beginners bro sure you actually have more advantage being a beginner yourself teaching other beginners then if you were a professional yes that's absolutely right that's correct so so you can really scale that thing up as much as you want like I went from being able to make $500 a month from teaching others all the way to five thousand to nine thousand dollars a month from teaching others so so you can really scale it but the reason why I like it is because you can be an earning an income while you're coding you can be you're earning an income by teaching others you're actually learning even better for yourself okay so you're massively improving your skill and you don't need to wait three years to become a professional software developer before you start looking for your job that's how people's dreams die that's how you have people who go to college for four years then this bender you're looking for a job and then they just like start working at [ __ ] noodles and company yeah man I I like to call it la earn which is you know I started it jokingly with my friends but I think it's a very real thing it's like you earn while you're learning yeah because then you can invest more time in decoding too as you're able to earn an income this way you don't have to like do a over on the side while you're learning how to code well you know what I mean you can actually yeah that's what happens to a lot of people and that slows down their time right now the more income you can earn from coding the more time to get spending decoding and because that you'll not only be increasing your income but at the same time really quickly increasing your skill set yeah so hunker down build the skills and then few months from now I want you to like start making a profile and dude for you you can just link me a profile it'll give you like I'll review your profile for free and give you tips on it but really [ __ ] but like again you know I I want to be there for you as much as you want to be there for yourself I can't be there more for you than you want to be there for yourself so if you're putting the time in and you're like going allin dude I'm more than willing to like jump in and help you out wherever I can beautiful just text me whenever you want yeah yes bro yeah man awesome look out for the second call the way you're gonna find out about the second call is from email or the Facebook group so keep your eye out for when the next call is gonna be it still isn't completely scheduled and then yeah we're gonna get started in the second call ask me any questions you want but for now focus in on improving your coding skills because that's the first step for you yeah bro all right Caleb it was amazing speaking with you man and I'll see you on the live call bro all right you got him a man take care peace
