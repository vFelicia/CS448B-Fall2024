hey what's up guys this is coffee from clever programmer Tom I want to just talk a little bit about my first day as a Python developer because I just thought about it right now I was walking with Frankia or droc and I was like we were having a conversation I thought about it and we thought it would be a cool experience to share someone to do that we're like let's roll the camera let's do it my first day at work was pretty freaking cool it I had to go through lots a long process for actually getting my first client and it actually happened from ad I posted on Craigslist and that ad was specifically an ad I posted for me presenting my services as a tutor alright me presenting my services as a Python tutor for I don't know 35 to 50 dollars an hour something like that what ended up happening was I got a call from somebody and they're like hey we're local to you and we just need somebody who can do this something of we heard this might need Python to fix it but we need a login system and we need the authentication system and we need this that and the other thing and at that time I was only about three months into my coding three to five months into my coatings skills coding experience you know I was kind of a beginner at that time and what I ended up doing was you know what normally any person who only had such little experience and has given such a giant task would do I said okay that's it all right I'll do it and that's when the craziest journey began and I didn't know anything about Python I didn't know anything about full stack development I didn't know anything about Django I didn't know about how databases work I don't know anything about how to negotiate pricing with a client I didn't know how to propose a contract I didn't know about NDA agreements I didn't know about how to present a timeline or do valuebased pricing I mean I could just list all the million things I didn't know at this point I was like a beginner slash intermediate developer because I was just focusing on the technical skills but the one thing I did do was say yes and as a whole like crazy amount of things that we ended up going through I picked up tons of skills on my own because I knew I was under the gun to learn fast and I picked up insane amount of skills and really short amount of time got to my god to the interview the interview went really well and there were some negotiations there that went also really well too and I remember that I was super scared but I went and spoke with my mentor my mentor she told me charged him $100 an hour and so that was a really really scary call to make because they were already paying me they were willing to pay me $70 an hour and when I told my dad that I'm negotiating up to $100 an hour you got so mad when he was talking right over when I got home he was like.he he said it in Urdu and he just he said like he said something long he's like numb economies like Luger wouldn't have passed the idea to job me but usually geez consider out that basically what he was trying to get at was I'm getting paid enough for ready why am I asking them for more so you know my dad is a man about integrity and honor and he doing things the hard way so when he heard me being this privileged freaking American kid is like it's my first job dad but you know I I'm gonna [ __ ] go for it $100 an hour what he didn't realize was that I was for me like personally it was about preparing for really difficult situations and if I can handle the stress and pressure of getting my first job you know and be like this job everything depending on for example if I didn't get this job I won't be able to help my mom or my dad which was my initial goal I wouldn't be able to help myself and live a coolass life knows which was also a huge goal hang out with my friends have the car that I want be able to hang out with the girlfriend that I want like there are so many things that depended on this and so there was a lot of pressure internal and then I was going to college at that time you know I was going to Oakton Community College had to do great in college too and I don't have enough money to go to college but I still negotiated because principally speaking if I do the really really really difficult thing now then I can actually handle it when there are bigger moments where negotiation skills are required when the pressure is higher right so if you get used to a brutal amount of pressure earlier on and you practice it because the muscles confrontation negotiation it's a muscle once you get better at it you can do insane amount of things you can with stand a lot of pressure in life and that will determine the quality of your life as well I I firmly believe the amount of pressure you're willing to withstand that's exactly proportional to the success you're going to have in your life anyways I ended up getting this job at $100 an hour which is dope and the first day I went in I'll put some pictures of I'll try to find if I'll see if I can find the picture of me going in the car I have a picture of the first day at office and they actually set me up in their office they let me put my little coat on the chair they sent the IT guy to bring my to get my monitor it's just so cool I mean how far the IT guy but it was really cool for me they respected me so much it was my first day you know the boss like asked me if I wanted water and it blew my mind that holy crap you know these people are doing such important jobs and now it's my first day and I'm I still felt like a kid and they're giving me so much respect and they're sending their fulltime employees to like fetch things for me and so I was even feeling a little weirded out about that I didn't know how to think about it but that was a pretty dope part of it that they were giving me so much massive amounts of respect because I was kind of the only developer they had you know and didn't realize at the time so they they brought in to set up my monitor and I don't know if you can see some of the code on the screen but it's literally like some garbage flash code and I was literally going through McGill Greenberg's beginner Python flask tutorials while I was at this job so they were paying me for a skill that I didn't even have at that point but the skills that I did have is I was reliable my communication was awesome I always said yes and I showed up for everything so they're like okay let's give him a chance you know so I learned those skills on the fly like I learned how databases work I learn how flash words I learned like okay well that's a full stack developer what they do and I learned it's super fast cuz I was under the gun and it was exciting for me this is exciting then I realized Django might be a better framework for their job so I can work with my client in an easier way faster way of meet the deadlines but I mean if you even look at Django's homepage they called the framework they say Django it's for perfectionist with deadlines you know it's like beautiful and that's exactly what I ended up discovering the same stuff that I would spend forever building in nodejs or some other programming language or even freaking a flask in Python with Django I could build their login system and their authentication system and their invoicing app everything I could build it a lot faster Django comes with a lot of builtin tools and technologies and I realized that that's what you know when I was making their invoicing app and I was creating the front end meaning like the HTML CSS JavaScript the graphical stuff that you see you know they point click on if you go on Instagram calm right now all the stuff you can see and hover over and click that's all your frontend stuff but then when you actually hit a like and it says now in this picture has 232 likes that's being stored in a database somewhere so then when you come back it still says 232 likes right it doesn't go back to 0 it's not let it just forgets it remembers it somewhere that's what it means to have a database database is what allows you to save stuff okay database is like equivalent of having a memory card back in the day when people used to play games they needed a memory card you remember that database is like on your phone the place that allows you to store your stuff locally the database is just online so I had to learn all these things and yeah it was just a really fast and an experience and then two months of working with them I ended up getting a pretty awesome check of about I mean it wasn't just one checked I was invoicing them on a weekly basis I'll show you guys my invoice too right here and I ended up getting a twenty thousand dollar check from them which was super dope and this was while I was traveling while I went skydiving while I saw my nephew I mean I was still putting in work one of the times my mom was at the hospital so actually worked from the hospital which was super cool cuz like she would just go to bed and be sleep you know and be your heat in the heat in her healing process I'll just kick my feet up and I'll just be working from my laptop and just coding [ __ ] up and then getting paid for it and when she would wake up I could just focus on her and put the code stuff away so it's I wasn't realizing at this time at that time how amazing it was to be able to do that because to me it almost felt wrong it felt like I was playing a video game and I was getting paid for it literally felt like I was playing Street Fighter or Gears of War because you're creating stuff it's so fun and then somebody is paying you for what you wanted I'm like okay so this is the greatest job ever so I'm doing what I want I have my own client tip okay I had I was inbetween that client and some other clients I had the ability to choose my own hours of when I work they didn't care when I work just care it as long as they got done and then eventually I even hired other developers who started doing work for me but that's a little bit more advanced so that whole journey of me getting my first job as a Python developer be learning how full stack worth and being able to do their job at that time then that led to me getting more class the first job was what changed everything for me you know that stepbystep process those exact skills of how I landed that freelance and client the exact technical skills I needed not more not less the exact amount technical skills I needed to land that client and deliver high quality work for them I still delivered really high quality work but what this allowed me to do is now waste any extra time learning any extra thing that I didn't need to learn it was the fastest path to the fastest learning and the fastest amount of income growth okay and that's the intersection you want to be at and that's why I'm like okay how can we make something like this which provides value to everyone in the community clever programmer I can my main goal is to provide something so it can provide value to who I used to be if it could just help to older me cross that path and I got together in my team we spent a few years and we built an incredible course which is designed to help you go through this exact same journey help you the teach you the full sack skills and the freelancing skills to be able to do what I did to hopefully be able to get the Paycheck that I got maybe less maybe more that is up to you the clients all that you know I can't control that but I just did the best I could to just go through my entire journey and just be able to help you repeat that process down to exactly what ad you should run down to exactly what your LinkedIn profile should look like down to exactly how to apply for these jobs down to exactly the specific skill you need to become a full stack developer I also teach you Django and Python the same tool that I use to complete their job I want to teach it to you I want to show you how to invoice people and charge the clients which are worse and be able to charge between thirty five or seventy five hundred fifty dollars an hour I don't want to say this is something you can do this is only something you can do if you put in a lot of hard work and follow up step by step system everybody's gonna make their own amount of money there's something I'm trying to put together they'll help you and guide you in that process okay so if this is fascinating to you this is interesting click the link below I've I've put together this program you can go to it the enrollment it
