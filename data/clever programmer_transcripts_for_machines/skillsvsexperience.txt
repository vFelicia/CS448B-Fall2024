hey guys hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm so on my Facebook page today I got a story to tell you first of all check out this chair how awesome I feel like I'm strapped in like a little baby like look at my head it's just so strong it's so good okay so anyways before I waste any more of your time I I kind of made a post on my Facebook page and essentially it was like hey guys go check out my learn Python olp course which is a paid course I don't know why everybody goes so crazy about that and one of the gentlemen said like he saw my course and then he goes blah blah blah you are a scam your Facebook course should be priced at $50 and not any higher and I replied and I said well yes but also not yes and because you know there are lots of other things that are being offered in there and I specified each thing like okay we have a slack channel and then we do like life a route meetings and we like try to build some projects together and bunch of students even get lots of oneonone help and then he responds back to me and he goes you're not a real software developer I just checked your LinkedIn you're you haven't worked for anybody you you are like a fake and so then I saw that message and I was like well you know I kind of got at that point I kind of got defensive I wanted to I wanted to say something I wanted to say something back but then I started thinking from this gentlemen's perspective and and the one thing I did say to him was okay you're not gonna go and look at the five hundred thousand people that are on the YouTube channel finding valuable information and you're also not gonna find like the five thousand people that we have enrolled in our courses at clever programmer but you're gonna like go look at my LinkedIn might as well also look at my Google+ page another social media thing that almost nobody ever uses so that was very interesting and you know I was trying to reason with this gentleman and I was like go check out my github and I've made apps and you can even see my apps and it's all like all open out there for the world to see but then I took a step back and I kind of stopped and I you know I got to thinking okay why was this person so emotional and why was this person who barely knows me probably never watched any of my stuff got like really upset about this that I was actually like selling a course or you know got personal he went from price of the course to like calling me a scam and I I I got to thinking and I was like okay what could be the reason and I think I'm kind of starting to understand right so he wasn't really upset at really what I was doing but what he was kind of upset at is how come I have more experience and it's very possible he could maybe he's a professional software developer I don't really know the gentleman but maybe he saw that he had so much experience and he just worked for so many years and then there's somebody else out there who is actually able to help more people and offer more valuable information to other people and other people are following that person and learning from that person and it ultimately comes down to that right I have more experience how can you be ahead of me how can you provide more value to people right that will happen with everybody in their lives that will happen with you all the time people will always question who made you the expert and they always want you to be the one who just backs out and goes yeah you're right I'm not the expert let me just go back let me lower my selfesteem let me lower my standards let me lower my rates because let's be honest I'm not an expert that's what they're actually trying to do they're trying to bring you down so when I get kind of that kind of feedback it's almost weird but I get excited I love that energy even if it's negative energy I want to take it and turn it into a positive energy for myself because it just tells me that I'm doing something right and it should also tell you that you're doing something right when you start to get people who really want to bring your energy levels down because they can't take it anymore it's actually a self projection kind of like how if you are you want to start a business or you want to do something and you'll I don't know one of your cousins or your uncle or your mom or one of your friends and they'll be like you will fail and you know I love you very much but you know back when da da da started something bad person failed and then but back when this person started so when they're talking about their failures right they're not talking about you they're talking about their failures and they're projecting it onto and saying you will fail as well okay they can't wrap their heads around what you're doing or if you start to up your rates and actually get jobs where you are providing high value and also making lots of money back they'll be going what bar you can't charge that much you're not an expert it's not that there are going against you or taking a stab at you is that they can't justify how they would be able to do that and they can't justify why they spent so much time learning these things and they're not able to do as much as you or get as many things as you are getting so it's it's a self projection is what it is and skills will always beat experience and that's why I'm such a big you know proponent of that fact I am very young right and it doesn't matter how old you are or how young you are what matters is your skill I know for a fact that I'm better than a lot of software developers I'm also not blind and stupid and I know that there are but Jillian software developers who are better than me I don't claim to be the best I've never claimed to be the best but what's very important to understand is whether you as long as you can help somebody else that's all that matters that means you're gonna stay in business and whatever it is that you do so understand that skills will always always always be experienced and don't let anybody tell you otherwise and don't let anybody else bring you down because to be honest with you you know this stuff gets to you and like there are times where I'm reading it and I'm like wow like this is you know it gets kind of depressing sometimes you read it and you're like wow I really must be doing something wrong here but sometimes if you take a step back and kind of console your own self but also understand your own value right and you don't have to explain yourself to people but you can know what your worth is you know don't let people like undervalue you because that's what they'll always try to do so I just thought that that kind of wasn't cool but rather than just kind of ignoring it I wanted to share with you guys because I think that important takeaway is that skills will always beat experienced and wide that should be consoling to you is you don't have to be you don't have to have started programming when you were five so then when you're 20 years old you can say you've been programming for 15 years you can learn you can start learning when you're 20 get really good and then get a job all your 20 okay you don't need experience you need to skill so if you've built something then yes you will get that job or whatever it is that you're trying to get okay and this is regardless of just coding pretty much in any field of supplies also I am taking the mouse north chess team I'm also their assistant chess coach because that's where I graduated from high school and I used to play chess on the chess team and then ended up becoming top one percent in the country and then you know I play at international chess tournaments or local chess tournaments what have you so I'm going to be training them and we're going to state championships I leave this morning and then we're gonna be going four state championships in Peoria and so it's gonna be pretty much nothing but chess so I'm going to be giving chest lessons I'm going to be helping coach each tune one on one I also have to help the whole team kind of come together be able to work together throughout the tournament and I might also make a video or two on chess so that's kind of what's going to be coming up and yeah if I get time to make the video if I don't then I might not be here for a few days and then I'll come back and jump in right here with you guys okay that's it I just want to share that with you guys I love you guys so much take care and I will see you in the next video
