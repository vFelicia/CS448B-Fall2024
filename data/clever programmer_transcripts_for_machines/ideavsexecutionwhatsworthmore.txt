so after making this video I realized the camera was shaking like crazy so I'm sorry I don't want you guys to suffer from like a stroke or a seizure but I think that what was said in the video is important so worst case scenario you can just not look at the video and listen to it and I want to just apologize in advance I'm sorry but I think what is covered in the video is very important and I think it's applicable to every single one of you and it's the idea of ideas versus execution and what's worth more and what should you value and focus on more this can help you with Landing jobs this can help you with how you should price yourself and this can help you with when you're working on your entrepreneurial idea and you want to launch a business how should you value and how should you come up with the different percentages for ideas versus execution so watch this video I think it'll be helpful to you again I'm sorry for the crazy seizure shaking okay didn't realize that sorry enjoy hey guys what's up this is ky from clever program.com so I just got an email from somebody and I am like this one this email got me triggered like so hard and I wanted to just share that experience with you guys and talk to you and maybe you can tell me maybe I'm crazy okay so I got this email and we we're just going to call this guy the the 0.5% guy okay 05% guy and here's what happened okay so the email went hey I got this amazing idea for an app that I think could revolutionize the world and I found your channel and blah blah blah and uh I think we can work together so I'm like okay great usually when people have ideas of uh like revolutionizing the whole world it's either one of two things one yes they're ready for it and that what whatever idea they have they'll revolutionize the world world with two they're completely delusional let me explain why I would say that they are sometimes tional because to say such a to say such a bold claim you have uh you have to have some evidence to kind of back it up you have to have something that's providing some kind of data or some kind of analytics like let's say the Apple's already getting thousands of people and then he had an idea to work with me to kind of like improve it and take it to the next level then that would make a ton of sense I would I would totally understand I would be like okay if you already have results and now you want me to help you improve it so you're not delusional let's work on it but here's where the delusionality comes into play where they have an idea but there's nothing backing it up so that's where your detector and your brain goes off and you go okay um there's probably nothing there and they just want to build something from scratch and then they think that it's going to compete with Facebook and all that stuff so great now with that part out of the way the part that actually bothered me a lot was something something different okay it's okay to have Big Dreams because that's what allow us to pursue our goals right I don't look down on people who have a crazy goal like if you think you're going to compete with Google that's a great goal but you need to then start actually working towards it and if you can use energy like that to go towards your goal you're going to be successful even if you don't make something that would compete with Google you'll create something good but if you have a goal and you don't act on it that's when you're in when you're in trouble right uh like my own brother had this crazy app idea that would require like bajillion dollars he's like it's going to change the world and I have this idea but he didn't pursue it right so that's what makes it weak the idea is what makes it great okay let's continue further as to what actually bothered me about this particular person's message and triggered me and he said we'll work on this blah blah and i' and I'd like to give you a share uh it's a great idea and i' I've have I've gotten some feedback from people from schools and uh it it's going to be like a real killer in the social media world I said okay sounds pretty interesting but you know uh to be frank I'm kind of busy right now working a lot on my YouTube channel so it's not something I can really pursue at the moment it's not in line with my goals um I would recommend kind of hiring a developer and this gentleman said well kazzy if you choose to work with me then I would like to even give you a certain share or a percentage in the company um and I again replied I'm like I'm sorry it's too difficult um but you know I can do it and then I got a reply back that said this okay that said I'm going to give you 0.5% share and and if it was any other day I would have said nothing and just moved on I would have just ignored that email or would have deleted it but it wasn't any other day and I read it and I was like I replied back I mean I said did you mean 0.5 out of one as in 50% like is that what you meant to say maybe you just use the percentage sign incorrectly did you mean to say 50 50% and the reply came back and he said no I meant 0.5% because it's my idea and this brings on a huge problem that I want to talk about because and this is applicable to all of you okay so it's not like you're just only watching this right because you're on my channel and you know me right I I want this to be also applic able to you in your life and I'm going to tell you why it's so applicable and this is one big mistake and I think it's just it requires you to reframe your way of thinking people put way too much value on ideas and not enough value on execution the number one secret why Facebook became Facebook out of Myspace out of Twitter and out of like a bajillion other things do you think it's because of just an idea do you think that nobody else had a idea for social media do you think nobody had nobody else had the idea for Uber no what made those work was it the idea no the idea actually had very little to do with it everybody has an idea it was the execution that was key that made it a reality you see um this channel clever programmer as small as it is right now do you think it was an idea that brought it to this level right it wasn't it was us working together having a back and forth and if I didn't provide you value the channel wouldn't grow right and also it required on my end to work a lot make videos give you guys lots of things that were beneficial to you it wasn't my idea that really helped right yes ideas what sparked the initial thing like oh this is something that would be really cool but it was the tremendous amount of effort that is behind the scenes that's not visible to most people like right it's not like my chest tastic business that I started which was chess and it kind of went nowhere it was my idea was there but you know what kind of made it feel the execution worked really hard on it for a year half a year but then I kind of stopped if I had continued working on it it would have been probably at a completely different place right now so that's my point right execution is King work is King content is King and just talk ideas they're fluff ideas are almost nothing so in my perspective work is a lot more important than an idea okay like let's say this person had not a revolutionary idea some really crappy idea but he chose to pursue it Mr 0.5% if he chose to pursue it he would have been in a much farther place right now than having an idea nobody there to work to bring that idea to life so it actually should have been something if anything it should have been the opposite it should have been 0.5% from idea I'll give you 99% for actually working and bringing it to life right or it should be worst case scenario should be 50/50% but honestly I'm a huge believer that ideas are important but execution is king So if you just have an idea and you want to pitch to a software developer you want them to bring your idea to life don't say 0.5% um it takes years and years for businesses to grow and for that 0.5% to mean anything for me I would have to work on it for 10 years and it would have to be as big as Google for me to have some kind of Chunk that was actually valuable or worth it for the time and the effort so give if we have to reverse this and convert it into a 80 20 year rule 80% of your focus should be on execution getting technical skills and then 20% on the ideas okay so work on your negotiation skills soft skills work on your technical skills use those right those are real tangible things use those to build something ideas they're weak people spend months years coming up with the idea the website the tagline the logo like even looking back I don't I didn't need to work so hard on my logo for the channel or whatever like I could have waited and which is actually what I did I waited for a while but again those are those are ideas those are kind of like things that take a lot of time but don't really produce any real results so focus on learning things and get just get going you have something got an idea get going don't overthink it and don't value ideas so much and make make them this mythical thing okay I want you to be realistic optimistic but not Dreamland and wavy not here okay so 0.5% I I I wrote him back a long email I wasn't very happy um it's disrespectful but more importantly I just wanted to like I want to actually help him and tell him like not only how it came off but something that he shouldn't think about but then he replied to me and you know he he he didn't get it he just said oh thank you okay like he just kind of ignored it and that's fine and that's fine maybe he will make the next Google or the next Facebook you know who am I I don't know but from my personal experiences and also learning from Elon Musk Steve Jobs like all these autobiographies that I've read and a lot of these people that I follow and learn from that's not what happened they worked on it Elon Musk used to sleep TW like used to work for 20 hours sleep in the same place where he worked and when his employees would come in he told them wake me up when you come in so he could get back to work on the day of their launch for uh what's now called PayPal it was called something else I can't remember commented below if you know but on the day when Elon Musk was launching it Elon Musk was the founder of the original PayPal he was up for 48 hours on the day of the launch do you think that was an idea do you think he came up with the idea and then went to sleep just like oh yeah 50% I'll get it he worked his ass off to make it a reality right so please value acttion ual work a lot more than intangible ideas there was my rant for today that's it guys thank you guys for watching I love your faces off comment below if you've had somebody approach you like this or if you had some preexisting myth and just let me know when you think about this right what what would you have said to this 0.5% guy would you have accepted him on this offer am I totally wrong you know let me know I would like to learn okay thank you guys love your guys' faces off and I'll see you in the next video
