hey guys how's it going this is going to be pretty cool because we have a livestream going on both YouTube and Facebook and this is my first time here in Romans group so basically today we're going to be talking about kind of the job opportunities that exist in the software development world we're going to be talking even about what programming language you should start off with we'll talk about what are some of the first things you should prioritize in order to get real handson experience and work okay and then I'll be taking your guys's questions along the way cool cool all right awesome we got a bunch of people coming in on YouTube we got a bunch of people on Facebook I can't see the comments on Facebook I'm going to click here hmm okay I'm going to try to figure out how I can see the comments so then I can answer your guys's questions along the way yep shouldn't this has started let me refresh here this live stream stuff always always a little bit finicky we're going to wait for a few more people to come in as well okay cool all right there we go okay so when did you guys kind of start coding you know give me a sense of it so we on Facebook we have a new audience that's kind of just getting to know me on YouTube you know you guys know me already maybe some of you guys are new so why don't you guys tell me kind of how long have you been coding for you know when did you start a programming you know I'll just be uni and I'm going to take on your questions and answer them live if I can see your questions so that's what I'm trying to figure it out oh okay cool alright Roman just sent me the link to the live ooh nice ok no feedback please mute mute and be muted meeting all right beautiful ok now I can see all your guys's comments perfect alright so great some people said for years George he says I started five years ago let me look over on what's going on what's the story on YouTube this is cool I got 2 things opened up here last year some people started in University cool so ultimately you know it really doesn't matter how long have you been coding for when you kind of started how much experience you have you know obviously if you have a lot of experience it's really good right but if you're starting out now that's totally fine as well because in my live webinar tomorrow which is like my live master class I really talk about the differences between a broke programmer versus a profitable programmer and one of the key things you'll recognize that I'll explain is that the difference isn't necessarily the experience or even the skills so you know I'm going to kind of go into that a little bit more tomorrow but you know first of all I just want to talk about the kind of the job opportunities that exist for software development you know that's where I kind of think the world is headed literally everything is being run on software from this live stream to Facebook itself to Instagram and all of that right now let me ask you guys what programming language are you guys using Oh some people started a week ago 20 years ago great 20 years ago nice lots of experience okay PHP Java that's great so um you know one of the programming languages that I use and I teach at clever programmer a lot is Python and the reason why I kind of teach that is because it's at the intersection of you know one being one of the easiest programming languages to being one of the most popular and trending languages and also it's a multipurpose and a pretty high paying programming language right there's a lot of demand for it so in the start it doesn't matter so much what language you choose because again it's mostly about what ideas you have in here and how you can bring them to reality right and what value can bring to other people with your skills that's really the key but what I advise is pick way if you're starting out you're brand new right pick something that's simpler but it's also powerful right because with Python you know Google was built off of Python right this is something I talk about all the time but I know there's a lot of new people so you know Google was built off of Python Instagram was built off of Python reddit was built off of Python right so lots of big powerhouses are actually being powered by Python and I'm not saying that it's more powerful than other languages I'm just saying that not only is it an easy language but you can scale it right and have a future in it if you were to start right now and then go further but if you start it off with JavaScript and you're already getting experience in it then stick with it stick with one programming language because what's really important are the concepts not necessarily the specific programming language syntax right the specific way you like write a squiggly or bracket and you close a function open a function like all of those things like lexical closures and all this fancy stuff that you can you get into that's not a huge deal the first thing you have to do is just wrap your mind around how this works and this a webinar is mostly for beginners okay so I'm going to be explaining lots of things to people who are kind of starting out that's my main focus and people also who are looking to switch into the programming field or you're just trying to figure out how you can start using programming to start getting clients or where to even look for work things of that nature alright so some people are asking me how long do you spend on coding how long arm somebody says you have a sexy voice thank you very much it's a great compliment 111 people hundred people on YouTube and 111 people on Facebook cool this is awesome this is weird Facebook is almost beating my youtube come on YouTube let's let's kick it up a notch alright so how long do I spend every day on coding programming um it depends you know I I you I was spending about 15 hours to 20 hours a day when I was picking it up you know that was one of the ways where I was able to pick it up in less than three months a lot of people go crazy they're like you can't pick it up in three months it takes 25 years and like a boatload of experience and all that and yes I mean of course you know to get become a really highlevel professional become really skilled that's how long it will take you but to say that you can't actually get work to say that you can't actually start earning an income and making a living off of it that's just BS you know because one of my biggest problems one of the reasons why I started this channel is that everybody always makes it seem like to break into this industry you have to have like ten years of experience or you have to have so much knowledge and all of that right so not necessarily true my background pretty weak in math um I mean I've worked hard in math and to kind of make up for it but still like math is not my forte I'm not necessarily like you know a genius but I just spent a lot of time working on it and it's kind of just like you know you pick up and then it becomes natural to you programming is kind of like that too you know I just did it a lot and then it became a way that I was able to think in it but what's more important are the skills that are around programming you know the skills of how do you market yourself how do you position yourself how do you stand out from the crowd and how are you able to get work you know those are the skills that ultimately really really matter obviously obviously your actual skills in coding matter as well because if you can't do programming then nobody is going to hire you right but to get work to get entrylevel work to get junior developer level work or even to work as a freelancer right and get clients that's not hard and doesn't necessarily always require like three years of experience for it in like entrylevel job okay all right so this is great a lot of people are on the channel I love programming have you know lots of experience you guys are very experienced this is really great and you guys have experience with multiple different languages so that's another thing I want to kind of expand on if you pick one language that doesn't mean that you're kind of stuck with that language right if you let's say start off a JavaScript or let's say you start off with csharp it doesn't mean for the rest of your life you're a csharp developer or a JavaScript developer that just means you know that's what you kind of start off with and you could choose to just pursue that one language or then kind of branch out like for example you know I'm huge on Python I just think it's the best one to start off with and most of the top universities agree you know UC Berkeley and MIT and all of them are switching over to starting people off with Python and they don't do it based off of feelings they do it with statistics and facts and they figure out that students just get better results when they start off with the language that doesn't necessarily get in their way it it just lets you implement your ideas at a very fast speed right so you're not held down by the syntax you just kind of get going you're very productive but let's say then after you get those core concepts and you want to transition then you can switch over to another language so for example let's say you want to do web development with Python right you start off with Python you experience in it now you can pick up JavaScript and then you know use that use a framework like flask or Django and now you have to learn HTML CSS and you kind of you know work with them together okay so don't necessarily think that you're stuck with one but I do think that the first language you choose is important and I also think it's important to kind of stick with it to get the concepts down yes being familiar with Linux will of course be an advantage being familiar with the command line will be an advantage so you know if you get extra time I'll work with those things you know try to that's why what I suggest all the time is especially I see a lot of beginners they want to just use some big fancy they're called eye bees so they want to use just some big fancy tool to run their code for them but they don't understand how it's actually running so I always recommend to use the command line as much as you can you know like stick with the command line you know that ugly looking black screen that has code like matrix you know use that to get stuff done because you'll improve your skills a lot faster and I realize there's a the audience we have right now you know you guys some of you guys are you've been you have a lot of experience and some of you guys are just starting out so I'm trying to meet you half way you know um I don't want to use like um I'm trying to meet you halfway but my focus again is on people who are kind of starting out and want to get that breakthrough yeah Ruby on Rails and all of those things are good skills to learn but what I recommend again is you know focus on one language whatever it is that you pick up go go hard on it right just focus on one thing and then improve your skills in that one thing for a while for getting actual work it's not that hard you know it's good to do programming problems and exercises to improve your skills and go through the academic route which I'm not a huge fan of but it's kind of good to do that you get something you get your feet wet but you know focus on projectbased learning so where you can actually go and get realworld projects that represent what you do in real world so instead of you know if you have a choice of making a factorial problem versus you know a choice of doing a project that's like a web app I would say try to choose the web app because at the end of the day you have something to show for it and you have realworld experience whereas you do the factorial problem you really don't have anything to show for it um and I have done the more technical things my whole you know career like when I was starting out that's kind of what I did just started off doing very you know just hardcore stuff you know in the command line all the time doing programming problems like factorials and whatever right those those problems that you get on project Euler hacker ranked I was doing all of that but then at the end of the day what I would realize is that I didn't have a portfolio that I could show people so some of the resources I want to give you guys that are excellent and are free I suggest you write them down like literally have a pen and pencil next to you and write these down because these were some of the things that helped me become you know a software consultant at less than three months like I went from knowing nothing about programming to knowing enough where I was proficient and I was actually working with clients making enough money to replace my job that I was doing right and then I just after that that allowed me to just kind of break through and break into this field so some of the resources are going to give you they're all free so one of them is Coursera right some of you guys might know it some of you guys may not it spells see oh you are Ser eh if some of you guys know it write it down in chat so other people could see how it's spelled another great resource is Udacity okay that's two so just for now just write these down you don't have to actually open up the tab because when I'm trying to share with you guys is you know might be actually really important for you so just save this for now so then you can go to it later Udacity is great if something is covered on Udacity you generally don't need to go to another one to cover it you can just kind of cover it from there juda me is pretty good but generally I try to stick with Udacity and Coursera because you did me generally just like one guy in his basement you know making the video so he can make some profit on the side some courses are really good but you know most of them are just they're just kind of weird you know there's very low production quality and also the material they're teaching and there are a lot of the times there's a lot of sacrifices that they make just so they can bust out and and get that entire course kind of done but you know have udemy definitely at the back your head in the list and then you can go to these resources and learn from them for free another one is EDX EDX okay so that's a really good one you can try out thank you guys for writing this down okay cool we got lots of people um yeah and so where my and for you guys who don't know me you know I'm the CEO founder of clever programmer it now is a entire company it kind of just started off with me and I was just like I want to teach people programming because how they're teaching it in schools they kind of screw a lot of people over and I saw lots of my friends quit programming or software development but it wasn't because they thought programming or whatever sucks it was just that they thought they weren't being taught it the right way or at least they didn't know that but I would see that and I would know because the first week the professor would give them hello world and the next week they would be doing some ginormous project and then I saw other people quit because for years and years they just did theoretical crap then they got graduated and then they didn't have real skills to actually get a job like what's the whole point of going through college and putting in all this tremendous amount of effort doing all this theoretical stuff that when you get out nobody sees you as somebody who's able to help them or skilled or practical they just see you as this weird esoteric theoretician right so go if even if you're going to college you know keep going but just understand that you know being practical versus just theoretical or very two different things you know one will keep you a profitable programmer and the other one will keep you a broke really educated programmer so you want to either be but you want to be kind of balanced right not just go crazy on one side you know so that that was one of the reasons why I actually made the clever programmer channel so I could share how to actually you know transition from your because nobody shares this stuff right the only share technical programming software development stuff but they're not necessarily sharing how do you take your technical skills how do you approach a client where do you find a client how do you actually get a job even if you have no experience how do you actually make that transition from your current job right what if you have a current job right now how do you actually find time to start coding in a realistic way and then make that transition as fast as possible where you start earning income with programming like they take the money in but they're not working to put the money back in your pocket right so not to say that the courses aren't great is just that they aren't teaching you skills that are very important for you to become profitable or earn a living with programming and actually be successful in it right like one of my mentors this is a story I sent out in an email today one of my mentors and this guy always wore this like ugly blue hoodie and he was a phenomenal phenomenal coder unbelievable programmer he was programming since he was like four he would literally only work with me for that hour that he was paid right when in my earlier days when I wanted to pick up programming I would hi I hired him so he could tutor me so I would go to my other job and any money that I got I would spend it to kind of increase my programming skills I would learn on my own and then I hired this tutor or mentor or coach he literally only worked with me within that one hour and then after the second that hour was over he that like that was it he stopped anytime I asked him about technologies that were outside of his scope or that he didn't know or he didn't cover he would just tell me like no can't help you with that any time I asked him about advice he would say things like you know do what's best for you right so I wanted to know should I keep pursuing my college or should I focus more on getting clients or how can I even get more clients and I never really got any real help that was useful but then later on I got a much much much better mentor who I even paid more and he didn't start coding since he was five but he was very profitable he was earning more than ten times what my previous mentor or my previous coach was making so this kind of goes to show you that yes experience is really important but there are a lot of sauce that are important but you know it's one thing to learn only the technical skills for programming from one place only the soft skills from a completely another place and then having to do the guesswork on your own my I'm what I'm trying to do is take that away from you and just show you them together like building your technical skills alongside your soft skills so you can start you know getting clients getting work having something to show for what you're doing more of this is going to be covered if you guys are on the Facebook page or if you're on the YouTube in the link below I have my master class so that's going to be covered in that as well I go a lot more in depth about all of this stuff okay so how do you actually go about getting a client where can you start today even better resources that you guys can start using because there's a lot beneath the surface that goes on and it's a free masterclass so you join it you know you watch it then those skills you can actually apply right away right I even show you like some of the places where you can actually go to apply today to start like earning income like one of the places I'll tell you right now is called up work okay so some of you guys might know it and if you go there and you literally type in Python or Python jobs or anything else you know JavaScript or whatever but my focus is teaching people Python but mostly I'm focused on teaching you the principles and you know like what actually what it actually takes to create those apps which you need to think about and actually how to deal with clients then you could take that and apply it to other things like JavaScript or whatever you want to kind of pursue you know so that's kind of what's covered in all of in the entire webinar that we're going to be talking about tomorrow as well somebody says how about Udacity Udacity is really good you know that's what I was saying like Udacity is unbelievable so if you have the option to learn something from Udacity first you should go there first that would be great all right um somebody says let's see looking at some questions you know like my big thing is not necessarily always get a job and then just work there ninetofive I'm pretty big on having clients being able to choose my own hours being able to work remotely even having the ability to fire your clients that's a great feeling when somebody is just being a pain in the ass you have the ability to do that but you know you can take those skills and if your goal is to then apply and become a software developer full time job you can certainly use those to do that as well yes so Tim Sullivan tasks team tree house team tree house is a great resource that is one of the resources I personally haven't used that much but I know that it's really good some like one of my best friends who is also now a developer he used he uses team tree house so definitely one of the resources to check out you know and all you other guys who never heard of it write it down because what's really important is for you to find that right person that clicks with you or that right teacher right mentor right website whatever it is because sometimes you know what works for me might not work for you so you might go through all these fuss five or six different free resources I just shared with you and you might find out that one of them is your favorite you know and it might not be Udacity Udacity was my favorite and then just use that to kind of like pick up those skills and you know improve them and kind of get better at it on the new Boston at least an early stage yeah the new Boston is a good resource to go to you know I used to look at a bunch of his tutorials but again what's missing is like okay great I make all these little games and text programming you know textbased games and you know he shows you how to play with tech enter and Python framework but you know I don't see the connection between that and where to actually go to get clients so then and and how do I use what you've shown me in my portfolio because in my free you know in my even in my free Python courses I show you how you can actually take what you're learning even throughout the free course and just like start applying it to your portfolio so you can actually start working towards getting clients getting work I try to keep it applicable to that sense but definitely if you are not interested in looking for those soft skills and you just want to get those technical skills the New Boston is a really cool fun guy he's very calm he has a very fun style to teach unlike most other people who are just like it just seems like they're bored to death and I'm thinking how could you be bored to death this is one of those fields where you literally get to create whatever you want um like the first time I got paid to do computer programming I thought it was like a glitch I'm like are this seriously paying me for it's almost like playing a video game and it's like I'm just getting to create whatever I want whatever ideas I have in my head and they were paying me for that and I'm almost thinking is somebody gonna catch on to this and are they going to stop paying me at some point and to this day I think that because for its it's honestly incredibly fun because you are creating whatever the hell you want and so I never understand like it's your ideas in your brain and then you put them and now they're scalable to millions of people imagine you know this game on iPhones called dancing line if you don't have it get this game unbelievable game okay you can download it for free it's called dancing line somebody knows about it type it in the comments so other people can know what it is literally one of the most fun games ever some developers had an idea they wanted to make this thing to put it together and now it you know and it was good people liked it and it's solving a problem for millions of people that's what I love about software development it's not just you get to do fun work that's but it's it's really meaningful and impactful work that's changing the lives of hundreds thousands or millions of people you know that's what I kind of like about it you find a problem in let's say the world of fitness right you create a solution and now it's scalable all of a sudden millions of people and they have it on their Android and on their Apple phones you create a solution for um you know nutrition and all of a sudden everybody has it you create something for solving an illness or you know a wiki for knowledge and all of a sudden everybody has it or Web Apps you know even web apps like Instagram and even like random stuff whatever ideas you have a gaming app like for example I play I used to play FIFA a lot you know it's a soccer game and my brothers and I we would always try to create these World Cups so you know you go in the quarterfinals and then you go into semifinals and then you go into finals but FIFA didn't really have that to play with your friends or your brothers or whatever in a nice way and so then I coat it up a web app that did that and then it randomly selects teams for you it randomly puts you and when you click on you know when you click on which team you want and then you put in the scores and who want it automatically you know moves the right teams to the quarterfinal stage to the semifinal stage into the final stage like that's pretty exciting you know I was pretty excited that you could just literally take what's here and just may get a reality the ways to finding tech jobs yeah they're pretty similar in most countries here's why people get too caught up in the minutiae like the the syntax of the code or the technical stuff like oh the application thing is not the same or you know like a few processes are different but mostly the idea of getting work is pretty simple you know some people even somebody like James all teacher who has like started 20 different companies he's a software developer founder of so many companies and he's he's a pretty unbelievable guy if you don't follow him follow James all teacher but you know he says that your ability to get work is as is directly proportional or whatever to your ability of getting coffee with somebody so there's a lot of you know it's not like you're trying to trick people but people want to work with people they like and so there's a lot of soft skills and social skills involved that people don't teach together with the concept of programming right so programming is one aspect and then you have this whole another aspect of how to get good at jobs how to get good at interviews and what specific things you need this was for example in in your high school when you're taking those college a CTS it the way to score better on your call is re in your high school a CT which is the standard test in United States they used to kind of test your intelligence is not necessarily based on how smart you are but it's based on your skill of taking that test so the way to get good at that test is actually to take that test more and more times even though it's used to test your intelligence the way you get good at it is by taking that test and not necessarily by being smarter so that is pretty similar to the real world we're becoming a good programmer is not necessarily the same thing as getting good at getting good jobs or getting good work or getting good clients or knowing where to find clients and knowing how to keep a longterm relationship with clients you know knowing how to save client from leaving all of that and I use the term client a lot because you know I'm a huge follower of Johnson mez and one of the key things that he says that I agree with a lot is that even the people who hire you think of them as just like one client you're just getting a lot of work from that one client right which is your employer so yeah there you go I answered it all right I'm looking over some questions okay so you know again all of this stuff and much more will be covered in a lot more depth in that live training so if you're here literally stop go click that link and sign up for it if this is something you're even mildly interested in I promise you it could change your life because we're going to be covering a ton of stuff in there how do you learn to code in less than three months even more software resources that you can use that are free literally how you can start finding work what are the some of the best things you can start doing to combine your programming skills so you can start getting work you know all of those things get covered in a lot more detail and I'll also tell you my story of exactly how I was able to achieve those results in such a short amount of time so you could steal literally that and try to repeat it armed Oh is the link not there on the Facebook one no worries I am sending Roman the link and he should maybe put it up all right sorry about that I think I didn't have the link arm here the whole time on the Facebook page so I'm going to go put that up right now okay I think the link should be there everybody who's on Facebook let me know if that link is there I'm gonna refresh again everybody who's on YouTube you guys see that link right and if you guys signed up let me know in the comment section you signed up I'm actually super excited about tomorrow I think it's going to be pretty damn cool um somebody says build the olp course you know I'm also going to talk about my create apps with Python course and helping you land your first client that's one of the bigger goals join cool thank you thank you thank you for sharing that Roman yep okay cool so that thing is there it's kind of resolved yeah so everybody was on YouTube go click on that link you know sign up on it and if you're on Facebook you know go ahead click on that link and if you've joined let us know let me know in the comments below okay beautiful said Robley signed up awesome Zullo signed up beautiful I'll take on more questions in the meantime from people Tim Sullivan asks I know Java and C++ you know and guys if you guys come to this it's not necessarily strictly related to Python or like a specific tool or whatever so if you come to this live webinar you'll pick up stuff that you can use immediately in your life right after leaving it and that means even if you are using some different programming languages or you know certain different tools all right let's see what are some of the other questions beautiful ah exit says signed up great signed up to sign up for the live master class that I'm doing tomorrow it's $0 it's free okay sorry um the link is in the description so you can go there you know currently I'm working with clever programmer building up this entire brand most of my work was just working with salt you know consulting and making software for lots of different people and now my main focus is clever programmer we have over two million viewers we have 20,000 plus students enrolled in our programs and those numbers are just going insane actually now 27,000 people enrolled in our programs let's see YouTube subscribers 50,000 YouTube subscribers and this was and it started about six or seven months ago so it's really kind of taking off I was I started it when I was doing all you know doing work going to college with and then with everything else that I was doing you know I was doing like four or five different jobs and so I literally had maybe one or two hours to spare every day and in that time I would make the YouTube videos for clever programmer for Python programming or even like some videos I think I've made on sequel and this general soft skills as well in those times to kind of build it up and then after it kind of became a big thing I'm just focusing on it the entire time you know now we have a team of developers that clever programmer that I've actually hired and that you know that we that work on this team we have marketing development reps we have all just you know we have a big team of people that helps make courses people who are editing these videos as well so now all our focus is making the courses making videos on programming because there's just a big need for this so that's where most of the focus is at this point but I still do software development mostly for fun and then some of the clients I still work with okay Rob says that's very awesome great okay great some people have joined who has joined huh Roman joined nice good job Roman Rob thank you for putting that in the chat so everybody could see exactly what were kind of most of the places that I mentioned today oxide says you look sexy nice somebody's earlier said my voice is sexy now somebody says you look sexy all right yeah I've been you know because I get to work on my own time and with my own clients mostly on now I've been focusing on learning jujitsu learning Muay Thai boxing lifting and then besides that just spending time with my family and friends so I'm probably going to be traveling to California in in a few weeks and then the rest of you know and then also most of my time is spent on just working on clever programmer pretty much the entire time that's one of my biggest focus hey man is it great to go with Django because Python a Python guy aashiq says yeah it's a Django is an awesome framework for Python so for example if you guys don't know Django some people who do JavaScript they have frameworks like nodejs so python has frameworks such as flask and Django so my future courses are actually going to cover flup flask and Django in a lot of depth and this course that's coming out touches a little bit on flask but mostly it focuses on helping you start making money with Python in as little as 30 days so that's one of my focuses of this new course that I'm going to be releasing in two days it gets launched act actually if you join the webinar it gets launched tomorrow and you get an early bird discount so this is a course that's focusing on not only Python but then immediately just like how do you actually get work and start getting a return on your investment but my all my other courses are free and I have one hundred and sixty videos on YouTube for training so if you just want to learn technical skills and you want to learn how to be proficient in programming and especially if you're kind of new to programming you know new when I say new you've been doing it for maybe a few months that would be the perfect start for you but if you have already been programming for a few years then those courses aren't going to be that helpful for you but the videos on getting clients finding work those are going to be really helpful for you and if you have experience you know start applying on places like up work there are literally so many jobs just type in Python jobs JavaScript jobs whatever and you get all these little nugget like projects so in my course I try to have you do those types of projects so then you can actually immediately apply to places and get you know started getting work that you can start putting on your portfolio but if you are if you already have experience you can start doing that now without necessarily having to take course or whatever the name of my youtube channel is clever programmer somebody wants to write that down in the description or in the chat go ahead do that I will love you I will love your face forever can we build a cryptocurrency blockchain I wish I wish I was that smart holy crap that would be unbelievable okay YouTube is now dominating Facebook like whiffed with twice the number of people on YouTube everybody who's on YouTube and everybody who is on Facebook if you have loved this so far yeah I love this if you didn't love it then don't sign up for the thing right but if you if you enjoyed it you got at least some value out of it something that you found that was useful go click on that link and sign up for that damn masterclass right that's where I want to see you it takes place tomorrow now two days from now whatever it's live it only happens once takes place tomorrow I'll be sharing some amazing secrets with you guys there as well and you lose nothing and everything that you take away from it is applicable right away ok so one hour long happens at 12 p.m. Chicago time tomorrow so click on that link and sign up beautiful michael says kishore says site is down really clever programmer calm can anybody confirm if the site is down that's scary um no I just went to clever programmer calm that doesn't look down I'll try the other one you lying to me let's see LC yro says where's your friend Tenzin Wow you know my friend Tom by name he's not here he's slacking I hope you're watching this Tenzin got to make those YouTube videos man it just takes a lot of like you know you just have to be consistent show up every every day that's what it takes you know building up this channel a lot of people like Oh an overnight successful not really like I literally gave up my life for the longest time spend 20 hour days working in the office I got this office I told a story yesterday but I'll tell it again so okay so here's the story I wanted to focus on this but the best way to focus is if you don't have a choice right if you have choices then you'll be lazy you'll procrastinate you'll be like oh the paper is due a month from now I'll just wait till the last day I won't do it today today I'll swatch some cat videos I was already very motivated to get clever programmer and this channel going but I thought what if I kick it into high gear right and go in survival mode so what I did is I like stopped working with all of the clients that I was working with gave up actually the job that I was doing cut all my sources of income got this office so there was an additional expense that actually actually had to cover and what happens when you're in such a dire survival mode your brain gets a very creative right and you become very creative and your work ethic is there and so what I started so then that allowed me to actually just focus and go crazy on building this entire channel building this entire you know now it's like a revolution it's not just a channel anymore because before it was just like okay it's just me putting videos and now it's all you guys you know that are part of this right and lots of people are getting amazing results so that is what kept me going and I just decided okay this is what I'm going to do and I'm just going to go kind of hard into it that's just how I think a lot of the times okay sites up great alright awesome um okay guys I'm going to start going in a little bit IRC room nice okay everybody on Facebook everybody on YouTube you know again you're enjoying this click on that link sign up for that thing I really want to see you guys tomorrow okay I want you guys to be there tomorrow Caleb yes I will do a vlog I've been thinking about that because there's just too much there's just too much stuff that I'm doing that's not only programming related and it's fun so I want to share that with you as well though you and I here are going to talk about programming stick to that but you know I would want to start that how long have I been programming about two years now to three years so actually not that long yeah but just to put into perspective my rates about like five times or more higher than the mentor that I was working with who had 20 years of experience when I started so I don't know if that puts it in perspective all right yeah the webinar is tomorrow 1200 Chicago time Tim Tim is asking lots of good questions but I don't want to just keep answering Tim's questions I want also like look at some other questions looking for other questions mmm okay I'm going to answer Tim's question I guess Tim says what is a framework in a language framework is just something that makes your life simpler for example English is a framework to express your thoughts language emotions and feelings right you can still express your emotions to me but it's going well but in English you could just be like I really don't like you right now I want to kind of shoot you in the face get away from here it's a framework that helps you kind of put things into perspective so in programming you could think of it like that you know it's a framework that frameworks make your life easier when there are lots of repeatable tasks framework kind of take care of that because they know it's going to happen all the time one example okay and it might be an example I'm going to set the risk of maybe some of you guys for starting out might not know this but when you're doing web development you always have to kind of run a server instead of writing your own server all the time like it's obvious that you need to be running kind of server flasks just kind of comes built in with that logic of a server so then you don't have to kind of write your own thing know jazz does the same thing you know has lots of builtin default intelligent things so that's really a framework okay hopefully that explains it all right ap a regex how important is yet regex how often will it be used it really depends what you do if you're doing web development maybe it's that it's not that important it'll help you it'll make you faster but it your work won't be critically stuck on it but if you're doing lots of text analysis data parsing all that then you should be good with regex regex stands for regular expressions regular expressions mean you can find patterns in a text weird example maybe doesn't even make that much sense but um what are the best ways to explain it like for example if you did ctrl F right now and you try to find for some word and you try to differentiate between a Python with the capital P versus Python with the small P that's kind of hard to do but if you're in word document or something click on case sensitive right but what if you want to find a specific pattern that has Python followed by a number after Python one Python two now you can start using regex that only looks for the word Python followed by some numbers after it and any numbers and then it can highlight that and catch that whatever esoteric example it's one of those things that you kind of just have to look up look at a bunch of examples and then it starts making sense is used a lot of the times when somebody gives you their email address so if somebody gives you their email address you can use regex to figure out what's before the @ sign and then what's the domain after the @ sign so or if somebody gives you their phone number it has parentheses around it right so like think about this when you're filling out an application online and you're putting in on a phone number sometimes you might be wondering should I put the parentheses around it should I put the hyphens in it what if the computer reads those hyphens and get confused what if it's you know thinks it's something else but no matter how you put the number the computer automatically parses through it and understands what the actual number is and they're using reg X there as well um okay hopefully that kind of answers it mark says why don't I get your email I think you should have gotten my email now well but explain to me what like why why were you expecting to get an email from me so then if there's something wrong on my end I can fix it and I'll manually send you an email Kishore thank you for all Indian guys or all Indian girls everybody's welcome okay girl guys everybody's welcome it will be 1030 p.m. that's when the webinar happens I signed up where can i watch it tomorrow don't worry about it if I have your email you'll get the right time and everything in the email I'll send you multiple emails tomorrow reminding you about the webinar everybody who's here if you're still here click on that link and sign up for that webinar I want to see you there happens tomorrow you learn skills of landing a client creating apps what can you do to get a job really fast how can you go about building your portfolio all those things and more the differences between broke programmers versus profitable programmers and I'll give you a hint it's not experience or skills so if you want to kind of learn more about it and even use my exact blueprint for how I learn all this stuff got it and if you want to just steal that show up to the webinar tomorrow all right please explain api's maestro Arthur good question API is application programming interfaces how should I explain it hmm let's say you want to use the power of entire Google in your app well you could write all the code that Google has so you can try to create your own Google Maps they'll be really complicated to use in your own web app it would take you a long time to create your own search engine and to create your own entire you know Google Maps you'll need to buy satellites and data centers and spend billions of dollars or you can use the Google API s and then just that just allows you to use Google Maps all of that code and everything into your own app so for example Yelp uses Google's API so when you look up a map in Yelp com they didn't create the map they didn't spend years and years and years of hard work creating it from scratch they just use Google's API and you get all those results okay so that's really what API is do it lets you just steal code or build on on the shoulders of giants think of it like that is Python better to land a job than learning csharp no there's no such thing you know there's job opportunities for both I say Python because Python focuses more on making you speedy and making you more productive the developer rather than C sharp which focuses on making your code faster and more productive my personal preference is Python arm but if you're already down the path on a specific language there's no reason to switch just focus on skills of getting better at jobs interviews getting jobs things like that you know those those soft skills but there's no like one language that's better or best than everybody else it comes to a preference you know ultimately um okay so I'm going to take last questions and then I am going to run because I got to start preparing for the giant event tomorrow which is going to be pretty exciting whoo I always get this like adrenaline rush before coming on the camera and then once I'm here with you guys you guys make me feel so calm and comfortable with your questions and you start talking when you guys don't ask me questions and I have no questions I'm kind of like worried I'm like I always get a little bit not nervous but I'm just thinking like what am I going to talk about now but then when you guys have questions I'm like oh cool all right like every time I blank out I literally just go to one of your guys's questions it's like such a simple trick it's awesome oh wow Rob that's a pretty deep question my YouTube don't worry about my youtube link just type in clever programmer on YouTube and literally it's the channel that's growing the fastest and it'll probably take over some really big channels soon like we started from zero to 50,000 subscribers because of you guys thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you um so yeah you'll find it just type in clever programmer or even my name but you guys don't know my name is Rafi Kazi Rafi Kazi I go by my last name cause II and I go mostly by Kazi from clever programmer okay cause II like kamikaze ok ROM asks haha nice ROM asks do you have a girlfriend is that what contributes to higher salary I don't have a girlfriend right now a but yes the ability to have a girlfriend does contribute to a higher salary because it means that you're somebody who people like to get along with so there you go okay now I'm going to answer the question will the constant use of a framework decrease your programming skills since a lot of it is automated beautiful question love that question really great question so basically he's saying like if you use lots of crutches does that limit your skill to a certain extent and that's why people who want to teach you and when you're learning we try to tell you like hey don't use all these big things that kind of take care of you and handhold you do it yourself and once you understand how to do yourself then use these big frameworks and these big technologies in the start I tell you don't even use an IDE because you don't know how to then use the commandline interment which is very important only switch over to an IDE which is an integrated development environment once you have that skill set and you actually understand how everything is working then you should use it so frameworks yes they can do that to a certain extent but when you're learning try to do most things from scratch okay and then start switching over to doing them from the framework great question wrap should you use mathematics should you practice mathematics more to be able to create calm complex or applications so like basically more complex applications you don't really need math so these are some of the big myths that I debunk in more details tomorrow you know do I need more math do I need to be smarter am I too old for this you know like am I too old to do computer programming we get into more depth on that because those are very important you know and they can have a big impact on your career but to answer to you right now more math no unless you're going to a specific field then yes it'll help like it'll help you more but will it stop you and it will make it hard for you become programmer absolutely not if anything I should be a good example of that I'm not a good mathematician at all and yet I was able to create very complex applications because the beauty in coding is that you build on top of already a lot of existing stuff so when you need to do something with a lot of complexity you gain a lot of the times use stuff that people have already built so when I have to do stuff with you know when I do machine learning stuff and when I do stuff that does image detection and when I do stuff that I can like look at two different videos and automatically tell you the differences between each or I do stuff that using Python creates an application where if you hold a ball in front of a camera it tracks the camera that's not me writing the math behind it somebody has already done that I use their frameworks I'll learn how to use those libraries and then I do those applications or whatever you still need to have the programming skills to put the pieces together and understand how everything works if your programming skills suck that is not a possibility for you so I want to answer that question very firmly that no math is not required to become a developer or a programmer somebody wants to challenge me go ahead ok Luciano asks arm certainly there are more profitable programming languages than others isn't it a clever idea to switch to a more profitable language yes if you can catch a trend switch to that earlier and be adaptable it's a very very smart idea don't be religious these are you know don't be like so closeminded if you're a Java developer like no Python no or if you're a Python developer to look down on every other language or every other tool or framework go we're kind of the trend is but don't let it distract you so for example if you're doing let's say csharp and you already kind of have a job and you realize and let's say you can make 70,000 80,000 or 90,000 dollars a year and then you see that in Python you can get a job for a hundred thousand one hundred and ten thousand you really think about if that switch is worth it if that time spent is really worth to switch that but now if you're on the other hand you're seeing a trend where C sharp is just getting dead and python or some other language like JavaScript is just skyrocketing then it's smart for you to start making that switch being adaptable pays off more than almost anything you know my oldest brother is almost doing a job you know where he's probably making quarter million dollars a year now and one of the biggest thing that he did was always switch you know very fast if he saw a different technology he would get that certificate so like my background you know even he taught me he helped me get my computer networking certification CCNA I then realized I didn't like computer networking but that's a story for tomorrow he basically told me or sorry basically what he did that made him so profitable and so good and so marketable was his ability to adapt to new technologies whereas other people anytime something obsolete they would just kind of die off because they had 20 years experience and they had like their ego in the way that kind of crushed them so throw away your ego just enjoy life you know learn something that you'll enjoy doing and love and then if you need to make a switch because it helps your family more or you can support others nearby you more or you can just live a wonderful lifestyle you know do whatever you want that's a lot more important than a specific technology or a language okay my beautiful people I love you guys so freaking much oh and if you guys want to get a book you know get this book not my book by the way I know a lot of people always want to ask Python programming great book teaches you but basics somebody in the comments you know please type in the name of it it's called Python programming by John Zell so other people could see it but yeah thank you guys so much for being here and watching thank you Roman for this opportunity to talk to these wonderful people this is my first time on the I love programming channel you guys had incredible questions let me know what I could have done better or if you guys would like to know other things for next time so I can keep it in mind in the meantime guys thank you everybody on YouTube for coming here I love you guys you know so I want to see you guys tomorrow okay lots of big things happening tomorrow I want to see you there so in the meantime sign up for that link I want to have at least 500 people so I'm going to go check right now and see how many people have signed up so go sign up for that so you guys can see me tomorrow and then I also will be sending you guys lots of you know valuable content so when I make new videos they're free they come right to you amazing content and even when I send you emails about new trends that are happening in the programming world or some new training programs that you guys could use that don't cost you a set all of that stuff I will also be sending you you know free of cost to you alright so we have about three hundred people who've signed up that's awesome we should we want to try to get more people so in the meantime guys please sign up I want to see you guys there thank you guys so much for being here and watching and as always I love your faces off and I'll see you eyes in the next video and now the awkward part of being live I have to actually close it in front of you finish bye guys bye facebook finish not working finish there we go and let's call it a day on YouTube as well take care guys thank you have a good one
