furloughed um i jumped into the five day react challenge to try and push myself uh definitely glad that i did i was really really nervous about it due to my skill level but um i'm happy that i took that leap of faith hey um as far as the future is concerned i'm just going to continue to grow continue to learn and uh hopefully repeat we ran into so definitely just want to say thank you and uh see you along the road see you guys nice i love when all of this stuff starts becoming like a real thing for everybody and it starts turning it into reality so it always hypes me up uh let's see who else we got is that jason her hey jason what's up guys uh my name's jason jason your voice is crisp and my experience with coding is probably about like four months in nice new coder i took a coding bootcamp and it was pretty good you know i learned a lot of my foundational things i made about three projects with full crud functionality i just don't feel like they look good or like real world applications so uh it's been pretty tough with the job hunt and i think um i joined this clever programming because i wanted to get like real world applications hey you know where to go for that let's go yeah to the react.js challenge and i looked through your channel and i was like totally amazed and i'm going to like binge through everything now and just like go through all of those videos um i love all those clone ideas and i think the biggest achievement for me was like totally grasping all these ideas i know a lot of time you guys were saying pattern recognition but beyond that like i actually really like your basic and like simple breakdowns of these concepts because to me like it made so much more sense than what i learned in my coding bootcamp to be honest um you guys explain it so so well um i think these real real world applications are really going to boost up my resume and portfolio so i'm looking forward to that and just actually just keeping in touch with this community and channel i think it's like one of the best things i've found so far hey let's go let me throw those air home sounds bro let's throw in some applause for jason oh crowd goes wild jason you're the man all right let's get back right into it so thanks guys for everything you've done i really really appreciate this it was such a great experience damn all right we're gonna be after going live in

know here we go what's going on guys patch more here checking in uh i'm an actor i'm a writer and i was also a bartender up until about six months ago when this damn coronavirus hit so i'm looking for a new opportunity so i decided to take up coding because it's creative and i've always been creative and so i love that about coding and i have a lot of fun with that part of it so um my experience in coding up until about two months ago was virtually nothing that's crazy bro from 11 year bartender and an actor to a coder that is sick but all those acting skills and social skills are paying off now because look at how good this looks bro so i hopped on a couple classes got my html and my css skills partly savvy um and i joined the uh cp five day challenge because i wanted to learn from the best and i've uh i'm a big believer and if you want to learn something and do it right you just got to throw yourself to the wolves learn it the hard way so that's what i'm doing um and the achievement i'm most proud of is definitely making this here amazon clone which i think looks pretty good looks fantastic i'm still working out a couple bugs but rest assured i will get there nice um you know now that i got coding in my life what is that my future looks like now is a future outside of bartending it's a glorious thought damn and um i'm excited to make my own hours make my own schedule dude i'm excited for you more time hanging out with people i want to hang out with yes i have more time to travel absolutely you know take days off or hell yeah whatever i need to do but i really enjoy coding i'm having a lot of fun with it it's very frustrating as we all know but uh i will not let that deter me so uh thank you to cp team and all you guys sunny qazi nas all you guys are killer slack
