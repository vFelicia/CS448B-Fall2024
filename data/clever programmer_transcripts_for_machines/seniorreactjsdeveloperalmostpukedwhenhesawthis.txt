eww dude what what's up how's it going this is kazzy let's get into a little bit of a story time here so the other day the craziest thing happened i was sitting on this chair here and i had a developer friend come over and he was coding it up and he's you know by far one of the best developers i've ever seen in my life like his knowledge of react is absolutely insane and he understands the api probably almost as good as dan abramov or dan yeah i'm probably saying his name wrong but he's the founder of uh you know he created redux and he everybody refers to him when it comes to react like all things reaction is like dan abramov is the god of react and when i was sitting with uh this gentleman this developer who's really really good he was killing it you know he's he's going through he's showing me a lot of like little hacks uh he was showing me a lot about typescript and how typescript is so useful and how he him as a senior engineer at his company he uses typescript all of a sudden out of you know he was coding on this computer he saw the fat cursor show up in in visual studio code as he's coding he's like and i'm sitting here and i'm like dude what and he just goes crazy he sees vim and he just can't handle it you know he's like this is gross he's like but all all right that's fine that's fine no matter and then he just keeps going and he keeps getting so annoyed and bothered by vim you know every time he's like typing he's like oh hit escape interesting it turns into a fat cursor again you know and uh again super awesome dude love the guy he's he's amazing i i'm even thinking about bringing him on the channel and actually teaching certain things but it got me thinking i'm like what's up with all this [ __ ] hate with them dude like what the [ __ ] is going on and you know i've seen this so many times with so many people like my friend david who works with us a clever programmer him too he's just always like god sucks you know i wouldn't use them ever and most developers that i know or have worked with they don't use them or they run away from them or they're talking [ __ ] about them and what i realized is most of them don't actually even know them and haven't even used it that much but they have so much against it and you know i just wanted to talk about it a little bit like it you know vim is not that gross okay and it's not disgusting and it's not ugh like what the [ __ ] is this i've been using vim for so many years of my life here's what i'll tell you vim is literally one of the most beautiful amazing things you could ever do in your life like it's is like mindblowing once you figure it out it's like whoa it's a whole new world it is your everyday your coding right and you're doing whatever you want but like if you start using vim it's like putting on these like psychedelic glasses and all of a sudden the whole world is just like oh like probably how joe rogan views and you're like whoa this is crazy i can do anything i can become anybody that i want it's that crazy of a difference let's use it i've never used any psychedelics so but that's besides the point but what i'm trying to say is when you do use vim it opens up a whole new world of possibilities for you and it is just so freaking fun to use and it will speed you up so much like as a developer you will go so fast so fast and what i always think when it comes to becoming a better developer is really you know there's different types of learning but one of the most common ways we learn as human beings is through trial and error so if vim allows you to essentially double your speed and i promise it'll allow you to weigh more than double your speed but even if it allowed you to just double your speed you've essentially doubled the speed of your trial and error which means you'll learn twice as fast and you'll improve your skill twice as fast which means you'll be able to get to your job twice as fast and that sounds hopefully to you amazing and something like you should want to do and you probably should do it and learn it now here's the thing and here's the catch with vim it has a slow learning curve it will mess you up when you are learning them okay it will slow you down your productivity will be a lot slower you'll be making a lot slow progress and that part about them is frustrating okay that part is frustrating it'll get to you it'll make you mad it'll make you angry but that's just the name of the game all right so the start there's a learning curve that'll slow you down a lot it has a steep learning curve but once you're used to it right your productivity will go down so if you start using vim today in your visual studio code or wherever and there are extensions you can go to visual studio code and just download an extension for them right and you go into it you start using it it'll like shoot your productivity down into the freaking ground it's almost like if you just started uh you know if you started learning how to write with your left hand or something it's almost like that kind of okay but once you become good at it then it's it is crazy it's it's the same as if you were able to like write with both hands at the same time so that learning curve just takes a little bit of time now here are a couple of things that i will tell you about vim that'll save you a ton of time all right if you want to get into it you want to jump into this world what i would recommend is go play there's this vim game online it's called vim golf i believe go play that go play this vim game online and it's like you have a character and you move them around with vim shortcuts and [ __ ] like that so play that and just have fun you'll learn how to move up down left and right which is not with your arrow keys it's gonna be with different keys okay so in vim you move around with hjkl okay h jkl so it's like weird and i was like hey h is moving you in weird directions and then jk is moving in l is moving in real direction so literally one of the most beautiful amazing things you could ever do in your life it'll throw you off you're like why am i moving like this but just play just play just play it until it's like pattern recognition habit and then you can bring that skill into your you know when you start coding i'll give you certain few key things to get started with all right but my goal is to get you to start using them and start actually just playing with it making mistakes having fun so i promise you it'll speed up your productivity like crazy all right so let's say you installed it in your visual studio code okay you go to your extensions shortcut is command shift x or on windows probably control shift x you go to your extensions you download them right and then you go back to your code and then it's like if you see that fat blinking arrow thing that's the mode people don't like being in that's like vim mode just hit i or a and that'll just like put you in regular mode okay and then you can just like code regularly how you normally code okay so you'll be totally fine if you hit escape it'll put you back into vim mode alright so that's just me teaching you how you get in and get out of it okay and then the other few things you need to know is ajkl how to move around and the nice thing is once you learn it your fingers never leave like their default position on the keyboard so you never have to go towards the arrow keys ever to move around anywhere you just stay in the home like default typing position and that will make you a lot more efficient and faster outside of that you know if you want to delete a line just hit d twice just try that it'll like delete the whole line all right if you want to copy an entire line just press y twice right and then go down somewhere and hit p it'll paste it as long as you're in vim mode all these vim commands work which means your cursor should be looking fat when your cursor looks fat you're in vim mode and then there are tons of other commands for you to know but i don't even want you to worry about that right now like in the start just learn to move around with ajkl it'll be weird but you'll get used to it all right dd to delete a line slash it also kind of copies it for you okay so you can paste it somewhere else yy to yank slash copy align p to paste those are some basic basic commands to get started with and then to go in and out of modes ina there's like a whole bunch of stuff okay i don't want to like overwhelm you and go into a fullon vim tutorial right here if you guys want to want to see that or want to see like how you use it with react or whatever let me know in the comments but look like as a developer as a frontend developer or whatever like even if you're doing react i think you should use vim in your code and i think it'll make you faster you'll start building components faster you'll like be able to move around the parentheses faster change the arguments fast it will just overall make your life easier in my opinion and uh you'll just feel like this badass hacker you know you just have this dope ass vibe about you that's why i like it okay so go out there go crazy have fun use it and uh in the comments below let me know if you use vim or if you're gonna start using vim or if you want see me make another video on vim and go deep dive whatever it is drop it in the comments below let me know if this is something you're gonna be doing other than that smash the like button so this video goes out to more people and as always i love your beautiful face this is qazi and i'll see you in the next video but that will make like oh wait what did they do i mean this isn't clickbait so that would be like good thing we have this recording we can add this as a pts after the video you did that i'll [ __ ] pay you an extra dollar you
