as a Python freelancer you could be charging the normal Python freelancer rate which for whatever reason is not available online I had to find out from my mentor and this was something that helped me you know I've told that story where I was on a phone call and I went from literally $50 an hour and I talked with my mentor he's like go 200 he's like no he goes I don't care how little experience you have you've only been in coding for three months whatever he goes doesn't matter they're trying to you $50 an hour for a Python freelancer is not right 150 an hour is what a Python freelancer should be making if not more so he goes I know you have less experience if you don't feel comfortable with 150 just go with a hundred so I didn't feel comfortable at that point to go to 150 I wasn't sure about my skills I got on this phone call and I said hey it was a scary phone call I've talked about this literally my hands were shaking I was like deathly scared and I went I'm like Kay so that $50 an hour rate we agreed on yeah that was just like my rate for doing like tutoring or coaching students but for my Python consulting rate I'm gonna charge $100 an hour and if that's okay with you we can move forward otherwise you know we can't and then on the other side he just goes he goes okay we'll see if it's in the budget and hangs up and keep in mind I'm a college student with a 2.0 GPA I don't have a fancy degree I don't even have my associate degree yet I'm in my second year at college and for those of you guys know who don't know what a 2.0 GPA means it just means you're a terrible student okay just take it like that and for me this is opportunity of a lifetime and I'm getting on this call and going from 50 to 100 it's a scary jump but the next day I received a message to set congratulations and you start this Wednesday and when I got that message I just saw it from the notification at the top of my phone I mean it was just like I was sweating you know for the whole day and then it just all that tension all the headache just gone and then eventually I started realizing it's not really that big a deal to charge $100 an hour though it was scary for me and also that shows the power of having mentors because everybody else stimuli just saying you're looking a gift horse in the mouth you're ungrateful and don't charge that much just accept what they have offered you already especially as that student okay alright so now I want to now and tell you this $50 an hour is a pretty low rate for a Python freelancer to charge really low rate but let's say you start at that rate cool you start at the $50 an hour rate somebody said give some other examples other examples of people who charge so yeah I'm giving you another example so one of my mentors charged $30 an hour another one charged $200 an hour as a Python consultant I had a mentor who charged $300 a Python consultant I know of many people who charge 7 or 80 dollars an hour I know because I've hired software developers and they worked for me and I paid them 70 to 80 dollars an hour to work for me on Python projects so $50 is a pretty low rate and again the 70 $80 an hour people some of them are wearing in United States and some I hired that were actually in India but it doesn't matter to me and it doesn't matter to a lot of people are hiring these freelancers they don't care what country or and as long as you're good okay and as long as you can communicate that to them all right and you can get the job done so anyways lower hourly rate is 50 now let's say you have one client at $50 an hour let's say you land you spend the next few months and you get only one o'clock okay you you try really hard but you only get one client for one or two three months you try one client at $50 an hour and let's say they don't give you 40 hours of work let's say they don't give you 30 hours of work let's say they don't give you 20 hours of work let's say they are only giving you 10 hours of work per week if you're charging them $50 an hour that's $500 okay in one week for ten hours of work and that's $2,000 a month okay I'm gonna say this again one client at $50 an hour for ten hours of work per week gives you $2,000 a month write this down just like that you can then do the math what can happen as you add more clients or as you increase the income or as you increase the hours the $2,000 a month is $24,000 in one full year I know that there's some people who are watching this right now that don't make $24,000 in one full year and you could do this with one client and you could do this with something that's actually enjoyable and fun you could be working on a security project you could be building a social media app with them you could be working with the team who's building a social media app so it's not even that hard you just communicate with them and they like you they just tell you what to do in the train you and you pick up those skills and then you start putting in that work and giving them what they need again it's not easy it's hard okay but if you follow this path okay and you use this this is possible all right it's doable the reason why when I say is not easy as I don't want people to come into this with like no intention of putting in any work you just want to like be lazy you want to be doing exactly what you're doing right now and for some reason come in here and think you're going to get massively different results if you start taking action on this and actually doing these things you'll get those results fast but again this is just one client I'm talking about all right $24,000 extra a year could mean you could start up extra business on the side could mean you could pay off all these annoying things that you don't like or it could mean you could pay off the mortgage or you know get a nice apartment and you don't even have to worry about essentially free
