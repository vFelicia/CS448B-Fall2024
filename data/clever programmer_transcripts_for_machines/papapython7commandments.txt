hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm also known as Papa Python in this video I want to give you the seven commandments of Python so let's jump right into it man read number one simple is better than complex this is a commandment I stole from Python and this is called the Zen of Python and if you actually put something in your terminal it'll just show it to you okay this is one of the things that python is known for and the people who made it people who are much smarter than I am they actually set that so simple is better than complex but what does that mean when you read that what does it actually mean in your life in your career as a developer what is it okay but when I read it I was just like oh it sounds cool but that's all I understood from it from more of a technical perspective we're to look at it like what it means in the coding world is a lot of the times people will do things a more complex way they'll write functions or they'll write code that is complex they'll write clever oneliners or two liners and three liners instead of writing code that is simple to read that is almost like English the variables that are clear and clean to understand function names that are clean and easy to understand and their code is written in a way where even if it didn't have any documentation it would still be very easy to read and this is very important because when people are trying to hire you they want to see that you are doing stuff thinking of other people or even thinking about yourself because if you write code that looks like gibberish you might understand it for a little bit but you won't understand it two months from now and other people looking at your code sure as hell will not understand it so simple is better than complex is a very important rule to live by number two is focus on building projects this is something I say in almost every video I know I don't care I'll keep saying it again and again till this point gets hammered home also I just realized I'm wearing a Python shirt so that's actually really cool okay why do I keep saying this point why do I keep saying focus on building realworld projects so much I say this almost every video this is one of the ways you're gonna get hired this is one of the ways where skill is gonna improve the fastest this is one of the ways you're gonna learn coding the fastest on and on and on but if you don't build actual projects you don't build something practical you're never gonna learn coding you're always gonna feel like you have imposter syndrome you're always gonna think you're not good enough and you aren't going to get as many job opportunities as somebody else who is doing lots of practical projects might alright this is one of the reasons why I see people failing quitting out of coding a lot of the times but they all they want to do is follow tutorials follow little programs that other people make copy paste code but when it comes to building something on your own they don't take on something to do you know a project that they want to work on your project doesn't have to be super complex okay you don't have to make the next machine learning algorithm that beats out Instagram and then now your new social media platform is the next snapchat you don't have to do that you can do something really simple you can make a very simple game okay whether you want to make a blackjack game or take tech toe or rockpaperscissors game or you want to make AG clone or a snapchat little fake clone or a portfolio website whatever it may be it could be some static boring easy website to make do something as you learn to code that's the only way you're gonna take all that knowledge that's in the tutorial that you see you're gonna bring it into real life where it gets internalized and it truly becomes yours where you deeply understand it and nobody can take that away from you now show up when you're an interview it'll come through when people understand ask you those deep questions you'll be able to answer them your github will have giant sexy projects on it which will make you stand out and more than anything you skill level will be improved and last point I want to add to that is work on longer project instead of short many projects like 10 20 30 work on one or two projects that you end up working on for days weeks months maybe even years okay that's gonna be a really good place to be at commandment number three learn negotiation skills and learn soft skills everybody wants to learn how to code everybody wants to become better at coding which is really good but what do you do it for ultimately yes you do it for the satisfaction of problem solving yes you do it for taking something out of your head and turning it into reality but ultimately you are doing it to get paid ultimately you are doing it to survive ultimately you're also doing it so you can actually thrive and take care of not just yourself but hopefully other people around you your family so you have many reasons while you're doing this money being one of the most important yet we never take lessons on learning how to do negotiations and we never take the time to understand how pricing works how to increase our pricing how to increase our hourly rates how to negotiate a higher salary how long does it take should you do counter offers or not what the are even counteroffers and it's a pretty sad thing to think about that people aren't thinking about this because you're putting 40 hours a week you're doing a fulltime job and you are most of the times being underpaid and overworked and it's not fair to you it's not fair to your family it's not fair to anybody around you I'll give you a little example let's say you're doing a job and you're making $10 an hour okay the results that you're gonna get out of that in 10 years versus if you were getting paid $20 an hour at the same job okay the results that would take you 10 years to get you can get them in five years over the long term you're essentially doubling that output of your life okay so that's why I mentioned this as very important it'll change the trajectory of your life and that same promote like if you get a job at let's say 50,000 dollars a year as a developer I don't care you know wherever whatever stayed in America or wherever else and you just try to get promoted through your skill from $50,000 a year to like 60 or 70 it's gonna take you five years to do that whereas if you learn how to negotiate and you become better and you understand where you can offer value where these people need it you can actually go from fifty to seventy thousand dollars a year actually a lot quicker and probably even in that first interview where you're about to lock it down okay but you have to deal with the pressure most people are too scared they can't handle the pressure the first job that they get they want to jump on and get into it they feel awkward to feel sleazy and slimy but honestly if you get hired as a developer other people the people who hire you are making literally like twenty thirty times the money that you're making them so don't be stupid please you know do what's fair because fair right on the other side they will say you know we want to give you fair pricing but most of the times they're gonna give you something a lot lower than what you could really be bringing them right so you want to make sure you have that margin in mind and then that you negotiate accordingly point number four learn valuebased pricing valuebased pricing is an amazing skill set there are many parts to it okay so for example you could build a website for someone that has $0 so they will handle you a lot okay they will come for revisions that will keep calling you they will ask you for all kinds of fixes they will not respect your time nor will they respect you and maybe pay you $300 for a twoweek long project or you can work with someone who's making a hundred thousand dollars a month from their website you can build him or her a new feature that you get them more customers and then you can charge them ten thousand dollars for a weekend long project okay so what does that mean for example if you work with somebody let's say upandcoming hair salon they have zero reviews on Yelp they don't make any money they're broke if you try to help them which my friend Tenzin and I did all right many local clients like that when we try to do that they would just haggle us and literally we would spend south of you know probably 30 40 hours working on a project for them and then when we delivered it to them they didn't even pay us $200 it was very depressing but it taught us a very important lesson it wasn't depressing depressing because we just know you have to take else before you can take w's right that was that was not a good feeling but what we learned from it was don't go to people who don't have the money okay because the value up I want to provide to them is gonna be a lot for them but I want to find people where I can get them a huge win and they can also pay me a fat paycheck right so it's a win on both sides so for example if you go to somebody who is killing it in their business but they could use your help and maybe they need your help to integrate a new Jenga feature in their app a Django is a Python web framework so you're using Python there maybe they need a web scraping thing that could ultimately bring them a lot of money or simply put they just need a better website which will then get them a lot more customers so if they're already making like a hundred thousand dollars a month with some of your tweaks if they go up by ten thousand dollars more a month what that really means is that over the course of the year you're making them extra one hundred twenty thousand dollars a year with the service that you provided so if that's the value you're bringing them you could have it in the proposal like look potentially the value I'm bringing you is gonna bring you 120 thousand dollars extra every year that's huge with that said I can get this done it's gonna be awesome but I'm gonna charge you fifteen thousand dollars for it and for that same thing that took us 30 40 hours we could have done this person's project for 30 or 40 hours and we would have walked away with a ten thousand dollar check versus a two hundred dollar check point number five this is the controversial one College one of the reasons why I mentioned quit college is most of the times they're gonna accumulate $60,000 I don't know 20,000 dollars of that 40,000 maybe $60,000 a debt with little practical or business skills depending on what it is that you do if you want to be a doctor you have to get a degree very important okay another reason I say this is most of the times when people accumulate debt it takes them five to ten years to actually pay it off it takes them a really long time now that's not very smart it's not very good so what I recommend is if you truly find a way where it's practical for you then yes use college okay I went to college for a long time and it was really valuable for me because it gave me lots of resources but I never taught treated like it was the only resource I used college as it was one of the many resources I never stopped learning on my own so the problem that happens with most people is when they go quit college you mean stop educating yourself what's wrong with you that's not what I mean what I mean is you never stop educating yourself you're always educating yourself it's just more specific to what you're doing instead of that somebody forcing you to go to a chemistry class or somebody forcing you to learn electronic call engineering when really you want to be learning Python data science web development machine learning data mining web scraping or another language like JavaScript doesn't matter what it is that you're trying to do most of the times it's hard to learn those specific things so I personally would rather look online find classes and courses on my own I leverage Udacity Coursera EDX team treehouse code Academy when I was learning all this stuff I used every tool on the planet and made sure that they were vetted and that they were the best because college is the biggest scam on this planet right like for example you know you are watching this video you already know English yet somebody who somebody will they have this degree called the English degree right people can get a degree in the language that you already know here's a piece of paper saying you know this language and I'm gonna charge you $60,000 for it okay it literally doesn't make sense some other things that I think are kind of up with it is how come teachers don't have ratings or reviews and how come a teacher can be terrible but still be teaching that class and still have tenure so there are a lot of like medieval things about colleges and the classical educational system which I do not understand but the reason why I want you to be careful with this advice is take it with a grain of salt most people will make a mistake of dropping out of college without having anything proven to themselves so for example for in my personal life when I dropped out of college it was only after I already had clients with Python I was already making more money hourly than my teacher was and he was asking me for career advice students in the class were taking my free course that I'd put on YouTube to become a better developer I had freelancers who were working for me and we were doing projects together so I already was making close to a sixfigure income while I was in college while I was building this YouTube channel so I had lots of backup plans and then I quit college to go all in to the clever programmer business and as well as go harder on the freelancing business on the coaching that I was doing for coding so what I want you to take away from this is don't just go home be like yo guys I'm dropping out think about it and have a plan and then go allin and if you're not in college just take this advice and apply it to your life maybe you're driving uber right now maybe you are working as a nurse right now maybe you are doing something else and thinking of transitioning into programming so realize how it applies to you realize what needs to be done as long as you have a plan in place and you've proven to yourself you're starting to earn an income from coding then you can actually go allin so that's very important point number six I'm gonna change it on the fly on my Instagram post it says stop being a little which I do agree with it's a really important point you should look at the Instagram posts I'll hopefully link it in this YouTube video the reason why I say that as most people are just afraid of rejections they're afraid to apply it to as many places as possible because they're gonna get rejected they're afraid of applying for freelancing opportunities because they're afraid they're gonna get rejected so they just keep preparing and preparing they'll get a degree then they'll get a master's degree then they'll get a ph.d degree and they have never really applied or have gotten jobs or have started earning an income and it's purely coming from a place of fear that they can get rejected which is just an illusion cuz you didn't have that job in the first place so you can't really get rejected right so it's just that point but point number six what I actually want to make it in this video is it's so freakin important to make your first one thousand dollars from programming if there's one thing you can focus all your energy on doing is start earning an income from it doesn't matter what you do doesn't matter how you do it but until you start earning an income from it you will not be able to commit to it like all in you'll not be able to go 100% you won't be able to improve it the speed that you're supposed to improve that you will not get the results you want and sometimes you can get discouraged and quit programming altogether but if you're getting paid to do it not only are you having fun and it's awesome but you're gonna be just learning so much faster because that's what you're being paid to do alright that's when I made my biggest revelations and now you're taking code a lot more seriously and your projects a lot more seriously there aren't just baby projects anymore know number seven what I'm gonna say is give value okay so what does that mean stop thinking about yourself look for problems in the world and they don't have to be unique problems just problems but you need to go out there and solve them okay so if you are looking to apply on up work and you see bunch of Python project so you can solve look for the problems that need to be solved maybe a lot of people are needing help with web testing selenium they're looking for help in somebody who can do web scraping for them maybe they need to make this little bot that can web scrape Craigslist and pull out stuff and then show it to you whatever it may be actually look for the problems look for what people want solve because that's what people will pay you for right people will pay you to solve their problems so look them up understand them at a deeper level and once you discover certain problems then you can actually go and learn them so for example instead of just learning about something totally random wouldn't it be cool if you kept finding online on platforms like up work people always kept saying they needed help in web scraping so you keep going man I see web scraping a lot I see lots of jobs for it I look to see lots of job postings for it let me start learning it and then you learn web scraping and you learned it enough in a month where you start applying to these jobs and the same people that weren't hiring you are now hiring you and you're doing this project for them and who cares if they're paying you $50 $100 if this is one of your first projects this is amazing you know this is a concept of not every dollar is equal so you could make $50 using uber or you can make $50 from coding but which is more in line with your ultimate goal okay so that's what I mean by give value find problems and you'll be able to find exactly where you can give value and then you can learn that thing and that's gonna be your most practical way of learning and earning at the same time okay so those were my seven commandments those were pop up I thought Commandments I hope that they were valuable for you and let me know in the comments below which one was your favorite one I had a lot of fun making this video it's actually 3 a.m. I'm dead tired so that's why you feel my energy be a little bit different but I wanted to make this video for you and I hope you enjoyed it with that said I do want to let you know that I have a new program called earn 1k with Python and that program is coming out if it's not out already it's going to be in the description below and the whole point of that program is to get you to earn your first $1,000 from coding and from Python because I realized that's the ultimate secret to improving because if you start earning an income you will take it more seriously you will become better faster than ever and it's like almost your nervous system now starts taking it seriously okay and it's fun so with that set I hope you go to that link put in your email alright so just do that now and as soon as this course is open I will let you know as well as I will send you a threepart epic master class that's absolutely free it's gonna blow your mind it's filled with value and yep that's it so thank you so much for watching this video as always I love your face and I'll see you in the next video
