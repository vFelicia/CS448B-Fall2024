hey guys how's it going so this is my first ever live session Oh we'll kind of see how it goes I am at chest state championships hi hi Colin how are you doing hi yeah your first your first hi hello how are you guys doing hi Maude this is the first session ever oh wow give soit people hey how's it going JP Gaming evig I'm trying to read your guys's names so I am here for a Chess Championship for State I'm bringing my high school chess team I am their coach and so I'm helping them out here and it's kind of we're just having a good time really so I just decided to go on live chat it's my first time ever and I wanted to just talk with you guys for a little bit before we decide to actually you know I'm skipping dinner for this so they went ahead to eat at Olive Garden and I decided to kind of stay back and I'm like you guys go ahead I think I'm gonna stay here and just have a chat with you beautiful people so that's what I'm here to do um just to tell you guys a little bit about what's kind of going on it's a high school championship the high school is now North High Evek awesome obviously they're doing great thank you harsh kamar says nice Thank You Ches Phillip yes Carter hi Carter lamps up so we are going to be playing in the state championship and today is like the rest day today we just got here we got our hotels this is my room and one of my friends is probably going to be coming here and what I did is I decided to bring some PI H ap gaming I decided bring some equipment with me so maybe you know I wanted to do something recording or shooting so you can see that I brought brought some stuff you know like a little bit tripod or whatever and right now I'm actually just recording with my phone so it's kind of crazy YouTube came up with this new feature where you can actually just go live with your phone so that's effectively what I am doing but I am working on some I have a few videos for you guys already that I I put together but didn't get time to push them out to you guys so I'm sorry about that I apologize other than that I am recording a little bit of playing chest live so playing really fast games where I have like 30 seconds or 10 seconds and then who I'm playing with they'll have like 2 minutes or 5 minutes and then I've kind of recorded it so everybody who's following me a snapchat got to see a lot of that so I would say if you have snapchat add me it's Roffe a 1 RAF eh 1 and yeah you kind of get a peek at what's going on behind the scenes and if you have any questions you know I usually will personally reply back to you or even if you're following along with the story that's going on I will usually answer lots of questions if you guys have any questions right now about coding or programming go ahead and start typing them in or if you guys have questions general questions RAF eh one so maybe I can write it here no um can i right here with you guys no unfortunately it looks like I can't write so it's are a fh1 so yeah add me there but anyways if you have any general questions about life if you have questions about which college you should go to or what can you do with program or what programming language you should start off with or is it too late for you to start programming you know any kind of questions you have I would be happy more than happy to answer them for you and you know in the longer run we will be doing live coding sessions to where we'll actually build something together this was just kind of for fun I thought that I didn't get a chance to see you guys today so I decided to kind of just do this so if you guys have questions start putting them in little thing in the little box oh and I did a live webinar with all the students wretchedly enrolled in the learn Python course well okay one second they said that I should install mantra pack one what program in or should I have start okay harsh Kumar I'm gonna ask you a question so that's a great question he says what programming language should I start with now I have a video that answers that it's called what programming language that I learned first and if you look it up it ranks first so haha engineer truth no I'm just kidding I love you engineer truth okay I'll kind of answer that question right here as well you want to start with something simple okay if it's in real life if it's an ink you know you're trying to pick up a language you don't want to start off with a really complicated language even if you're trying to speak to another human being imagine if you're trying to teach a language to somebody who's never spoken before you'll try to teach them some kind of easy language something that's not super difficult so I would I would ask you to reframe your way of thinking and and do that with basically think about that about programming like that okay so you should pick the programming language which is a way to talk to a computer exactly the way you would about go and go about that in a human language so pick something simple I mean some of the simplest stuff you can start off with a scratch actually which is built by MIT which is built to visually use blocks of code and many things happen now that's a really good place to start off with but the reason why I don't personally recommend that as a first language to start off with is because while it's good to build your fundamentals that gives you strong fundamentals you can't really develop real apps and real things with it so I recommend a language that's fairly easy but also very powerful which is Python so you know like I always say like Instagram is built off of it and then one alt likes majority of Google is actually written in Python so it's a very powerful language but it's also very simple its syntax is very simple you don't have to worry about all this squiggly and all that stuff and then when you're using libraries which is like stealing code it's super easy and by stealing me the code I mean actually ethically stealing code I you know using somebody's libraries or opensource framework and then building on top of that it's as easy as just saying import blah blah blah and then that's it you're done which in for example if you're working with C you might have to get to the binary level and go to C make and really install everything from scratch you know for those of you guys who were doing video like recognition you know data analytics or whatever some some intensive stuff in computer science and programming try to make OpenCV work would see its hell it's a lot of work but now try to make it work with Python and if you get the anaconda manager I mean it's like at one line and it just installs everything for you so you know if somebody doesn't know any language for me to go in a lot of depth wouldn't really make that much sense for you but I will just say that it's a very easy language to start off with and it's the benefits of how easy it is really keep showing as you progress to more advanced stuff in Python you'll start to see how you can do really big things really quickly so even with a few lines of code you can actually do video detection and image recognition and thing like that and in our course with the kind of things that we're working on is essentially building GUI applications which is called graphical user interface so instead of just writing code that runs in your command line or terminal I mean that's really cool because you know we're all nerds that's awesome for us we run it and we don't care it's awesome but if you're trying to show your girlfriend if you're trying to show your boyfriend or whoever right your friends they're gonna be like yeah you know it's they're not gonna get it if they have to use a command line to run your code they're gonna be like what the heck is this so if you build a graphical user interface were there clicking buttons and graphical things are showing up and blah blah on the back Python code is running but they don't really they don't need to know that they just work on the graphical part of it then it's fun for them and they want to use your app and they also want to you know then learn how they can code themselves as well so that's the things that we're focusing on in our Python courses like really building apps and those of you guys who are either new or have been watching my channel but haven't really or don't really know that I make coding tutorials because I do a lot of life advice type of stuff but yeah there's a ton of tutorials or son of content you can start off with Python I think it's a great language for you to actually start off with but let's say that your goal is completely different and you want to do something like web development and just completely frontend stuff then JavaScript and HTML those are good language to start off with but what I would say is you can still combine that with Python so on the back end like all the heavy lifting you can use Python with and on the front end to make things look beautiful you could use JavaScript HTML things of that nature okay awesome good questions is there anybody else who has a question I'll jump on it right now and answer it for you if you have a question and drop it right in there I'm gonna wait for you I am waiting for you cool let's see the room it's alright it's alright okay no questions you guys suck you guys don't got any questions so you know I'm just gonna go ahead and talk a little bit feel free to watch you know soft skills the reason why I talk about them so much and I emphasize them so much is because let's be honest they are the things that will get you to work with other people that will get other people to like you and work with you because as humans were very emotional creatures so people who want to like for example right you can train somebody how to make a sandwich but you can't train them how to be happy right so if you have a really unhappy employee I mean and then know how to make a sandwich like big deal you can hire somebody else who's happy who doesn't know how to make a sandwich and then you can teach them how to make a sandwich but you can't teach that unhappy person to be happy right so door certain traits can't be taught technical skills you can pick up a book or whatever and you can actually just learn them but with what soft skills that's something that that you know a lot of them take a long time to develop or they can't be taught so really focus on your negotiation skills your soft skills they're very important like the effect that they have on your salary with just a quantitative part and then you know forget about the qualitative part right the relationships that you build your coworkers because you're gonna spend a lot of time in the job that you're at so you want those people to be happy and you also want yourself to have a good time you don't want to just go to work 900 to 500 hate your job come back home tired not be able to give time high quality time to your friends and family and just be frankly a crappy person so that's why it's really important to work on your soft skills and you know for those of you guys who don't know what I mean when I says soft skills is people's skills human skills because ultimately no matter what you're doing even if you're writing code in front of us green the whole day you're working with humans you know almost all of the time even the code that you're told to write is actually some human coming up to you and saying hey I just talked to the manager and he says we need to optimize the button because it's leading to less conversions because people come to this website and then it's like kind of broken and it's not working so hey you software web developer whatever can you fix that and then also make sure that it looks better and it's like green so then they want to click instead of red so you want to be able to talk with them understand their problem make sure they like you and then you know you go on and work on your part about coding so I would suggest you know focus on technical skills technical skills are great but one of the biggest mistakes I made when I was starting out was I focused way to much on technical skills I'm really one minded and I have trouble multitasking so when I started going into one thing I just go crazy like for example when I started out I was doing 20hour days studying computer programming like literally 20hour days so boombox what's your question you said can you I don't know what you mean by that it just said can you with three question lines can you I can't so focus on that and then that will honestly help you not only live a better life and have people like you and you like yourself but also quantitatively help you improve your salary and be able to negotiate something better for yourself and why I talk a lot about money a lot about those things because ultimately that's what we want to do right as a software developer program we're going to land a job so we don't have to work crazy hard but then be able to earn some kind of income and also you know bonuses digitize your ideas so you are creating your ideas bring it to life creating a game or whatever so those are all the things that we're doing right and then again the reason why I'm emphasizing money is because if you do that part right you are cutting down a lot of your time you don't have to spend years how is this a chess championship you are right I am sorry this is a terrible Title I is the Chess Championship because I'm I brought the Nosler chess team I'm their chess coach so I brought them here to play chess and currently there you know I'm in my room but the tournament actually starts tomorrow so we got here today I don't know what day it is it's Thursday right there's or something and then the tournament I think goes Friday and Saturday and Sunday so it's like 3d tournament so you know it's like a pretty big deal it's a pretty serious event and stay state championship so yeah that sort of can learn coding online is that question it looks like a statement somebody just said can learn coding online so yes you can learn coding online I'm 16 hi there anyway I can get a job program I know Java okay I've tried to read it very fast so here's what I got from your question you said you're 16 sorry I'm reading other questions you said you're 16 and can you get a job and you know a little bit of Java yes yes if you're 16 you can get a job you don't need to have a certain age you don't need to have a certain degree you'd like these are all like [ __ ] limitations that we put on ourselves and put these barriers so we have an excuse to sleep at night and be better and this is something garyvee would do I've been listening garyvee a lot you know yes your to your answer yes you can certainly get a job there people who are looking for work and if you can't help them yes you can do a job there are tons of like 16 15 euro CEOs running companies so for you yeah if there's work you can find clients you can you can do a job now do you have to go the traditional route like try to apply to Google try to apply Dropbox try to apply like these big companies yeah you can but there is good money in actually getting private clients or software you know doing independent software consulting where you're either going doortodoor knocking like can I build a website for you or can I do this for you or whatever or you can go to meetups meetup groups and connect with people around you network with them and then see if there are people who want to digitize some idea and if you have the skill set and they are willing to pay you then you guys can form a partnership and then work on that okay so if you're 16 years old yes you can make money doing this also see my video for ways to make money doing computer programming you can teach somebody you don't even have to know what you have you have to know very little and you can actually go and teach people programming and no you're not stealing them out of their money you're I'm not trying to take tell you like be a con you're not faking your way out of it right as long as you're providing them value and helping them get to the next level you can charge people and they'll be happy to pay you because you're helping them and before you guys say oh but I don't have experience I'm not an expert look it doesn't you don't have to be an expert because somebody who connects with you they'll connect with you exactly because you're not so far advanced somebody who's so far in math has that ever happened to you where somebody your math teacher you ask them a question did you have no idea what the heck you were talking about or they gave you an example that made no sense but it makes sense to probably PhD professors you know why that happened cuz they're so far ahead of you you're experts through the real experts they're so far ahead of you that you can't relate and it doesn't help you with anything so you don't have to be an expert if you're one step ahead of them and you can help them get up they'll be able to better connect with you and they would want to work with you more so can you get a job doing Java you can teach Java have private lessons or you can find people in your local community but local businesses and yes you can make money as a 16 year old knowing Java that's how I would answer that question Wow we have 15 people this is super cool any questions bring them guys come on what's up yeah Aden Moop sure aahed if I'm saying it right hopefully I'm singing right I had hi what's up I don't know nothing much probably the roof huh I am you don't know here for a chess tournament but the team is not here right now right this second and why not to eat and instead of eating I stayed here so I can spend some time with you guys okay that's what I'm doing I'm like huge screw you guys I need to spend time with you guys I can't stay disciplined Solo saw me learning plan where should I learn okay I'm so overwhelmed with so many platforms where should I learn okay guys hold on let me get a pen because some of you guys are writing and on my phone it literally shows me for like three seconds and then I okay okay so first of all relax don't be able to realm because computer programming is such a fun field that is so exciting especially that you can build your ideas one thing that overwhelm comes from is if you're only doing it to do homework if you're only doing it to get a job and make money right if those are some of your only reasons you're gonna feel this constant overwhelm and this is what I emphasize in a lot of my videos like really have fun enjoy okay this is a process of building experimentation and you having fun learn a little bit of somebody who's teaching you like you didn't even follow basic tutorials on YouTube and as you're building something stop the video and then go out and then just practice it on your own if you don't play with it you won't get good at it don't just be doing things to pass an exam don't just be doing things to pass a certain course or get 100% in the course but the more time you spend playing the better you'll get was like hell I'm in class um oh man that went by really fast you're gonna have to write that one again buddy so I'm still answering your question spend time playing with it okay that's how you're going to get good at it and in that's how the feeling of overwhelm is gonna is gonna be gone regarding resources I know it's overwhelming there's too many resources in my video how to teach yourself code I talked about what resources you can use but even there you know there's tons of resources now here's what I'll well but I will say ok I will just be a bad market or if I don't promote myself here my Python courses I think are really good but feel free to look around in some other Python courses if I work well with you if with the way I talk connects with you then you should go through my courses I think they're good too tested and tried by like hundred thousand people plus at this point including on my website so that will really help you and all my courses are free except for the learn Python op1 ok and don't jump on that one just yet that's about building apps if you know a little bit of the free course like learn Python you follow it you start getting a little bit proficient then maybe you can jump in the paid one but don't go to it yet you need some experience ok I mean you can do it from zero like zero experience but I think it's better if you actually learn a little bit of like basic Python first it'll help you when you're actually building apps in the learn Python olp course so learn Python course that I have it's on my website is completely free that you can take and it has exercises that are stepbystep ok there's a full community so you can comment and ask questions and then somebody you know will jump in there and answer you it has a learning management system so it tracks like naturally spoke for your career so if you left off somewhere and you go and you know go to sleep or you got to go watch a movie with your friends you come back before sleeping you know you're just laying down on your bed you know like okay let me just watch a little bit you'll remember where you left off so you can continue from there but if you know what I'm thinking on website feel free to just take it on YouTube it's on YouTube it's called learn Python programming it starts from complete beginner zero zero knowledge ok mmm nada and then we build up and we become better and we become proficient thinkers we think we started think like computer programmers and then we learn Python as a byproduct okay then we do exercises and projects so like the final project is rockpaperscissors for example you build a whole game and it'll have a graphical user interface and then you can actually share that link that app with your friends and family so that is pretty cool I think I think that's a great resource to get started off with okay you look confident maybe I enroll a software engineer does what a software engineer does okay I look confident maybe learn roll sure you're generous guy give him your tennis okay Collins thank you thank you thank you Bryson I think you asked me about how good I am at chess I am pretty okay at chess I am very hungry I'm a modest person modest people don't say they're modest but I believe it or not I am but to give you a real perspective I am top 1% in the world I have a rating of 2,000 so that puts me as a chess expert and I think I'm pretty okay there are bajillion players that are better than me and I will get my ass handed to me when I played them so some grandmasters or even one of my friends I think I might record playing with him his name is Eric Rosen he's like 2,400 2,500 and he's so good so yeah I mean chess is very it gets very involved you know it's a very deep game so yeah lately I haven't been keeping up with it you know I haven't been studying it or going to tournaments but yeah I have played in international tournaments and in local tournaments and things like that so it's a lot of fun it's a great game to exerciser to brain and kind of stay sharp so you know like I do a lot of things I did it's ooh I do lifting I do programming I do soccer I do chest ton of things but does a few things that I love doing a lot you know that would be chess which is I'm doing less of it now and then programming which I'm doing a lot of now and then now videos I love making videos and I think one of my favorite things to do is actually get to talk to you guys like it's so weird I'm sitting here alone okay but I feel that I have all that in the world because I don't know I just feel like you're right there with me I don't know if that makes sense but well that's just how I feel so more questions you know I'll try to answer them I'm sorry those questions go by so fast it's really hard for me to read sometimes but if you guys have any more questions go ahead ask them and I will try my best to answer them for you I also don't know how long the lag is I wish there was a way for me to find out how many times do you guys think I should do this in a week once twice zero times okay so guys I am getting bad connection and I think that I have got to go okay I think I have got to go I mean it just says bad connection so I think I'm gonna go because I don't want you guys to have a crappy session like and not enjoy it because it's slow so I'm gonna let you guys go thank you guys for coming I love you guys so much I'm serious like I love you guys so much thank you thank you thank you for coming watching and enjoying and asking questions participating and as always I will see you beautiful people in the next video that was bad yeah one two stop streaming okay when I say stop streaming
