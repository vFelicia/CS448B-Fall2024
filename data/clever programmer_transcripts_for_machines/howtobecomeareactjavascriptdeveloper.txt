whoa what is up guys how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com welcome welcome to the webinar uh welcome to how to become a react javascript developer so excited to have you guys here how are you guys doing what is up vijay dixon says bam vladimir we got ricky he says wow hey all right guys if you guys are here just let me know where you guys are coming in from drop it in the comments below we're gonna be getting sunny live on in just a little bit i hope that the audio works just like expected because it would really suck if it doesn't so let's do this yo frank what is up brother hey miriam guys if you're watching this on you should be watching this on crowdcast if you're watching this on youtube just know that you won't be able to like actually engage with us because we're going to be bringing you guys on live as well and today is going to be just about you know the same more is caught than taught meaning you pick up more by seeing people's behaviors and just being around them than you do by people talking at you so we have usually a lot of trainings and a lot of things like that today is going to be more like you're going to learn from people's personal stories how they became a developer how they started landing clients or landing jobs how to start making an income and i think you're going to pick up a lot more just by hearing those stories and our goal is that hopefully they're inspiring to you hopefully they move you and hopefully they inspire you to become a better developer and show you how you can do it too and how you can land those jobs or clients or make an income with coding things like that does that make sense guys all right with that said i'm gonna go ahead and um invite our boy sunny so let's see i really hope the audio works out okay because that would not be fun if it doesn't hello yo what's going on guys yo what's up sunny how's it going guys damn hold on i cannot hear you let me try again hello hello yeah i can hear you we're good okay all right give us a second guys i still don't think i can hear sunny everyone says audio is good papa react hey what's going on guys yo what's up oh yeah i mean i don't think it's muted it's just nelson what's up it's um good to see you again frank no hold on hold on that's fine it's just just when i put this on there's echo so i don't want that yeah this allows me to hear him but then there's echo so i would rather not i would rather hear him without the echo i know all of you guys can hear him clearly and you guys could hear me clearly as well which i think is fantastic the only problem is when i'm listening to it i'm hearing an echo if i turn sunny no no no i i don't think you're understanding me nas it's my audio that's making me here i know people don't hear it oh [ __ ] yeah i can hear the double okay so maybe if you guys have uh frankie can i get your airpods and maybe that allows me to listen to sunny really weird errors that we get into sometimes guys but that's okay it's part of it's part of our process as part of the debugging that we always have to do exactly i think we go pretty good now i want to connect them to your computer are they connected to your computer with you on ecam okay perfect that would be perfect i've got a new one peppa remix okay getting clear voice guys let me know if you can hear my voice as clear as kazi's or i will adjust the volume on my side so let us know guys where's nes echo yeah we should be able to see we got pinky ms what's up we've got dick dick chancing says react god love you bro thank you very much dude we have frank because i prayed to the demo gods nice give us a sonny beatboxing when did you catch movie boxing all right anish we can hear you both thank you priyanju so raft says yes honey okay awesome nice nice now i can hear you sunny nice oh [ __ ] have you got them inside your headphone yup oh nice let's go dude yes perfect all right guys so let's get this started and what we're also going to do is we are going to be learning through other people's stories as well and seeing what they have achieved and what they have accomplished and i think that's gonna give you guys a lot of context around it exactly all right so if we want to start bringing people on nas frankie if you guys can just go ahead and start inviting people i think that would be the best way to go about it yeah let's do that dude and guys let me actually toggle this good hack on the audio and uh one sec i'm trying to share my screen but i don't think i'm able to are you able to share your screen sunny uh right now oh snap oh [ __ ] nice what's up frank hey i can click it yeah dude if you click on your name it says share screen for me i can share screen if needed okay maybe you can share screen and talk on the webinar let's do it dude so some of the slides yeah let's do it so is it not letting you share the screen because they're not pop it's the share screen is not popping up for me that's what i was saying okay um let's go ahead and oops oh my video's going off okay yeah nice um okay guys let me show you my screen right now sure so i think they can see it now whoa got some echo yeah okay i know i killed it so guys let's go ahead and a lot of you know us this is the clever programming team let me go ahead and drop the side so they can see it right now nice so this is the this is the team this is just some other team guys right like we have a huge amount of people who make the magic behind everything happen so this is just some of the members of the team but give it up for everyone that you know so go ahead and drop it in the comments um and yeah guys a lot of work goes into bringing you guys this value and this knowledge so um yeah let us know if you guys appreciate and love that stuff hey dude i hate how the slides are on google slides oh you can't just hit right on your keyboard yeah i mean i might literally just keep it like i could do it like you command command enter and then you can just hit right okay so there you go or just click it so i think we're still doing this today right quasi we're going to be doing it yes yep so just let everyone know how many people is it that is going to be a part of this opportunity to get that free coaching call so there's actually a free coaching call that means you're going to be holding and if you actually jump in in this webinar during this webinar session if you're one of the first are we doing 50 or 100 was it how many people did we do yeah just the people who can actually join inside of this webinar it's going to be for them yeah so anyone who joins inside of this webinar guys you're gonna actually go ahead and get a free coaching call with me and quasi so that's gonna be super super valuable it's gonna be a chance for you guys to go ahead and speak to us and you're gonna get some uh a lot of value out of that so something to bear in mind before we get kickstarted off so stick to the end if you want to go ahead and see how you can do that and if you guys didn't already know today is the day that we have the final pricing for the course so something to bear in mind um let me go ahead and check it out today guys is the day where profit with javascript price increases permanently and it never comes back down so we want to take a lot of your questions we want to share stories with you of the people and we just want to give you kind of everything you need to be able to know to be able to make a decision for yourself exactly guys so this is going to be a jampacked sort of training we're going to be bringing on loads of people so that because we find the best way of actually showing you a bunch of stuff rather than showing you a bunch of slides just speak to real people who get real results and you guys can pretty much learn from that so uh yeah something to know um we're also going to do a bunch of q a during the session so there's going to be a bunch of opportunity for you guys to go ahead and ask questions you can either do it a few ways you can ask a question in the ask a question button so there's actually a button you can click and and these get upvoted and sort of ranked and that's a really good way of asking a question because it goes ahead and shows us what people want to ask or you can go ahead and just pop it in a comment just remember the comment section is going quite crazy right now so it's kind of hard to keep track of that um okay nice now guys time to focus turn on your phones and do not disturb and let's go ahead and jump into today's training so let me go ahead and actually go through this um can we can we actually is it not working yet or is it still the screenshot isn't working right yeah so my screen share isn't working but we have some people on right now okay so we have some people and this is the cool part guys if you have by the way if you have joined profit with javascript just let us know in the comments section and we want to start bringing people on from the community from the program to be able to just share their stories and their experience so we have melissa actually on nice hi melissa hey how are you good thank you how's it going pretty good awesome and what have you been up to lately um causing trouble that's what i do best nice and what was it that brought you to the community what was it that brought you to pwj let us know let everyone know um i lost my job because of covid um and i decided to try programming and i signed up for a college class and i sucked at it so i went to youtube and found quasi and uh he helped me actually pass that college class um but then i found out he has like y'all created your own program so i joined like right away like i think i watched that youtube for 20 minutes and then i was like wait i need to just join i'm like i bet i could learn better if i just joined this class so i didn't even finish that youtube yeah awesome nice and how do you how have you find your experience because because somebody who's new to pwj yeah i think everybody will be excited to find out i'm totally new to programming and i will say it has helped a ton because getting into the community of people who actually know what they're doing um has really helped in fact we've started a mini group out like of people i just met in pwj and we're working on y'all's projects that we found on youtube like the spotify the netflix like because i couldn't keep ups because i'm way new like i can barely even type um so like just like getting that group of friends and just having a group of friends who know like a little more than me some actually know less and we just kind of help each other out it's amazing and then just getting on all y'all's coaching calls has like made me go from like knowing nothing to i know some now i'm getting there that's it like that's what we aim for is to build that sort of confidence and like she said guys we have communities inside of the community which is insane like i love that i really love that and um how do you find that's helped you out and helped you build your confidence like i'm one of those people that gets frustrated really really really easily but just having like 100 friends or be like girl you can do this come on like i'll jump on zoom i'll show you how to do it like it's just made me not get especially i'm just like hey let's solve this problem so that's awesome nice cause yeah i think you're mike's muted yeah i can't hear him at all yeah we can't hear you oh how about now now you're good there we go damn okay i was like damn i can hear myself but i had muted myself in there that is so amazing that somebody from the community will actually jump on a call with you i think that's one of those things that makes all the difference in the world there are programs that i am in and where i'm trying to learn like more about business and how to grow business and how to help people and even they will never actually get on calls with you or the peers and if a peer can get on a call with me i feel like that just takes everything that i'm doing to the next level so that's really cool i would suggest if you are gonna join us also download zoom because that screen sharing button is amazing right now exactly zoom skills yeah and screen brush is another good one we use uh which which might be handy for you to use oh yeah that's awesome you just roll over the screen oh yes green brush is really cool so melissa before we move on because we have more people lined up if somebody is on the fence would you recommend this course to other people now that you've had especially some chance to go through it oh my gosh yes anybody and everybody this class makes it so much easier even if you want to take like a different class because your friends are doing it join this one too because then you have friends to help you with that one nice because i'm the one that like joined like five different programs like don't do that but yeah nice but like yeah like just having the community and then being able to go through like the modules at your own course like you might hear like you need to hurry through them no like actually go through them and learn them that has actually helped me so much just being able to learn it at my own pace and not have a professor be like you got to learn it right now and i'm like you know and then like like i don't know like uh like having all the community rooms like if i'm stuck on this i can go to this room and be like hey and all these people know about it like that has helped tremendously like just knowing which group to talk to yeah we actually introduced module rooms so you've got module one two three and then them rooms are pretty good a lot of students found that was really useful so yeah that's awesome nice thank you so much melissa for coming on really appreciate you thank you thank you so much man i keep hitting that x button too quickly so what i want to also do is i want to bring on some people who also maybe aren't in profit with javascript but you have some questions you want to ask i want to address your guys's question on the call so i invited two people right now ken and i think one more person at the top so somebody asks what are the classes and how are they scheduled tenzing asks so when it comes to the classes guys there this course is prerecorded with trainings which means you can take it at your own pace even if you're a complete beginner you can take it at your own pace and be fine even the live three live coaching calls that we do every single week you can take that at your own pace as well meaning like they're prerecorded they get recorded afterwards and we'll put them in the module so you can take them then at your own pace or if you can make it to the live call that's even better you'll get a better experience exactly so before we bring on atharva just one second yeah so to mention that guys we have 15 modules so there's loads of prerecorded training content and yeah we have weekly coaching course up to four weekly coaching calls at the moment and they're gonna be that's an opportunity for you to ask a bunch of questions interact with us get to know us a bit more really really hey ken how's it going my man good yo what's up ken so what's uh i know you're in the webinar do you have any questions or anything you want to address while you're here on the call with us and nice having you on here by the way oh thank you welcome dude i'm just trying to pay for the course through the payment plan nice yeah because i haven't been paid in two weeks so i'm out of money right yep yeah so a payment plan is something that would help you out right right okay just so are you aware that we have a threemonth payment plan yes got it awesome there's also actually another option um you can use it and i've actually recommended it to a few people is if you pay with paypal people actually offer six month financing i think with paypal credit if it's available in your in your area so that's something that actually might be quite useful and zero percent so that's really useful yeah that's definitely gonna be and what was it that made you sort of uh on what was it that got you interested in profit with javascript oh yes well for years i would have been a sql developer i got that job a long time ago and i couldn't get it back right so i was like let's try something different okay i'm trying to ignore javascript for the longest because i believe it wasn't no money in it yeah until i saw you guys nice awesome dude and uh so a few things i'd like to ask what's your why and why do you think pwj is going to help you or why is it going to help you get to that why all right well right now i'm disabled okay because i lost that job because i was disabled right yeah because i couldn't go to work right and i figured that if i can work from home and like program on my own make my own money i'm not be worried about being fired from a job because i'm disabled now yeah right damn bro yeah damn it so that's a good reason to be in this program and bro we definitely got your back just most important thing is when you're in this program like are you able to put in between 10 to 40 hours a week yes i am okay the more time you can put in the better the results you're gonna get and in the shorter time frame you're gonna get them because like i've said even on the instagram yesterday i just posted this because i was like i feel like some people are starting to get this idea that it's a magic pill and it isn't it requires a tremendous amount of hard work and there's a lot of failure you have to go through but the students that succeed in the program are the ones who keep failing keep trying new things never stop get help from the community use the courses reference material build projects keep trying and then that cycle of that work build reach out work build reach up like nonstop cycle that's what creates those disproportionate results for them over time okay this sounds good i did for sticker once yeah yeah i learned oracle and the one from microsoft sql server right got you yeah because even even in those coaching calls that we pretty much exactly what cars you play that's what we like always try and instill like it's like guys like we said like it's not always like a course isn't going to be the magic pill that's going to transform your life what the course is offering is a community like a space for you to really flourish and sort of grow right and we sort of help you we provide you like with the guidelines and then we provide the content on top of that right so it's a lot more than just like material inside of a course that's why i really don't see like much benefit in like a lot of udemy courses because most of the time i would end up having a like a question i want to ask or like you know you're gonna have some kind of like some kind of thing which you're interested in but you have no idea like how to even ask the question to begin with and i guarantee if you go ahead and ask somebody on on udemy you're not going to get a reply right like this yeah it's going to be a huge while right yes so there you go man like i'm happy for you to jump in the program i'm pumped for you thank you so much for coming on ken you're welcome again appreciate you dude appreciate it all right and join the join the program uh and if you join it during this time we sonny and i definitely want to get on a coaching call with you okay okay thank you so much i really appreciate it awesome dude i'll see you in the program again um i gotta get better on my timing i swear to god yo srikar how are you doing what's up hey i can't hear you can you hear me yeah yeah we can hear you all good see if we can uh get your mic figured out but srikar was in the chat and he was like yo guys pwj is the best community that helps people with any debugging issues they have a great curriculum and has given many jobs what are you waiting for and guys when it comes to getting jobs or getting work or getting clients i just want to emphasize that you have to enjoy coding if you are doing something else and you only see it as a vehicle to your freedom and making money do don't go towards coding they're a lot easier and better ways to make money like if that's your primary goal i would say like learn business like learn how to sell your own things maybe like learn ecommerce there's tons of ways you can make an income that's a lot easier than learning coding even i watched this video i randomly came across and it was so random i typed in rafikaze on youtube because i just wanted to see like my personal brand video that i recently created right so i'm going through youtube and i see garyvee's video under rafikaze which was super weird and it says i can't code and he goes you can't sell crap and i clicked on that video and i started watching garyvee's video in one minute 40 seconds and he literally says i wanted to become a python developer but i can't oh [ __ ] nice yes i was like damn yeah because even gary vee sometimes you know he admits that he can't learn coding and it's because he doesn't probably enjoy it yeah so if you don't enjoy it don't force yourself to do it what i want you guys to go after is really find what you actually enjoy about coding is it the actual process of sitting down and coding is it the process of you writing out your ideas on a whiteboard and coming up with what you can build is it working with the team of people and coming up with what kind of app you guys can build and then breaking that apart down for me it was always the problem solving that fascinated me about coding and by the way guys the profit with javascript uh button is below so if you guys want to join you can click there and i do want to let you guys know that today is the last day of the price that it's at and then by tonight it's going to increase so that's something i want to let you guys know if you guys want to join it just click it we will see inside the program but i'm going to continue with what i was saying and for me the problem solving is something that's fascinating to me and i absolutely love which is why i really love chess too i don't know if you guys like chess but sonny do you play chess uh i mean i dabble with that i need to i i'll definitely have a game but it'll be fun yeah i'll play you blindfold minecraft let's go yeah so yeah with chess it allows me to go in this flow state and think for a really long period of time and that's what makes chess fun for me and for a lot of people maybe even for you sonny coding is fun because it lets you hit when you're two hours in or three hours in and you're in that flow state yeah right dude that flow state is something else and that's something which i like even if i would say this is my advice right even if you don't enjoy coding like always give something a try with 110 right like you can't say you you don't like something if you give it 90 i just don't feel like you've fully gone into it right and coding is one of those things you're gonna kind of hit a wall at some point like it's guaranteed you're gonna hit a wall and i would say i'd recommend at least give that wall a fair amount of time before you kind of say okay this isn't for me and like what i would say is when you get into that flow state guys that's really when you're going to really start all right yeah you guys hear dj khaled going another one did you oh no no no i didn't is that what you've got in your text message yeah every time we get a student to enroll in pwj i have dj khaled going another word like let's go the family grows baby i'm gonna i'm gonna do the same thing that's good yeah classic lip yeah just joined welcome to the program john exactly awesome dude and and remember like another reminder guys that this is today is the last time you will get the price that you see uh from this bun after today it goes up and we didn't lie last time and we're not lying today it's going to go up yeah so let's bring on other people so atharva what is going on my man talk to us about what got you into coding and what got you into profit with javascript and welcome welcome dude we spoke together nice yeah we spoke yeah so what brought me into coding like i was 10 years old and my brother used to learn c plus plus and i was like hey i want to do the same and i would never get his books so one day i just stole his book and just started reading and it was so interesting like according to me i just read the entire book in just two days and it was so yeah and i just started to do some other coding languages like visual basic like i didn't know that it was like outdated thing i was just into coding so i just started doing that and it was fun and like you actually make something and like you have an idea and you make it happen that's that's so important and that's so good about programming that you can make things happen and i just move on and i'm now 19 and i know javascript i know php and that's so good but but the real thing is i was never surrounded by developers and a community like this so i decided that i would just go into profit of javascript and guys i was the one who wasn't fans in the previous webinar so i didn't have the chance because my dad was sleeping and i wanted to take this for sure so i thought like okay so we have to pay hundred dollars more but then when i woke up i saw the price didn't change and i was like oh no i'm just taking this now you woke up the same day for us it was the same day you're losing yeah i thought well dude like i'm so glad that you took that jump and like from from i think it's really cool because a lot of people are in your position that you're in a week ago right now so what would you what would be your advice to them if they're sitting on the fence and they're not sure about joining or not joining right if you are on the fence you should know that you will never get any community like this if you go on stack overflow you post a question then people will answer this but nobody will give you an answer they will it will all be are you dumb don't you know how to do things it's like no dude that that doesn't mean how the things work they would even say that this is already answered go to this page no that's not how things work in the community in the slack community um there are people who get doubts every day and there are beginners one is duplicate even yeah yeah in the slack community even if people don't know the answer they are very happy to help because in the process they also learn something and that's very important like if you try to answer something and you you are into that problem and then you know how to solve it at the end of the day you look at the threads you know how to solve it and that's what we have for like the modules are also good but the community best part you can ever have and the coaching calls is also the good part of it because in coaching calls you get a huge value bombs and you can ask any question anytime like no one is there to stop you you just raise your hand in zoom call and you get your question answered that's awesome people like that you actually saw the coaching call this week right you jumped in both i think right you were in both coaching yeah i jumped into both coaching calls and i uh in one of the coaching calls i even made a video and shared with the oh yeah yeah yeah dude thank you so much for coming on i know we jumped on ig live yesterday too so i'm pumped thank you yeah i'll see you again on ig live dude thank you so much for joining all right brother take care take care bro um i'm really curious to hear some of the people's uh stories as well i can't share my screen but maybe sunny you can also share screen and show the actual page cleverprogrammer.com pwj let's do it dude so i'm gonna go ahead and show my screen right now for you guys boom there we go so you guys should be able to see the screen no yep now we can see it so you guys can see the link at the bottom of you want to clear your screen brush uh can you see oh yeah oh god damn it yeah there you go um right so right 500 now yeah so right now guys we pretty much uh like you can see we have 12 hours left right so pretty much and to be honest i think maybe at the end of this uh we usually actually ended this webinar might be jumping that price up so um if you go ahead and join the benefit is right if you join the course right now in this webinar me you're going to get a coaching call with me and kazi which we don't offer to everyone right that's going to be an exclusive thing for you guys inside this webinar right now and something i want to show you guys so the the course itself consists of a bunch of stuff guys you've got 15 modules and these are going to be like it does not matter if you are a complete beginner you're going to get pretty much brought up to that standard of where you're coding you're basically creating your own projects we have weekly javascript and react coaching calls so that includes myself every tuesday we have nars i think on saturdays and then we have the the success coaches so success coaches are huge guys like they're going to provide you personal personalized video feedback on every single one of your assignments so this is something that you don't get on stack overflow or you don't get this on a udemy course you're not going to get somebody actually drop you a video saying this is awesome what you've done over here but this bit of code can be written a bit differently you're gonna get that inside the course and i don't i mean until this day i don't know anywhere i've tried to find other places i'm yet to find somewhere that actually gives you proper personalized video feedback and on top of that guys we're going to show you how to make money from it okay so to consider as an investment in yourself we're going to go ahead and teach you how to make money now you don't have to take our word on it we pretty much have like a bunch of bills that you guys have seen you guys are going to go ahead and be able to create all of these builds we actually have so many people inside the course right now like frank you're going to be up to speed can you show the amazon one by the way uh yeah dude let's do it so this one right here is nice yeah this one's still damn would you guys like to learn how to make that exactly guys if you want to know how to build this stuff including all the functionality you can see right now full ecommerce functionality then we go ahead and we're going to show you how to do all of that this guy even added the animations dude i love this build i love this uh we have a few questions too so somebody says how much time will it take to become a react gs developer the clip zone asks so it's a very good question um maybe we should wait let's come back on the screen and we can answer it um and by the way a week from now the doors close to the program so that's something i also want to let you guys know yeah exactly so a week from now our doors completely closed we do that to keep the quality of the students very high um so right now like where we have the doors open but in a week's time we're going to close that stuff and pretty much we're not going to open up again maybe for a few months maybe for a year we don't know yet we pretty much we're not sure on that but we like to keep our community very powerful very positive and to do that that's why we do it this way now the to answer your question to become a react developer my advice guys is if you can go ahead um and it's all about how much time you're willing to put in right so if let's say you join the course today and you put in two hours a week now i can't promise you in a year's time you're gonna even be a developer right like because then you're gonna need to point some serious work like when i'm talking serious work i'm like kazi said before uh to ken i think it was who jumped on like it's going to take another person jumping in lovely michael let's go we just got michael enrolled in profit with javascript awesome dude welcome to the course nice so yeah you're gonna pretty much if you're gonna like i would recommend dedicating imagine you had a day job right that's eight hours a day right consider that as your minimum i would say like if you really want to grow give it your give it some serious time like make it consider it not just like a little side hobby something like that if you want this to become your fulltime income then dedicate and treat it like a fulltime job right like give it that same amount of hours and then in my in my personal opinion i believe i honestly believe if you follow we have a nice little road map and i usually teach a way that you can actually start earning money during the three months that i would actually predict that you could become a developer very intense three months right like i wouldn't say it works for everyone three months but you can pretty much make it work in three months but you can pretty much go ahead and actually in your first month's stuff roadmap that you and i we showed last time too and it's basically like imagine if a timeline is like this right yeah you can spend three months actually learning the skills and building the projects and the next three months actually working on applying for jobs and you're applying for jobs that are probably around between 40 to sixty thousand dollar a year range exactly a complete beginner oh crap i totally forgot i'm sorry we have luke i wanna bring on some of the people here so luke uh he's like hey this is one of the newbies from the program if you wanna get our experience how are you doing yeah what up what up here's henry yeah man can you hear me awesome yeah i know uh yeah i've been trying to grow this out but i know uh pretty much i've been on the fence for quite some time i think i actually sent on two emails to you guys uh to like the supports that just to see like what i was truly getting um because you know 600 it is an investment obviously so you know some people cannot afford it or some people are just like debating and they're on the fence over the price but for me like learning all the modules um not just the twitter but like eventually zoom spotify netflix going more in depth and just what's on the youtube content and then as well as like the weekly coaching calls like those have been like amazing i haven't been able to participate in them yet um but i do the i rewatch them so every single one is like recording you can just rewatch them so that has been fantastic and then obviously the community like i've done so just i guess for everybody else is on the fence or if they're just wondering um i've done udemy courses i've done youtube tutorials um i've paid for all like other classes as well and what's different is just like the whole community like you get a udemy course and ever it's prerecorded same thing here but like the community is a lot different and you to me like you don't really get like the interaction that you guys get here every single day i log on to slack you can see like 100 missed messages everyone's just constantly like asking questions you know like everyone's always communicating over and saying something like everyone at least is answering questions or working on something um recently i found out that there's like weekly homework assignments too like somebody was working like a tip calculator and things like that and that's just something that you don't get with udemy courses you know udemy courses they do two or three projects and that's about it so that's obviously like that luke give me a little bit of like give me a little bit of your background so before this program yo rami what's going on man i'll call you up in a second so give me a little bit of your background before this right who is who is luke like what just tell us give us a little bit about you uh all right so let's see here i started out pretty much working like a restaurant and hospitality industry um i worked my way up through like a server through bartender eventually moved up into management um anyone that knows a part of the restaurant industry like you know you're working hard you're you know you have 12 14 16 hour shifts you're busting your ass you know so i don't know if i'm not allowed to swear or not but you're busting you know i swear as much as you [ __ ] want all right um but yeah you know you're hustling you're busting you know everyone knows the industry you don't get weekends off you don't get holidays off none of that you know if you got to work a 10hour shift guess what you're working a 10hour shift a 12hour shift 14hour shift so and then i uh came across a bunch of youtube videos about coding it kind of sparked my interest oddly enough i started with like python i couldn't really get it to set up properly i think i spent like a week on it gave up and then like a following a month i did like a lot more research uh seeing which path i wanted to go down ended up coming up with uh javascript so i did html css javascript and i've been selftaught for like the past five months now so pretty much looking forward to kind of make that change and uh landing some clients so i decided to jump on board nice your main motivation was to land the clients it was actually selftaught javascript five months progress and then you wanted to take it to that next level and actually income right so you actually jumped in the course that's awesome dude really really awesome yeah yeah yeah that's pretty much it um like i said like i would love to like lease land clients so that way i could become a fulltime developer you know not have to go to work but right now i have like a ninetofive job so i'm doing that and then i'm spending two three hours four hours a day uh coding also afterwards so why are you coding why what's your goal why do you need to make an income you know why couldn't you just be doing the job at the hospital you know in the hospitality and all that uh the quality of life man that just all it is uh coding allows you to i mean if you're a freelance and you get to work from everywhere you know from anywhere in the world that you want you get to set your own hours yeah you have to have your own discipline and you know determination to make that happen obviously nothing's going to be handed to you on the plate um so even if people are saying like oh yeah be cool to work from vacate like you know in florida or miami or bali or germany like wherever you want to work from like yeah but you still have to hustle like you still have to work hard you know like one way or another you have to work right yeah um but yeah no creating the quality of life setting my own hours um you know pretty much charging you know people whatever i would want to charge what i think my worth what my time you know i think it's worth to them um and that's huge and it's also it's like uh you know people in the past that like trade skills are important like manufacturing cnc cad work steel work well now as we go towards the future technology is going to be like those trade skills you know technology is everywhere i mean it's on dishwashers now you can have lcd little panels on refrigerators like it's crazy like it's going to be everywhere so like being a part of that chain is important so so i have a question for you how much time have you been able to spend in profit with javascript uh with profit with javascript i want to say maybe with like 10 20 hours not much i literally joined i think uh two or three days ago i want to say um so i haven't been able to spend too much time but uh just navigating 20 hours that you spent what's your experience been like and would you actually recommend it to somebody oh yeah no absolutely it's been it's been phenomenal like i said like the community itself has been phenomenal asking a lot of questions you get a lot of feedback um everyone is like responsive so that's been great and the amount of knowledge that you can actually get out of the single course like it's worth it like that's what pushed me over the edge i'm just saying that value and just constantly you know having that available and lifetime access like you it's a huge value say i would definitely absolutely recommend it it's like one of those like listen you also it's an investment in yourself like it is you know to some people it can be like a lot of money but it just that's an extra motivation for you all right if you're gonna pay something like that you might as well get that worth out of it you know that value out of it so that's a really good point then kazi actually said that to me as well before in in in the previous webinar like if you get something for free guys like we all treat that free thing like like [ __ ] like pretty much none of us another student let's go price is going up man if you are on the fence what are you doing jump in we have a 30 day money back guarantee too exactly what's up right now uh ronald ceballos welcome to the family uh yeah so exactly yeah if you if you get something for free your investment in that like whether it's a product or whatever it is your investment in that is very everybody who wins our challenge the first place yep they don't even show up to the calls yeah i can actually say yeah that's a really good point yeah exactly so like literally the people who actually buy the course that i can tell you because i personally see them on the calls right they literally they turn up they show up they want to invest they want to complete the modules they want to go back to the modules because they paid for those modules and then they want to do it again right and that's what is going to push you that motivation that drive all of those things so like exactly like exactly luke said like it's an investment in yourself and that investment is further than just the course it's going to push you and be your actual main mode especially in the beginning of your journey yeah thank you so much for coming on luke really appreciate it no problem no problem and thanks for having me on looking forward to the coaching call later see you later so somebody asked tyson asked he goes hey do we cover loops and variables and you know all these basic functions like do we cover basics so i guess let's have joe diaz let us know if we do cover them or not good good way of doing that dude nice what's up joe how's it going hey what's going on brother holy [ __ ] i love i love your energy bro it's amazing it's so good so what's going on so somebody asked if we cover loops and variables and arrays and like basics do we cover them or we do we not in the course no we don't we don't cover all that [ __ ] yeah you gotta pay to find out get enrolled in the i would have seen that no seriously i mean we cover all the basics this course by far you start with the basics you learn html those are the building blocks as someone was asking on the post you know hey can i study can i be a good react developer well don't get to react yet just get the html css part solidified first because that's the building blocks of react then you learn javascript and then they all combine together you know you can learn react and uh to get back to what the others are saying is you know this community is awesome and the one thing i like about this community is the i get to get involved with people getting into problems you know issues like yesterday we were debugging for nearly i guess uh four forty minute sessions with ronak kumar and we identified that uh his amazon clone after his after he would deploy it to come up with a blank page and for the life of me and leaf we couldn't figure out what's going on so it was a comment in the props that was causing the issue right so we so we went through the we went through the project we went through a fake deploy hello world we stripped everything down we deployed it it was coming up fine then we put pieces together one at a time and then as soon as he put put his checking checkout page it had the comment boom we figured it out so we then lift leaf was able to find that that was this is a known bug and it's been logged in and react so now you know you know it's like i would know that so and anyone the community runs into similar issue i have the resolution so that's what i like about this community is solving problems of people that encounter you know take time to go through the code this you guys whoever's on the fence this is not something that you can find on stack overflow or any udemy or i know udacity or whatever that's just recorded courses that uh you know you play and you learn you get what you get pretty much right thank you bro i appreciate your words and i think that's really cool what you and leaf you guys were working on it together yep last night nice nice how long were you up until last night uh maybe 1 30 2 a.m coding coding yeah i need to get i was i was working on my clone as well so i thought i'll jump on this issue and i'll you know front load if i get run into the issue i'll know what the problem is so how was the call yesterday with nas on the resume oh awesome i got an awesome feedback so i'm working on that as well very constructive feedback and you know i wanted to ask nasu if you can send me a copy of his resume so just to have it yeah um so yeah a copy of your resume so you can have it nice and there you go right there you can see the the all in all anyone who's on the fence i know you have to decide if once the door closes that's it game over exactly guys what if they just want to keep walking on the fence you know good luck you know good luck in total hell damn yeah either either if you love joe drop it in the comments and let us know we love you i think joe just go is literally like a person who's showing you guys that like it's more than just like a course it's like like joe like literally was able to pair a program with leaf yesterday and they were able to like overcome that issue in the coaching call he got a bunch of value from that with the resume and work on that stuff like it's more than just a course you know like it's a lot more than just like just a simple course and like joe joe is literally somebody who comes on every time and like his energy is literally it's radiated throughout the community and if anyone doesn't know linkedin review of a resume cost about 1500 bucks professional review dude that's actually yeah sure that's incredible yeah if if if you do if you if you do a resume review with the course i mean that's so much value ad that you get not just just the module it's just you know the community the value add that you get i didn't know said um on linkedin if you want to get a professional resume review it's 1500 bucks are you serious the [ __ ] are you doing giving it away for free bro damn joe what was that was yesterday's call helpful for you was that yes very much yes awesome love it love it bro nice oh rami is like what the [ __ ] knows all right guys um so joe thank you so much for coming on brother really really appreciate you anytime brother take care thank you dude take care all right yeah resumes are pretty important you know it's like one of those one pieces of paper that can actually like land you an actual job by somebody seeing it and yes i remember yesterday i was on the live stream too where nas was actually sharing that and as somebody asked in the comments you're like i've won so many coding competitions and i've like built so many projects and my resume my cv is five pages long and i remember commenting back and i was like no parth elon musk cv is one page exactly you gotta get it down to one page yeah exactly and the truth is that guys if you handed me a cv with five pages i wouldn't i'm i'm telling you right now i wouldn't read it like as in like as in the truth is but if you showed me a website saying that this is my portfolio and here's my apps that would impress me that would show me some stuff like then i would actually go ahead and play with it we kind of show you all that we tell you the shortcuts we tell you the actual reality because the the reality is i think i think the way that we're taught from like school and the education system is broken like it's not reality it doesn't show you reality it doesn't show you how it actually go the conversation actually happens when you when you leave university or when you go through those sort of modules because they promise you like okay you're gonna get the degree and you're to go outside and then you're going to wave this piece of paper and somebody's going to give you a job right and you're going to pretty much put all of that piece of paper in the fancy details on a piece of paper which we call our resume and that's going to go and land your job and the truth is it doesn't work like that okay like so miriam said i think two pages are more than enough i couldn't agree more i think if you get your resume two pages is more than enough any more than two pages you're overshooting like because then maybe yeah i have a link saying here's a here's my website go and check that out if you want to find out more but yeah so let's start taking on some questions as well so if you guys have questions start dropping them and we want to take them on so one of the questions is hey can i directly go with react javascript or should i learn javascript first um so what was that so either react to javascript she asked which one should i learn first can i so basically somebody's asking can i directly start learning react or do i need to learn javascript first so um my advice is yo what's up corey yeah my advice would be for that go ahead and learn the fundamentals first right it's like you're trying to ask can i build a mansion or should i build a house first like you need to know you need to pretty much go ahead and like learn the fundamentals like get know how to build the foundations and the foundations in this case are html and absolutely basics of javascript you don't have to become a javascript pro but the basics of javascript because what i thought one of my mentors i remember in 2017 no not 2017 2016 when i was picking up a lot of the coding skills he's like don't even think about react until you spend three or four more years learning coding and reading clean code and reading all these like books on algorithms and data structures no i see like i would like scream at that and say go the other way like i would say spend like i would think boxing why would you [ __ ] yeah i know like you just like throw that over like like honestly guys like literally the basics like once you know the basics once you can get pretty much a web page and a button click fun functional why wait jump into react because react is a library that you're using with javascript right so when you're using react naturally your javascript is going to improve right it's going to get better it's going to improve so why the hell are you going to waste your time doing the things separately when your javascript can improve either way when you're doing react oops sonny i just got a great idea yo frank thanks for the 5 donation bro let's go thank you oh nice yeah so i just got actually a really epic idea sunny and i think let me know what you think but i one thing i want to actually try is maybe on a weekend we just do a crowd casting like this so it's easy to bring people on the live with us yep and maybe we just have them apply and build profiles so for example you literally help them build a profile on hired.com oh yeah that'd be dope see what i'm saying yeah and also we help them with like you know some of them maybe i can help them with writing their posts to get freelancing jobs dude that would be insane i think that would be super valuable and i think that would actually help people even um if whoever's got experience in like up work can go ahead and teach how to use up work and set up an upward profile those sort of things or take lessons.com or yzan uh if they're based in united us you know like any of those platforms we can pretty much go ahead and set them up live on a call i think that would be awesome yeah seriously yeah um that would be awesome dude let's go ahead and what's that she got you some nice water yeah she stole my water and i messaged the thing bring back my wall everybody's replying to paul in the comments because paul like was writing these long comments about like what we're doing is wrong trying to get people in profit with javascript and he's like they're just trying to sell their course and going crazy and so i see a bunch of people replying to him and i like vlad's comment and he goes actually they're trying to shorten the time you would have to invest to learn javascript yeah i was buying udemy courses and skills skillshare subscriptions but nothing compares with pwj here we have a community and being a part of this community keeps me motivated all the time we got live calls who else does live calls for the students every week he goes like qazi said it is the best javascript course on the planet exactly dude i don't i don't know if it's my mic actually my your mic what's up what's with your mic oh no we're good we're good yeah we cut out for a little bit um yeah dude i think that's an awesome comment hey another student let's go hey i need to i do i need to add that oh man then nas came to run over to like he's like where's the song playing he came he thought somebody spotify was playing welcome i kill up you thank you dude for joining how are you doing bro i'll come to the phone yep oh so people are like dude i would that would be actually a good idea uh like us doing the live call and actually helping people on the live call yeah venky asks do you cover dev ops are we planning to cover devops in this course or no so right now our focus is mainly on react bringing you as much react value as possible damn his setup was sick that's what i was like we just found our freaking cp new cp team member yeah i like that sound yeah i'm actually doing my wednesday so stay tuned guys i mean wayne if you want to make you know we're we are looking for a content creator yeah he had a perfect live streaming setup right there yeah yeah all right let me see if we can take on another question okay let's see any prerequisites for this course um no dude so you can actually if you've never heard of code before you don't even know where to begin with coding you have no idea how to build a website this is the place for you we're pretty much we will take you or what will literally hold your hand teach you all the foundations for the fundamentals for html css javascript and with that we will pair you with the right the correct knowledge as to how to use those skills and become like somewhat of a a sellable asset to somebody else so like you can actually go ahead and make some money with the skills that you learn right so we're gonna go ahead and teach you that and then on top of that we pretty much then upgrade your knowledge by layering react on top and hey let's go i'm still on youtube yeah can you see me can you hear me yeah yeah wait oh i can hear okay so i can hear awani i'm so confused right now what is going on oh sonny is gone can can you guys hear me yeah hey let's go we got the family growing you're taking me hey right now guys welcome to profit with javascript we are so excited to have you in the program kazi you're gone who's gone crowd we can see sunny i just see qazi sunny is disconnecting yo priyanshu how are you doing hey man oh okay i'm back there we go there we go now we can see everybody priyanshu talk to us man first of all just give us a little bit of background what got you into coding how old you are how old you were when you got into coding give us a little bit of your background bro so everyone i'm priyanji siraj i'm from india i'm 13 years old and i have around two years of experience actually i would say i had around one years of experience i got into coding when i was 11 when i when i was exactly 11 that was my birthday when i got into coding and um it was actually clever programmer themselves who got me into coding so that was amazing then um this one it's all went on i thought that coding was cool and i started learning python and after a few months of uh learning python i got stuck into tutorial help so that was like the worst thing that you can possibly imagine now uh what actually happened was that i didn't code for uh six months straight like no coding at all so that was kind of me so and then suddenly all of a sudden this forward situation comes in and i also have a really good friend who helped me out and he told me that yeah you can do it man you can you can do it just crush it and then uh you discover thing it and you guys started off with the google maps challenge i was so so like i was hell inspired yeah i just make this i get my portfolio up and running i'll show my parents that i can do the second show everyone that i can do this and i made it but that time i didn't actually even anything so like i was actually delayed and then i was learning more about javascript and then came their live streams of react really impressive like seems they're still on youtube you can all go check it out and then this amazon challenge came this was like the best thing that happened to me ever so i learned about react i learned about react context i learned everything about riyadh that i need to know and after that guess what on 12 september at midnight uh for it for india it was 13 september the midnight so i jumped on a live call with sunny himself and he that was like enough for heaven for me after that the next thing i know sunny took me into pwj for free that's it dude it was your answer like disagree on what you just said that all of the people who get the course for free don't even show up i have showed up in literally all of the calls and i've sucked through even though it was like 2 20 a.m 3 a.m or something and all of them are jampacked with value i'm already towards module 8 of the course and it's going amazing like if you guys are actually on the fence like everyone else has said even i'll see the same thing the two most valuable things that you have actually three are success coaches the community itself and the live streams guys this is highly neglected and i'll tell you the difference between any udemy course in them in a i have actually bought several udemy courses myself and what happens is that you tend to check out more about programming yourself right i was on this flutter course recently and i had and they showed me how to build a hello world application in flutter now i wanted to add some more widgets to it but what happened like any night it would happen to any one of you the same thing happened with me i tried to play around with the code and i and i messed up i didn't have anyone in the entire world to help me and i felt like i was already in the grave but these guys the difference between them and everyone else is that the live streams that they have they have separate q a session for you so like you will get you'll get to speak with sunny you'll get to speak with nas and you will be able to clear all your doubts out like i i am making some uh word uh word application so that the next time i hop on a stream with a nas or sunny i can actually ask them my questions and like you have to it's not some people even think that okay i bought this course now it's going to be there with me for my lifetime i'll just keep it aside i'll do my stuff right now guys that's not at all how it's how it's supposed to be like i even though my exams are going on i'm still putting in like as much as i can like i'm putting in four hours i can get five hours and i'm trying to make these uh word applications so that even i can be there in those streams and i can actually clear out my doubts the clouds that i have and i and the best part about the stream is with nas at the end you guys get to party like anything like think about think about it like the best day in your world like every other thursday that's how good it is guys that's awesome dude i love your energy dude thank you man i appreciate you and not you know not everybody has that and so i think that's really important because even when you talked about qazi it's not true you can give a free course to somebody i think you were an exception and sunny saw that and that's why he like kind of picked you out and he was like yo let's go but honest truth is unfortunately in most of the situations when people get things for free they don't appreciate it and i am actually not i am the same way as well myself like yeah that happens to me too like i tend to always like think about it to be given to me for granted and like several others do that too like think about it buying a fake bed from uh the roadside and buying a bed from louis vuitton think about it like that which one would you uh care more like you would also always care more about the louis vuitton bed not just because of how how expensive it was but also because the quality that you're getting right so it's the same thing over here like these guys actually like push you until you are actually like a good developer they're always like as sonny says they're always there holding your hands and walking you through and that is something that's i i've never seen that in any course ever ever dude i i love the uh the the comparisons you come with that cleared it up really well it's like a louis vuitton verse like a boat you're going to get off the side of the street like which one you're going to take care of more right like it's an investment in yourself and it's true like when i jumped on their first call with brienne uh with brit like he it wasn't like it wasn't the fact that he was he was young right it wasn't the fact that he's a young coder it was because like one of that guy one of those guys said that i was young so i got a course free that's not a dollar how it is yeah like it wasn't that guys it was a case of like he knew like when when he was speaking to me like he was like i can't afford the course but here's what i'm doing and he that was the energy that i felt and like i was like yo this is like we have to have this energy in the course because it showed that like he wasn't looking at it in terms of money he was looking in terms of like right i know i can't get into the course right now but but what can i do to better my situation so that like inside at some point i will be able to get in the course and if i don't god damn it i'm going to be a developer if somebody like somebody's not going to stop me right like it was like i would like to just cut you off for a minute for all those people who are actually like not in that situation who who can actually afford the course like it is actually expensive i wouldn't say that it doesn't but it's actually an investment on yourself and even if you can't i highly highly recommend you guys to watch their clones that they build in the amazon clone which you have on your youtube like they explain react context api like like anything and if you guys want to be in that my peace of mind state you guys should definitely check out this book deep book oh that's a great book by cal newport right fantastic book and talks yeah i was talking about brother about it just yesterday yeah it's it's so good and like when you like actually complete the complete reading the book even i'm doing it right now i'm reading it every day you guys actually tried to follow the rules and principles that kyle newport talks about it inside of you and try to be in that mind how did you get into personal development did your parents push you to get into personal development or did you pick it up on your own what it was actually kind of really funny like school is kind of easy for me because number one all the teachers [ __ ] and number two i have some friends who help me out oftentimes and my post so i got into personal development because see the ability of a person to just sit in his house and code all day and make a difference just by singer sitting at his house and not like being some kind of uh politician and making a difference that actually surprises me like the your ability to just sit in front of your computer and make a difference in hundreds of thousands of people's life is really surprising to me because you're putting in so much hard work and like this is so amazing like i had that ability that i never knew of in the two years back when i actually found out about coding i knew my potential of this laptop this crappy laptop that i have and i started to use it in the good way like oftentimes people tend to buy a laptop for the entertainment purposes right like some people buy for youtube some people wear it for netflix i even that was kind of like my performance and some people buy a chromebook oh my that thing guys yeah so that is something that's extremely good like they're that just mindset that you need to have like i'm learning something new like all the time that i've ever been like at any point of life i've always been in that learning attitude like i always want to learn more and more and more i have like tons and tons of encyclopedias i i used to study about theoretical physics and i was really engrossed in that too and i loved coding because i could build things that were really amazing and that could actually change the world and that would implement my life and as you guys asked me to do i started to document my journey i wrote i started to write blogs two days earlier and like you know how good it feels when you actually try to bring out value i want you to make i want you to make youtube content on coding or personal development or anything like that start off with like full on youtube can you make a video this week and post it up definitely i'm i'm working on on my exam i was working on yeah when would you upload your first video i'm planning to do it on wednesday because wednesday is actually my lucky day i've done several new things in wednesdays can you have it uploaded and published by thursday let's go dude no i'm actually planning to start creating the content and i'll brainstorm it tomorrow on monday i am teaching my friend so i'm gonna be occupied in that too and and another thing i would like to say is that guys some people say that like on sunny i talked to him about it yesterday and some people keep on complaining that they don't get clients they don't get students do it for free guys who's stopping you i teach my friends for free and that's how you get you get networking like you guys should watch the igtv video we did with i did but sunny like that is jam packed with value you you everyone should do it everyone should thank you so much for coming on always appreciate your energy when you drop that video send me a link to it on instagram okay i'll drive i'll drive people to watch it okay bye all right take care thank you thanks dude i had to kick him off otherwise he was going to take over this whole [ __ ] show dude if you guys love priyanka and his energy guys drop it in the comments below he's intended dude i feel like i have way too much power with this i know the whole deck is right here um okay we got a great comment by lem kennedy and he goes i'm a seasoned dev and i tutor daily so he's making an income from teaching other people coding which is i highly recommend you do that actually as one of the things he goes taking a break from finals to be here i've seen what the big boot camps are teaching the homework the projects and i can tell you that that's that there's more value here than what you learn at general assembly full sale etc at your own pace too the tas at the boot camps never have time to answer the questions students have no question goes unanswered here now what i like about lem is that he is hey another student just joined in profit with javascript welcome nice so lem started coding and profitable javascript and in his first three weeks he actually cleared fifteen hundred dollars in cash and he's only two months into coding he's a complete beginner to coding um and what is amazing about that about at least he's a beginner when it comes to i think react js right okay when you are teaching coding to other people you become better a lot faster and even if you're new to coding you can actually help people who are one step behind you because you're going to be a lot more relatable than somebody who has like 10 or 20 years of experience in coding yep and that's one of those things that's going to make just a strong foundation for you and give you that practical income coming in from coding so then you can actually quit your side hustle like if you're doing uber on the side or if you're doing construction work on the side you can stop that and actually spend eight to ten hours a day on coding so that's one tip that i would like to give all of you is figure out a way to make even one dollar from coding when you do that everything changes for you exactly guys and like the best way to do that is literally teach for free like my that's why i would advise you guys whoa dude so terry what insane dude go i think maybe uh can we bring that on the screen so teary just dropped a hundred dollar donation on youtube and he goes so terry can we bring you on here oh there we go nice and so tyra goes hey qazi and sunny graduated as a computer science major and used udemy throughout people really need to get the difference between profit with javascript college and other platforms i would love to join one day on the live with you guys and talk about the enormous values pwj brings love y'all dude we massively appreciate you like and and you're 100 like he's on the webinar oh dude let's bring him on 100 the spring we invited you so theory let me go ahead and stop the show that's crazy crazy dude damn thank you bro that made our freaking year that was awesome yeah really really awesome that's awesome um let me bring on awani i know some of you guys i'm sorry tommy some of the people have been waiting forever i apologize i forget sometimes hi amani how are you doing how's it going good good how are you guys doing fantastic so tell us just a little bit about you and like how before you got into coding you know like what were you doing the last few years i guess so uh guys i'm i'm actually a mom of toddler so i've been uh i used i have done my master's in computer science but that was like whole different like thesis level thing i got into coding few years back but it was like just just for few some years and then i had to drop it now it's like after four years i'm coming back again and it's just because i like coincidentally or fortunately saw this clever programming video in on youtube i was so furious that time i thought why did why did youtube took so much time to show me this video and i just started what was the video i the it was the five days challenge that amazon nice awesome yes i did that and then i immediately joined it so i want to tell want to tell people like like me especially i mean i know all the youngsters they love coding they want to learn so many things but the people who are looking for their career change who are absolutely beginners who are moms who actually like uh just want to do something but they don't have any idea what to do and they are thinking about coding this is the best place you can come to i mean there are lot of things like they have like so many like they have beginners also in term intermediate people also they are advanced level people so they all work together so you know you know what like how to solve your problems you you know you won't be you won't be overwhelmed at all you will be enjoying coding and people will be there to help you exactly wow yeah exactly that's why we try and push for is is more of a course it's more of a community right and it's going to be with you even once you get your job we actually have people who are actually in a fulltime position but they still come to those coaching calls they still come and actually come with their problems come with questions like hey sonny i'm in a new role and i don't know how to navigate this huge code base any tricks or tips you could share and those kind of things which pretty much it's not just me answering at that point is every single person inside the community um yeah yeah that's really awesome um so awhile i want to ask you uh if you if somebody is on the fence right now what would be your advice what would you what would you tell them if they were on the fence of joining pwj yes immediately join in i mean you're gonna enjoy it it's you not only gonna learn coding but also like how to communicate this is i mean i'm talking with you guys is one of one kind of a kind of achievement for me i would say i never been like live i have never uh i mean it's really really hard for me like i'm not confident enough to do that but i'm doing that that's one achievement from cleveland give her some words of encouragement in the comments below we have about 500 of people watching her live so guys just drop some love for awani and awan you're doing fantastic by the way like you're doing incredible yeah exactly you guys i mean credit goes to you all all cp community all the mentors all the coaches and even like all like my fellow friends like now they are becoming friends you know like i'm becoming like friends to so many people in the community so it's so great i mean and one more one more thing i want to uh mention see like uh i i'm learning how to question i mean how how we can why we should ask things so i have learned like i have learned that a lot of love coming in by the way like you are amazing daniel is like you're doing amazing thank you for sharing your experience everybody sharing jen yomna all sending heart signs for you thank you guys thank you so much means a lot yeah carry on the money yeah yeah i mean you learn how to question and i mean how to ask question actually because like lot of time you get struck in programming but you don't know how to ask people like how can i get the solution of it so when you go to the community you see like a lot of people are struggling from the same question and then you get the idea and like it will be helpful and it's just one week guys it's just one with me and i actually don't get that much time uh i mean i have a lot of things to like i really get very limited time to uh to code but that that time i actually am able to focus because the content is so good i mean it starts from beginning and then slowly take you take you there and there are like a lot of live calls where where people do fun nazis dancing i love that so i mean yeah i mean it's so much so good i mean i i really would tell all the people especially the ones who are thinking no this course is not for us like they are like just uh getting hesitated that like all the advanced people are there they know already know some coding how would we go there like how we will be doing everything right so i am the i am the example for them i i would say just come and you got really gonna enjoy it people are there to help you it's so good yeah exactly thank you so much i really appreciate you one thing i wanna em and this is something which i think kazi might be valuable to a lot of girls who are willing to join right so one thing i'll tell you guys from industry experience and the developer sort of market is very male dominant right it's very very male dominant at the moment there's a lot more guys who code than girls so one thing i can say is in our community we actually have some insanely talented like women inside of the course and it's really awesome to see that and i can actually say like a lot of our literally a lot of our best developers like jen um like iwanis is now in the course like we have so many amazing so powerful women inside of this course so if you're if you ever see like coding as sort of intimidating because you're you're a girl or or you maybe feel that like you might not fit in then this is something is in there melissa is in there amazing women exactly like and this is where like the support comes in we make it our best effort to make sure that everyone feels comfortable inside there which means in the coaching calls everything so everyone has like a completely like powerful voice inside the community so that's just something i want to highlight um yeah really really awesome to have you inside owani thank you so much appreciate you thank you thank you let's go hey me doing my job again cutting people off in the middle i wish i could just stop that um thank you for the 10 donation he goes you guys are amazing thank you for the course and

fire you're 17 years old you're learning coding you're hyped you're excited tell us a little bit like why did you join profit with javascript and what would you say to somebody who's on the fence because today's the day the price goes up today is the day where we really just want to go hey if you want to get the best deal it's today a week from now the course doors close and after that we're going to shut the [ __ ] up and not talk about profit with javascript for a really long time yeah and there's going to be no enrollment for profit with javascript and we're just going to go crazy providing value on youtube and helping people and helping people in our program get results the ones who are in the program so if you're getting annoyed right now my apologies but it's just because we really believe that this is the best course on the planet so we want to give you that opportunity to get the best deal and after that nothing from us and we're just going to go back to our like daily providing content and value okay exactly so give us a little bit why'd you join it and what's like what would you say to somebody who's thinking about it yeah uh i would like to ask you kazi uh how many models do we have in pwg 15 okay so like we get 15 modules 15 pieces of content to learn right right no wrong why we are having coaching calls every day life coaching first the value never ends even there there are specific smart modules all right welcome another student join tondo thank you but keep going fury yeah so even if people are listening to you so even if there are specific number of modules the value is never ending it's unlimited like we have no life cost than the number of days in the week we are literally having live calls every day so the like it's you get lifetime access plus the value is never going to end unlike an udemy course okay so kazi my next question to you is what are we teaching in pwg you tell me sir yuri sonny what are we teaching what are we teaching teaching web development uh how to make money no specific technologies uh javascript reacts html css material ui mockups yep zeppelin that's right guys but hold on hold on sorry sayuri keep going and another student just joined welcome ken right keep going hey let's go so guys six more minutes till you for the coaching call if you want to join by the way so the name is profit with javascript but you get javascript you get html you get css you get react you get load you get whatever you want like anything in the world you want to get into it like you just ask and you get it like there are many people who know more things like we we recently have some uh students in our uh pwj who are willing to learn dsp and we so yuri i'm gonna let you on for 10 more seconds because we have a lot of people lined up so you got 10 more seconds go guys if you're on the fence join it you have a 30 days money back guarantee no question asked and if even if it is there you will never need it this is my word

have i have three teenage girls how are you able to focus on the course um it's uh just scheduling my time i use my google calendar is full i scheduled a time to do stuff i make appointments with myself um and that's how you make the time important uh important um yeah otherwise and you were also doing a job right while you were going to pwj yes yes okay so give us a little bit of like because i know some people also want to hear results right they they like hearing people's stories they also want to hear results and i know you got some nice results so talk to me about like what happened with your job that you were initially going to with pwj and that you've shared with us because i think that's really awesome for people to hear i was working as a junior dev i was the junior member on the team uh and they had a budget shortfall from covid so i was the one that ended up getting cut from the team um how many people got hurt from the team uh i think about 25 well from the whole company about 25 to 30 people all got played off on the same day um yeah so between um the uh so using profit javascript stuff i had redone my recently redone my portfolio and my resume sorry you just always keep that there just just in case and um reaching out to the network of people that i have made through um instagram twitter um flat groups that i'm in um just put out there that hey guys i need a job um and so put out a blast of i can't i don't know for sure i would say about 40 or 50 applications um had an interview this was a monday how to interview tuesday an interview wednesday and a job offer on thursday damn that's insane and what were the what were the results like so you went from what was the job that you had and if you're not comfortable sharing the numbers that's okay but if you want to share the numbers you're more than welcome to because i think it gives people context yeah but what were the results you lost the job while you were in the course and then you got another job and what was the difference i was a junior dev making just about 50 000 i'm just under um i am now a senior dev um because of all of the react and advanced javascript stuff that i've been working on with clever programmer made my portfolio kind of bump me up to the next level i am i have a salary of 95 000 with plus benefits and bonus options so i will be bumped up over you know a hundred thousand a year by the time everything rolls out awesome that makes me so happy jen i'm so happy for you that is so amazing and i can like i don't have to do like i was doing side projects on the side and i i don't have to do what was your what was your reaction when you got that email from them it was like an email right where they gave you the offer yeah it was it was actually during a coaching call one of nasa's coaching calls and i was just like i thought i thought they were joking that the amount that they had an offer letter i was like they can't be serious yeah it's like one of those it sounds like one of those scam emails they're like just wire us 30k here first that is amazing thank you so much for coming on jen appreciate you guys give it up for dan what an amazing result going from 50 as a junior developer to 96k as a senior developer thank you for coming on exactly i appreciate you bye all right guys we had a few people joining so we had tyson we had sweater we had john kenwright george garcia jorge garcia yeah welcome guys yep awesome that's awesome you guys jumped on into profit with javascript and guys so the coaching call the time is now up so the coaching call is done for we we have the number of people that have already joined it but what i would say is if you want to join the program and you've been thinking about it and thank you somebody give a 20 donation really really appreciate you for that thank you just please know that next week the course the doors are closing and today the price of the program goes up at 11 59 p.m sharp pacific exactly guys today's game yo somebody made it at 12 40. oh nice arpita you're still welcome to join the coaching call with us because it's still 12 40. exactly amazing stuff guys like kazi said today is the last chance to get the price that you're seeing so make sure if you want to join or if you're on the fence save yourself the extra money go ahead and join uh today and got it yeah let's take another rapid fire frank you got 30 seconds hey what's up frank what's going on guys um just want to let you know there's a huge difference between all these courses that you guys are seeing and the clever programming courses i like to like think about it as fast food mcdonald's udemy stuff and like custom sushi chef like 800 beverly hills sushi exactly exactly you know the place too right i know yeah um guys again like i was able to take that that course um i was able to do that spotify clone with sunny and the guys from sonos like like hired me man i'm i'm making almost 15k a month now like that's a huge amount of money guys it's like we're not playing around and i get that job you guys take over cp you got it frank if there's a position open at sonos let me know yeah what the hell man and what was how much were you making before that job by the way um i was i i was just doing freelance stuff it was just like janky like little stuff here and there on average how much were you making a year um i was like at 130 you know like average and you know they take like average yeah like net 90 you know i didn't get paid for three months at a time awful yeah you know so this helped me put me over the edge and love you guys and it's the community is well worth it guys you you're gonna get you're gonna level up because of that i mean but you so frank has went up from 130k to 170k which is awesome but frank what the hell man i think you've paid the difference a 40 000 difference in donations to us so you're not making any extra money i'm going to keep doing it so that maybe thank you so much for coming out we're going to keep bringing people a lot guy frank what would you say to them if should they join should they not join should they think about it take some more time what do you think no join get off the fence man it's uh it's better on the other side believe me uh you'll get a lot of opportunities that you didn't have before let's get it man just come join me come join everyone it's a family let's go somebody join from your words commodity yeah kamala just joined thank you frank really appreciate you brother have a good one love you guys peace yo wayne what is going on my man hi man are you doing dude that's that i want to set it up bro wow are you making content or what uh yeah i do he just did live streaming he was in the coaching call yesterday so oh nice awesome dude talk to me wayne what are you doing with that mic and that setup are you making youtube content i am yes um the kids started me into it um mainly i wasn't comfortable talking in front of the camera so this was for me to get over my fear by doing that right now so this is how i'm able to talk to you a lot more confident dope that is freaking exciting there's something beautiful about starting to put out content and speak your confidence level goes up so fast it's weird you're like wait i haven't had this boost in my whole life and all of a sudden in like two weeks you see a big difference we saw a big difference in even some of the people from our community like amanath and he's like now so confident when he speaks so something interesting nasa just told me what did you do to your team treehouse subscription and then i think you also joined profit javascript so talk to me about that i did um basically i messaged you in i think as one of your videos that i was actually on the fence uh so i've gone through team treehouse i did the udemy uh did coursera i did everything basically and one of the main things that pushed me over yesterday was the strength of your community and because i'm looking through my team treehouse and i'm there to finish to full stack uh javascript developer was 36 hours so i looked to that and i went yeah okay i can do 36 hours but three months later it's i'm only on 26 and the problem is is that is that there's no human interaction you're left alone and also you're told to reach out to people via linkedin and you do that and no one gets back to you anyway so i signed off i went over to the fence crossed over and this morning it's been a whirlwind uh you i'm going to the facebook group i've actually gone to your slack and everyone's commented and not left me alone since this morning basically got me into everything that's awesome dude and how did you find the coaching call uh perfect you know it's you know it's it's one of those ones that you don't really expect to be happening and so you know i was i was on the fence thinking is this just another course it's just going to be going through just acceptable money but it's not the case as soon as the payment has gone through and if you start coming through uh satisfaction from there awesome and what would you say to someone who's on the fence of joining like what was it that actually pushed you over the fence and and then some people might be able to relate to that yeah so yesterday's obviously the community strength in that uh so after like yesterday uh because i meant to comment onto your your channel as soon as i signed up i canceled my subscription to team treehouse and so from there that saved me an extra two hundred pound a month that's awesome dude nice damn steep yeah hey listen subscription yeah that is awesome man we're very glad to have you in the community are you gonna make are you ever interested in making coding content yeah definitely um a little bit of background about myself is that i've i was at the very beginning of the birth of the internet and everything from there and also was building html tables the web is built in tables uh i was there when bootstrap came in and foundation first came in so then obviously i changed my career down to uh ux design so and when furlough oh sorry when kevin came in i was furloughed a few months so within that three months i think how can i uh bump up my salary i know can i be more um how can i help the team out a lot more so that's when i started looking into javascript and it's just after i just kind of grind can mature and after that but no so after today uh it's been a war event so guys i'm so glad to be on your course and if you are on the fence just leap you're never gonna know until you jumped yep all right thank you wayne so much man really appreciate you brother have a good one yeah cheers guys thank you love the sound dude yep yo lamb how's it going how you doing brother talk to us about some results what has happened since you've joined pwj oh man it's been pretty crazy like um i actually i actually went down the uh the tutoring route um and uh it's it's crazy like i i deal with uh with boot camp students all the time and uh i you know you read this out in the comments like you know the stuff that they the stuff that they uh they teach like i see better things coming out of out of pwj and out of your courses and like the stuff that you have planned um and like my big things i know this is going quick my big thing is that if you're a seasoned developer and you're watching this because i'm a i'm a seasoned vet too i've been coding for like over 20 years now um of course this these uh the clever programmer like you know they've got their their finger on the pulse of what is like popular right now like what's actually gonna what you can put in your book and like on your site and like what uh what what everybody's looking for especially if you're like me and like you know you got displaced by um kovin so you know if you're on the fence don't be i mean it's worth it it's worth it at all skill levels that's awesome you actually joined quite recently as well right yeah yeah i've only i um i found a video on uh when i when i first um um lost my gig i found a video on uh uh quasi uh uh talking about um tutoring on wise it like you guys your free content um actually is what uh what tick started me and what video was it specifically that helped you by the way i think it was the um how to make uh five grand as a javascript developer or something like that i don't remember the name of it um directly i'll i'll i'll let you know but um but yeah it was like i was like okay i'll try it and i made i made enough to join the course within a few days and i was like well you know if uh if the free content was was enough to uh to do that i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna come in and i'm gonna i'm going to actually see what what this is all about and i'm so glad i have like the community is great and how much did you make in the first three weeks of the program uh i think at that point i was somewhere at about 1500. not bad yeah investment yeah it's still still going up tyson says digging the nintendo with the old duck hunt gun in the background that's right that's right you gotta show off your cred i remember when i was really young when i was a baby i used to be like really fat and like i would have a diaper on i'd be running around everywhere in the house and i remember my brothers would always go behind the tv and plugins do something with the wires and then you'd be able to play that game where you can like do duck hunt and i didn't know what they did because i was like two years old right i was like so young like one or two years old so i just thought they would go behind the tv and like i so they weren't at home i went behind the tv and i just tried to model what they did so i just took the wires just like randomly like dangled them and came back to the front and i'm like why the hell is this not working why can't i play my duck hunt game i got so angry my brothers walked in on me and i just had like i was just wearing my like diaper i had the tv and i was like i broke the freaking like pushed it off and it like ellen broke i was so angry yeah so that's my story with that duck hunt game that's what i do and my code doesn't compile you know yeah right right after after hour 10 of debugging exactly damn but he's still wearing a diaper right thank you so much for coming on no problem [Laughter] i was going to make an internal joke but i realized yeah rage quit um awesome all right so this has been pretty freaking epic i think we have a few more people to bring on and i think we're going to take on one more person guys and then after this we're hey what's up bro dude you really gotta like do the conor mcgregor thing one day bro just like that yeah yeah i'll growled the beard i'll work on the irish accent like a fight club every time patch comes on he's like ready to go you know dude the wife the wife beater has been the one consistency in my life since my bars closed back in march it's just been like every day i'm like i don't have to leave the house i can do everything from home i'm just going to throw on the cozy shirt you know that's it yeah yes yeah so i think some of the people have heard your story but i think that is really inspiring for people and can just give us a little bit of like what you were doing with previously yeah and yeah uh yeah so i was i've been a bartender i've been living in la for about 11 years and and i've been making my living as a bartender for like the last 11 years and it just like these last couple years i just find myself no matter what job i'm at no matter how much money i'm making when i know i have to go there i'm like [ __ ] this when's it going to be over i don't want to spend eight hours doing this get home at 3am my whole next day's ruined like the whole thing and i was like you know then you mix alcohol with you know some entitled people that come in and you're just like it's just a recipe for an argument or someone's ego for you know it's just like it's not a positive environment more often than not and i was like i don't want to spend my time there but and so on the other side of that i'm also an actor and a writer were you so were you skilled at that stuff could you do like the crazy tricks that they do the bartenders do the best the best trick i ever learned how to do was to blow fire so i like i could take uh i could take a empty bottle of gray goose and roll up roll the napkin up to look kind of like a little flower you dip it in bacardi 151 you light it on fire you take a swig of the bacardi and you just kind of like spit and pull away and like you get this big old fireball so that was kind of fun nice dude yeah yeah yeah no i was good though you know i i knew i could do that at the bar what's that you would do that at the bar only one bar i've ever worked at let us do it there and that's just because they were like we were downtown it was a dive bar and so it was cool but um but yeah multipliers weren't like that's people literally getting lit dude coming out of there they're like yo this [ __ ] is on fire no no it's on fire it was on fire it was cool man uh it was fun but you know aside from like little things like that and stuff like it was just a negative environment and so i like you know i started ever since lockdown had been spending a lot of time like on acting and writing and stuff like that and then i was like well i obviously need to think about when my bar opens up i don't want to go back like i want to be done with that part of my life what else can i do and then you know i just kind of like huh i was just going to add no skill goes every skill can be useful like imagine if you're making a training video and you're like guys today we're going to be learning about firebase totally yeah yeah and you should apply to a job like that you'll be like guys this app that i built for you guys is built with react and firebase can breathe out and let's go bacardi 151 the camera yeah man yeah totally no i mean there's definitely like some skills that i learned as a bartender you know you know learning the gift of gab and socializing and just like i always loved the aspect i got to meet people from all over and you know different people from all around the world and stuff like that that was really cool but um yeah man so so i was uh doing a lot of acting and writing i was like what else can i do i don't want to go back to the bar so i was like well let's take a look at coding and obviously you know like i knew of you quasi through amber lee because she used to train me in boxing i can't wait to get back to that by the way um and so i was so i hit her up and i was like you know is is causie what's the deal i know he's a programmer and stuff and so she told me a little bit about it and i watched you guys videos on youtube and and uh my girlfriend's friend is a programmer as well and like graphic design and stuff like that and so basically i was like what else can i do that's creative that makes decent money but more than anything else i will enjoy so i was like let's give this a shot and i just kind of dove into it and i was like well this is a lot of fun and you know i kind of found myself like going down the rabbit hole for like five hours a day just like messing around making cool little web pages and stuff like that and um you know making little websites for friends and all that kind of stuff and i was like this is [ __ ] great and i don't have to leave the house if i don't want to i don't have to worry about it's pandemic proof you know what i mean yeah and at the end of the day it scratches my you know creative itch so that's why i felt like it was a good fit for me so you know damn that's awesome dude that's awesome bro thanks i really appreciate that we appreciate that story and like how you went from like even you getting interested into coding it's like you kind of just heard it from a friend like your girlfriend's friend right and you were like hey this guy's a graphic designer and doing coding and that got you interested in it and i remember you and i were on a call yeah yeah man i was just like spilling my guts to you and and i was like dude i don't know if it's the right thing for me i already have so much going on i want to be able to find my balance and you're like dude just do it i was like [ __ ] it i'm gonna do it yeah you know i have not got it and so today the price of the program permanently goes up if somebody's thinking about it would you recommend this program to them and i know now you have some experience with the program too because you've been in it yeah yeah i think so definitely like if it's if you want to if you want a program and you want to learn how to do it right then join profit with javascript because not only do you get the classes but like uh wayne said earlier like it's you're joined for the community as well like that's almost more valuable than the class because you don't have a lot of classes where you can get answers if you have a question and like i think that is one of the obviously coding is difficult and you're gonna get confused at times and who do you reach out to if you have a question like this community is has been so incredibly helpful for me so like i love all you guys man it's it's you've made you've made the process of learning something brand new like this a lot of fun so there we are i love that yeah thank you so much brother thank you so much you got it guys love you guys see ya appreciate you bye damn all right guys so i think that's it for for today i hope that you guys enjoyed it got value out of it um is there anything else sunny you think we should talk about or or do you want to end it off with i think the main thing is guys like you saw today like not from like a fancy presentation not from something you know like premade it's pretty much real people speaking to you guys that like this course is more than just a course right it's a community it's something which is growing it's it's dynamic it's constantly evolving it's growing it keeps up to date as well with the latest and and newest trends you know like everything is always adapting in web development so we not just us but the community is ahead of trend right so like we're always getting sort of your news feed and things like that now what i want to say is if you haven't or if you're on the fence my personal advice to you guys is regardless if you get it today or if you get like within a few days the point is that doors will close to that community in a week's time so on the 26th we pretty much close the doors and once they're closed we don't know when they're going to open again um so it's very much a case of like if you're on the fence my advice is jump right now i remember 30 day money back guarantee so my advice would be go ahead jump in see what it's like because at least that way you give yourself the option of trying the course otherwise if it closes by the 26th you miss the chance to even test it out right so what's the what's what's better right 30 days of testing something and then if you don't like you can get your money back or just like missing out on the opportunity and then letting it go forever right that's my take on it um but as you can tell guys we're never gonna stop bringing that free value for you guys on youtube so the fire is gonna keep coming and with that said i mean i'm pretty good dude i think i think anything you want to add to that that's it i think you guys have heard enough we really appreciate you we love you today is the last day of the price and then after that week from now doors closed we love you guys we appreciate you this is qazi this is sunny and we will see you in the next video click that button below flick it jump in the course you won't regret it we promise you
