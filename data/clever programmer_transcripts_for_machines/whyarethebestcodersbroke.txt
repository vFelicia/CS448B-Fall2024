so why the best programmers are broke and one of the main things is so basically you know I'm talking about the people who have been coding let's say for 30 years and their rate is 30 dollars an hour and I know that because I actually had a few coding pewters or mentors that I had hired and I was working with and that was a rate they were charging and worked very closely with them for a few for a few years actually and I was looking at so I had one mentor who was essentially broke who was a great coder with 30 years of experience making $30 an hour then I had another mentor who had you know only few years of coding experience but then he was charging 150 to $200 an hour as a Python consultant he even had clients who charge $300 an hour as a Python consultant and that's what made me you know started thinking about okay hmm you can have somebody who has 15 13 30 years of experience and you can have somebody who has less experience and are actually less hot you know less good coders they're not as good as somebody else who has 30 years of experience but how are they when it comes to the pay so different like what is the difference they live in the same country they live in the same state they live in the same city they have a room to apply to the same pool of jobs so what's with the disparity why is one guy making five times as much and other guy making five times as less why does it take one person to do in five years what it takes other person to do in one year why does it take one person to do in two years what it takes other person to do in 10 years what the hell is the difference so here's it what in my opinion what the difference is it's a lot of self limiting belief that people put on themselves okay and it's a lot of here's what the most important thing that I think people overlook 85% of your financial success and listen to this very carefully and if you're watching this live stream here's what I suggest bring bring some notes with you bring a notepad and take some notes all right write down what I'm saying and this will really really help you 85% of your financial success comes from your personal likeability your interpersonal skills your people skills your negotiation skills all right and the other 15% of your financial success comes from your technical skills how crazy is that and this is it this is according to Carnegie Mellon University they did a research and that's what they put out and I think it's true it's the 80/20 rule 85 15 in this case but that's really what it is quality of work of course it matters your dedication of course it matters your time of course it matters but how come the dude who's put 30 years into coding and literally codes every single day has eyebags underneath his eyes doesn't even change his shirt like this guy literally was my mentor and I hope he's not watching it um and I love him to death but he literally wore a blue hoodie every single session we've ever had okay and like had crazy eye bags under his eyes and he was the best coder I've literally ever seen okay this guy was like wizard he'd been coding since he was five years old and he'd been coding all the way through and his work experience was 30 years I imagine that you've been coding from five since you were five years old and then you also have professional job experience for 30 years so he was probably coding for over 40 years okay yet that was his hourly rate and again you know why is money important a lot of people are like why are you talking about money why do you bring up money so much here's why because I care about you being able to support yourself but not only that you being able to support your family and your friends and get those around you this was something I kind of figured out or it happened to me and I had this realization a while ago and I've told this story where my mom got an accident and I couldn't afford her surgery like literally our family couldn't afford her surgery so for 12 years like she just kept being an agonizing pain and me feeling helpless was the moment for me where I realized that I only need a little bit of money to be happy and I just need to eat food and that's pretty much it and I'll be like good but I need to have more for other people around me and not just enough for myself because I think that's selfish to just have enough for yourself so now going back to the two programmers right one making 30 and other making like 200 an hour that's literally one person's one year of work is equal to the other person six years of work so you're saving yourself a lot of time which gives you freedom you're obviously making good money so you get paid what you deserve you're not overworked and underpaid and you can help out everybody else around you and also you're like I said you have that freedom and that freedom is what we really want right that's what we're alternately looking for and here's what I like about it the most when you're getting compensated well for your time you end up having a lot of extra free time and now with that time you can choose to put in a lot more work maybe even build a business on the side or work on really cool coding projects like nerd out whatever but you could work on your own things and that's the freedom that I like you know for example if you're charging let's say let's say you're happy with making $2,000 a month okay let's just talk about some practical math now let's say you're happy and you enjoy making $2,000 a month and you figure it out the what would keep you happy you could be working 40 hours to make you could be working 40 hours a week to make your $2,000 a month so let's say you could be working 160 hours a month to be making your $2,000 or instead of working hundred and 60 hours a month how about if you had a higher hourly rate that you charged how about you worked for only 40 hours and made $2,000 how about instead of your workweek being 40 hours long your workweek was 10 hours long and you get 30 hours extra now you could take that extra 30 hours and put it towards work and now instead of working 10 hours you're working 40 hours but your income instead of it being 2,000 it's now 8,000 dollars that's one thing you could do the other thing you could do with that 30 hours is literally start going to the gym that time you complain you don't have enough hours in a day to spend with your family friends or your girlfriend whatever take care of that I don't know the third thing is enjoy your life like travel go to different places go to different states go to different countries see what is going on in the world check out different cultures it's unlimited what you could do at that time so that's why it's important to understand and calculate what your earning potential could look like so you have this clear map because most people what we do is we just applied lots and lots and lots of jobs and then the first one that comes to us we just accept that and it can even be like some really crappy opportunity and then we just go from there right and then we just go day by day not thinking about what we're doing we work we come home we watch stranger things or house of cards and there's nothing wrong with that if you're watching it from a place of just enjoying it but most of the times our lives are so hectic that we literally need to numb the pain by watching some stuff to keep our minds off of the pressure and the headaches and all the problems so we come home from 900 to 500 a job that we huh we're like it's okay I'm not really feeling it we spend the rest of the time maybe watching a show or something and then we sleep and then we rinse and repeat and go through life like zombies and then we look back and we're like I have an average job that prays an average income I have you know either a partner in life or I maybe don't even have a partner in life I'm physically in just an okay shape if not poor shape and I wish I could do a lot of the things differently and then as soon as that thought creeps into your mind what do you do boom back to Netflix back to watching the TV back to watching your favorite reality show back to calling that best friend that just makes you feel comfortable and feel good and you guys just eat cookies together and you guys just like hang out together and eat ice cream together and both of you try not to remind each other of where were the places where you could have really succeeded and pushed yourself and had that tapped into that potential that you know that you kind of had so again it's important to understand that and not go down that path okay just have always have that in the back of your head and like I say your true friends are not the ones who make you feel comfortable or cuddly or just enjoying yourself those are people you can I mean I honestly hire just hire a therapist or something just pay them hourly to listen to your problems it'll make you feel nice and cushy they'll make you feel cozy you'll be great if you make money you can just hire them that's it that's the type of friends I see a lot of people have just just always trying to make each other feel as comfortable as possible only to then later look back at their life and then regret it I honestly think a true friend is somebody who pushes you and makes you feel uncomfortable not all the time but at times calls you out and it's okay if they make you feel a little uncomfortable but enough to challenge you so you can push yourself forward in in your income in your financial success in your relationships in your you know your body your fitness in your emotional health your mental health whether you do meditation or whatever it is in every aspect of life you should be around people who push you forward and truly care for you that's what it means for somebody to truly care for you like they watch out for you okay so keep that in the back of your mind yeah Netflix Netflix is too expensive for some some of us jaunty so again when you're working on those little apps on the side and you're freelancing you could be making that extra income and then just pay off that Netflix pay off your Hulu subscriptions pay off going to movies pay off those fancy dinner dates pay off your phone bills pay off all these annoying little things that nag at you and even if you you're not ready to make that full jump yet you could be doing this on the side and save yourself time and just be making that extra income to give yourself that breathing
