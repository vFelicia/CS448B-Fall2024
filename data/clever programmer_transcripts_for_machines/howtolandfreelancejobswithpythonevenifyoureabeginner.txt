Frankie I'm going live right now turn off those lights right there please so look at how easy they made it okay you what's up guys how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer dotcom welcome to this epic livestream and in this video we're gonna be talking about how to land freelancing jobs with Python even if you're a complete beginner and actually what I'm gonna be doing and I was talking with my friend Frankie are you guys able to hear me now you guys should be able to hear me now if you can hear me please confirm and if you could please man the chat that would be fantastic so what I wanted to share with you and this is like I want to get real with you in this video I want to get raw with you and I want to show you exactly where to go and how to land clients where to find them what type of jobs to look for in this live stream I'm gonna share you the number one secret pitfall that almost every Python upandcoming developer or anybody who wants to be a freelancer falls into and why they're never make any money and I'll show you specifically what that means and I'll also show you how you can avoid that and actually earn a real income with Python and coding and in this video we're gonna be doing less of talking and I'm gonna be doing more of showing so this means the actual resources that I'm using and the right place to go what type of jobs to look at and where can you actually apply and how much money you can be earning as well I'm also gonna be showing you specifically what type of Python job opportunities exist how much people are paying for them as well as a freelancer because I realized for most of the audience and for most of the people can you use a laptop instead of your phone you don't need an administrator if you can just go live that'd be great just so you can monitor it and see if you can hear it and if people can hear it you know okay alright awesome Thank You G that's my new style you know I got I wanted to go clean No More Homeless anymore alright okay so all right guys let's keep the chat clean guys let's be respectful for everybody that's here we want to make it a high quality live stream for everyone so if you're in the chat and you're acting like an idiot and ruining the experience for everyone who's viewing it we will just kick you out or block you but what I want to do is I want to give you guys massive amounts of value on this live stream all right so it's all for free you're all you're gonna get this value right here right now all right so let's jump right into it with all these things said okay we're gonna get started pretty much right away now what everybody makes it seem like is that getting a freaking job or getting a freelancing opportunity to requires you to have multiple degrees requires you to have years of experience a PhD I don't know what most of these developers say but most of the developers make it seem like rocket science and while there are certain aspects of programming that are actually rocket science specifically if you're working with NASA most things are actually not that hard okay they're a lot easier for you to get started in and especially if you're new you can get started in a lot quicker so I'm gonna show you guys and we're gonna pick things apart live as well okay so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna open up my document and in this document I'm also gonna show you what type of opportunities never to kind of fall for and go after because they're pretty much just traps and I'm gonna show you what things to go after so let's do this we're gonna do this we're gonna send this one over alright so now you guys should be seeing the live stream and or sorry my screen hopefully and a Frank if you can double check that if people are seeing my screen pretty soon that would be great but I'll keep going alright so I want to give you examples of realworld opportunities on a plateau like up work okay so if you guys don't know what up work is you go to Google Chrome comm you type in upwork.com and this is where you can get freelancing jobs all right so you would go to where it says jobs you would type in Python and you would type it in correctly unlike me and depending on different parts of the world you would either hit this off or you would hit this on okay and let's go down and here you would look for opportunities that you could actually do as a Python developer so check this out okay we have bunch of job opportunities here I'm on this live page hopefully everybody can view this I'll zoom in a little bit more now you're gonna look for opportunities you're gonna cancel out a lot of the things you can't do or maybe you don't have the skill set to do and that's fine maybe you look here DJI SDK Raspberry Pi I don't know how to do this I don't know what DJI is like a drone and working with Raspberry Pi I have no experience working with drones or Raspberry Pi so I'll skip this but now let's go down and I'll probably skip lunar and fertility calculator all right might be interesting to read it but I'm gonna skip that because you know also you have to be expert it's probably require some very specific knowledge maybe it's not a good fit let's keep going full sex off for engineers skip skip skip but now let's take a look at this one okay Python scrapey spider to retrieve PDF links we need three Python scrapy spiders to crawl three different domains and return the names and full URLs of all PDF files on the domain we do not need to download the PDFs only create a list of their names and full URLs must be written in Python alright so what is this person actually asking now it might sound like rocket science but all this person is asking is can you write a Python code that can go to all these web sites and literally pull all the URLs that say dot PDF at the end that's it so if you go to website and you see a URL on there that ends in dot html' don't write that one locally but only write a list of ones that end with dot PDF so all this person is asking is hey write a Python piece of code that can pull all the PDF URLs from the three different websites I give you so for example if I gave you clever programmer com your Python script should be able to go all over clever programmer comm and find all of the PDF links if I gave you Apple comm it should be able to go all through Apple comm and find all the PDF links that's it that's it for this job how much are they paying for this particular job they are paying three hundred dollars so let me zoom in just actually zoom out just a little bit right there you can see it's a three hundred dollar job you could actually apply for it right here right now all right and these people are legit look at where it says $30,000 right so you that's that's generally what you want to look at if you're looking to apply for a job you don't necessarily want to apply to just any job right like here it says your dollar spent payment unverified this person could just be lying or this person probably has no record of hiring people so we don't we don't have enough data but somebody who spent thirty thousand dollars paying other people to work with them they're most likely not playing around so if you're working with them you're gonna be at least making three hundred dollars or more for this particular task now if you're somebody who has cool social skills you could get this particular job and you could hand this job off to somebody who knows how to do it so you could hire a developer from somewhere and make sure that they do this project while you just manage them all right so then you can get profit but you don't even necessarily have to be that good at coding so that's an alternative even if you're not that great of a developer if you're a complete beginner but to be honest to do this project if you even have a little bit of skill in Python like let's say you're past the beginner phase or more intermediate like it says this is a project that you could do very realistically okay so that's one example let's go down and see maybe if there are any other examples that we can see right off the bat so okay let's see this one let me go to the chat first and see what's going on what are people saying in the chat how to use Python are we mark okay great awesome can I see your screen hello okay all right whatever so here I am on this page and you can see it says scrape two sites walk me through so now check this out okay this guy goes I know how to do basic scraping with Python and beautifulsoup I want you to show me how to do a couple of trickier sites or best of all show me how to access an API please note I am not paying you to do it for me so this guy's not even he doesn't even need you to do anything for him he just says I'm paying you to show me how to do it you can give me written instructions but I'd prefer a zoom meeting where we can walk through it together so he's even willing to not even meet with you in person or online or on a oneonone call he's even okay with the written instructions and he says these are not workrelated sites that are gathering information for my fantasy baseball team so he literally wants to hire someone to help him do some web scraping with Python and beautifulsoup for his freakin fantasy baseball team and he's verified here and he's paid people over he's paid a total of over $60 so unlike so it's not a scam it's somebody who's real who's spent real money and all he wants is somebody to walk him through so even if you're pretty much a beginner and you just go through a little bit of training with me on Python and beautifulsoup words or web scraping you can actually work with this person and land this person as your client and they'll be paying you 30 or 50 or $60 an hour so you work with this person for three or four hours that's two hundred three hundred dollars right there for you now before I continue further I do want to know if this is valuable for you is this been helpful so far I'm gonna stop my screen share for just a second all right cool hmm so all right now all this stuff that I'm sharing with you guys right over here we created our new program right around this whole thing because what we want to be able to do for you is I want you to be able to go to these exact jobs learn these exact skills and be able to land clients okay because most of the people they have skills but they have random freaking skills right but how cool would it be if somebody literally okay let me go back to that how cool would it be if somebody literally shows you like if I bring you in and I go we're gonna do this exact project this person is asking for then I'm gonna show you how to go to this exact client on upward exactly what to say to this person and then land this person as your client how cool would it be if somebody just went okay hey man you see this project right over here this Python scrapey spider one yeah I'm gonna show you exactly how to make it so we make it somewhere in a program we make this full project and then I show you exactly how to reach out to this client and how to land this client and then how to solve this problem for them that's essentially what I wanted to do in this new program that we have launched and it's called automate with Python like a badass and that program allows you to land freelancing jobs on platforms like upward comm start earning an income even if you're a complete beginner that is the goal but the new program that we just launched let's go through a few more examples okay so I have a few examples and I want also give you examples of what what not to do all right what type of jobs are bad for example so let's take a look at this job the guy says need help building restaurant app now somebody he needs his entry level that's pretty cool and he goes I'm developing an online application for my family's restaurant I'm an IT graduate certified in computer programming and I will be leading the project I'm interested in working with local developers bla bla bla bla bla bla bla I just kind of skipped over it and then he goes when I plan on meeting I would prefer that the developers are present because sometimes I'll be meeting with investors please send me a message your experience dah dah dah dah dah okay let me ask you a question if you're watching this stream drop it in the chat below right now is this a good job opportunity or is this a bad job opportunity this is a good freelancing opportunity or a bad freelancing opportunity and I want you to critically think and tell me why don't just look at my answer right over here at the top but like give me a reason as how you would reason with it and why I'm gonna jump into the chat now and see what you've come up with so tell me what you think about this our be within this is useful okay some people say no what seems says no Ola says lowrate vishal says no calm mel says good and bad both ELISA $0 spent Tanisha says no money spent okay this is really great thank you guys for participating okay I love that thank you so much Abdul Majeed says because your dollar spent this is not good because too many demands and no money spent thus far Eclair okay Siobhan says big nono money spent Akash says title and step description is not good small steps nope no build this out with PHP gonna be in the painintheass Christopher says Robert says $0 spent very vague description bad because too many texts and he seems not reliable no exact income he's fake okay looks like you guys are on the right track so that's fantastic guys by the way thank you for everybody who just spent that much time engaging with it you're much more likely to make way more money than a lot of the people who are on this livestream but not participating I still love you but these are the things that get you to actually understand a lot of these concepts this is what makes the difference between you getting these clients and not getting these clients and wash these clients be taken by somebody else so thank you for that level of initiative that level of participation because it also makes it a lot more fun for me so thank you for that okay so now I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna give you guys my thoughts on it would you guys like to hear my thoughts on this it's a trick question cuz share it anyway alright let's go so go right here okay so here's why I personally say no so first of all I agree with everyone this guy first of all has no ratings so there's zero stars that he has so that's the first flag for me another flag for me that's pretty huge is that he has spent $0 so far but now here's the big red flag for me he sounds like every loser who has an idea for an app and they're gonna be meeting with investors and they're trying to sell you some pipe dream of something that doesn't yet exist he doesn't have a prototype he hasn't built anything yet he says I plan to wrap it up and go native I plan to make this I'm thinking about making this maybe I'll be meeting with investors one day there's nothing yet there are no investors yet this person is an IT graduate certified in computer programming okay he doesn't even have a job so it doesn't mean that his idea doesn't have potential it doesn't mean that this might not be the next Facebook it just mean that the odds of all of that are very low and there's no security or any reliability all of us follow the data you have your life is very important guys your time is very important so going down a rabbit hole like this which a lot of freelancers do you will be so surprised so many freelancers will go down this path and there will be so confused and they didn't get any money this guy's not trying to scam you this is a person with good intentions but you are going to not make any money from this or very little money because this person has no money to give you he's a graduate he doesn't even have a job so we're he's gonna give you money from okay and investors and all that stuff is most likely a pipe dream if you get in any Ober car every bird driver you know what I'm talking about every bird driver has like a freaking app idea right you know like all those people everybody has right and all these people have no record for it for their results like why are you working a $7 an hour job but you have this amazing app idea like you should have you should have had something prior to that right like you should have had maybe a business prior to that you should have some kind of track record right then maybe your idea is more believable people want to get behind it so stay away from this is a trap this type of stuff okay again I'm not saying oh it's a scam or anything but I'm just saying that even though this person has good intentions you want to be really intelligent as a freelancer as a developer so then you that you could get paid what you're worth not be undermined and overworked okay so that is what I would say to that let me go and see what people are saying in the live chat because I want to make sure I engage with with you guys all right of course not zero income bla bla bla bla bla why not okay okay let's see okay what are people saying so no lurking yep yep all right so some people asked in the in some people email me from this livestream and they asked hey is this class so when you join this class guys you have access to when you join automate with Python the new program that we just launched you actually have access to it for a lifetime alright this is not you don't have access to for a little bit so even though it's a module program and we're only gonna add more modules to help you start earning an income because the whole point of the program is to take you from zero to start landing these specific clients I'm showing you an up work we want to make it that braindead simple for you and your return on investment when I make it that brain that simple but yeah so essentially once you join you're gonna have access to it for ever okay it's not like you just and you can take it at your own pace as well so I just wanted to mention that now let me continue and show you guys some other examples so let's go and do this let's go and do this let's go boom alright here's another good here's another job opportunity and you guys judge this and let me know what you guys think so this guy says Python beginner homework help needed hello this is an unconventional post from my company one of our customers need some help for high school homework in Python good English skill is a must can hire immediately so if it were you and let's say you are either a complete beginner or you have just a little bit of skill in Python or whatever the case may be would you take the time to apply to this or not Oh give me yes or no but also give me a critical thinking and your reason behind it okay I'm gonna read everybody's comment in the live stream and then we're gonna go from there so what do you think would you apply to this opportunity or not this was posted one day ago and yeah yep so let's see let's see what you guys say alright let's see what's going on Carla says let's do another example damn Carlos is excited how to write description how to write skill description up work will seem we also show you that in our program how do you write your skill description in up work alright so if those are the questions you want to ask that are very technical everything is covered in the course I would suggest you at least check it out okay alright let's see what's going on thanks for the info Robert says David Roberts and Snagit now ok Python and JavaScript worth more okay so somebody says Christopher says why not cool Mikey says yes seems good for a beginner Dino says you will do something like that for free cuz I can't pay that much no Camila is still suspicious comments all the suspicious gig look suspicious UNK it says knows your star and not challenging Carlos says yes he will do it because it says $600 spent and requires English okay say it says definitely yes came an 1230 says yes payment history is there Loco lightning says maybe only thing does not have much info Shawn says to be honest I won't because he's not specific about the problem Robert says any good reference is a worthwhile investment okay all right I do it if it's an up front or at least secured by third party Bruna says they have no rating that spent 600 I'd go for it okay cool Claire says I would apply alright so let's see here's how I would answer it there's no clear right or wrong answer sometimes there is but I'll just give you my thoughts behind it so you guys can see how I would kind of tackle thinking about this okay all right whoops okay so here's how I would kind of think about this Python beginner homework help needed now if I was in the or position where I was looking for a client and to work with someone and I want to just be able to live my own lifestyle right like I'm living in Hollywood I want to work remotely I want to be able to kind of have my own lifestyle choose my own hours have my own clients kind of earn an income and then choose my ability to hire and fire clients and I saw this now be like hmm skill level can't be that hard it's high school homework I have good English they're looking to hire immediately they are payment verified they have already spent over six hundred dollars for me depends on your interest right if this is genuinely not interesting to you then maybe don't do it I love working with people I love teaching I love explaining things it deepens my knowledge it also I love seeing the transformation that takes place in people and you change the trajectory of their entire life so for me that's what's really powerful and magnetic about this being able to have that opportunity and then privileged and outside of that I'm getting paid for this as well so it's a win on many different spectrums and now if I have another client who I like less I can fire that client or I can choose to up my rates with that client it gives me more options so you want to have your power comes from the number of options you have okay so this is you know if if you're talking about the dating world and if you guys have options of which girl you could hang out with or make her your girlfriend or your wife right you get to choose who you want to be with but if you don't have that option you will go with literally whoever is there available for you sometimes people get into a relationship and stay in that relationship for a long time out of convenience and out of having no options all right so you to always be the person who's in the position where you're choosing from a position of power rather than that of weakness then when you commit to a relationship then you really commit or if you commit to a client then you really commit so in this case I would say this would be a yes okay this is a great opportunity all right let's see what people have said before I continue any further let's go right there throw my face back on go here bada BAM bada boom let's see what people are saying all right paying well okay cool David is down for it say is genuine client Geetha's yes it is good for Python beginners Claire says yes I would also enjoy teaching explaining concept which eventually resonates with the student awesome Carlos says power choices comes from a mind set up of abundance exactly okay cool so all right cool okay hopefully I think hopefully for you guys this has been valuable so far this was something new that I wanted to do I'd never done this before I wanted to give it a try and see how you guys like it to be honest this is super if I was in that position this would have been massively valuable for me that's why I shared it because if I was back in the day where I was looking for clients and wanted to know how I could do it I would love to be able to just see exactly what I need to do okay so again if you guys are here and interested in all this stuff so far I'm gonna talk about how to automate with Python like a badass our brand new program that we just launched me and my entire team we worked on it and in that program we literally take these types of jobs from up work we complete them as projects that you can have on your portfolio and then we show you how you can go to these clients on up work how do you build a profile how do you go and reach out to these clients and how do you land these types of clients for these exact jobs so we don't want to just teach you random automation stuff that you can find on udemy.com or you can find on you know YouTube anywhere we want to give you the real stuff that you can actually apply in real life and actually get results and go to these practical jobs and get them done so we wanted to keep it as real world as practical as possible for you that's why I wanted to do this live stream and share with you everything live so you could see how this works okay this is why I believe it's so important to be just transparent and authentic with you guys in raw and instead of making some fancy video and sharing this with you guys I just wanted to share this with you one on one just me and you okay hopefully you found this valuable if you are interested in this definitely click the link in the description for the automate with Python like a badass course and at the very least just check it out we have an amazing video there for you to see you can also learn more about the program and see if it's a good fit for you if it's not you don't need to join it if it seems like a good fit for you you're interested in working as a remote developer kind of having your own lifestyle working as a freelancer and just becoming a badass at Python in general then definitely go check out this program we'll show you how to crush it as a Python freelancer in 2019 and beyond thank you guys so much for being here I love your face and as always I'm gonna see you in the next video
