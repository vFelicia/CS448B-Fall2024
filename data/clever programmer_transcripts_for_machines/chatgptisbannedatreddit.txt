I know it's not clickbait I just got off the phone with a senior engineer at Reddit has 15 years of experience and he just told me that they are not allowed to use Chad GPT at their company blew my mind too I know and he informed me that that's not just the case with Reddit that's the case with a lot of Fortune 500 companies a lot of the big tech companies you know what they're scared of their code being leaked rightfully so a lot of companies that's happening to or their code gets leaked it happened to Microsoft recently and a bunch of other companies where their code gets leaked and it's a big massive problem that they have to deal with but still there's something that seems so wrong and stupid with it that it's it's nuts when he told me that my mind blew up it's like in the early days when internet got started people were probably thinking oh we shouldn't get out this thing there's this thing called viruses and because we just do everything locally and we don't use internet we're good we don't have to worry about anything and then what happened those companies became dinosaurs and then a lot of those companies ended up dying or they weren't able to expand their business as quickly as all these other companies that could use internet so if you're one of these Fortune 500 companies watching this video what is wrong with you Ai and things like Chad GPT or llms large language models all of these things that assist us humans in doing things faster better smarter and for cheaper doesn't it feel like you're putting your company in the stone ages that's what what it feels like to me it literally feels like if you are doing this and you're stuck doing this you're putting your company in stone ages because compare that to a team where they have the same number of employees as you so let's say you got a you got a 100 people on your team or a thousand people at your organization another company has a thousand people but your a thousand people are not allowed to use CH GPT so they're stuck with their human skills right the other team has a th000 people that are allowed to use Chad GPT I swear those thousand people will be operating like 10,000 or 15,000 people that's that that's what the equivalent would be if not more I know this because I hired a lot of software Developers for myself and I would pay them I don't know 20 to $60,000 per month cuz I had a team of developers and they were developing software for me and my company clever programmer and that's what I paid them and then Chad GPT came along and I was able to build the same app that I would have paid them 60 Grand over a 3month period by myself alone in about 2030 days so I did it three times as quickly and I saved $60,000 and that's just me as a one human imagine expand that out to thousands of people thousands of developers and you're talking about 600,000 $6 million $60 million saved or value produced however you want to look at it and that starts to be undeniable and so if you're a company that's doing this you're in the stone ages and for you developers who who watch this and you're like oh my God now I'm scared I should not use CH gbt because big companies don't allow it here's something crazy that happened so in my community for my course that I launched it's called profit with AI and Chad GPT where I show people how you can use Chad GPT AI make money with it uh I have a student in the community and he said the same thing is happening at his company they're not allowing to them to use Chad GPT so what he told us in our group chat and WhatsApp group that we have for the community he said what we do is we run to our car we brings bring our phones with us and we use Chad GPT in the car we solve our coding problems we figure out what the solution is and then we run back into the company and then we go ahead and uh solve the problem right write the code that way the company can't track that they use Chad GPT so a lot of these dinosaur people you know and then there's going to be elitist software developers as well that are going to be like don't use it it's because they're trying to gatekeep because they're scared shitless their little 60 years of experience is now being threatened and like I know it sounds insensitive if you are the person with six years of experience so I apologize but here's the thing okay let me say it with a lot of care and love I care about you and I want you to win and if you keep fighting it what's going to happen is you're going to get left in the past because that's what happened with anybody that fought technology or revolutions or changes they got overthrown they got killed their jobs got taken away their profit margins went away so please don't try to fight it use it it's your friend so what I would recommend to you is you you're in a great position if you have experience use that with AI and Chad GPT you'll go so much farther you'll become so much more valuable and instead of it replacing you you become a replaceable so please focus on that instead don't focus on I want to fight this technology and stop it from becoming a thing because you're not going to be able to do it and all these companies that are trying to do it or worried about their code leaking or whatnot just make your security better you know or get on I know you can't trust this company's taking so much data this company's taking so much data everything runs on data I'm thankful Google has my data so I don't have to type in my freaking address every single time I look at Coffee near me don't fight this revolution be a part of this start learning how to use AI start learning how to use chat GPT that's my personal recommendation to you if you're a developer boost up your skills you know there's so much that you could do I mean it's unbelievable I have students in my course right now who I have a 60yearold who's like I tried so many ways of making apps and he goes now with Chad GPT I'm making these apps and I just made my first app in like 10 5 to 10 minutes and he's like I'm so excited I can't sleep and that's the experience I want you to have even if you're new to coding before I used to say the number one programming language was JavaScript now I'm going to make a video on this too the number one programming language is English or whatever your language of choices as long as you can articulate what you want you can turn it into reality it'll it'll turn it into reality and you still have to know coding and you still have to cons get the know the concepts because you C you won't even know where to copy paste it to run the code if you don't know know anything about coding you know I've gotten that question at one point I was somebody was like Hey KY where do I even paste this code to make it work and I'm like okay you're going to need to know a little bit of coding so you still need to know coding it's not like you just skip coding but what I mean is you have just sit there and write every single thing like now when I code I'm basically coding like a senior developer who has like 20 Junior developers and I'm just looking over their shoulder and giving them each tasks to do they bring it to me and I tell them if something's wrong with their code or not that's what I do with Chad GPT I just go give me a modal that has this button here give me a popover thing when you go on the tool tip give me this and this give me a cart that can when user clicks it it adds it to the cart and then user should be able to check it out so I give it all of those things that I know how to code but it take me 20 30 hours of my time and Chad JP does it and then I paste the code and I see an error and I'm like give it back and I'm like you know what you missed this add this and they'll you know and this and this and then we'll fix it and then it fixes it gives it back to me and I'm like this is good thank you and then I move on so I'm I'm operating like where I have 5 to 10 engineers and my staff Junior engineers and I can work with them now imagine when Chad gbt 5 comes out or Chad gbt 6 comes out now you got senior Engineers pretty much right they they won't even make a mistake when you ask them what to do so use it build stuff with it if you want to learn how to use it and make money with it and build your own apps with it or land your dream job and make six figures or you want to make um you know you just want to improve your career whatever it is I built a course exactly on this and we're teaching you practical skills so if you're a theoretician watch somebody else's videos that nerds out on llms I want to use this technology to build real world that I can use that companies can pay me for that I can go and freelance with and that's the community that I'm building a practical Builders with AI and chat GPT so that's what the course is about if you're interested click the link below and go and join it I'm still building out more of this course so if you join it now it's in preorder so you'll get the best price but the price will keep increasing and after this um Q4 meaning start of the next year the price will have increased almost by double the amount so if you're interested and you want to join or you're very you're even slightly curious click the link below go and check out the course called profit with the I chat GPT and I'm going to teach you the skills even if you're a beginner to learn Chad GPT to learn Ai and be able to even monetize in the first 8 weeks and we have students doing just that so regardless of whether you join the course or not understand that chip is inevitable understand that AI is inevitable utilize it please use it so you become more valuable and you become Irreplaceable I love you let me know what you think like the video and I'll see you in the next video peace
