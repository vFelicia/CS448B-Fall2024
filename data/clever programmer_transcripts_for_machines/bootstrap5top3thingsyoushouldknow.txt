grammar.com today i am here with your boy sonny how's it going guys you guys already know we're here with the react god himself and guys today we're gonna be talking about what sonny we're talking about bootstrap and in particular guys bootstrap five so if you guys know what that is drop some knowledge in the comments and let us know if you're excited about that yeah this is probably one of the most exciting hottest topics that people are talking about right now when it comes to programming and we're pumped because we're going to be covering this exact thing today and a lot of companies are actually looking to learn this now before we continue and we continue talking about bootstrap 5 and what you guys are going to be learning i just want to let you guys know that we actually have a special guest on here with us today and the reason why we're bringing on this guest is he has a lot of knowledge on bootstrap 5 he's used it for many of his projects so he'll be able to add a lot of extra insight and value that maybe even sunny or i could add on the stream he's our student in our course profit with javascript and his work ethic is absolutely been amazing since the time he's joined right sunny like this guy has never let up like most people kind of gas out and they fall off rishi's been killing it from day one guys he's also a success coach so rishi is actually a huge part of the javascript community in profit with javascript so he's absolutely smashing it absolutely smashing it you guys so super pumped to bring him on if you guys are excited guys freaking stand up proverbially on your feet drop it in the comments below that you are excited to see rishi because i sure as hell know that i am because every day i work with this guy i'm excited to see him i'm gonna drop some applause hey let's go so let's bring on rishi right now what is up rishi how are you doing hey what's up guys i hope you guys are doing amazing and i'm so happy to talk about bootstrap i have been working with bootstrap for a long time and probably i have built all my websites with bootstrap so i'm so happy and so excited to talk about bootstrap how are you guys doing that is amazing bro freaking pumped to have you on here and um i mean with that said let's just kind of jump into what you guys came in here for what do you guys say let's do it bro let's jump straight in all right so let's learn bootstrap guys and let's see what's going on with this whole world of bootstrap and uh son you want to talk about this yep so guys major companies are using bootstrap right now we've got instagram linkedin twitter so interesting story that rishi actually told me earlier what's the interesting story hiroshi with twitter so the exemployee of the twitter created bootstrap and the name of bootstrap in previous days was twitter blueprint and that's super interesting yeah so this was an exemployee from twitter themselves actually went ahead and created this and then they actually went ahead and used it so that's awesome to know spotify lyft tinder all these massive companies are using bootstrap right now so massive value in learning and understanding how bootstrap works seriously massive value and a lot of these like instagram is using it linkedin is using it i mean even lyft and tinder are using bootstrap so that's kind of crazy it just shows you i think it's the most one of the most popular libraries right for front end like or maybe even the most yeah especially when you're beginning guys especially when you're just starting off in your development journey bootstrap is a massive tool like especially when you're landing clients you're doing your first bit of work i would definitely recommend jumping into bootstrap because when you start developing your websites don't look that great they look kind of like boring using bootstrap is immediately going to give you that nice looking website so um what's your thoughts on that rishi yeah i think bootstrap is one of the most popular css framework and it's it's got like high popularity and it's like easy to use even though big companies they have like this great developer still uses bootstrap so i think it's the most convenient and the most popular framework out there yes awesome we have a lot of people coming in to the stream and they are pretty pumped about this excited to have you guys even elijah who joined profitable shortcut yesterday i spoke with him and he's on the stream so elijah welcome here now let's talk about what is bootstrap and bootstrap basically allows you to build fast responsive sites and you guys can do this with bootstrap now it is opinionated and it kind of has its own way of allowing you to do things but with bootstrap 5 they've kind of opened it up and made it a lot of plu easier to plug and play with a lot of things right sunny yeah yeah exactly and guys the aim of using bootstrap is to get something what we like to call a mobile first design right so mobile first which means that it's going to work on a mobile and then it goes upward so it's going to work on a mobile it's going to work on a tablet it's going to work on a desktop so regardless of what screen you're on that's what we're using bootstrap for to achieve that sort of design and that look and feel regardless of what device you're using yep yeah and just to add to that like i mean bootstrap is super responsive and it's like the grid system and everything is so powerful and that is the reason people like use this bootstrap because it's super super easy to like make responsive websites with bootstrap even though you don't have different knowledge about media queries in css right so that is the reason like most of the people use as bootstrap nice nice that is amazing now let's go and talk about the features of bootstrap so one thing is it's very easy to use uh it is mobile friendly and then what are you thinking about the customizable bootstrap sonny so customizable guys it's massively customizable you have a number of different templates that you can actually go ahead and use so these are they range from a bunch of free templates you can use also premium and guys it's open source which means it's actually massive the even the code itself you can contribute to so bootstrap is customizable like enough on its own but if you want to go ahead and add features to it you can even do that because it's open source so we have that so it's customizable and it's also super simple to integrate um rishi have you worked with prestyled components and the responsive features like the grid you mentioned yeah so for sure like it's uh it's super easy to integrate the docs are super easy the installation is super easy and the prestyled components they are like super easy like if even if you want to use button even if you want to use grid or flex work or even if you want to use card it's super easy you just go to docs and there is the whole code for code for cards and you just copy and paste and it's super easy to implement you want the component so there are different kinds of components and like you were saying even sunny when we were talking earlier it's super responsive it has a lot of browser compatibility but there's one browser that they're actually not going to be using moving forward if you guys want to take a guess if you guys want to take a guess at which browser they're not going to be using drop it in the comments below we're going to cover that in a second and then they have a great great grid system which uh which actually surprised me when we were speaking earlier on zoom sunny you were like their grid system is actually faster than the uh fl the grid system that you just use with css yeah so honestly guys and this is coming from a professional sort of standpoint like when you're yes you can code extremely beautiful websites with flexbox and grid css grid like we do on the live builds but sometimes when you have freelance clients you have a bunch of jobs lined up you need speed you need like something which is fast something which is robust in this case bootstrap is your answer so if you have a lot of jobs on the go i would really recommend jumping over to bootstrap and and using it as your sort of point to go to instead of doing everything custom and bespoke really really good place to start off a bootstrap also guys like as you mentioned browser compatibility this is actually really important point because they dropped one of the uh browsers which a lot of people don't like so i can see a lot of people dropping it in and i think we've got some correct answers right hey nice let me see if i can actually uh show those answers on the screen that people are guessing so i'm gonna show some of those by ram komar he says internet explorer we have people saying edge people saying different things we're going to reveal that to you guys in just a second and uh yeah guys this is actually a blog post that i think is a good resource i'm gonna drop it in chat for you guys you guys can actually even go to it and if you're watching this video we're gonna cover this in just a second you can even just type in the url that you see at the top here but this is bootstrap 5 alpha so it's not like the uh most stable version yet it's the alpha version but it is out as of june 16th and this is their blog post that they posted and they talk about like how now it has a new look and feel which we will be talking a lot about for example uh everything is flat now right sunny you said that yeah so previously and a lot of designs especially when now like i started off it was very rounded guys like like even when you're using your iphone back in the day you had like a very rounded button 3d sort of design whereas now if you notice material ui bootstrap all of them follow this really flat clean looking design so they've gone ahead and updated all of that in bootstrap five and just to touch on the alpha point that kazi mentioned in case you're wondering what alpha is it's when they release something which is in like it's sort of development stage right so just to give you guys some context to that i actually started using firebase uh the realtime database when it was in alpha right so just to let you guys know so if if i used it when it was in alpha and i'm still using it now it's it's actually pretty safe to go ahead and do that right so it's pretty good safe and then when it moves to beta you pretty much rest assured that it's going to go forward so definitely worth reading this blog and checking out definitely and now if we go down they change their logo this is a pretty cool logo i think that they actually have we're going to talk about what new things are happening with jquery and javascript and how they decided not to use any more jquery moving forward we're going to touch base on the css custom properties you guys that they added in so it's kind of really cool you can basically use your own variables we're going to touch a little bit based on their docs the fact that they expanded their colors overall and even how their forms now have kind of a different feel to it and they're much more customizable than before um and the fact that they have enhanced grid system so this is actually a really cool thing because if you're using previous bootstrap like bootstrap 4 you can actually move on to bootstrap 5 in a really easy transition so it's not like everybody who's using bootstrap 5 bootstrap 4 is now screwed you can actually just really easily move into bootstrap 5. yeah exactly yep so let's go back to the slides here and i'm going to pop them open and now we're going to go on here and start talking and sunny go ahead take it away my man and sonny you want to center yourself a little bit more because sometimes you're not there we go that's good it's good yeah pretty good awesome nice so uh guys here's a quick overview of what happened in bootstrap five and then we'll touch base on every single point so jquery was removed massive decision guys massive decision yeah and it goes to show you that i see a lot of comments when we're doing these live builds of uh people even we got one back now by ao nahin who says do we need to learn jquery so guys bootstrap's massively used a framework and here's your answer if they're removing it take this is some a vote of confidence you don't actually need to learn jquery anymore future code just drop rip jquery yeah so pretty much jquery is now is old news guys we don't use it they've switched over to pure javascript which means faster websites responsive font sizes is huge so let's go ahead and actually jump into the next slides we'll touch base on each of these individually i think that'll be a bit more easier so guys response font sizes deck uh the remove card decks they switch to vanilla javascript uh dropped ie support and yeah let's keep going and we're gonna go through each of these yeah so jquery was removed we've touched base on this and basically what does this mean it means that they're using vanilla javascript now um which i think we mentioned on the next slide and basically what that means guys is it's super performant so vanilla javascript is the fastest we're going to get it's like a bare bone to javascript so they've managed to get everything down to being perfected no libraries no like extra code just hanging around because jquery is a massive library and slows down your code over time and just having that dependency like there's no really real reason to have it if you don't need it exactly and uh with this uh with this said that that's pretty much gonna allow us to have those that responsiveness and that speed that we're sort of uh looking for when we're building sites and then the next thing guys responsive font sizes so this is huge this is really really important because even if you see in our live builds when we're actually building stuff we don't actually use responsive fun uh pixels which we like you could use different sort of numbers i think you can use rem which is a responsive unit but in in bootstrap you don't have to worry about any of that you just use the response just one thing here's a good thing erican asks and he says how do you use bootstrap in react is it only for blah blah you there's actually a library called react bootstrap and it's built for use with react so that's actually a great thing that you guys can actually use really good question that is because i've used that personally uh being the big fan of react i am so you guys can definitely go check that out we touch base on that later on in the slide so you guys can check out the link and we'll have a link for that by the way we are at over 400 people watching live that is amazing you guys that's like if we had like a little stadium that place would be booked or if it was like a you know like a hilton hotel and you have those conference rooms it would be packed so thank you guys for being here we're so pumped what can they do sunny to help us out a little bit with this video all we ask guys is that you smash that thumbs up button to get that video as many people as you possibly can and if you have friends if you have a mobile device literally switch on put the video on let's get that number up to 500 guys yeah because guys it we spent a lot of time preparing these for you guys always and our number one goal is for the video to just go out to as many people as possible and for as many people to get value from it as possible you know if somebody's a developer they're on their lunch break we want them to be able to watch it and maybe just get one little tip and now they can either get their salary boosted or they can be seen as more valuable to the team because they'll learn about bootstrap 5 something they didn't know about and we can all be a part of that and actually get it to that person and help them out with their careers by just hitting that thumbs up button because it just gives it so much more reach it's kind of like the youtube algorithm is broken so by just doing that help out that would help us so much and with that said guys let's keep going nice the next i think guys yep oh sorry going richie yeah sorry so i think yeah the responsive uh font sizes are one of the most important thing because like you and i was working with like bootstrap and when you like make a website responsive it's easy to do that with bootstrap but again then you have to go through when you have to design for mobile you have to make those font sizes smaller and it's just like you know it's just not the right way to approach but this is like massive and i'm like super excited for this yeah so it's big big addition to uh to bootstrap five massive guys the next thing drop they drop by the way internet explorer yeah uh what i just one interesting thing so randeep says you should do a live show as soon as it's allowed i would attend 100 so i actually do want to let all of you guys know we're getting this like sick ass place uh in beverly hills and it's going to be like a clever programmer mansion and from there we're going to be doing these live streams every single day and we're also thinking to actually host live shows there for very few people that can come in just because of kovid so we would want like only like five people or seven people max so if that's something you guys are interested in do dm me on instagram and we can have a conversation about it yeah all right moving on to the next thing so sunny go for it man take it away yeah so next guys they did a massive decision here which i love they dropped internet explorer so heartbreaking yeah dude like much needed needed to die so long ago i promise you that the amount of times everything would work on chrome on firefox but internet explorer 10 and 11 would just give me such a pain in the arsenal like i'm so happy they did that so now they can focus on the actual browsers that we care about and edge as well is pretty decent so they got rid of that so now that they can optimize it and that also means that css variables now work which is why they got rid of that that is beautiful and just a friendly little reminder for everybody just go ahead and uh smash that like button nice [Laughter] nice so the next two things um we actually can sort of jump through these ones so we've got the svg icons right they added a huge s nice for you guys who don't know what svgs are they're kind of like so imagine we had an icon svgs mean that they are like a vector icon so no matter how much i stretch that thing make it like higher seriously like you guys it that's so important you guys what he's saying and i just kind of want to just jump in and emphasize it so much more like i want to scream about this because if you get pngs and jpegs and when i'm doing a lot of photoshop stuff or even frontend design it's so frustrating to you constantly get these images that when they're like dragged a certain way or they're like distorted a certain way to start to get very like squeeze it like they're like all screwed up like this or very squished or they're with and then we have to do things like object fit contain and do a lot of like jiggery pokery to make it work but svgs are just vectors you could literally pull it maximize it to infinite length like literally make it like 10 000 pixels you know and then boom it's perfect and if you make it tiny it's still like perfect exactly so really really massive use cases for the svgs guys and they're just crystal clear as well they make your website look so nice um and then what's the deal with custom css variables yeah so this came in because they dropped internet explorer 10 and 11 so they were finally able to bring these in custom css variables are awesome because oh hey nice we just got sb's five dollar donation and uh sb's go ahead sonny nice yeah so we um oh fuzzy thank you and we just hit 500 guys and he says i'm not sure if you saw my comment but your videos help me solidify what i'm learning in my boot camp right now thank you so much react is hard love that hey i hope we're making it a little easier with the live builds that is amazing thank you guys thank you so much like seriously appreciate that that's like such a big vote of confidence thank you yeah massively appreciate that um yeah so guys the css variables pretty much just how we have variables in javascript now we have them in css so let's say you had background color you can assign it to a css variable and just use that variable throughout your app rather oh nice that's actually really cool exactly so imagine you had like background color and then yep you could pretty much just go ahead and i think the way you would use it is you write var or like it's like dash dash var and you can pretty much open so dash var and i think you just do it like that or something along those lines and we pretty much can use that variable throughout the project which means if we ever change the background color it will change everywhere we use the variable beautiful that is beautiful so just one variable uh and then you just that's awesome it's like constants right you we have them at the top of the file and then you change it everything changes exactly that is super useful that is super i think we should use that maybe in the next few builds maybe we'll we'll definitely chuck then or something yeah nice akuma's deception says i have an interview coming up with ibm i wanted to thank you guys for helping me throughout my journey wish me luck oh nice that's awesome dude well done ibm's a pretty decent company that's pretty that's nice let us know how that goes that decent company it's massive yo freaking amazing so pumped for you and good luck on this interview you're gonna crush it just go in with confidence one thing i like to say is when you're in the interview just think everything you're saying is just gold that's not the time to be skeptical and doubt yourself you can doubt yourself after and before but during it just everything that's coming out of your mouth is gold trust me on it it's gonna help you so much exactly game face when you walk into that room all right extensive color palette rishi what the hell is going on here man what am i looking at i think this was like so much needed like bootstrap has just few colors and like you know it was like really decent colors but like you know this was much needed like they extended their color palette and now you have a lot of options to choose from and i think this is a great addition to bootstrap so i'm super excited about this because like now you have a bunch of options to select with so i think the the reason to extend uh the color palette is amazing nice i agree with that the color palette was pretty boring before they added this so like really really nice to see that they've extended that out awesome yep yep that is awesome okay cool so yeah we want to definitely have some nicer colors now bootstrap svg icons we touched on it but this is what the library will look like for you guys when you're there in their documentation and you'll be able to pull it out now sunny just a question curiosity why would i use bootstrap icons instead of font awesome so good question so imagine you're using bootstrap to handle all the layout and everything keep it consistent like if you if you're already pulling in bootstrap from the cdn which means like how it's basically how you import bootstrap into your project you want to make sure you're not pulling in extra stuff so imagine you pulled in bootstrap to do your layout and then you handled uh font awesome as well you've now got two massive modules that you're kind of pulling into your project keep it all in one everything is included in bootstrap and also i think bootstrap have optimized quite well now um with the latest bootstrap 5 uh update because like i said they stripped out all the jquery so i think it would be a good good use case to actually go ahead and use the bootstrap icons instead awesome yeah i think and one of the yeah i think one of the most important reasons now to use bootstrap icons is like font awesome is launching font awesome six and then i'm pretty excited about both of this competing together and one of the most important thing is now with this like you know font awesome is little bit complicated to use now you have to create a key for you and then you they send you the kid in the email and then you use it and it's just kind of complicated but like when you use bootstrap it's super easy to use right so i was i'm super pumped about this so let's see like how it goes with font awesome and bootstrap got it hear you on that random 10 says i have experience in web development already and i have seen and subscribed to many dev channels but you guys are the best i discovered your channel just at the right time thank you thank you so much all right let's keep the value rocking and rolling you guys so now one thing that's really powerful is existing bootstrap themes so if you guys are working on projects and you want to build something just skip the work of having to do the whole thing and actually just get to the theme so here's an example of a theme right if you are trying to build an app and maybe you're trying to build a custom relationship management system or you're trying to build a system a dashboard that is showing people's weekly sales total orders and kind of this type of thing it's much better to just use a theme that already they have done all the hard work for you instead of you building it from scratch imagine how much time that would save you and then you can possibly be going on to another client instead of spending three months building out the front end what are your thoughts on it sonny 100 dude so imagine guys like every single time you landed a client you had to spend like a four hour live session just getting the front end to look somewhat close to this right but you could skip all of that just by using the theme right and then you can reuse the theme change up the colors change up the way that things are laid out for different clients and you can pretty much have a reusable way of landing and finishing a lot of clients work now this is a really repeatable approach that i would recommend that everyone goes ahead and uses and guys also these are the people that build these teams are like frontend geniuses so they they account for all of the standards like you can see the drop shadows here are perfect they've got the cards looking really crisp that stuff is exactly things which we typically would overlook but it's really something that they're going to dial in and nail it so yeah um srindi asks hey guys can we use these icons on our clones like youtube spotify instead of material ui and the answer is that yes you can you can definitely use uh these icons these themes that's totally fine we still prefer material ui design just because it's easier less opinionated but there's no reason why if you want to use bootstrap 5 you can't and get the library uh react bootstrap and then follow the documentation there because that's going to make it a lot easier for you to plug and play bootstrap into your react app exactly definitely yeah and i think like the bootstrap teams like you can find out like a lot of teams it's not just limited teams there are like a lot of teams and it's not even expensive like if you land that line you just buy that team and it's not even expensive exactly you make your money back so damn fast yeah and um we also want to show you guys some of these where some demos of working bootstrap five so you guys can actually go to this link here i'll try to drop it in the chat as well but this is a link you guys can try to find just in the url and you can even just go to the documentation page if my youtube is gonna work fast enough man we gotta get a better and much faster computer because my computer is just maxing out with all of this stuff on it um so let's go back cool yep all right so right here so but the documentation guys it makes it a lot easier for you to understand i mean this is pretty much like how bootstrap 4 you you know you would write the code for popping up your buttons and then they'll like just pop up right here you guys can take a look at them i think what are some other things that are important to show them should we show them card drop downs models so a module guys is where we have a popup that appears on the screen now typically when you code a modal you gotta account for a lot of headaches what happens when they click outside the mode what happens when they click cancel button this or the the proceed to next button so these are all things that you need to account for so let's go ahead and show them a demo of the model that you get inside a bootstrap and it's really clean i've actually used it for production app before um so you can go ahead and click launch demo mode and you can see it look at that super nice and you even get an animation of it sliding in and out and i can click out of it and the code is just right here right and if you guys want to play around with it on your own you guys could actually go to codepen and then just copy and paste that code and it will like just work for you right yeah exactly and then it should just run it all for you provided you pull in the right css right just make sure that you link the css file and then once you do that which we can pull like maybe rishi you can link me to css and i can just drop that in and then it'll look great but without the css is going to look like crap but once the css file is there it's going to work but you guys can use this resource code pen and that should make your life a lot easier as well just wanted to highlight remember the dashboard that we showed a second ago let's hop over to that dashboard for a second all right let me go to this one right here we go yep so guys i just want to pay attention so there's a little mobile icon at the top which shows a preview of what it looks like in the mobile massive massive uh show of the responsive functionality when you're using bootstrap so that's something which comes straight out the box you get that out when using bootstrap and it's huge like even the slideout bar oh everything damn you can't even make it dark mode yeah really nice right damn that is slick that is really slick yeah and if you land that to a client guys and say like here's your project done they'll be like wow okay this guy like spent a long time he done everything he'd done it all crystal clear the client just cares about the finished product it doesn't matter how you get there as long as it's answering everything that they need and it's a quality product so oh damn that looks nice these guys went ham with the front end and like this is so good even the demos jacked the demo is too good wow yeah a lot of people would just pay for this and get it like i would honestly pay for and get it yeah this looks cleaner than the stripe dashboard oh yeah easily easily this is amazing uh so somebody's saying hey can you also talk about the drop down nav bar and things like that so let's talk about let's go into the nav bar as well that's a good point actually yeah so i've coded an app bar a responsive one from scratch it can be a headache guys like and what we mean by this is like you know when you sort of shrink your page and you get that little sandwich bar icon yeah so i think i think it might be in this case they might be supporting it here so if we go down and check that oh nice yep yeah guys if you code that manually it's actually quite a little challenge to get that working so save yourself some hassle use something like um uh bootstrap to go ahead and fix that problem for yourself that is beautiful yeah that is awesome there are different kinds of navigation bar options so if you just scroll down close it like you can find out there are different kinds of options that you want you may want to use right for navigation bar different patterns different colors yep yeah true guys i just want to shout out i saw a few people wondering what the um that that theme sort of cost like guys how much let us know in the comments how much do you think that theme that we cause you just showed you cost so like that's like a full app theme can i take a guess too can rishi take a guess too yeah i feel like it's gonna be 50 bucks something like that okay yeah yeah i think it's not gonna be expensive it's gonna be like around 50 60 yeah that's what i'm guessing so 49 guys nice 49 to get a production now imagine you land a client for 500 dollars guys 49 take a cut of that you still got 450 profit and they've saved you how much of that work so really really something to consider when you're trying to grow your business yep priya says to be honest a day before yesterday one of my friends suggested your youtube channel oh my god right now i feel very thankful for him and no words to describe about you guys you guys are rocking damn that is awesome thank you thank you and and to be honest like i have seen like on upwork and freelancer.com i have seen like clients who wanted to build like an admin panel like this and they pay like 500 bucks right and all you need to do is like just buy this for 50 bucks and just connect the back end with front and there you go like you don't even need to spend a lot of time and you make 500 right you just find 15 you make 500. and elijah says 49 for that is a steal considering it would take me hours so now imagine if you guys had to develop your own theme of this caliber i mean this is easily two to four hundred hours of work and assuming you're actually good at what you're doing and that's when you would actually get something like this so now just do the math right so let's put in let's say 300 hours of work at let's just say you say your rate is worth 30 dollars an hour uh yeah you know the the the time value of this is really nine thousand dollars yeah so much better to get something up and running and then your clients will be blown away as well guys don't spam in the chat you're gonna get blocked so for example heman just spammed in the chat he's gonna get blocked but uh you know i see the positive comments you guys have coming in so keep the positivity going guys and just let's keep the quality of the chat really clean amazing awesome uh frankie i need your help with the chat because some people are going crazy all right beautiful so let's keep it rocking and rolling so themes are amazing use them abuse them and um leverage them and they're going to help you get a lot of clients and make a lot of money fast so yeah now why use bootstrap tell me about it guys yeah so it's super easy to get started i think we literally just uh copy in the cdn imports right rishi inside of our html file that's it and that's literally it you pull it in that simply and then you can pretty much start using it straight away so it's even quicker than how we would do and if you're using react it's literally npm install react bootstrap and you pretty much have the module inside and everything works from there the documentation is amazing so we just showed you a demo of how you can have a lot of those demos you can actually see they've got the example code most of the time when i was using it i'll just check out the dum the example code and just change it for what i needed it for and that's it like you don't need to kind of dive in a bit further than that you can start they've got styling components um for pretty much everything you need so they have nav bars models buttons everything that you're going to find in a use case for including forms they're going to have that support so something to definitely go ahead and i think that's really simply um enough to just show you why you would go ahead and use it as opposed to not using it and this is pretty much how simple it is to get started on it right that's what you were talking about exactly yeah so if you're using mpm it's npm install bootstrap and on the next slide we actually show you the uh how you can just do a cdn import so just those four lines of code and you've got the css and the javascript yep that's it and it allows you to so like here are the top reasons to be using bootstrap you guys if you guys want to write it down or mentally remember it it's all good but one of the biggest reasons why you guys want to be using bootstrap is actually because you can actually build sites fast so that rapid development can actually be very powerful for you guys so here you know you can build and and you can build responsive sites fast so you know whether it's mobile um you want to go mobile like it's going to be mobile responsive it's going to look good on an ipad it's going to look good on an iphone or an android or your imac or your windows computer browser compatibility is going to be there minus of course um internet explorer 10 or internet explorer 11. yep and then um the turnaround time is fast right so what does that mean for your bank sonny so guys let's say you have five clients right you have five people that want websites built for you one wants a dashboard one more portfolio one on some other website like you've got you've got a bunch of work on your hands now you could either sit there and spend time doing flexbox doing all that stuff or you could use bootstrap pump out these uh these apps very quickly and as we say on the last point with the premium templates available it makes that very easy like we just showed to do that now if that means that you can take on five clients very quick in a month you might be able to increase the number of clients you're handling a month which means that more money goes into your pocket right and also guys just remember once you buy a premium template you can reuse that template there's nothing saying that you can't right you can go ahead and reuse it and then you can make more money from it so it's like an investment it's an investment in yourself when you buy that template think of it that way and it makes the decision super simple yep dev zio says i pay 100 for 400 of work off that so that's a good way to think about using bootstrap or using themes inside of bootstrap you know you it's a good deal for you if you can make things fast for me speed really matters and yeah but you can be moving on to the second or third client instead of just slaving over one thing for a really long time so i think that's super important and this is one of the use cases we showed you guys of it and then here are some blog examples of how you can actually be using it so here is a good blog by it's called milo and uh do we actually is this a link sunny yeah it's clickable okay so let's actually click it and uh let's see maybe we can drop it in chat below as well dang that chat is super slow youtube needs to work on their chat it's so poor like the experience of writing in there whereas twitch is just so damn fast so fast but uh here is an example i dropped in the chat below too you guys can actually check it out and what it looks like and i think it's pretty good it's showing you like you know here's the three column one and i think you should be able to click it and see how three columns work yeah and it's and it's very easy to do things into two columns or three columns right sunny with this and full widths super easy super easy so you see when you buy these templates they give you a bunch of different variations and demos for those variations with the code and everything alongside it so to get something looking the way you want it it's very very easy using the demos that they give you so definitely go check them out guys and it's just quite fun as well to go around and play with the templates just to see yeah yep and uh damn you guys thank you so

we're gonna carry on it's gonna be rishi and i taking it over but this is the course that he's gonna be running a live call for profit with javascript and if you guys want to learn from sunny and you want to develop your react skills or javascript skills you're going to get weekly calls with sunny you're going to get weekly calls with nas a live calls actually and also guys you're going to be getting the modules and the training everything you could imagine and the most important thing that we try to offer you is how can you take those skills and actually make an income with it in terms of freelancing or getting your dream job so the link is in the description below for the course or you can just type it in right at the top there and i would suggest to at least even if you're a little curious go check it out and watch this video and see if this is for you but if it is definitely jump into the program and we would love to help you and teach you all of these skills every single day and show you how to make an income with it and i mean you're inside of this program right yeah so just to add to that like before i joined this course i had a few you know some knowledge about javascript and css but after i joined this course like i've been talking with sunny i've been talking with nasa i get to talk with them on the live calls right and now like you're actually on alive with us yeah yeah and now like i started my coaching career as well and i'm doing personal coaching and i have like four clients right now and they pay me like 40 dollars per hour so it's like i get a lot of value content and i just feel that it was one of my best decisions like yeah damn while a lot a lot of people are losing their jobs right now you know because of covid yeah 100 percent like yeah um awesome so guys let's keep the value coming at you guys so let's go and is this what is this is this full screen what is happening oh all right here we go okay i'm gonna full screen this sorry guys my computer is running a little slow so just bear with me here thank you for the donation we got one more donation really appreciate it psy and he says can you guys do some sessions on pwa which is progressive web apps and yeah i think at some point we're going to do something with react native as well cool all right so let's keep it rocking and rolling so can we go ahead go ahead yeah sorry i think yeah this is one of the most important and most useful case of like bootstrap because like building an ecommerce site is like so much harder like when you have to build but with bootstrap like you can see that it's just 49 and you just buy it and you just enhance it modify it and there you go like you have an ecommerce site right so i think this is one of the most important use case of bootstrap yep 100 i think that's really important a lot of people want to build bootstraps uh ecommerce sites like amazon you know or like shopify and a lot of freelancing jobs are out there so bootstrap is really good for that what's going on here so yeah portfolio like yeah i helped build my portfolio with bootstrap and a lot of people build a portfolio with bootstrap so like if you want to build the online portfolio with bootstrap and you just have a little knowledge about like coding or like uh very less knowledge about coding just go to bootstrap teams and just find a good portfolio before you download that part and there are a lot of free portfolio as well kazi you know like you can download a lot of free portfolio for you and then you can just edit that portfolio modify that portfolio and then you have online portfolio and like you know making that online portfolio is one of the most important thing when you are applying for those developer jobs right because like they always want to see where you stand out like you know so i think it's easy to do that with bootstrap super super easy yep i think that's super important to be able to do all of this stuff you guys i'm reading your guys's chat and we're trying to engage with you guys as much in chat as possible as well we got another donation by sahil thank you so much for that he says love you guys keep going and we will so guys just to recap right portfolio you can build ecommerce sites you can build blocks i can hear echo rishi you want to mute yourself cool um i was hearing echoes i think maybe your headsets came out or something or audio maybe i don't know just double check please and then we'll try to make it work because now my echo is gone so guys all these platforms you can you can all of these types of apps you can actually build with bootstrap and some beautiful projects using bootstrap you can build now the second reason you guys should be learning bootstrap is actually the powerful grid system that they have so this grid system actually is even faster than the css grid system so it has some really powerful professional use cases for why you should be using this and you can actually build mobile friendly sites using the powerful 12 column system so a lot of big sites like spotify or instagram or a lot of these guys that are using bootstrap are actually using it um and you know like that it's faster than the css grid which is something i just mentioned a little bit ago and real real fast and rishi did we have demos prepared or should we just go on to the next slides oh yeah we can just go into the next slides but like yeah just to add to that grid system is like super super powerful guys like i have been working with the grid system and the way bootstrap has improvised and even in bootstrap one of the major changes are there enhancing the grid system right they launched the flexbox they launched the grid system now they're enhancing the grid system and it's super easy to use like we don't have the demo but like i can just explain that all you need to do if you want to use a grid system is like you define a deal and you just give a raw class to that and then you can give a number of uh columns to that or maybe if you want to just quickly show that gaza you can just go to the codepen and like we can show them like it's it's yeah it's super powerful super powerful you guys it's really really powerful um yeah if you want to drop me a link i can probably show them in the slack channel but i'm going to keep it moving just for every just so we can bring more value to everybody and guys it's also open source and community driven and so what that means is there's massive massive support for it you know on github in their issues you can even go to github issues to get fixes to your problems their documentation is great so what that means is that there are a few things one it has excellent support so it even has great support for react and you guys can actually use react bootstrap this is a library that they have for and it just allows you to plug and play bootstrap into your react app and then no licensing issues with clients which means that you don't have to worry about purchasing a license or anything like that you can actually just use bootstrap with clients anytime the themes and then you're good to go and this is an alpha build of bootstrap so this is something we touched based on earlier and alpha build means it's the first working version of an application so you know right now it might be a little bit unstable it might be a little bit you know something might be wrong with it as i start to work out the kinks and go from alpha version to a beta version and then eventually going on to a fully stable version but i think you guys should definitely give it a try and use bootstrap 5 because i think you know they wouldn't release alpha build if it's not good or useful for most use cases i think 99 of you guys alpha build you guys can actually use it trust it i think people who are working with massive companies where you have millions of customers maybe you probably won't move to an alpha build you won't use an alpha build because you want to make sure that your version is extremely stable all right because if you want to go to the codepen and you want to show them i just dropped it dropped you the codepen link and now we can show them the or maybe it's open it's open i guess okay i just clicked it okay so now just scroll down i can explain quickly just scroll down in the code okay got it html file or maybe you can just like minimize css in javascript because we just have html okay yeah that's how you can do okay so now i can explain that so the way you use grid system is guys like it's super easy like if you see i created a view and uh so bootstrap works with the classes right all you need to do is like all you you just need to define classes right now the way it works is that uh uh you i first gave i first define a view and that the class name of the deal is row and underneath that so there is one row i said i said to the browser that there is one row now underneath whatever columns i need all i need to do is like give class column to that and even if you have like if you want if you want to add more columns to that you can add one more p tag and you just give one column so that's how like you know there's one draw and then there is number of columns and that's how much easier it is to use grid like before like bootstrap you need to go to css you need to define that display grid and then grid template column and then one fr one fr and stuff like that but with this like this that's it and the pg warning bg danger and bg info are the bootstrap colors that i'm talking about right vg means background and warning means the yellow color yep so this warning right over here is how we're getting this yellow color right there the danger is how we're getting that red color and then just because just by even adding the p tags you're breaking it up into its own columns right yep i'm just breaking it down so super easy to use the grid system guys i love that that is so awesome um i think that demo is super helpful so hopefully guys this uh all of these slides were valuable for you guys and gave you guys insight on how bootstrap 5 and bootstrap works in general and why maybe you might want to actually use bootstrap 5 and learn about it because you know even though with a lot of our clones we're teaching you materially why and i think material ui is fantastic you kind of stick with it and be totally fine material you guys developed by google but what's cool about i think even learning bootstrap 5 is because you're not going to be handicapped if you go to a job and they're using bootstrap 5 you can plug and play and learn their system and you guys can actually get that job still so i think knowing bootstrap 5 you don't have to be a pro at it but knowing it is not a bad idea so for you guys to maybe build a demo app with bootstrap 5 or even some of the clones you built the amazon clone that we taught you guys to build the spotify clone that we taught you to build you can probably go back to them and turn them into bootstrap 5 instead of material ui and learn it that way right and just to kind of recap everything we talked about top companies are using bootstrap right it's responsive it's fast jquery was removed they switched to vanilla they dropped internet explorer now they have svg icons responsive font sizes which was huge so if we go past all of this custom css variables so you guys can actually have variables like background color the color palettes are great uh themes you can use them and actually get started with bootstrap super fast and up and running with massive projects getting started is super easy npm install here's a cdn code you can just drop in and be good to go build sites fast was one of the reasons we said you guys should use bootstrap reason two was it has a powerful grid system and this is why it's important i think reason three that we said is that it's open source and community driven so you guys can actually use that to your advantage and build amazing things so hopefully guys that was something that was super valuable for you guys um i'm gonna share something go ahead rishi yeah so i just wanted to say that cause like if you go to that code pen again like i have one more demo for flexbox so that i can also show them flexbox and great voter for them simon yeah just refresh that page yeah so now just scroll down and the way you use flexbox in bootstrap is like uh just scroll down in the code all you all you say is like how you you know how you used to say uh in css that display flex all you need to say is d that's flash and then justify content center so this actually makes it much easier oh that's nice i didn't actually not know that oh let me actually i'm sorry they were they weren't seeing the screen now talk about it yeah okay so if you want to guys you if you want to use flexbox it's this easy like you know how you have to go to css if you don't use bootstrap you have to say that display flex and then you have to go and tell that justify content enter in bootstrap like you just say that b does flex and then you just say justify connect center and that's it like it's using flexbox so the most powerful tool of css that is boot uh that is created that is flexible bootstrap made it super easy for us to use like grid and uh flexbox uh so that like you know it's highly highly recommend to use but uh to use uh bootstrap uh for one all of your projects i would highly recommend that yep awesome now hopefully guys that brought you a lot of value if this was valuable for you guys can you guys please let us know in the comments if this brought you even just a tiny bit of value would love to know what you guys thought about this presentation we spent a lot of time putting it together we wanted to make sure it was entertaining and educational at the same time so i just want to know some feedback in terms of did you guys enjoy this what could we maybe do better and so then in the future live trainings we keep making it better and better for all of you guys right i can see hidayat is here in the chat akbar is here gaming with armand is here akshay is here and so alfredo is here komal and we really make these for you right and so if we get your feedback i think that would be helpful now i also want to know we i have one thing one more thing to share with you guys are you and if this is for you guys if you want to become a javascript developer and get a job as a developer and really it's a road map to going from you know if you're at zero dollars right now to going to a hundred thousand dollars now whether it takes you you know one month one year three years five years it's a road map that can really help you get to and and have like a clear idea of how to get to your six figures earned from programming in total so if that would be valuable you know let me know if i can share something about that with you if that is valuable then i what i want to say is guys go ahead and go here the link should be also in the description below this video but this is a training and this is a training that we actually prepared for you guys which is top three mistakes to avoid when becoming a javascript developer and we go over some of the most common mistakes developers make but on top of that we really just like lay out the roadmap for you and how to turn your javascript skills into cash because i think that's the thing that not a lot of people talk about it's an exclusive training we have it up and available right now we're thinking of changing it soon to a netflix build so while it's up i would highly recommend that if you're interested even a little bit go uh click the link below and register for this training and just make sure

please join the webinar you're gonna get a lot of value from this webinar so please do that and because there was a question in the chat like i think it got disappeared and someone asked that like can you develop android apps with javascript and i would say 100 person you can develop android apps with javascript those are the class cross platform apps i have building i i have built android applications with javascript i use cordova hybrid applications i use coilovers definitely you can build that okay awesome yeah people are saying they loved it a total value aaron says total value thanks elijah says yeah i love these presentations that's great great content great content from zimbabwe that's awesome that we have fans there just a small suggestion daily stream from your side will be valuable for us so that's what we're trying to do actually we're trying to get to the point where we're just doing daily live streams for you guys and right now we're kind of almost at that level even we did one on sunday um we did one on monday and then we're doing one today we have one tomorrow tomorrow you guys will actually be building the zoom clone all right you guys are gonna be building the zoom clone with nodejs so if you guys are excited and pumped about that make sure you uh lock it in your calendar all right and set your alarms on your phone and subscribe to the channel so then when we go live it notifies you and you can just click on it right then whatever you're doing whether you're in line waiting for something you're going out or you're just sitting bored click

learning and picking up new skills so that's happening wednesday thursday we're going to be talking about front end developer guide for 2021 the roadmap to a successful career and then i think friday we do a twitter clone build so it's kind of packed back to back and i think it's great to have those live streams every day and i think uh e1 with me or even i think for everyone uh it's it's adding a lot of value to their lives like even for finding a job like i was watching uh uh frankie's and science video and i've been following all the live streams and it's so much helpful it has helped me so much like those projects are literally like so powerful dude like uh i think the netflix clown amazon clothes like you can just literally put that up on your resume those are not the small projects that that a lot of people build like a calculator or something these products are really like real world projects people are getting jobs with it you know like jen in our profit but javascript community she ended up landing a 96 000 a year she got a 96 000 a year offer yeah and the most important thing their their hiring managers like was the koi tracker we built in profit with javascript they said that they love the kovic tracker so yeah so i'm gonna go here and uh this is our profit with javascript community you guys and so we have tons of people uh you know in this community i think
