today's live stream guys guys pumped to have you and today we're going to be going over the best projects on covid 19 guys so basically we're going to be showing you guys all of these projects and hopefully they blow your mind so we got tons of submissions for these actually and today we're going to be reviewing and picking the winner and what happens when somebody wins um nas so so guys so basically what happens with these projects is that guys with these projects our students we have been building these projects for the past few weeks with our students and you know we've been finishing up we'll be doing it live in our zoom coaching calls in profitable javascript and then what happened is the students went out and we had a challenge you know we like to do challenges in our course they did a challenge where the first place winner gets 500 the second place winner gets 250 and a third place winner gets a hundred dollars and so what they did is they went on they personalized their projects and voila here they are today guys this is going to be pretty amazing this has never really been done before like the fact that not only are we going to be reviewing some of these projects for example like you know let's just pick uh this actually one looks cool so we're going to be reviewing them and yeah we're going to be picking the winner out of these guys and then giving away 500 and we're going to be running these challenges pretty damn often and all of these students are actually from our community of profit with javascript so excited to show you guys all these projects in a second so just buckle up get ready and you're going to have your mind blown let's go guys this is going to be an epic one yep and guys before we just jump straight into this video a few things we just

like i'm pumped energy code is like i am pumped that is awesome guys okay this is going to be epic joe joe is palm ria vicious oh my god you guys this is gonna be awesome we stay guys a guy guys for those of you who are on proper javascript let us know in the comments below who here has completed that project and are in profit with javascript let us know in the comments below too yup awesome all right guys so let's go to the first project right now this project is built by abdullah tahir and he's actually sonny's a student before he ever even joined prophet with javascript and he landed sunny helped him land a uh school as his client but we're let's let's take a look at his project and start reviewing it so i'm going to go ahead and i'm going to put it at 150 percent because my screen is really big so nas do you want to just go start talking through this project and you can even be my eyes and my you know i'll be your arm so just tell me what you want me to do and then i'll like go ahead and do those things yeah so i really like this so actually before we get into this can you can you actually show the project that we basically had people create on live in profit with javascript so i sent you a link on slack so it kind of gives people an idea oh nice students oh and by the way guys thank you so much yesterday we got so many super chat donations that was freaking crazy we broke a hundred dollars on it and just right now we got another super chat by a conch thank you so much for that really appreciate you and i'll pull up so so you sent me a link on slack for for what the what they were supposed to do so this is guys this is the project that basically our students will building within profit javascript with our students from scratch like literally from wireframe idea to a fully built out project and this is this is how we do coaching calls right so you know as you can see what do we have here guys we have basically the title right we have the option for us to select a country you can see we start out with worldwide so if you go ahead and click worldwide you can type in usa for example in there so type in usa you can actually type in you yeah you can type in your oh it's fast yeah yeah it will zoom into you say you can now click on that you can for example now click on the red the red circle click on the red circle right oh nice yeah and it will actually pop up with information about you know cases recover and deaths right for the specific country guys now now let's go ahead back to the top let's look at those tabs above let's look at those steps above now what do you see you see the cases you see recovered and you see deaths okay yeah that the case recovered yeah yeah yeah the cases guys that is cases for today so cases recovered and deaths that is the number of increased for today yeah so let's say we look at you know currently we're on cases let's say we click on recovered so click on recover oh nice everything changes literally even the even this changes too exactly so i was going to talk about that for a second guys this is so epic people were so excited about this you have no idea so as you can see you see them that a chart on the right hand side which was actually created using chart js you know javascript library if you switch between for example you know recovered cases and deaths so you know just click through click through those uh those all those different ones yep so let's go to dats here oh it's just smooth and nice man we got to get more people to subscribe to clever programmer than than die we definitely want the debts going to zero and subscribe guys if you guys want that to happen where you want the subscriptions to go up to 10 000 in debts to go to zero make sure you subscribe to this channel exactly let's change the stats let's make it a more positive place let's do it let's do it so yeah as you can see basically you know this is local tracker now here's the cool part guys you want to hear something really amazing yeah how about we try we try to squish the window and try to make it mobile let's let's go to mobile let's go to mobile okay can you do it you're gone yeah yeah yeah yeah let me give me one second i'm just going to make sure that i have there we go and now let's go to uh mobile so it's like they can see it in a clean way look look go keep going keep going boom oh man this is like mobile friendly it's very mobile friendly it's extremely mobile friendly so yeah not only is it a project that's actually you know built out nicely but it's also mobile friendly it looks good it's just you know it works well that is amazing yeah so guys drop in the comments below if you ever wanted to build projects like these and learn how to build a project like these you know like this right this is something we do in profit or javascript together with all the students like from xero guys this is awesome okay so let's get into reviewing people's projects now right so okay so let's going on we have abdullah here that's the first submission and what i like about it is the fact that he took what you got what you gave him but then he also has like dark mode and nondark mode and that a lot of modern websites i've noticed have that and there's this nice little transition when i click it and it goes to dark mode so that's oh man that is slick and even when i hover over the things it goes dark um so that's that guys guys give some fire for get not not fire just be like yo this is a this is awesome yeah just drop like something that you like about this just drop it in the comments yeah go ahead so we're gonna say i love the dark mode i love that and click on symptoms and prevention click on that cause so where okay symptoms and prevention click okay ah it opens up a new link at the top okay so dying okay that's epic nice so people can actually even read what the symptoms look like so you have um you have symptoms here you got fever cough shortness of breath and he's hosting this on google docs so that's really cool yeah yeah so actually he wrote his own document looks like dang this guy this guy's going all the way he's trying to actually help change the world that's beautiful okay so yeah that's really cool i love that now what i do now i love also how he has the like uh the country's actual you know uh the country's map i think yeah that is awesome nice he's got the nice flags each country's flags and they told cases looks really good too that's pretty cool what happens if you click through so click the recover and desk click through that uh recovered okay let's click that oh nice it actually changes on the map so it doesn't change the total i mean this is here just total cl uh cases globally uh but it does seem like it changes let me see if maybe i can put our ourselves at the top right that might be better for everybody um but yeah it looks like the whole map changes which is really cool nice i like that that's cool yeah but the charge.js thing that that graph doesn't just doesn't change which is okay and then he's got news at the bottom too so if people are trying to read news guys on a scale of 1 to 10 what would you guys rate this go ahead and drop that in the comments below what would you guys rate this app and i think you know i mean i like it nas i think let's now take a look at maybe other projects as well i think this is pretty good let's do it yeah yeah already rated guys 10 being the best and then one being like not so good all right that's the skill guys yeah i kind of also want to take a look at how creative they got with it to be honest so like bro just to wait till you get because i think like wow so this is one done by rania okay this is really cool i really like this one i love how pretty much everything is there right in like one glance i really like that like even active recovered and debts now let's see if i actually change the country what happens albania wow a lot of stuff changes including total no total cases but this over here changes and then it actually takes me closer to maybe where albania is so i'm very very bad at geography so i'm not exactly clear i suck at geography man yeah i'm really bad at that stuff can i click on countries okay i can't click on countries looks like people are given an eight and nine i see a seven i see a ten nice i see a ten thousand okay somebody lost their minds i see nine point five eight okay cool okay yeah so now let's go ahead what are your thoughts on this so like my thoughts are really good it's clean i love how you used all the real estate what i do think could have been better rania is like for example that table right there if you could have expand that table to be your full 100 width because you know how it kind of it doesn't cover the 400 with the left table that could have been made better right so so like maybe got it so there is like space here that's like not really being used for anything and it's just like you know what's what's really going on here you know and i think guys one other big thing is like when we're developing these applications it's really really important is it's okay to limit the width of an app you can literally say hey the max width of my app is going to be you know 700 pixels right or 800 pixels or a thousand pixels right that way when you look at it on a large screen it doesn't get blown out right yeah that's what we did that's what we did with that project the one i just showed you the one we started off with profit with javascript oh hold on hold on so actually nas to be fair it's actually supposed to look more like this okay that's better so what actually happened was that because again i'm on a 5k imac that like nobody really develops anything for so on that it looks a little but it looks like it does take up so it's it's pretty good actually in that sense gotcha bother that dang dang man what did these students are freaking killing it and like look even even mobile even it's like mobile responsive so i kind of like that it's mobile responsive um the one thing though is that if you're on a phone i mean i don't exactly understand how i would scroll past oh my computer is crashing i don't understand like i would have to scroll through this entire table right to be able to scroll past and go you know what i mean like i don't know how i would get to this part without scrolling through the entire table so it might be like a little frustrating experience on mobile so maybe i would think about like how can i put all of this stuff at the bottom you know at the top yeah and also the those graphs at the bottom i would make those full screen i would make like when you go to mobile i would make those graphs be like full screen grabs not yet full screen okay smart so like on mobile responsiveness i mean for me this is like a seven out of ten yeah okay so so mobile responsiveness could be improved but i think in terms of this i mean it's pretty good like for me it looks like almost a nine out of ten i honestly can't think of what's it yeah i would say i would say an eight and a half an eight i would say yeah that's pretty good that's pretty good yeah okay awesome so that's what we would give the ronio one i think it's pretty good let's move on i mean i i also want to kind of get to these like drastically unique designs so should we go in an order or should we kind of go like whichever one we feel like going to first let's let's just go in and order really quickly like like not spend too much time just going over really quickly let's do it okay cool so here's one by tommy kelly so let's take a look at this nice i see the search table at the top something cool is about to happen here okay so tips for using the site nice click the column i mean might be a little like frustrating experience on mobile because you see how small that crosses yeah yeah that's true that's gonna be pretty annoying to close so um and even in regular i think it's gonna be kind of annoying to close let me click outside of it see if i click outside of it it seems like it's not going away yeah so i kind of have to like also to be fair i have to make sure it's 150 and then i'll click x so that it that kills the appeal of your program honestly because of your app because even if it's going to be something fancy you don't want to start it off with something that looks crappy so i would remove that i would remove that but look at that i mean he is taking up the whole real estate bro check this out damn that's true that's true i do like that one thing i really like about this is honestly when i'm using this uh tables are really important for me so even when i was looking at the coronavirus cases i wanted to see by like i want to be able to sort by desks recovered that was important like it so like i want to be able to sort by cases and see what's number one what's number two so that actually oh actually i like that so like i feel like we should also rate these apps not just on how they look but also their functionality as well so for me so far this app has more functionality than all of the other ones that we've seen so far so i would actually on the functionality scale give it give it a higher um oh look at this bro look at the search functionality look usa oh man that is nice okay i i'm sorry but i'm gonna uh from what we've seen this takes the kick over the last few ones like by miles yeah i'll get i'll get i'll give this a nine i'll give this a nine out of ten i'll get this one man yeah this is nine out of like especially like how quick i mean look at this bro croatia like instant like this is actually more useful than most of the apps that are online guys what do you think what what would you give give tommy guys drop in the comment below what number and like look as soon as i type in india india actually pops up and right away pops up nice that is very good touch i like that that's a good touch so click on that and click on recover i'm curious okay let's click on recovered oh the total recover changes at the bottom and the map changes that is nice and it looks like he has sim he has symptoms so he even has videos and news playing that's really cool new covered law oh wow i can actually click it and it expands that's dude that's nice that's useful like look at that study provides comprehensive view of cursive venomous snakes and snake bites in the middle east um i mean that's not really connected to don't exactly know what's happening there snake bites snake bites you know with kobe you know i think this is this is useful and the top one is useful and then he got tweets and cnn that's super cool bro cause that's useful like twitter new news is useful the other news stuff like looks scammy but like if you have twitter things pulled up that looks like really relevant and like yeah i something i can trust so i like the twitter embeds that he has yeah i would say functionality definitely like a 10 out of 10 functionalitywise like for me like 10 out of 10 10 out of 10 for like functionality honestly like looks i would give it a 9 out of 10 9 out of 10 mainly because i think like for example that twitter the twitter tweets at the bottom like you know how it goes goes all the way down i think it could be a little bit improved to make it to make use of more real estate um so yeah i would i would i would use the twitter up but like look at the responsiveness so like when i go from full to like this already it's like doing such a good job with responsiveness wow and then go to a really small one let's go oh man this guy has like every case like figured out guys this is crazy i mean this is crazy because this is what we learn in profit with javascript like i mean seriously right this is crazy we learn how to make not just applications but mobile friendly applications i mean the whole shebang this is this is really really awesome okay so this one i'm gonna rate it pretty high um definitely just in my mind this is yeah like this is gonna be there so great job tommy on this so let's keep it moving so great let's go to abdullah tahir we've already seen his let's take a look at ahmed's because that looks really cool i like how this one looks oh by the way if you guys want to check it out you can also go to this website uh the link is at the top maybe i can drop it in the comments so yeah drop in the comments i just dropped the link in the comments so you guys could go to it and play around with it okay let's see here whoa that looks beautiful it's beautiful but okay hold on before i say something this page can't load google maps correctly do you own this website okay that's fine it's just google map stuff that's api key stuff okay so let's see okay that is really cool that i can hover over a country and it kind of highlights it so that's really cool i like how it says 123 761. i like what it looks like okay um actually click on a circle click on that circle quasi just zooms in so honestly like it's what are you talking about i don't like it i don't like it and the reason why i don't like this is because um i don't know like i feel like on mobile this any type of map stuff is always a nightmare and like really confusing and like once you zoom in you kind of don't know how to zoom out is it like do i use my mouse wheel to zoom out is it command minus command plus but holy crap that's like zooming in on my chrome screen um and i don't exactly i don't have a sense of direction on this app i don't know where am i supposed to click or what's happening yeah like where to go what to look at right and like just right now even how slowly it's loading and then also those numbers look really great oh something is happening on the left hand side that's looking really nice whoa i mean yeah that does that looks pretty good that looks great that looks great yeah yeah i saw that i thought i was like holy that looks amazing the map though yeah i think you know having the map is full screen probably not the best like if he if he had that thing on the lefthand side be always open yeah because that already will give you some intuition and honestly i wouldn't i wouldn't use the map like he's using it he's making the map everything i would like have like a little search bar where you can type in your country name and then like this stuff on the left opens up that will blow people's minds yeah we got another donation thank you guys for okay seriously yeah we got another donation that's awesome thank you all right okay okay so i i really yeah what do you guys think about this i mean i really like this i think if he had a search bar right around like here so it's very clear that i'm like looking for countries and then boom i do that and maps i would make it like much smaller probably like maps isn't that useful and it's also kind of clunky when you click on it and stuff so i would not make it like the main part because now i'm lost like the only way i can search up united states is to somehow find it to click it i'm not gonna do that that's too much work now there are some icons at the bottom so i'll click it it says didn't finish it yet hahaha that's funny it toggles between it seems like night mode and the other mode holy crap it says countries updated province has updated cities updated so that's nice it has like these things looks like he's got a bunch of popups all right okay wow that's cool look at okay that is really cool so take a look at that when i click this at the bottom you see how at the bottom it like expands into three different things one is confirmed cases one is recovered and then one says dead so let's go ahead and hit recovered and let's see what happens maybe the whole map changes to recovered oh i mean the front end of this is pretty clean it's slow but it's really clean a lot of functionality i'll give you that for sure a lot of functionality is there music i don't know where it's coming from but is that you where's the music coming from no i think it's coming from the side because somebody's somebody said get ready for something for some music nobody else can hear it only i can hear it oh man all right well what where's the dance you know virtually dance virtual dance yeah okay um i have to turn it off i mean the music is lit good song choice that's a great song i love it how much how much how much would we give this project what do you think people are like now 10 because there's a music there's music so what's cool about that when you click it let's see there's like uh there's some other stuff some attachment stuff and then some table so like let's click so table side man your app is so awesome it's being destroyed by google maps honestly if you started using google made google maps extremely small your app would be so useful because like your frontend design is awesome i love what you're doing within where you're headed with it but it's just like it's so damn slow because of how the map renders um and i can even see this is how i became i'd coded okay so it's doing it's doing some cool stuff on the side but yeah i would definitely ease up on the google maps other than that i think this is great what so nas what do you think yeah i like that i mean i love the fun listen a lot of work was put in this for sure you know yeah in terms of like like even having it where you click on that button and then also like you know it goes in and stuff like that that's a lot of work right so yes i have a lot of work you for that that's a lot of work though i think that you know always think that simpler is better right simpler is better you want to put into account the user experience this is a cool ui but the user experience of it may not be like the best mainly because i don't know what to do like i'll see a map that's cool but i'm here to get from about covet and i want to see that straight away right so that's what i would say i would give it i would probably give it like an eight out of ten i would say like give it a give it eight out of ten point yeah this is really this app is really great um ahmed so take this critique with like you know just open your mind so don't be offended by it but take it really for what it is like i would basically say for me this app is a six out of ten and their only reason is that i wouldn't use it so that's the only problem just because the user experience is really slow and everything like that but overall the app is beautiful it has so many cool things but the problem is that the users probably wouldn't even wait around to see all those cool things so you want to figure out how you can highlight those things in a much simpler and a faster way but other than that i'm a great job on this so yeah i i'll maybe even have like a running list i'm writing yeah i actually have i have a running list as well yeah okay none of my pens are working okay cool nah i got it thank you all right so now let's go to gens so jen is a professional software developer who's in our community profit with javascript chad is amazing jen is awesome we can actually even pull up jen so let's see i don't know why it's going so slow yeah why is your thing going so slow it's true it's funny that my laptop is way faster than this so this is our community of profit with javascript we have tons and tons of amazing people and let's see if we can pull up jen but jen is it's lagging right it's slow yeah so jen is right there so we're going to be taking a look at jen's project i think it's going to be a great project i got good feeling about this um got a high school station jen jen come on what is happening here what is all this oh yeah i mean i mean i mean look i mean we had it we had it where you know you really we limited the width of the project but yeah i got it maybe maybe it could have been centered or something but okay look active cases and recovered and debts looks clean that looks clean i love the hover effect the hover effect is pretty good i love the hover effect yeah yeah and and i think actually one thing to guys remember one really cool thing here is oh jen jen is on here she says you guys are too sweet i love that nice i just highlighted a comment sorry in a second i think jen you're going to be saying we're not sweet but okay go ahead dogs so i one thing that i love what jen did is like if you look at the projects right it's about the color the color you know choice that she made you see how for example she has the green as the title right the code 19 tracker is the green and then for example the map is also green right so she's keeping consistency within the whole application in terms of like colors right yeah i love that that is really good that's one of the hardest things to do guys a lot of people would just put a bunch of colors together you know and they know you know and then you know and have it work but but with her i love how she had kept the consistency that she kept like the you know the green color scheme which is great yeah that's really good um so that's awesome i like the consistency i like the how the tables are here and they're kind of by default sorted by the most i don't know why most people didn't do that but like by default i think it should be sorted by the most cases because that's what i look for whenever i'm looking up any coronavirus stuff i want to know where what's the number one country what's the number two what's number three like i didn't know russia was like right there number four yeah number one another functionality that like i just realized it has that i didn't even know there was like no way for me to know it would even have it is the fact that i can click on russia's text and click it and then it actually takes me to it you guys watching that oh no way really yeah so when i actually click on russia it takes me to it and all these the only thing i would say is if you want to make it a functionality that i can see maybe like a little effect that happens when i go on it like it gets a little darker or something or at least my mouse should turn into like a pointer yeah like the hand pointer like the hand pointer right just that alone would tell me that this functionality exists so that's really cool and let's go here now when i go to brazil okay it's a zero recovery today okay i think that's that's fair india nice i mean i love whoa 49 000 plus cases today in india oh wow damn that's actually a useful functionality that's really really useful and what i would even do to really let the user know that they clicked on india and it's selected is maybe even it has like a color that like highlights it to just make it look like that that's active right now when we click india yeah having an active state and a hover state so right yeah kind of a hover state when you hover over like you know on the tab on the on the map or not on the map but on that specific country that'll be great right yeah exactly that would be awesome let's let let's look at the one the news uh below what does she have in there the news um nice okay so she's pulling the news from the guardian that's that's a good source i like that you wrote this uh source maybe even drop the logo because when people come to these types of websites i think like it's hard to trust what's happening like they're gonna be like oh this these you know jen is running a scam here but when you either add a little logo or why i like twitter embeds is because the proof is all right there like you just trust twitter so you're much more likely to click it but i still really like how she did it yeah yeah yeah so i love it i think it's good you know functionality is you know functionality is pretty good as well right i know some other people have done that some even extra functionality but you know hers is pretty clean and let's go ahead and check let's go ahead and check if it's more friendly as well just really quickly i i do like how she has the total and all that underneath it like in the plus 631 today like that is cool let's just check mobile friendly okay so in this view it already becomes mobile friendly so that's great now let's go to a smaller like a mobile nice that's great very mobile friendly very mobile friendly i love that that's cool so great job i love how we're creating these applications like just that's clean you know mobile friendly and clean i love it man yeah so this is this is really good so great job on this jen yeah uh this is awesome i would go ahead i'll give it a nine point attack and 9.5 out of 10. and only the reason why is this is really good but i just think yet you know from other students what they have done like you could have added some even more for example maybe it's twitter and bad maybe it's even symptoms maybe you know for what we had different students do i think it could have done even more potentially yeah so really good that's great yeah my score on this would be like eight out of ten and only just for a few reasons one is there's a lot of space not being used here um the fact that when i click on some functionality that's there that like i don't because hover state or active state isn't here so i would probably knock off some points for that and um you know and also like india when i click it like the flag and everything should come up right over there you know like the fact that the flag doesn't automatically come up um and you know if it's a smaller country you're never going to find it like you're never going to be able to see where it's even located and for news i would see i would feel like if you had twitter embeds that could actually make it better so for me this is going to be an 8 out of 10. cool cool cool awesome let's move on to other projects ooh i'm excited let's look but guys what would you give jen drop in the comments what would you give jen right there drop in the comment guys yep drop it in the comments guys and let us let us know people are saying nine we got 400 likes on this beautiful nice thank you for that you guys really appreciate you okay people are saying jennifer good work okay sam nice nice nice great job i love it okay eight nine eight beautiful we're getting tons of ratings on this eight eight point five ruby okay great okay guys let's move on to the next next project so i think that project let's just put them ahoy remember guys a few things we want to tell you is remember this project the winner will get 500 second place we'll get 250 and then third place gets 100 these are all of our students in our course profit with javascript if you want to check out that course link is in the description we have a free javascript training as well that's over one hour long link is in the description and we're currently reviewing all of the students projects that submitted it from our profit javascript community so let's keep it rolling let's go on to this project right here i'm pumped to see what's happening here because it looks pretty unique oh man i already like this this is oh i feel so good looking at this one and um i love everything that has like a landing page type of vibe to it just because i'm so used to you know coming to a page that has something don't exactly know what we're downloading though so yeah i think i think maybe like i think that maybe like wanted to have like an app like an android ios app but got it got it that would be cool that would be really cool so okay so let's go here i mean it's i love the landing page of it like this would actually make you download this app like i would want to yeah if it had something i would download it on my phone and look at it yeah people are saying this looks amazing um okay so let's go here total cases i don't know i don't i'm not a huge fan of this color coding it doesn't it's not like intuitive at all the fact that i have to like actually pay attention to your color coding is not a good sign because like why is the most dense black like that by default should be red the most red should be the most cases and why is red like in the middle so weird like i don't know like that to me is uh hard to read i like though how the case is recovered and deaths are yeah i love that and you see and i think i also love like how that if you switch like a different country so let's say like let's say we do like usa so let's search usa for example so instead of global data it should also say worldwide because global data is not clear what that is okay i'm not in usa if you see it yeah like recover for example i love that i actually like that recovered the button that recovered um uh bar that like goes left and right yeah it looks fills up yeah like fills up which is now how many people recover from the cases you know and it kind of zooms in and i like that little like usa um that little like section that that card on the right hand side which is really cool because it's like it gives you like a place exactly where you need to look at right so yes i really like that part actually uh the news is one of the best how you've put together is literally probably the best how it looks so great job on the news portion you crushed it keep the distance stay at home wash your hands crushed it with that oh man i love tables why are you hiding the tables those are my favorite because that's actually what i want to use um so can you search for in a table can you search in a table or no yeah yeah nice so it's really fast search but it like has a little weird experience on it so like it literally jumps oh wow moves my entire app so i would i would because when i'm on mobile it'll be a really frustrating experience to have this happen to me but i love the search so functionality wise already you took the cake above a lot of people because that's what i do when i come to a covid app or i want to look at stats i'm going straight to the tables and i'm searching and sorting and stuff like that so this honestly should be higher up because people want to look at those trends like i like to look at the trends and the growth for me the functionality is based a lot on the like if i'm looking at the covet about kind of gut wise i'm judging it on if i look at a covet app i'm judging it on you know is it showing me the rate of growth of of whatever like whether it be the rate of growth of debts cases recovered um and i'm also like judging it on uh like table searchable table so can i like search countries and how fast can i do it and can i sort them because i want to look at like which are the top countries that are affected that's generally what i'm looking at so and i think a lot of people are so i would definitely make sure that those things are are a little more thought out and i would like i value that even over looking at a map you know so yeah just a good user experience exactly you don't have to remove the map but like maybe even you can make the map a little bit smaller but that table view it looks nice but here on the table yeah i feel like i like have like a table view near the map you have a table like above like all the way above near the mapping potentially right so i feel like that could have been even part of it as well also it's hard to see go ahead go ahead nas and i would oh so he has total stats and new cases okay so he does cover that i like that okay cool yeah but actually honestly what i like about this is again i love his color his color choice guys like you know very just clean and crisp right and he can keeps consistency which is good so it's a clean sight right it's something you would build but i think yeah again the user experience can definitely improve a little bit yeah yeah especially like that map when you search when you search on the map like it just kind of jumps to the center nah nah i think you do better you got this you can do better what's up guys because i was like yeah it's crazy because um for me i feel i literally it seems to me like we're like 10 minutes behind like the lag is that bad because i'm looking at the youtube but frankie's like it's looking great so i'm just gonna keep it rolling um but yeah hopefully yeah right now people are looking at this app that we're looking at right so cool i mean i think overall this is great um a few things like when i hit like the like i would never know to click on this because it has a strikethrough and that to me doesn't speak like hey this is another functionality so i would never know to click on it that i feel like this table is very like it could be i like the functionality so the functionality of this table is a 10 you know 10 out of 10 but like the user experience and the front end of this table is not good so i would work on that other than that this is a phenomenally done app it's very creative and it looks professional like if i saw this i would actually think it's like a professional app this is crazy i know i i like yeah i know i like this i like this a lot actually you know but like again yeah and also yeah that that table as well yeah it doesn't fit in with the whole application like you did so good on all these other top parts but like the table just kind of like you know just kind of like black you know not black but like gray and white so i think you definitely could have done better on there maybe some padding more margin more padding you know and different colors for the table yep so overall uh i would give this app and you know i would give this app an 8.5 probably yeah i would i would give it a nine i'll give it a nine okay awesome so let's keep the ball rolling okay so now let's go to the next one abdul salaam so if it i mean it looks very if it looks very similar to the other ones we're not going to spend too much time on it to be honest just just for the sake of time yeah but let's see so let me go to 150 percent where it would look sort of normal i like that bar that bar graph pretty cool bar chart that's pretty cool yeah i like the bar chart at the bottom i like the text he's using the font i like his font a lot i think these stats are not accurate though so that's a big miss like i would definitely make sure my facts are accurate when i'm building an app so the facts are off here so that's a huge minus on the functionality side and i honestly care more about the functionality than even because i'd rather use wikipedia because i know it'll be like accurate or i'll use some crappy site that's interesting i don't know why those stats are off like that maybe i don't know that's really that's really weird yeah but i know for example usa has 4 million 4 million and then behind usa is some other country brazil with 2 million so it says last updated july 28th but i don't really know if it is um okay so i would give i would give this like i would get this like honestly like probably like an eight and eight or so yeah i would say for the images use the thing that sunny taught you guys with object fit because look these are not pixel perfect images they're squished so you're taking images and you're squishing them and it's very visible that they're squished so otherwise these circular images would look great but if you actually use that like object fit line in css it'll make them perfect so i would yeah just focus on that um i like i'll also focus sorry sorry go for it also focus on the code 19 so you have code 19 to learn code 19 symptoms like the information on cover 19 you know i'll you'll want to put like um some kind of a text on what is you know what are you going to be talking about below you know the the table above says total life cases by countries then you might want to have some other text that says you know covet you know covet uh so people are saying people are saying that he basically subtracted the debts from the recovered or whatever and that's how you're getting this but honestly but i i still that's no justification even though it says live cases because if it's not if nas and i are both confused by it a lot of people are gonna be so it doesn't matter so even if you do something like fancy and intelligent it doesn't matter if most people get confused by it so you sometimes have to even give up your fanciness to just make something people get right away that's really important i'll say so too i would say so too scroll down i think that the news as well could have been could it could be could be a little bit better in terms of you know how it's formatted yeah so that's cool that i can download it but honestly i don't care to download it that much but it's still cool maybe if i'm like a data analyst but like i was also not very clear to me what i am exactly downloading i do love how he has top countries with today's new cases so like we know that's cool today for today india had the most cases which is really which is like which is really interesting like that's i didn't know that so that is interesting yeah i like that so yeah let's let's so kaiju let's give this like a a number let's move on let's keep going okay cool so yeah so i'm gonna give this a i don't know i think like it's 7.5 okay cool and i'll give it an eight yeah just because like my stats when they're not right on kovid then that's problem cool let's keep going okay cool so here is this one what was that what was the name of the last one the person who did it abdul okay cool dang interesting so nice centered i like that oh interesting design uh okay cool hold on let's see keep going i think the graphs got a little too complicated here so i mean unless you are having like data scientists come to your website like this is freaking oh yeah those graphs i would not want to look at it so um grade function functionality wise great clean i like i like it i mean it's pretty clean in terms of like it's centered right we know it's pretty clean i like that it just it kind of you know it feels friendly right but like yeah that graph is like weird yeah um yeah yeah the okay the table looks nice so great job on that the table looks good one thing i would say if you centered everything like i think who's it mustapha if you already centered everything then the search box should also be centered too yeah so i would say that yeah the search box should be centered right and then also for your people are like data scientists ll um also for your like i'm having trouble reading this off the patch so i'm like 167 000. i'm like no no no uh yeah 1.6 million and then i'm like no no no 16 million and then i'm like oh yeah that's 16 million so don't make me like don't make me do work when i come to your website you know like just make it really simple for me so like definite so functionality wise i'm gonna dock off those points from the functionality i would definitely have commas now let's check mobile friendly so here let's go cool that's great what happens when i choose usa nice um zooms in okay something kind of really much okay i don't really know what it does on the map like it doesn't really do anything it doesn't even bring up the flag so don't like what it does on the map like okay great i can read the text united states like that's that's not that useful let me i do like that table though like that table is like pretty clean it's just that table is not that table is not uh what's it called is uh not sorted or is it i'm not sure maybe it's not yeah mobile friendly wise it's not that great like mobile friendly like this is weird to look at this on mobile so you know like looking at a map that's just like blank it's confusing then i don't even know how you scroll past a map on your phone without like starting to mess around with the map um yeah honestly guys map the map makes it a really poor experience like unless you use the map in a smart way where you don't make it so it's like the biggest thing on the screen if you kind of use it in a more like subtle way then it will look really great yeah yeah yeah yeah so and i think those active cases like in mobile could have definitely could have been better you could have made it like made that like full with 100 or you know just put this up into four you know you don't have to do it like that so yeah that could have been done better as well so but nice job but nice job overall i like the creativity so just for even the creativity alone like the fact that you really went out of your way i mean i would have otherwise given it like 7.5 but i think with the creativity involved like i'm i'm just going to put in an 8 so nice job on i'll give i'll give it a 7.5 mainly because like the format like i'm very particular with like the small little things because they make a big difference the formatting the numbers that kind of stuff it definitely could have been done better so i'll do it give it a 10.5 holy crap we're about to look at somebody who went the extreme way he's using freaking float precision big precision numbers wait we're looking at what i'll show you there's like an app coming up by i think it's by uh andres vegan and he's like using freaking floating numbers like point zero point oh bad we're going too advanced with that so oh okay let's go let's do let's select the tian now okay cool let's uh move forward oh tatiana nice okay yeah okay our students in in covet in uh javascript hold on now she's one of our students with coven oh man oh fancy i like that it's very fancy worldwide what i love i love about this one is number one colors and number two attention to detail yeah attention to detail very important yeah so graphs are really nice i like the little logos with the graphs so you guys use that to your advantage like active cases right and recovered cases it has a smiley face and then deaths have this i think jen had probably the best use of logos unless it was tommy kelly but so i like that there's mortality rate and all that that's very good i can hover over these so when i hover that looks really nice let me actually click recovered okay something happens okay the whole map changes wow the whole map turns table changes too the table changes as well okay so let's go take a look at so okay great let's go down so here's the table the table is changing top 10 active guys what do you think about this one guys let us know in the comments below let us know in the comments below yeah i like what she's done with the news it makes it look a lot more legit the fact that she's turned into these nice cards because most other people's news looks like um spam or like an ad like ads that you have don't look at so i like holy crap some people are giving it 10 e to the seventh power points yeah like four nine amazing amazing ten people loving this okay so i like that it even teaches you prevention that's really good let's go into symptoms that's that's cool the fact that okay that's really useful because i always want to know what are the symptoms of this so then i kind of want to go to other apps and then take a look at or i will google what are the symptoms so the fact that i can see fever and dry cough and fatigue that's really good sign okay and then you got resources so that tells me what you're doing okay nice learn more on who.net nice you're giving them credit that's really good you got your instagram and you got your github somebody said i love it three thousand holy yeah so let's see worldwide uh i can choose different countries nice okay all right cool so overall what would you give this one nas i will give this honestly honestly though i mean actually go go into a mobile view mobile view control view if the mobile is good i would give this a 10 out of 10. this is by far one of the best swans i definitely i think i've seen okay clean clean clean good good good yeah yeah it's easy to read i'll give this a 10 out of 10 for sure okay sick um for more would you give it yeah for me this one is gonna be an eight out of ten okay why so uh why is cause again i think the map should not really take up all of that real estate because these graphs are freaking awesome and the table is awesome i wish the table and the graphs were like right smack in the middle like how the initial app that you built nas so that you should so it's like that is important that those things be front and center because map is not super super useful to look at also the other thing that i think is um i don't like i want to have a table that i can sort and you can't store this one i can't top 10. yeah i can't sort this one i also wish that like i could sort it based on recovered that total debts all of that i also wish the countries next to next to it had um flags so in the table and um and yeah so those few additions again map i think just it's so good the app is this looks so good i just wish more of this stuff was front and center the map was like probably because if i'm on mobile right think about this if i'm on mobile it's going to be really hard to scroll past the map because you're going to hit your thumb on this and you're going to like keep on playing with the map instead of you know the those countries what you would do okay so here's the thing so on the map actually is in order for you to actually use the map you have to use two fingers so you know when you simply just scrolling it actually it won't scroll the map won't scroll unless you use two fingers got it okay yeah yeah but but yeah but i would i would still put the active cases and recover like these cards honestly even on mobile uh these cards i think might be better to put at the top like i would wanna personally yeah i would really like to see that so i think this app is really really good just those few touches like for me it um the functionality i think could be improved a tad bit other than that response like mobile or sorry um how good this app looks the design it's like one of the best yeah yeah very clear very clear all right let's keep going man let's keep going oh what's going on here john anthony babin oh interesting guys but wait if you guys want to check out these projects they are they are right here you can check them out right here i'll put a link right there so you guys just said oh dang i'm matt uh is it me or is it taking a really long time to load it's taking out some time to load either that or i don't know or something or something's going on okay yeah that yeah still a few few good yeah we still have took a really long time to load i felt like yeah okay great uh we got the tables let's go afghanistan nice so same thing with the table so the table is great just searching is like kind of hard to see that there is like this search here which is really small um let's go over the good things first so the great things that i love about this is i like how he went with the cases recovered and that's that looks pretty clean and even the emojis or icons that he used for them look nice the images yeah yeah i mean i like that though i don't i don't i don't like the how it has like that really like that green gradient yeah the gradient is like the gradient i'm not a big fan of that yeah i like i like flat colors and that that's actually very you know flat colors are are very much like in style right now so yeah i do like the fact that he has a hover and active state so when i click on deaths that does stay active yeah this is active too uh stats over time go ahead go ahead go ahead i'm just gonna say i like that the graph is right there front and center so i can take a look at the graph let me actually type in usa that table is really key okay i like that the graph changes right away as soon as i type in usa and it shows me cases and recovered at the same time so that's that's actually really useful because i can see the rate of recovery in cases in the same graph yeah somebody's like 8 out of 12. you know 12. so the number of sudden is 12 i don't know how that happened but oh my bad it's supposed to be 150 go ahead yeah and i do i do love i do love how you incorporate um i think the case is recovering that could be at the top you know the map is not the most important thing right you want to see the numbers right away that is the most important thing right so you know um that could be better and i think that table below that table below um does not fit with all the other things that you got you're like the borders are eh you know so yeah i think it could have made that a little bit cleaner but you know nice job and just i like how you use the real estate which is really good so the whole real estate is is used up nicely by the way guys i just wanted to say thank you so much we are about to hit 10 000 views on this live stream as well that is crazy are you serious it's insane we're currently at 9 500 so guys if you guys want to help us break through the 10 000 just please smash that like button like right now like smash that like button yeah it's just going to help spread this some more you know we're talking about covid we're not spreading covet we're just spreading the love of this app and so more people can actually view it do that that would mean the world to us thank you guys so much let's keep going appreciate it so this is cool let's get out of this app so i mean we want to give it a rating i think yeah i'll give it a 7. damn you went really hard um yeah i think um for me this one just because i got my tables and i can sort by them i love sorting by my tables and um i got the graph so functionality for me is great i think the front end could be improved so i think i'm going to give it a 8.2 just to be above a little eight so that would be mine on this okay damn we got lots to go right we got a bunch who that john that was john john john let's see let's go andreas andreas vegan vegan he's vegan he's vegan yeah nice okay cool holy crap what is happening here okay oh okay that's a big image man you have to zoom in a lot of this one yeah the image is taking over my brain nice i don't like that i have to scroll horizontally on this um i like that there are commas in here but i don't like that i'm getting floating numbers like point zero uhhuh right yeah uh yeah even if you remove just those floating numbers you might be able to yeah i would stretch that a little bit more oh i don't know what is happening with this graph it's just so interesting this is not useful um so great but i think on i think on mine if this is a i would say a six out of ten yeah i was gonna give it a six as well yeah i would say it's six yeah i would say a six yeah okay yeah cool let's keep yeah not finished yeah i would definitely finish it at the very least have something live up and like otherwise just remove it if it's that like awful i would remove it andreas okay cool next um this can't be reached no you you he he gave the localhost link no come on don't give the local host link guys yeah the local host let me just whip it up on mine so you whoa okay guys not good is it the next person this is the next person yeah so you're making me do too many things to fully visualize the graphs please rotate your phone and scroll down if you have problems scrolling the table try clicking on any of the four buttons first oh my god for all oh my god i was reading it right away i have directions on how to use your site period there should never be any directions on how to use a site because they because the usability of a site should be within the site itself they should never be in directions drop in the comments below if you agree with me on that and if you feel like the same the same on that right you should never have to guess or read how to use something it should just come naturally yeah that is um yeah so i would what the hell is all this black stuff at the bottom where i don't know i mean look you can see my screen like look there's like bunch of it's not it's literally like not what's been on yeah click on show graph what is the show graph what is that so it's so cool i mean i'm on imac but that should still not happen show graph um close close graph uh show table hey here's my table let's go man you love the tables man uh this app is too weird to use like it got too creative for me i don't know i'm oh my god oh my god this is too creative for me i'm gonna have to give this a 5.5 out of 10. i'm out yeah i'll give it a 6 out of 10. i get a 6 out of 10. but you know for somebody but you have to understand man but a lot of these people like you know i know albert alvarez is actually one of those success coaches a lot of these people like are really beginners with coding right and this is their first time trying to try now something like this so right even that no no i'm being i'm being um awful just for like the dramatic impact kind of like how simon cowell is you know you know uh what is that show america's got talent but no seriously like it's it's freaking insane guys like the functionality you have to add to make this work is actually crazy we're just for entertainment purposes you know sometimes playing the good cop the bad cop so don't take it to heart we love you we say it all of this i'm using this too we should have use of this as well you know like yeah yeah if it's cool or yeah it's it's all right yeah uh yo i had one of his comments okay it because it literally says was okay cool all right yeah because he's awesome all right so let's keep going my bad abdullah i don't know what happened bro i don't know why you're hidden but we'll bring you back don't worry saba ah okay um i would prefer okay i like that it's taking up the full screen let's go 150 nice i can see everything visually in one place i would prefer country flags next to it um i can't change between recovered cadets and all that i can't click or wait is it just loading or what's happening okay i don't think so they don't even look like buttons guys when i hover over it i like it doesn't even look like i should be able to click on it but when i click on it it works so front end wise it's pretty low like i would not give it that high of a score let's go albania it's fast though is it mobile friendly just mobile friendliness i mean it's the same as what the other ones are so is it more friendly just check that no it's not oh it's not okay i'll give this a 5 out of 10. holy crap so yeah so 6 out of 10 for me great good job but the reason why you didn't get extra points is because it's um doesn't also have and like you didn't really innovate a lot of things on top of it but overall it looks good it has like bunch of functionality come on man you could have just made it mobile friendly you know mumble friendly and just you know already it would have been a few more points but yes friendly guys is key yeah mobile friendly is really important because most of the people are even going to be using it on mobile oh man we're about to get to some exciting stuff guys we just broke 10 000 views thank you so much this is freaking awesome i am pumped about that yes that is pumped epic bro that is epic all right let's keep going keep going let's go let's aj thomas aj thomas actually know aj thomas it's spicy webb spicy web designs or spidey okay let's see what we got here aj thomas nice i got my 4 million and i got my 2 million i like that you got the correct numbers not exactly sure what it's allowing me to click and what it's allowing me to sort oh so i like that the map map yeah i like that i can click it it actually moves puts a mouse here so i can click on peru and then it chooses peru that's nice on the left hand side we'll start to see stuff pop up yo sunny is here hey sunny is here let's go what's up sunny hey guys keep signing some fire emojis guys let's go no stop telling people to give emojis they're going to get blocked on you too all right don't give emojis just just really come on man so why does it say zero cases zero recover today zero debts uk nice i like the little carousel at the bottom i mean functionalities there responsiveness is there um i can click this the do you know you know what i like the the scroll uh the sorting by the countries is not there um but like you know i don't know it seems like an eight out of ten just like a bunch of the other ones yeah i'll get it okay okay who is this aj aj thomas yeah aj eight okay cool um all right let's go on to new one new one what's up new one awesome new one clean yeah clever amman amanda says clever programmer as simon cowell nas domonsky has david uh williams and dev's got talent let's go it couldn't load oh no no devs yeah this should be like a dev's got talent so i like what he did on the innovation of like the recovered worst versus the um live cases you know that kind of that's kind of cool and i can hover over uh yeah all right that's alright and there's no charge it's not just google maps doesn't work but there's also no graph so i can't see growth rates and things like that so this one is going to be a 5 out of 10. yeah sorry but but pretty cool pretty cool try and design yeah should we should we have prizes for like the worst place or is that too mean do you guys think we should have prizes for like the worst place um or just no like you can just tell us no you know that could be a horrible idea in worst place in the first place and the worst place that's hilarious that's andrea i think right andrea yeah somebody said um ashken says kazi honestly your course has helped me a lot and it is worth far more than what you guys charge for it thank you so much i appreciate appreciate that we put a lot of love into that this project was made in the profit with javascript course and should be submitted already that's what yvette just said oh yeah yeah because she's like somebody asked how can i submit their code project um okay so guys if you're catching me some of these i might be like a little brutal just don't take offense i'm just because i'm just going through this fast now uh yeah looking great but just for some reason the style of it like i don't know it looks like one of those like 1999 like html websites you know like freaks me out to look at it like i don't know why there are three exclamation marks saying today's cases like feel like my dad is yelling at me so so guys what you want to avoid is you want to avoid like wide shadows like those white shadows even if you simply just remove the white shadows and you kept just a very simple kind of like nice border like a nice curved uh design and very flat without the white shadows it went a lot better right away so try shadow shadows in general are already like very much nonstyle guys literally just i mean try to avoid it like as much as you can unless you know you have it you have like a hover state or something okay mobile friendliness i mean mobile friendliness is actually pretty damn good not gonna lie great job on mobile friendliness seriously like what um yeah so yeah andrea andrea nice job but yeah i think i think the design could have been a little bit better i mean i do i do okay besides my yelling at the design i like that like the table my table is there i don't like that it's not not sortable i also don't like that that i can't click on it and then it picks those countries so let's actually go ahead and pick usa so search functionality is great nice i don't know what happens on the map there it's a little aggressive but i like that i can see the total cases today active and all that yeah um so so let's let's give it a score and let's let's keep going can we still have a few man i i seven point nine okay i'll give it a i'll give it a seven i'll give it a seven seven okay so who was this andrea right like honestly just the fact that it's usable functionality and then it's mobile friendly that alone already gives it a really decent score you know and then like honestly it could have been the ugliest thing on the planet but like if it has usefulness then that's really good like yeah okay some really creative ones we're about to look at man i'm excited to get to the david one man i can't wait to get rid of all right like i'm dying like that one oh like all right all right let's keep going through this let's see so okay okay cool cool cool cool so let's take a look holy crap that's kind of i kind of like how like kind of pops out like that's kind of nice oh man why are you hiding your tables and stuff why are they hidden they should have been like at the top nice job on them but there should be more holy big tables i can't sort them they should have flags next to them um so they look nice but i think the functionality on it is a little low just because i can't hey there's no search functionality there's no search functionality on this so um i think just because there's no search functionality that alone drops the functionality like crazy of this app so i'm gonna have to give this app a uh a 5 out of 10 unfortunately yeah i would say i don't okay one thing i don't like is like the centered countries like don't try to center that kind of stuff you know yeah that's just that does not look good and it feels a little bit like incohesive like you know you have the top map with you know which with those tabs which is awesome right search functionality is not there but as you go down it just kind of feels discontinued like disconnected you know very different style and everything so yeah i think definitely could have been improved there um on that style so yeah yeah so i would definitely do that okay but nice job other than that great job making the clone of the covid just yeah i those few things i would definitely improve them 6 out of 10 for me let's keep it moving on jonty briggs i don't know about this one this one is throwing me off let me see so go um so i mean yeah it's uh i don't know what's going on here that doesn't look right oh everything's at 10 and now it changed holy crap my computer's about to crash this has gotten way too fast the map is so huge that it's like like i would run away from this app and yeah um yeah so overall i mean let me actually okay so first of all search functionality great job on this when i click usa everything changes to usa nice i feel like too much is going on in terms of like why i don't know why everybody's going so crazy over the map the map is like too much you can make the map really tiny and it will still look clean yeah and the whole and transparency guys guys please avoid that to the your livelihood yeah like oh my god why transparency i think i have to stop looking at everything for a little bit so yeah i think you know the your thinking behind it was you know good you wanted to have the map really cool and what are you doing is this what you're teaching them to make in this course listen listen i said be creative as you can okay so okay um if i speak like a consumer not like a developer as a consumer i'd be like ugh like i feel like i'm on like 1999 html website right when html and stuff was getting developed so that's kind of what i would say from a developer perspective look functionality is great it's useful i can search up countries it shows me them i would get rid of the map or just make it really tiny the tables would need to be prettier the tables don't look pretty and i would get rid of all transparency this thing doesn't even look like it has it can scroll and just adding graphs on top of everything else makes it just too much going on but again if you're new and you built this i mean you're a rock star so nice job but in terms of the actual app i'm going to give it a 6 out of 10 and what makes me give it a 6 and not a 5 is because at least all the functionality is there yeah i'll give it a 6 as well okay this is jaunty jaunty daunty okay awesome all right here we go now we got david riccosi hey let's go david dave are you in the house david let us know if you're not he's he's running the live coaching call for profit with javascript elijah is like that website was too loud for him to handle yeah okay let's see here man i love your tables um that effect is slightly weird just because like it makes everything go invisible like just maybe like a little bit more subtle not not so it blends into the background but i love your color choices like where it says 4.47 million um also i would like it go ahead what that will improve is the numbers they're not aligned they're all all over the place oh yeah what the hell i did not notice that at all yeah so keep your numbers aligned that's part one and make them a little bit bigger because that's like one of the biggest things that you know that is telling that people are going to be looking for so make that a little bit more bigger hey it's like dancing numbers oh i know right what is that song dance monkey up and down and up and down and up and down yeah i don't know about those dancing numbers look i love the dark theme i love the design i like how you're using orange and purple i even love how your table is just the dancing numbers really throw a person off um it's your functionality i mean it looks like if i type in usa it should do it live but it doesn't and i have to it's not intuitive that i have to actually hit enter or does it i mean it doesn't search does it i don't i don't think it works at all oh man i'm taking away all the points for that also what did you do david you had such a great chance to win this what the hell so here it should actually say active cases or something at the top because what is this thirty two thousand thirty two thousand why i know it is is it thirty two thousand like active cases um 32 000 friends i don't know what that number is 32 000 friends 32 000 subscribers subscribe to the channel on that note guys let's go so it's lagging huh it's all good it's all good so yeah i would so that i like how the i like your logos with infected and deaths and all of this there's something about it that just it's very very close to actually really you click on that button recover no the right button right hand side like there's a right arrow button you see that oh i don't even see those oh wow i didn't even know that was there yeah pretty cool um so okay cool i can refresh i don't know what that's for but okay reset okay um okay so that's cool that i could click that button i like how you use these debts and infected icons great job on that those are clean very very very distinct visually so good job on that um another thing is it is very close to one of those like super modern website designs like it looks almost really good there's just certain things give it away i don't know noz can maybe tell you but like when i hover over this there's that little box that's behind it but that box looks like it's too tight maybe if that box was you know a little bigger i think yeah i think i mean it's fine if you want like on the hover but like i think in terms of user experience right for example there's 148 883 i'm not sure what that means like does that mean that new cases new infected or what yeah i mean like like i don't know like if you even if you just simply added a plus in there just a plus 148 right that right away tells me that is plus new numbers or something like that so always think about not just the ui guys but user experience very important yeah and i know you guys you know and if you guys want to you know you know obviously if you guys didn't know right but the way to get to kaz's heart is like literally just you know have a dark theme right so yeah elijah says i think if this site was more polished it would be a great contender for top three now steve i know what you're saying the refresh obviously he goes it obviously pulls the latest stats from the api i don't think that's actually obvious at all and especially to the user they have no idea what you're doing by hitting that refresh so i really wouldn't say that yeah it's not too obvious to me and if it's obviously developers that's okay but again it's end users that are going to be using it at the end of the day so i think that just needs to be a little bit better uh in that regard so for me i would not like even look this graph is like hidden and i don't know why could you have found a graph that had more lines like holy crap like why does it have so many lines in the back i can't even see and it looks like right before this call oh i have to actually look at hot yeah not mobile friendly and it feels like david right beforehand manually with his hands drew this red freaking mark with the marker so like it didn't look like he's pulling from real data this is like david got one um so it's a pretty app but i wouldn't use it ever um and so because of that it like design wise it's really beautiful i would like design was i would almost give it like a 8.5 they're just some design things that are broken but functionality wise it's sitting at a five so for me i'm gonna give it a six yeah i'll give it a seven i'll give it a seven but yeah david user user experience first yes and function yeah user experience and for a person like me some functionality first if i'm coming to the app to learn about covet stats i want to know in simple ways what i'm looking at yeah let's look at what the next app is looks like okay let's check it out interesting okay graph is unreadable awesome okay john anthony is actually on the chat so clean okay let's see what's happening here let's see who's our next victim yo i like what he's doing here on the navigation fancy navigation on the left hand side you know what i'm saying nice i can click it and it goes to a whole different page yo okay cool all right look at that okay let's go back to the dashboard here i like that okay so i like how front and center everything is and it's very obvious for me to how to use it so if i go let's go usa nice i get my infected right there recover that's great now on the right hand side can i sort this i can't sort this can i click i can't click so that's sorted at all yeah yeah so that should be sorted top cases per region that's pretty cool you got it based on oh that's that's actually a nice way to put it for me to go oh crap north america is like screwed south america and then asia and europe and africa like actually it's kind of nice to see how screwed everybody is in a descending order of screwedness except that's true it looks like australia is killing it dang look at that australia is like i think it's just one of my friends that probably has it but outside of that everybody's looking great um global daily cases okay that looks good too i mean okay functionality wise this is as a user i am looking for this i like that you actually even thought about call to action that's actually like advanced and we probably didn't even talk about this but like the fact that you have some kind of call to action because like look what can people do to help and you already thought about that on donation i think that's actually pretty smart because most people who are coming here are looking at how screwed up the world is and then want to find a way to help so i actually really really like that you gave this website a direction because again guys at the end of the day what really matters is is your website either making sales or is your website helping change the world some kind of call to action somehow so uh for me and then it's like looks great on the screen and then let's take a look at mobile friendliness please don't screw up here uh it's a little screwed up oh nice nice it even changes at the top yeah man did you actually did you see something so actually i'll go into big screen go with the bigger screen check this out so you see look at the recovery rate so as you hover over hover over the you know hover over the infected uhhuh you can see the recovery rate that it creates like that shadow you see that check this out no no no no no uh hover over the a country infected number i'm being stupid hold on okay hover over the country infected number okay i'm hovering over here look at the recovery rate um do you see that that circle the green circle i think that so i think that circle is happening regardless of anything at random times no or is it but yeah i think it's random bro like because what what does that 62 percent mean oh i sure don't know my birthday's right up yeah damn he tricked you he got you oh look at that but uh let me see actually what the donate looks like if it's still donate man i gotta say that the innovation on this the mobile friendliness on this the usefulness i mean granted it doesn't have my sorted functionality that i crave but like even this graph is very useful to actually look at i feel like i don't know i feel like i would have to give this a 8.9 in my eyes yeah i'll give it a nine i'll give it a nine who is this top three elijah says top three contender uh 9.5 for this one elijah i really like this one yeah yeah okay cool muhammad says eight what's all says nine wow this is this is great movies is actually one of our uh mauis is one of our success coaches yeah yes he is great guy guys great guy okay how many okay we got a few left okay guys so great job guys so far we've been going at it hard let's keep the energy high so what i want you guys to do is just drop in the chat below how you guys are enjoying this so far let's keep that energy up and honestly if you feel like you need to stand up stand up look at the squad leader and i think it looks like mario so like stand up a little bit and just make sure that you're feeling you know attentive you're relaxed if you need to go grab water or something i got perrier with me you know get something with you because this retention is going to be important for your front end design skills like today what you're learning might actually be able to get you a job tomorrow so stay with us keep the energy high like the video if you haven't already other than that now you got something to say before we just get back to it let's get back to it guys let's get back to it let's get let's get to it all right so let's go and take a look at carlos serrano oh no no no yuga you gurang all right jake says been standing the whole time abdullah says let's dance nas let's go oh all right oh all right let's keep going who what am i clicking on what did i do live all right here we go okay that's a little creepy image of somebody with an underwear on their eyes that i think that i think they're meant to be like a like uh that looks like underwear on my eye it looks like i'm wearing somebody's wearing an underwear where their nose should have been and they don't even have a nose so first who doesn't wear underwear on their eyes first of all first of all it's also not teaching me how to use the mask correctly it's actually teaching me i should put my mask above my mouth so all right anyways let's take a look at what's actually going on here let's click on recovered nice it changes to that let's click on dats seems like it changes to that okay let's go back to total cases covid 19 tracker i like that little virus icon kind of moving up and down uh at the top guys ease up on the animations um and jiff images and all of that just because it slows down your website yeah your animations guys when you do actually do animation here's a here's a really key part listen to this yo what is this why can't i so what is why can i look up multiple countries and stuff you know what i mean like what is that about what does that mean what do you mean what do you mean oh this is probably done wrong yeah you know what i'm saying like yeah that's not right and it feels like nothing is changing unless then it zooms in it zooms into the usa so like if you type in usable zoom into there wait hold on what what gilbert says love your channel quasi love the fact that you make real world projects that a person can add to their portfolio okay cool uh thank you by the way i appreciate that clever programmer simon call yeah so i don't like the fact that those things add on and they don't do anything i thought it would like combine the stats of brazil and usa so that's not good i like that you have flags and everything so that's cool the functionality is a little broken just a little bit not too much but a little broken still just a little broken yeah these graphs don't look good at all at the bottom left i would do something to make them look good man we are hardcore we are hardcore man with our dave's got town literally um i think i think i think here's what i think i think that um for one the transition is a bit too slow so the transitions for example you know when you when you hover transitions can definitely be better right you guys want to keep your transitions and here's the key thing you want to keep your transitions to 0.2 seconds to 0.3 seconds max doing this in code maximum is 0.3 seconds guys ah i see okay that's the key that's a key factor got it this this would be really hard to use on a mobile device just because the countries when you type them in they start to stack on and that's a pretty confusing user experience so overall mobile friendliness is great i would give mobile friendliness a 10 out of 10 on this good job on the mobile friendliness the the app functionality is pretty good just it lacks a little bit on the user experience and then also the design the front end design of it i would give it like a seven out of ten so with all of those combined for me this is a seven yeah i'll get a seven as well actually yeah yeah yeah i do like all the things that you put on that you put on news right i mean this is the reason the only reason i would lower it from an eight to a seven is just because even though it has the same functionality as the apps i gave and ate it actually has a poorer user experience simply because this starts to stack on and then it's confusing what that actually does yeah yeah yeah yeah that's it simple fix but but yeah guys okay so now we got carlos serrano carlos is in profitable shortcut too right i think so uh let's take a look at this okay cool so all right all right i kind of feel like leaving the website already just because it's too dark so if you're gonna keep it something just keep them white it makes me feel lighter even though i like dark mode but i feel like you gotta then do dark mode right because if you don't do it right then you got consequences where people just feel unhappy and like like you're trying to suffocate me and i want to leave right away like this is this is like a you know like like a like a cave you know you go into a cave yeah you know but yeah no i think guys whenever you do this kind of stuff like you have to use very nice like when you if you're doing dark mode grays are very important here you know and what i i think another big thing is like for example the the countries cases is not sorted right so it's not sort of just says afghanistan the top um you know map i do i do got to say a few things i really like is the color scheme which you were talking about earlier nas like yellow the bed recovered uh 89 000 the heart i mean 89 000 is what's recovered so i like that it's blue i mean i if you're gonna make it blue then make also this stuff blue so then it matches everywhere and i like that he's actually using it these uh icons correctly too you know i like the good use of icons yeah but if you click if you click on the actual uh items like the map color does not correlate with the color of the tab yeah yeah i know i know that's what i was saying it's not the same yeah yellow is like blue here and the blue one is like green yeah but you know so that's good and then here i have to like sort it uh or it's not sorted let's take a look at mobile view so i mean mobile responsiveness is solid mobile response is 10 out of 10. functionality let's check like functionality so functionality is there nice um so great so functionality is solid functionality is good i would give functionality like a 8.5 i would give the user experience a you know uh 8.5 the front end design of this though is really weak i would give the front end design a five so for me this would be at a 7.5 yeah yeah i'll give this a 7 actually i give this is seven seven yeah yeah carlos design could be a little bit that design you know again too dark of a design um those those the map is a bit too big right that's not the most important thing when people like you always guys when you think about application always think about what is the main thing that people are going to be doing right the biggest thing on the app is going to be the first thing that people see right so always keep that in mind yeah people are saying it's too dark um yeah steve is saying scroll bars ah so he didn't like it okay cool let's take a look at this one hey at least this is centered so nice okay cool so let's take a look at this so the world is spinning but just remember that it's costing you probably you know the speed of the website maybe or maybe maybe i'm wrong yeah um okay so let's take a look at debts and all of this so i'm just in the start i'm kind of just like looking for functionality so okay nice functionality's there the charts are looking good graphs are there um okay and then countries are there so that's great what i the only things i don't like about it is um i even like the fact that you have testing for coronavirus here i any time you guys put a solid call to action type of thing i think is a huge plus because your website's purpose guys if i can get this through your head it will make you a really really not only an amazing developer but an amazing asset to anybody's team your website should serve a purpose i think it's great that your website can inform people about stats i think that's great too but i think if you put you want to take it one more next level above that is give it make it give people a direction so yeah if you're looking up coronavirus stuff maybe you're thinking about donation so that's one good call to action i would put or you want to get tested for coronavirus so that would be another one so helping people take some kind of action from the data they're looking at is a very very powerful thing you can do yeah i'd agree with that i would agree with that yeah and i do when i saw the quran testing i thought that was really interesting because that right away takes you to google.com and that really takes you to like you know covet or covet testing centers for me so yeah very nice very nice so overall what would you give this nas i'll give this i'll give this an eight it's um would i like this here's what like here's what i like i like the simplicity of it like it's yes it's true easy to look at and yeah you know pretty simple yeah yeah though though for example right the map spinning map you don't really need that um um the cases are not for example are not sorted right so in the table right it's not sorted um everything else is is pretty usable other than that but you know those two things and then oh uh also um the blue background not a big fan yeah another kind of the blue background you know you kind of want to avoid those kind of backgrounds and makes applications look very kind of old stylish old stuff that's why somebody said uh amanatsa amana said this one seriously looks like an early 2000 design yeah that's that's kind of what gives it that look but i mean i got a second you i mean keep going finish your finish your rating and then i'll say mine well yeah i know i think that that was pretty much it like honestly like great job you know but you know make yours not 2000s but you know 2020. you know so what would you rate it i'll rate this i'll write this um i'll give it a 7.5 okay cool what the hell you said you i think you gave it an eight and now you change yeah so okay good so i think on my end what i like about it is the simplicity so functionality wise i mean most of the functionality is there so functionality wise it's like a 8.5 out of 10. it doesn't have sorting it doesn't have like um it doesn't say above the like what it like you know it should have more maybe even information in the tables like recovered or deaths so that is lacking i like the search functionality works effectively so that design wise i even like it because it's so simple and usable so that's good i just don't like the blue background that could be improved let's take a look at mobile friendliness mobile friendliness is pretty much a good ten so great job on mobile friendliness yeah and um and then you got some call to actions there too so for me it's gonna be and you know granted the front end design is lacking it's probably six or seven out of ten for me overall the app is eight got it cool coco okay cool yeah let's keep going guys so guys what do you think in the comments below what do you guys think how much dropped so we had people saying five we had people saying 6.5 yeah that makes sense animated globe is overkill yep i would agree i would take out the animated globe it's too much steve doesn't like the blue background yep yeah yeah our ratings are gonna change you guys they're not going to be perfect looking this is our first time actually doing this developers got talent dude we should actually call it developers got talent literally honestly we should actually call this series look at the parentheses at the end devs got talent let's do that that's yo guys should be like yo guys welcome to another episode of dev's got talent does your app have what it takes we'll find out right after this break is like that's a great idea i love it dev's gotta tell who likes it let's go let's go guys yeah okay cool so let's take a look at this i mean honestly i'm already liking what i'm seeing here i like the graphs and everything boom give me everything in one place i'm a sucker for that i like that your your circular images are also looking good they're looking great the country names i mean i love that it says cases and country i don't like when this over here doesn't say anything that's always confusing to me because i have to figure out what it is then you guys make me read this it's why are you making me do so much work like just say cases above it so that's good it's already sorted so that's good functionality i like the icons he's using and the colors so this color maps the color here maps to this the icons are great for recovered i mean i like the design so for me the front end design is pretty good the news is phenomenal one of the best solid yeah the new one of the best news ones and even be supportive be careful be alert be kind be ready to fight covet 19. i mean that is a great use case of it i did not know that this is actually like vertical scrollable like i don't know either i like it so i would do something with that let me so honestly before i let not speak i'm just gonna actually i'll i'll hold my ratings until the end so now as you you can go ahead and talk about this too yeah so okay so check this out i love i love you know how you you're using a lot of the real estate which is great i love your icons those really small icons in the top left i know they just add some playful to it like it's just some playfulness you know which is really cool they just add a little bit of iphone to the to the desks yeah it's a little bit of playfulness yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so the icons like icons are well no you know what i mean like i know i know what you mean i'm just messing around i'm just messing around yeah yeah yeah so functionality wise it's good i like that um you know the fact that you know you are it's sorted that's really good as well you don't need to have countries and cases in there like you already are saying live cases by country you do not need to have also like the header the table header in there as well you know it's fine people will know that this is the cases because you said like i see what you're saying so like remove this header at the top nice okay yeah that would actually just make it simpler exactly exactly yeah so you don't need that um i'm not a big i i mean yes i like to have everything in like total cases globally the whole map not the whole map but the chart i like how yes it's good to have everything on one total right to have all total cases recover and deaths in there but i think i know i'm a big fan of looking at one thing at a time and then kind of trying to because otherwise it's just it's too much to see what's going on too many things yeah i see so what would you give this i'll give this probably probably i'll give it an eight i'll give an eight yeah yeah um yeah this is honestly uh so i like what elijah says elijah says i get the feeling that this developer used their site a lot during creation the user experience seems pretty good yeah jen oh nice jen actually goes way to go nero i'm a proud mentor so jen was actually mentoring nero in profit with javascript that's awesome mmhmm yeah honestly i would i gotta give it like a 8 to 8.5 i'll just give it a 8.5 just because um i got all my functionality and then it's really good looking on the eyes it's already sorted by the top cases the image for the countries are there i can fully search my stats are there and then the news just the news like most people's news is where you guys fail pretty hard like new york news makes it seem like i'm on some like scam site um because i feel like people kind of are just treating it as like a throwaway but if you do your news right it can actually make your site look even better yeah so good that i i really liked it about this so from eight to eight point five is where i would put this at and the small the small animation when you hover over the news like yeah like it animates up you could you could you could you'd you could download that down just a tad right you don't have to be having it be so much but like a small animation perfect perfect yeah yeah so nice job on this nero great job this is a 8 to 8.5 um okay great so this is nero and then here this is not live not completed but i want to show my effort i mean this is pretty broken when i looked at it um but it seems like he was about to take it somewhere so it could have been cool but um i don't know just because it's not functional i don't think we should even look at it that much yeah yeah yeah no no no yeah i mean i mean it works i love here's well here's where i'll give this guys like the for example that map right the map that you see that map is actually not easy to create that map with like this geography map right there geolocation map but that's not an easy map because it's not from google maps right it is from google maps but it's it's using different you're using a different kind of uh style maps um that style is not the easiest style to create so got it yeah okay i'll give that all right got it i think i'm gonna get out of this one just because we we do need completed submissions to rate it against um okay i think we have went through all of them so what do you think now is it time to make our final decisions guys who's pumped to make a final decision who wants to know who got the first place the second place and the third place and they said maybe we'll do and maybe we'll do who got the worst place yeah a runner runners up so guys remember first place gets five hundred dollars second place gets 250 dollars and then third place gets 100 so guys start putting your winners you know we're just gonna scroll through like the top so if you guys have any winners in mind you guys can drop them down below i think i wanna still kind of decide so i'm gonna take so now as you go ahead and make it take a decision and guys i'm gonna kind of like focus not even that much on the live stream i think i'm gonna kind of focus and decide who the winner is and the nas and i are gonna come together and hopefully make a final decision okay so just be with us imagine there's like who wants to be a millionaire type of dramatic music playing and uh let's go do you have any music playing do you have any music that you could you can play be like no i would love to actually let me see if i can uh honestly i don't know how to and i could really mess things up ah yeah let's not let's not worry about it right now okay let's just play it with our mouth all right i'm i'm taking a look at this and i'm just kind of gonna be deciding you guys can take a look at my screen with me yeah guys drop drop your your three winners in the comments guys who do you think won in the comments let me see i'm just gonna put i'm gonna take a few that i really liked hold on now they're getting all like jumbled up in my head dude no i think there's a few that stand out to me personally um amanot is like can we make a poll at paul eevee.com that actually could be pretty cool but that'd be hard right now and then actually hold on but the question is like who's the first place you know what i mean like the best one guys who do you think had the best one out of all these i'm seeing man i think um man jensen's really good too i they're i'm getting mixed up with them right now they're like getting that chance right there that's right i know i mean yeah i know that i'm just saying like i'm getting mixed up in terms of like i forgot what were the really good points about some of them um people say people are saying nero no no that's frankie okay so okay honestly i kind of feel like that i have um i have my first one um i feel like i kind of got my first one and i'm gonna just slack it to you and you tell me what you think okay and we can kind of decide in slack and hopefully we can come to some kind of unanimous decision on it that would be great but i am thinking this really interesting okay um hold on let me see that's kind of what i am thinking now so guys right now i'm actually messaging nas it's almost the equivalent of like i'm going behind camera to just kind of like whisper in his ear and talk to him so we're discussing this on our private slack channel and deciding who the winner is before we actually announce it live because that's the person who's gonna get 500 and um this is what i'm leaning towards nas let me know yeah i know i know you might be i know like yeah yeah but functionality wise yes it's there yeah i get it i get it what i what i would say is like it's probably something i would realistically use on a pretty active basis i could imagine it being a bookmark on my chrome and i would go to it and check stats and check what's happening like okay yeah i mean i i give i give pretty i give a pretty high score for that one so yeah i would i would say so that could be number one i would say i would agree with you yeah on that yeah let's do that okay all right guys i think so should we announce our first right now but we should do a third place and that was third place second place and then announced third floor i see okay third place first okay got it got it all right do you have anybody for third place yeah i have an idea actually okay cool i mean for third place you have to know second place well hold on so should we should we find out second place and then third place yeah let's do let's do a second let's do second place i i think i already know a second place okay okay so drop it in the chat if you uh yeah say this would be don't say it out loud okay okay let me know when you've dropped it i did okay cool i'll go take a look at it because i'm just looking at some of the apps that are up there already okay if you take a look at it they don't know what i'm talking about one second relax i know what okay okay i think i think that's fair wait wait wait don't show don't show slack you're showing i don't i'm not i'm not you can see it because you're looking at skype on ecam i'm not showing that so don't worry okay okay um so i think second place i agree i 100 agree okay okay um maybe you can give it ratings kind of like how how i gave it for first place like on three different things functionality mobile responsiveness and front end and then you kind of give those ratings so then we can have a good reason for what who why that person got second place man this is exciting this is crazy abdullah is like whoa suspense yeah guys this is crazy oh man okay now i think we're just picking our third place right now so let's take a look i'm gonna have i'm gonna open up a few and i'm just gonna take a look at what's happening on some of the other like i'm opening some of them that i kind of forgot about um guys this is interesting actually this is like literally like this is very interesting style and we got i'm not gonna have it we have and then i would say oh crap i almost showed our slack oh really because i was checking i was checking mobile responsiveness and i uh okay would you agree with me on that what i just sent you let me see let me see without showing everybody um yeah yeah but let's pick uh third place right so let's pick third place so third place for me is between um so oh okay okay i totally forgot about that you know what's funny guys is you guys have no idea what we're talking about but you guys are like just you guys are like on your on your on your toes right now i know yeah jen is like a real nail biter jen you may or may not be one of the people we are thinking about so they or may not yeah okay people are saying we closed our eyes we didn't see slack okay cool so let me see what's going on here uhhuh let me see let me see let me see hold on this is interesting is it though hold on hold on i really have to hold on bro i think hold on that's what i so um you think so man yeah cause i would actually use it dude like i would actually use it i really like looking at it i think the innovation is important but i don't think we can put innovation on that much of a pedestal over like design and functionality you know what i mean so yeah yeah that's important like the design of this is really nice you know yeah i agree i mean the icon the icons the the color theme i would have to go with this one so now you guys know there's icons yeah you do know that so i think i mean what i feel like yeah let's do i oh yeah let's do i think i think yeah yeah yeah let's do it yeah yeah but let's give it like the functionality more responsive in front so guys we have just decided our three winners of this challenge who's ready to know who they are guys this is going to be really interesting actually yep okay i think that's be careful be careful with that number because that number hold on we gotta be careful with that hold on i mean it doesn't matter as long as it's in you know as we just have the positions i think that's important that's okay i think they'll understand what we mean that's fine okay okay they'll understand what we mean that's fine um okay guys are you guys ready we have our three winners uh of who actually won this project and we're gonna start from the third place first if you guys are excited drop it in the comments below rania is like let's go jennifer is like she's like oh man give me 600 guys so we got our three winners i hope that you guys are excited if you guys are liking this so far guys make sure to smash that like button but i think this is the time where we are going to get into our winners now should we get started on this let's get started right now drum roll please guys now guys we have thought about a lot of the people and we just want to say everybody did a great job on these submissions i mean just take a look at these submissions they are absolutely phenomenal you guys crushed it with every project but with that said we still have to actually pick the three winners and so with that said our third place winner and before we actually hold on before we actually say that we are rating these on three different things so let's actually just explain to everybody kind of what's our metric okay we are rating each one of these on three different things one is we'll keep it suspense up i love it i know we're rating this on functionality we're reading this on um mobile responsiveness and then we're reading this on what's the third one nas and and design front end design front end design so like how does it actually look okay so those are the three things we're rating each of these on and based on that we're deciding who the winners are now with that said should we go ahead and announce our first place winner what do you guys think no third place third place winner third place oh yeah our third place winner cool so let's go ahead and do that so in third place who do we have nas we have got drum roll please and that is jen jen congrats you have won third place did an amazing job we loved your project and here's what we gave you in terms of functionality front end so we're gonna go with that and jen gets how much 100 a hundred dollars for her for project okay so uh and now let's open up jen's app here and actually let's take a look at what's going on so how did we rate this nas so here's what we looked at we looked at functionality front end and mobile friendliness right now what are the what are the numbers that we gave uh we gave a kazi in terms of functionality you tell me because i can't okay i have it on we have a nine a nine out of ten for functionality right yeah it's it's easy to use the news are there right right it's clean it's good and so i love the functionality even it's sorted it's sorted by the top countries first that's one of the first things i look at anytime i go to any type of covid app i can see the growth at a global level and really important i want to type in specific countries so for me i would want to type in usa and i can just see that right away and it's super clear so i love that jen said totally made my day love that hey love it love it love it yeah okay so then so functionality it's a nine out of ten nine front end 9.5 out of 10 front end so why is the front end 9.5 out of 10 on this nas yeah so 9.5 because okay so here's what what i love i love how you kept the colors consistent really cool right um colors are consistent and i love the use of your icons it's just like it just makes sense icons are so good yeah they make complete sense right it just makes sense you know the only thing i would fix in this case is like you know you you could make the news better that is why it's not it's a 9.5 instead of like a 10.10 10 out of 10 you know right exactly the news i think could be better other than that it's really good i mean the countries look great the taxi used looks crisp modern i mean it's it's gorgeous it's really really gorgeous um i love looking at it i would actually use this you know so yeah yeah so this is a design wise it did great and then the third one we did it on is mobile responsiveness and which is which is hold on it is very mobile responsive i'm probably not gonna show everything just because our slack messages are right behind it uh with who the winner is but it's very mobile responsive yeah so we give a mobile responsive at 10 out of 10. great job on that right it's you know very remember responsive on mobile and that's the most important thing and yeah so 10 out of 10 on that flawless nice so great job jen is our winner for third place guys give her a big round of applause and drop some love in the comments below no no who is our second place winner for 250 dollars oh man that's gonna be an interesting one guys who's ready to know who's the second place winner guys drop it in the comments and we'll let you know just after the break right now yeah cue the music cue the music wait what are you what are you yeah so are we showing that are we are we gonna talk about yourself you can't see it nas you keep looking at my skype screen nobody can see it right now okay okay good you keep keeping my skype screen yeah okay okay good good good good so our second place winner of the tracker challenge is qazi go ahead our second place winner is tatiana hey let's go tiana she killed it on this one she i think she's not here actually she's not here on this in this in this call but that's all good no worries i'm sure she's gonna be super happy once she finds out that she is the winner yeah so guys why did we pick this guys this app has a really slick design right it looks really nice on the eye the graphics on this are great the icon usage i think is clean i mean i gave it we gave it some extra points for innovation because this is completely different than what nas showed everybody to build so that requires a lot of thought and a lot of effort you guys because nas had thought about that one for a really long time so yeah yeah yeah definitely on that and then um yeah so now as you want to break like maybe we we can go through like what we rated it on each thing so what did we rate it on functionality functionality we gave it an 8 out of 10 and then functionality um you know it's functional in terms of like you've got all the necessary things i love how you have that how you have like for example the total cases and you have the like half that half bar there right yeah um yeah that's there the only thing we just you know why it's 8 out of 10 is just you know the map is a bit too big right right it's you know you don't really need that um yes and and you're only showing the top 10 countries so you know if you show only to all the countries and so forth like that you know that could have made it a little better but um yeah i do like yeah i do like that you have symptoms and resources and prevention like all of that so that's really really good um okay and then what about the front end design of this app front end we give it a 10. wait no hold on this is a 10 out of 10. wait yeah a front end we gave it a 10 on a 10. it did an amazing job it just looks amazing it looks really good like it's just you know it's like it's friendly yep you would want to use this app yep yeah yeah awesome and then on the mobile responsiveness this is a also 10 out of 10. also 10 out of 10. so great job on the design tatiana absolutely fantastic well deserved second place win for 250 dollars so excited to um you know give her this news you know what would actually be cool is if we could bring these guests on that would be awesome that would be really cool that'd be really cool so um if if uh jen you want to come on this guy the show right now you should hit up david rico on skype david hit up david rokosi on on on slack and ask him what our skype name is the reason why i don't want to reveal it on the stream is because then i get tons of like new requests yeah yeah awesome job so guys this is pretty cool right i hope that you guys really enjoyed this and now we are going to be going and announcing the first place winner first place winner guys who is ready who is pumped to get your we take a break right now should we take a break right now all right guys that's good see you guys later take a break all right so are you guys excited about finding out the first place winner if you are smash that like button and drop in the comments let us know we are going to be revealing the first place winner based on the functionality this the winner has crushed it on the functionality and mobile responsiveness and the frontend design if you guys want to take a guess at who this winner is go ahead and drop it below but very soon we're actually going to be revealing the winner yeah drop in the comments below who do you guys think this is before we reveal dev's got talent on devs got talent just a minutes before we reveal it so guys drop that in the comments below think about it you guys see it we had all these projects submitted to us by abdullah rania tommy kelly ahmed jen domagoge and the list goes on but out of all of these we have one winner for that first place of 500 who is it gonna be can you guess one only one stood out the most from everybody else guys only one stood out that's right and our viewers are going up and up i'm loving that that tells me we should keep the suspense going all right guys out of all of these the person who won first place is now as you can tell this is the first place winner guys of the kova tracker challenge for today is going to be are you ready for this are you ready it is kelly oh wow we said that like at the same time holy moly yeah that was perfect timing awesome so let's take a look at this app over here first of all i mean the front end is on point all the frontend functionality is all there but let's go through the list and kind of rate it so nas uh how did we break this down can you can you tell us yeah so functionality wise we gave a 10 out of 10. now why do we give it a 10 out of 10 kazi because guys look what what do you want to know when you go to a website and you want to find out coronavirus stats you want to know how your country is doing but you also want to know how the world is doing and so if i just go here and i sorted by cases that instantly tells me everything i need to know i can also see and sorted by debts and that tells me oh man like uk things are looking bad those are some of the most important things that i want to know but the reason why this gets a 10 and not just an eight or a nine in functionality is why nas why i think you would know why why qazi the search that is the winner on this guys like look at that it's so fast if i go mexico if i go usa if i go brazil i don't as a user the user experience we should have rated things on user experience too i forgot user experience on this is 10 out of 10. so like i can just search up any country i can think of and it's just so fast i don't have to hit enter i don't have to like wait for it to pop up it's just all right there and it's so fast yeah so it's thought out so he thought about the user experience of this application right not just about how it looks whoa tommy kelly is on here is he hey i just i just dropped his comment on the live stream tommy kelly awesome job he says thank you all let's go tommy tommy wait maybe he can get out get on the call as well if he's able to yeah on the skype so take a look at this you guys like i can actually click on france and it opens up that country it doesn't do that weird thing where it like zooms in with the map and like has all this everything becomes slow it's fast if i type in spain boom peru it's fast like it's actually really really useful and i can use this app you know on a daily basis now if i hit recovered or total cases i can actually see the growth of recovery of cases if i do total cases i can see that as well yep and then the news what i really like about the news on this is the fact that he used twitter twitter instantly gives your news credibility it makes it not look like it's a spam or something like an ad because most people's news the mistake they made is it makes it look like an ad this looks like real news it's cnn verified badge i recognize this to be twitter and it makes me actually his news is really the only news i actually really pay attention paid attention to yeah i would agree so i would agree so it's it's pretty easily laid out to where you can you know i can you know like i literally actually just this is the first time like i actually listened i mean looked at the news and like it said hong kong disneyland will close again after surgery corner virus cases like this the first time they actually you know paid attention and read the news on a site like this right so um i think i think that makes a lot of that made that says a lot you know i love the addition of symptoms you know that you got on there just as a helpful suggestions which is great um yeah just overall user experience of this is is really good and i love it really good so we rated it 10 out of 10 on functionality uh now on the front end design this gets a pretty high rating what does it what does this get nas on front end front end we get a 9 out of 10. 9 out of 10. okay um and then what about just like few things like for example this says simpsons instead of symptoms yeah so like just a little you know and like maybe the twitter could be above this instead of just like plus sign thing and then i don't like this banner at all like this banner just kind of takes away so that's why nine out of ten but overall it's very clean and then on mobile responsiveness nas what does this get that gets a 10 out of 10 right absolutely yeah it's mobile responsive it's got no problem at all when you go to mobile it's just so you know it's going to be used on mobile as well and so that's how that's what we look at so yeah tommy nice job man nice job there's you've got some improvements to make you still but nice job very nice awesome so how did you guys like this yeah how would you guys think of this challenge you know for those of you who are in the profile javascript course would you want us to do more challenges like this let us

challenge that you see here today right this is this is what we do within profit with javascript right so if you're ever interested in for example in learning becoming a developer building crazy projects like this being part of develo developer challenges like this being part of a community that you know helps each other grow and you know challenges each other just how literally just how we did it through here right the point of this challenge was to challenge each other right if you want to be part of that again link is in the description guys check it out profit with javascript it is there it is your ticket to becoming a developer right i you know between me who teaches it between kazi who teaches it between sunny who teaches i know you guys know sunny right you guys know sunny right drive some draw some fire first honey you know we are all amazing teachers who are there to help you and to guide you and to get you to another level of becoming a developer so guys you know for

i'm now i'm in the process of paypaling jen you guys oh dang look at that guys this is so crazy how we are doing this all live that's amazing somebody asked a question actually i want to answer a question here somebody asked a question can you become a developer without it without a degree um yes you can a lot of people in our in our course you know do not have a degree a lot of students that i know a lot of people that i know who are developers guys do not have a degree right you don't need a degree to become a developer there we go it's crazy you got it qazi so here's the third place for jen 100 payment has gone through nice nice nice beautiful awesome that is exciting and then and then yeah i think tatiana is not on here i know i know so there we go so tatiana is not on here yet but that's all good no problem i think we can catch a tatiana afterwards and then we'll paypal but yeah hopefully this was exciting for you guys guys we're going to be doing it very often if you want to be a part of this we do this in our community profit with javascript so everybody you saw today and all the projects that they actually had done um it's actually link it go ahead right here so this is the program it's called profit with javascript and in this program you know of course you're gonna get the training the technical training but the really important thing that we do in this program is we actually show you how to earn a killing with those skills so how do you go to upwork how do you go to freelancer.com how do you go to and land your dream job because look coding is going to be important but what's important is you actually being able to make an income and a living with these skills that's where it becomes practical so we want to make this extremely practical for you yeah yeah what do you what do you think about these calls nas are they valuable are you kidding me guys these are if you ask any of our students guys these calls are one of the most valuable things that part of this course is actually we actually have a student literally come in he's like soul rock just says i came in late being in a coaching call with prophet with javascript so he actually just jumped in from the coaching call from javascript but yeah go ahead keep keep tell us about this guys is these coaching calls we have about four coaching calls every single week at this point you know me sonny kazee you know we teach you guys how to go from basically zero right zero to actually you know knowing having amazing projects on your portfolio knowing the good foundation of development and just being ready to go out there and you know into the real world right so and these coaching calls you get to ask us you know direct questions we get to personally talk with you right and you know that type of level of connection right your health you're not gonna get what else yeah you're not gonna get that anywhere else guys and one other important thing i want to highlight for you is the fact that you get a personalized success coach so if you guys remember nero's project is covatracker and i don't know if i have it open but jen who won third place was actually his success coach so every single student in this program gets a dedicated success coach that gives you personalized video feedback on all of the projects that you do wouldn't that be exciting to actually get video feedback on every single thing that you submit like think about that just for a second i mean imagine you built this covet project and you got a video feedback kind of like how we gave you a video feedback so that's i think something super important and then nas you want to speak to the slack community yeah i mean what i was going to get but i don't even get personalized you know video feedback you know as we get here when i was in college right they don't do that for you right so you know that is extremely very extremely important extremely valuable but in terms of guys in terms of you know in terms of the actual community we have a slack community that's around at this point 1500 students 1500 students everybody on there everybody on there is supportive they're there to help each other out they're they're they are there to push each other answer questions ask questions i mean literally if it's literally like a family like a gen gen right there says it's a slack family right it is it is really a family yeah so even if we go here like if you take a look at this everybody's asking questions they're getting their questions answered this is the kovitt tracker challenge that we told everybody to be ready for so you're not going to find a community that's just hands down more engaged and better as like the qua and in terms of the quality it's going to be really hard to ever find that so we give you guys all of this at essentially fraction of a cost of a coding bootcamp but honestly most of the students who have been here they literally tell us this that they're like hey i went to a sixmonth coding bootcamp that i paid ten thousand dollars for and he goes this program is actually worth more this course has given me way more than my sixmonth coding bootcamp so that's just like saying it's insane and but that's commonly what we hear about this program so if you guys are interested then definitely click the link below in the description and check it out um i think you will really be blown away by what we have created if you're serious to any amount definitely jump in the program and join profit with javascript join power for the javascript and if you don't like
