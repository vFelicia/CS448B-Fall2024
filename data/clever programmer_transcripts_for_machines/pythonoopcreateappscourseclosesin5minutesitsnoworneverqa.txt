all right should we keep this hey guys how are you doing all right let's get pumped up oh man this is super exciting uh all right guys we're in the final we're in the home stretch okay hey hey there guys hey all right awesome we got some people coding at moment great stuff I am excited it's okay if you're eating hi welcome welcome back sub bro unheard robot says for the Facebook people you can't see a timer here like the people on YouTube can okay so basically there are 20 minutes left till this course closes and then it's gone okay there's no registration there are no exceptions uh so it's a 20 minute home stretch and I want to sign uh I want to like answer any questions you guys have at this point okay that's what I'm here for cool hat yeah it's my friend's uh friend's mom made it enac what after you sign up once you sign up you get manually enrolled by me or one of our team members like Rachel um who is drowning and enrolling you guys which is awesome yeah she just has way too much work and then we have a few more people who are trying to enroll you guys and they're just like oh my God but Rachel is really the lead there so this is super exciting uh but yeah we we've literally today we've got hundreds of students right we had that webinar earlier in the day at 1200 p.m. we had an email earlier than that we had another email we had another email we had another live webinar or live stream on Facebook and YouTube and right now this is this is it this is the home stretch I mean we are building something exciting like the group the community that we have that we're building we literally have over hundreds of students now it's just such an amazing experience and I really want you to be a part of it like genuinely I want you to be a part of this and help us take this to the next level so really um yeah I I'll do these live streams you know once in a while like I I'll try to do more of these if you guys like them and I'm I'm going to start calling out everybody who's joining right now um also I've got a fast action bonus so for the first uh 15 people who actually joined from this live webinar or this live stream I will send you out this book one of my favorite books that I've used okay um I will send this out to 10 people and I will sign it is that something exciting for you guys would you guys want a book from me signed delivered to your house for free let me know hold on on YouTube I think I'm not sure if it's showing up correctly but now it should be showing up correctly awesome so I'm going to put this away it's called intro to programming by John zel it's an unbelievable book like you create these apps you create some you don't really create like lots of apps but you're really learning the fundamentals of program pring and I think it's a great great book um can it be the first 50 people um no it's going to be the first 15 people that actually get this book signed okay uh so it's going to happen uh for the people who are actually in this Live cast so you're going to you know once you sign up you're going to get the our emails basically to connect with us want you to just tell us and say hey I joined during your Live cast kazy said he'll give me a book I'll sign it well this with this pen right here right here okay and I will ship it out to your home free of charge all right awesome um all right let's see I'm going to start answering you guys's questions I signed up all I see are some videos is that all or is there more there is going to be constantly new content added to the course also the some videos that you see actually are projects that when I give you these assignments it's going to take you a long time to do them so um don't worry about the length it's about the quality of the videos Okay so so the content is very powerful lots of students are getting great results with a student David build an app in 2 hours 2 hours we have a student his name is Dennis he has a website called the happy mindset.com uh he's killing it he already has a job he's doing real really well we have another student his name is David um he built a really cool graphical user interface application he's a freelancer he's actually in slack so you guys can once you join I'm not making these people up you can talk with them okay and I've also put them in my email and he made something for Tobias guitar.com and he basically links his app to it so it makes all of his stuff easier he's using this so then he can actually charge more as a freelancer I think it's a really cool idea that he's learning programming skills to help him with his um freelancing capabilities we have you know obviously the infamous Kitty which you guys at this point all know about she has her website it's called The Savvy coder.com and she built it after joining you know uh after she became part of clever programmer she got motivated she put together her website and now she's also blogging on that website so which is super cool uh Kevin Moreno joined great this is awesome uh Fanny Wong joined a just a little bit before that all right let's see so payment plans there's a threemonth payment plan okay where you pay $33 for three months and the course is yours there is a one payment which is $97 the course is yours again just a reminder the course is about being able to create your very own python apps and 7 days or less from scratch uh you get live sessions you know with all of the students actually there you get personalized emails so just to keep you on track hold you accountable I check in with you you get weekly checkins every Monday okay we're going to be doing a 30 to 60 day Sprint so every Monday for the first 30 to 60 days I'm going to be checking in with you we're going to be sending you surveys and based on your responses the course will be customized for you okay time to take the hat off boom so I think that's going to be pretty cool um yeah okay more questions let's see I'm your follower from from Italy nice Issa how did you learn programming um I learned programming through many different resources which I talked about probably throughout the whole day but I'll just mention them again okay um I learned through corsera intro to computer programming part one intro to computer programming part two principles of computing part one principles of computing part two then I took intro to computer science at Udacity that was really cool then I took some courses at College um let's see a little bit of free code Camp you know team Treehouse I mean everything okay another student just joined I'm going to announce his name great Christian Christian neelsen um awesome if you joined um no so Josh Newman it's not about the first 10 people in the Stream it's actually the first 10 people who buy the course while watching the stream they get this book sent to them okay so that's a bonus for you guys so once you join the course this is I think a 20 $20 you know amazing book and you get it free of cost and you get my signature on there all right uh programming necessary for ethical hacker uh I'm not sure about this question let's see um no no not necessary all right other questions okay another another student joined his name is Frank welcome Frank I mean guys this is exciting like we are in the home stretch we have literally hundreds of students enrolling at this point like we have hundreds of students enrolled this is really cool like we had when we started we didn't have anybody now clever programmer has grown to 10,000 students enrolled in the program we just got another student boom Lamar Roberts you're in I see that right here um Frank van is here awesome guys this is exciting great so you know I'm I'm really excited about this because we are really building something powerful here right we got 10,000 of you guys to enroll at clever programmer and now because of you guys it's a massive thing the YouTube channel is an amazing thing and now finally this course we're getting so many students and we're getting all of you guys and especially with that energy and that whole group like I think we can achieve some really exciting stuff and get really good results whether it's really earning a higher income whether it's you just really want to learn get a deeper understanding of programming whether it is like you want to actually work at a professional job software consultant what consultant whatever it is this course will give you the fundamental tools to start heading in those directions to start getting results and also I focus on getting your return and an investment so I'm going to going to be honing that point in constantly how you can actually the investment you make into this course how you can get that back right right when you get out of this course and again just a few reframes uh and to understand what this course is really offering and to put it into perspective is for $97 you get lifetime access to everything so when I add bonuses and when I add new upgrades to the content and when I add new videos new projects live sessions one one call with you it's free to you any additional stuff is free when this course relaunches it's going to be a higher price and just to put it into more perspective is like thinkful which is an online coding boot camp charges you $500 a month to provide a much poorer experience than what I'm actually offering you and the reason how I know this is I was in the thinkful program and again same thing with Linda corsera and Udacity uh you know they they don't actually provide you the community of other students so this is providing uh you know you with the community of students who are driven dedicated just like you so you guys can collaborate and build something awesome together all right more questions um python was not invented by Google it was invented by Ros some something I forgot his last name or whatever but um basically python is a a very powerful language just in case you guys some of you guys don't know python you know Instagram was built off of python I've said this so many times but I'm sure that some of you guys are new here and don't haven't heard this yet but python you know Instagram is built off of python 450 plus million and growing right and that is based on by inst uh and that's powered by python Pinterest is python you know one of the three major languages used atog Google is python so with python you can make even Android applications using their kyv framework to working at Nasa you know doing data sign stuff doing image recognition doing video recognition doing data analytics or you could be creating games with it or you could just be writing software to automate a lot of the stuff you do okay just some stuff you do for fun all right Alexander Moreno has joined every every time somebody joins we get a phone call here great we got some more stuff um I mean guys the return on your investment is really simple like you teach two people what you learn from this course what you can do in probably a week after learning stuff from this course you can charge those people let's say very minimal you know usually you can start off at $50 an hour but let's say you said $20 an hour you just give them Five Lessons and your money is back for the course okay lifetime access for $97 there's no monthly fee here just lifetime access so again that's not going to be the case the price of this course is going to be increasing um yep so when the time is over the registration closes um I go offline um and unfortunately you won't be able to join the course anymore okay so I'm going to update this and I'm going to say that basically cor closes in five minutes uh Josh Newman it's totally okay if you can't get it okay I'll still be here I'm not going anywhere okay uh this course will be live again for you maybe you'll be ready then plus 99% of my stuff is free on on YouTube and even on Clever program.com so use it and get a lot of value out of it um I would suggest if you are going to be busy I would still suggest get it now because you lock it in at the current price and then you can use it later let's say you just never used it and you even went over the 30day money back guarantee I'll just return you your money because I'll be able to see that you haven't used it okay uh I'm not here to nickel and dime you but I am here to hold you accountable so you can be successful this is not a Magic Bullet everything is going to be perfect course this is we're going to be involved in this course this is not the I'm going to take this and throw this in the trash course this is the we're going to work together and make sure you get your results and achieve your goals course okay so that's why everybody's going to be involved that's why this is so exciting right this is not just your average udemy course you just take throw it in your library of courses all right um so yeah uh I would say lock it in at the current price again 30day money back guarantee right that just should just make it a nobrainer you get it now you don't like it you call me um um and like I say you know I'm going to get upset I'll probably cry a little bit in the corner but then I'll send you your refund um I'll call to I'll call you an apologize and I will give you a one free one hour oneonone session with me okay personal coaching session that's normally valued over $150 for an hour okay you're going to get that for free because I just stand behind you know what I offer that much okay so take advantage of that as well Violeta joined great excited to have you Violeta okay oh Facebook live just fell off all right here we go Violeta just joined uh Violeta Bishi awesome she joined okay yeah there's also PayPal so if you want to do um you know onetime payment you can there's a threemonth payment plan with PayPal you can do debit card or credit card so that works all right let's see what other questions we got uh Ajax if you joined before the deadline which was supposed to be yesterday at 8 or 900 p.m. Central Standard Time if you bought the op course then you get slack Channel for free right now slack channel is $47 okay uh course was not ever free for anybody uh the O python create apps course which is designed to help you create apps it takes you from uh just writing code to actually being able to create full apps so the O course was actually never free from the start uh in the start when I launched it it was $49 and a bunch of you guys missed that time to buy it a bunch of you guys waited and then a lot of you guys actually bought it at $97 price points I was kind of laughing like you know you didn't pull the trigger then and now you're pulling it at what price point when it's doubled and the next time when I launch it is probably going to be doubled or tripled or even more because the value of this courses is going to be unbelievable like and it has already been unbelievable like just one of the students made $1,000 you know just this month from one of our free videos so people are getting results people are students are building their own websites students are booking new clients I mean so the result results are awesome together we're going to make this an even better course we're going to build it together and you know help you get the results that you want so um you know if you're really debating and you're on the edge the worst case scenario you get it and then you can think about okay maybe I want to you know I I would get it now if I was in your situation if you have the funds that's that's what where's the PayPal select same place uh click that link in the you know this is the page and it'll show show you there's a PayPal option just scroll down enough that's the link okay uh the apps that I've created are on GitHub you can see them I even show my apps in videos uh just one of the apps that I show you guys is called agile directions which you guys can even play with most of the apps are built commercially so like you know I can't show those to you guys because they're private software but the other apps that I have they're completely online they're on my github.com and also on my YouTube channels um you know in the description boxes I actually link them so you can click them also on my website when you go to my blog post I put my apps there for you guys to check out all right let's see uh Kiki yes you can always learn for free uh but you just get faster results when you get high quality stuff that's just a fact I bought a $4,000 course it's called zero to launch just a few days ago like few not days ago but months ago um and it's really designed to help you with your business and uh it's really helping it help has helped me scale uh clever programmer like insanely um so yeah there was a price that I had to pay but then the results I got which was was much more unrealistic than what normal people get okay so they're always good free stuff I've always always used it but one hack I used to do when I was taking corsera courses was I would pay $50 before the course even start um $50 for the certificate um so then even though I could have taken the course for free it was so I could be committed to take that course okay so that was just a hack I used all right let's see okay guys uh we are running out of time we have 10 9 8 7 guys here is the book that you get if you join in this stream and uh text book or something to us you will be getting this okay um all right guys that was awesome we had tons of new people join I am super excited guys um while I'm taking this course actually offline some of you guys actually might be able to join but uh very soon it's going to be offline so probably in the next 5 to 10 minutes expect it to be completely offline especially once I go off this webinar I'm going to turn that page off okay that link is going to be unavailable all right guys okay that was exciting that was like a little era that we had uh and thank you guys for being a part of this honestly I appreciate you guys so much for being here for supporting the channel from for being here for a really a long time you know um I am humbled by you guys so thank you shout out to everybody who joined uh we get we're wow we're still getting some more people to buy actually um okay
