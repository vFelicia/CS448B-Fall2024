this Discord bot that you're gonna build can effectively do anything from hey give me five coding project ideas to what is reduced in JavaScript and how do I use it to give me five gift ideas I could get for my girlfriend this thing can handle it all I hope you're excited let's just start building it up right now now if you want to build this app alongside me click the link in the description below it'll allow you to create a new ruffle and then from there you can go ahead and Fork the rubble I have there for you and it's gonna be a blank project and from there you can go ahead and start coding this bad boy up alright so let's just go ahead and get started now we're gonna go ahead and hit create we're gonna create a node.js rumble and I'm just gonna call it chat GPT Discord bot now make sure that you use my replit link in the description below in order to be able to go here and make your own replicable for free all right now here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna go ahead and click on packages and we're gonna install the Discord package so just go ahead and install the Discord package your upload also makes really easy to be able to install any packages these are really simple now I'm going to go to my Discord and I'm going to create my own server here so that's going to be step two go ahead and hit create now I'm going to Simply create a brand new let's go ahead here and I'm gonna go to a new application okay just make sure you're on discord.com developer slash applications now I'm going to create a new application we'll call it chat GPT we're going to agree to the terms of services here now what we need from here is let's go ahead and go to oauth 2. I'm going to create a custom URL here we're going to call the discord.com API oauth2 slash authorize question mark permissions and scope is going to be bought in the client ID we're just gonna copy paste the client ID from the top okay so client ID is right over here okay now we're gonna go and click add bot and we'll say yes do it let's go ahead and give it a photo so we're going to give it this little nice AI photo okay message content intent and let's go ahead and say let's go back to our oauth 2 custom URL let's copy it and let's go paste it and let's see what happens here boom it's saying an external application chat CPT wants access to your Discord so go ahead and say chat GPT add it to the server continue and then go ahead and authorize so it adds it to your Discord server now at this point it's authorized and it should be added to your Discord okay how you know is it saying it at the top right to add it to your Discord yeah now let's go to openai.com Let's click open and let's go to their API we're gonna go ahead and sign up or sign in you could continue with Google or just pop in your email and password go to view API keys and let's go ahead and create a new secret key so copy that secret key that you just created and when you go look at the usage you can see that you got a you got 18 dollars granted by them for free so once you get up to the 18 obviously you're gonna have to start paying but 18 you get for free okay so you should be good for up to that usage so let's go to API keys and let's go back to our replet let's go to secrets and let's paste in our key into secrets okay so open API key that's what we're going to call it and for the secret make sure to paste the secret that you had copied okay the SK at the start represents secret key all right and at the bottom it should be stored there so replit is also really good for handling and storing your secrets this is normally a pain and you have to add it to you get ignore and do all this crap if you add it to riplet you don't have to worry about any of that now we're going to add our Discord key and go back to your Discord developer applications go back to the bot and then go ahead and reset your Bots token and it's going to give you this token so copy that token and paste that in okay so now you got your API key and you got your Discord key now you need to have open AI org so go ahead click on settings and that's your organization ID so copy that and go ahead and add that in beautiful so now you should have Discord key open AI org and open API key those are the three that you should have here okay now in our our index we're going to add the my secret key so go ahead and add that in so process.nf automatically has access to all your environment variables so that's what we're doing right now we're adding all the keys and environment variables let's just change the variable names here so open API key will also have Discord key and then we'll also have open AI org so we got all of those all right now we're going to go ahead and create a client and a Gateway intent okay and now we're going to be actually setting up our Discord messages on our back end so this is we're already on step four so step four out of six are already completed so we're very close to getting this app up and running all right so for our intents we're going to go ahead and create an array of intents and in there we're going to have a Gateway intent for bits and gills we're going to get access to Guild messages okay let's also get message content and then on message create let's have the fall following happen so we're going to add a try catch block and then I'm going to try catch block I'm going to basically say hey if the messages author exists then return this will essentially prevent infinite Loops so this is an important one to add and then we'll just print out the message okay so print out the messages content next up what we're going to do is we're going to say for client login pass in the Discord key let's run this and let's see what happens okay so I'm going to go back to Discord let's see if anything is happening on the top right you can actually see Chad GPT is online right now which is a good sign testing let's try this let's go back and boom look at that we wrote testing in our Discord app and it just popped up right over here so that is a very good sign that thing that looks like things are working all right so now we're going to set up our open AP open AI okay so now we're already on step five of six so we're very close to finishing this thing let's require open Ai and then we're going to create a configuration for this okay and we're going to say for organization we're going to pass in our openai org we're going to pass in our open API key okay and let's go ahead and look at the example so at beta.openai.com examples you can see a ton of examples that people have already built and you could look at it okay so what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and copy that text and we're gonna paste it right here okay there we go right now that we've got this now let's change the prompt so basically all we've added here is this part right here which says this right so you could even type it out manually if you want it to so for prompt we have message content and now we'll add in a message reply here and we're going to basically say hey from response get the initial Choice get the zero Choice and then grab the text from that so let's run this and let's go back to our Discord bot so I'm going to say give me five project ideas and let's see boom there we go so you can see that we're already at this point finished with the app so this is absolutely crazy we were able to build this app in about 40 lines of code and you had your very own chat GPT that you had built using Discord and you create your own bot and now if you can ask it things like hey give me five project ideas or you can ask it a couple of other things like you can ask it questions it'll answer them to you and at this point you should have your very own working bot I'm absolutely mind blown if you want to get access is to the app that we just built click the link below and I have the app completely made in reply it's completely free just go ahead and Fork it and once you're done forking all you need to do is add your own API keys so you need to add your open AI or key your openai key and you need to add your Discord key once you add those three keys you're effectively done I hope you enjoyed the video
