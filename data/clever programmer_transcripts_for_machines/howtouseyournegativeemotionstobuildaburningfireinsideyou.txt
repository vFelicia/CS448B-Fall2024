hey you what is up how's it going this is Kazi from clever programmer calm I want to talk about a few things I just actually got out of a massage and this was the first deep deep deep tissue massage I had and this thing is painful if you were standing outside it pretty much feels like I'm giving birth inside okay my masseuse is just telling me breathe deep and I'm just breathing just like and then they're just like she was just like working out all those knots it's really really painful I actually went at a dumb time which was right after lifting take care of your body take care of your body your body will take care of you and will take care of your mind all right so in this video I want to talk about the concept of using and leveraging negative emotions to drive you versus positive emotions and some of the advice then I'm gonna give you is not the general mainstream accepted advice okay but that's just how I think and I want you to just pick that advice up and and see if it works for you or not okay but I think that this will massively improve and change your life if you apply it and actually really understand what I'm saying and internalize it so let's jump right into it so now you can use positive emotions to make yourself feel better right so you could be like hey and that's what that's one advice that kind of everybody gifts when they're like hey improve in your life and just like imagine it into existence and self manifestation and look in the mirror and say that you're the best ten times twenty times do affirmations do visualizations right in the journal your goals so there's just a lot of advice that people give on thinking about it positively right so now that might work but that could also not work for certain kinds of people and again you have to understand what personality type you are and what works really well for you that's the most important thing because what jives and works well with you now I'll give you specific examples for me negative emotions actually work really well it's not just like Oh fight yeah competition it's more like look at yourself in the mirror like if I'm looking at myself in the mirror just like what do you look like like that's disgusting you've spent ten twenty years like you could have been working out for the last five years and this is what you could have looked like and this is what you actually look like and just like really acknowledging it and just seeing and then feeling it but it doesn't make me cry and I don't just crumble and then I don't do anything about it but rather just like who focuses me it gives me that laser sharp focus because I see I see it and I feel the pain and I let it sink in and then I let it sink in deeper and deeper and then I allow it to move me towards actually starting to take action towards that thing okay I'll go deeper here even starting this clever programmer channel yes there were a lot of positive things right lots of subscribers maybe money ad revenue oh I'll become famous I'll be a public figure maybe I'll speak one day because of it and providing lots of value to the world just a lot of joy and a lot of happiness and changing the world now yes at surface level it sounds really good yes it sounds good yes a lot of people will say that that's their deepest well that's kind of what drives them and pushes them through all the obstacles and everything and it can but for me personally it works but it doesn't work that well so again kind of negative emotions work a little bit better for me so it's like that competition and competitiveness works better so what I was doing was like I would look at online channels other coding channels and I was like how how do these guys have so many views and are getting amazing ratings for whatever and how did these guys even have channels they're so bad at teaching this stuff like they're doing such injustice to the people actually learning this stuff there are much simpler ways to teach it why are they making it so complicated and then the examples that they give are like super obfuscated mathematical examples and if you're a complete beginner what the hell you're not gonna learn like that right you're looking at this like for example if you're a complete beginner wouldn't it be better to learn in a visual way so then when you do something it makes a square or circle and if you're wrong you'll know you're wrong because your code didn't make a circle right and so it's obvious but what will a professor teach you alright guys we will write a Fibonacci sequence today and so if you're a beginner you have no idea where you went wrong was your code wrong are you actually even wrong what was the right result that you were supposed to get is recursion really the thing to be learning when you barely understand how to do a freaking for loop right or a while loop so there were a lot of things like that right that motivated because I saw this and I'm like water people teaching this the right way that's just like injustice it's not fair and I can't believe that people actually watching this and you know a lot of people maybe they're getting value I don't but a lot of people are like honestly getting more confused than actually helped and so that drove my motivation and desire to do it at a deeper level and I was like God like this just can't be happening because how I grew up a lot of unfair stuff happening around me and it's all a lot of unfair stuff happened to my friends so I would try to protect them from those unfair things happening and I cared less about myself and more about other people you know as I was growing up putting that into perspective at my current age and what currently drives me deeper it's like seeing like for example if my friend something unfair was happening or he couldn't stand up you know to his parents or whatever I feel like no like yes you can do this like tell them this or you know there is a way to get out of the situation why are you okay with it why don't you change it like there's so many ways so that unfair on injustice that would happen to me that I tolerated when I was seeing happening to somebody else I'm like I cannot tolerate it this will not happen I'm not complacent with it like it has to change so it's similar when I'm looking at those channels and I'm like no this can't be happening I'm like I need to do it so that this that's why that drives me at a deeper level but maybe you know who knows like maybe you're young and you're like wow I'm gonna grow up and just self manifest into this amazing beautiful person and if it drives you great it doesn't do it for me so that kind of drove it deeper for me and you know certain other like and I would be like wow I need to make a better coding channel and there's so many things I could improve on so let's do it you know let's just jump into it and actually make it happen and then over time you know there are different types of motive they keep driving you but that was the underlying competitiveness that really helped me same thing when I was improving in chess it was a lot of the underlying competitiveness and the fight that actually motivated me and pushed me and if you think of competitions that's the same reason why people improve so freaking fast if they're part of a team and part of a competition because you have that fight in you that energy in you and then you just bring it out and then you push yourself beyond like what you could actually imagine and so it's actually good to have that enemy and have that like I need to get to this level and I need to get past it you know like John Tsongas wasn't really my enemy because I liked actually what he taught and that's why I started my channel but I was like I got to get to that point but when I was starting you know coding 360 I'm just calling it out but I wasn't really a huge fan of his content that was like if this guy can teach Python again no offense I'm like there's so many ways to improve upon this ok he he has good content but I think he honestly can just do so much better and and I was like I can improve on this I can improve on this so in the start it was like when my channel has zero subscribers yes there was a lot of other driving factors what was pushing us like I need to get to this point you know get to dis many subscribers at coding 360 has so it was like that internal competitiveness right it just brought out that competitiveness like alright let's go and then I would just like keep going and then once I beat his channel and it intersected and we beat it right like for example I'd look it up on social blade and social blade would say at this rate you're gonna beat this channel at five in five years from now and I'd be sitting and I'd be like really five years from now watch me get it down to one year in a week or two two weeks you know and so then when I would look at it again because my subscriber growth increased faster it would say okay now it looks so you can beat him one year from now and I kept getting it down so that competitiveness drove me so and then eventually I caught up to him and then I had I said bigger and bigger challenges for myself to appeal to that competitive part in my brain and keep that accountability and that motivation going past just a surface level of whatever else things I want it like a bigger house maybe like take my family on traveling things like that another thing that really drove me was and I've shared this before but like my mom had an accident I couldn't nobody could actually afford her surgery in my family and so seeing that and I'm just like how pathetic is that that you have a family and they're adults they spend their whole life we love this person and as a whole family we can't even afford her surgery I'm like school system is just a scam you get out with hundred twenty fifty three hundred thousand dollar loans you barely have a skill set that people will actually pay you for hire you for you cross your fingers hoping they'll get a job not really and even when you get the job you don't use any skills that you actually learned in the school and the people who are teaching you those courses don't have any skills themselves and they're stuck teaching it or maybe they do but they're not that good usually okay so and it's like charging you ridiculous prices for those classes okay so I was like there's no way that school will actually help me where I need to get to and all for like a below sixfigure income if you're living in America and if you're living like for example right now in LA Hollywood yeah good luck surviving off of like $40,000 a year like barely will cover your rent and then you have to pay taxes on it and then you have to actually do stuff like maybe get a coach or maybe you need to get a car or you have like so many extra bills and good luck if you need a subscription to something or you want to get meal prep or you want to get cleaning or you want actually just even do stuff outside good luck and then you think you'll be able to take care of your family members with that freaking money that where you can barely support yourself how disgusting is that you spend your you spent so much of your life and only enough to barely support yourself is that okay with you that's not okay with me going deeper into those negative emotions and actually poking at the things that drive you and motivate you alright and you're just like I can't hit like this level of complacency I just won't have it okay and just saying it and being honest about it I believe can actually help you a lot right and again maybe this is not the style for everybody okay maybe not everybody learns like this or improves like this but it does help me and maybe it can help you however in the mainstream media they'll never give you this advice so if you've never practiced it or try it you know give it a try like be extremely honest with yourself and don't get into a depressive state don't get depressed you know you're seeing you're like oh man like I want to just cry in a corner now but like exactly specifically see how much you suck at something understand it and then systematically start improving in it you know so if it's like table tennis there's like oh man like I'm just so just coordinated like my hands just can't even move like I don't know what I'm doing and then you know and then just like look at it I'm like oh man I suck so bad and then know exactly how much you suck so here's what I mean pingpong has a rating system and so maybe the best player is like 3000 rated player okay elo rating system the same that chest has the same that actually even tinder has so see what a 2000 level player plays that understand specifically what a 1600 level player plays that and then understand specifically what your rating would be if you played competitively so maybe your rating would be like 200 250 you suck then now that you know exactly how much you suck you could actually is that keemstar yo that was that big back to the point knowing and understanding exactly how much you suck is very important okay so it's like your rating is 250 now you got it now you know exactly what your rating is right and now you can look up material how to improve as a 250 rated player to get to 300 now every advice that will come your way as well will be very specific so yes first it can be very depressing putting yourself in a number oh man but now you have something measurable whereas people in life are just like a leaf in the wind and just like blowing and being controlled by their emotions and you know they'll play pool for their whole life but never actually improve in it or they'll code their whole life but just have a someone skill be at a specific type for their whole life and their typing speed is always the same and it's like the low average or average so why not actually make improvement so now in table tennis when you realize what your rating is what kind of material you could look at to actually improve that was the byproduct of knowing specifically and exactly how much you sucked okay and coming to terms with that and then from there improving and I honestly feel there's like beauty in that so it's like when it comes to fitness you know most people are just like oh man yeah I'm okay I'm average yeah I'm good I'm fine yeah just like okay but like really are you though are you at that level where you're happy with it you know what can your body actually look like if it was at its best ever right how would your muscles look like what would your strengths be at could you carry your friends something happened here why could you carry her if you're falling off of a cliff could you actually pull up and get back there like so many people who don't do a lot of physical activity and they'll like run around a little bit and just like get a cramp in their leg okay that's weird man that's kind of disgusting and so if you tell your brain that that's disgusting there's such a strong emotion such a strong word for example that your brain will be like I'm not gonna be complacent with this behavior whereas if you just tell your brain I like that's okay like if I eat candy once in a while or like I don't code once in a while like that's okay but if you're like no that's that's how my brain thinks okay so this might be aggressive for some of you so just tone it down to your level my brain is like no you're a loser if you don't code or your loser if you're not doing this there's something wrong with you and it needs to change so when I tell myself that it's like whoa it's like a reality check okay and then it actually helps me start doing the new thing and then eventually it turns into a habit and it turns into a system and it turned into something that I can improve forever I don't care about the surface level stuff anymore I'm improving at it in a much much much deeper level and a much much much faster level okay don't be okay with the average okay I know exactly where you are and know exactly how much you suck in the thing that you're doing and then improve don't be pessimistic but just be hyper realistic and then improve from there okay I'm very optimistic person if I'm like oh my rating in pingpong is 250 I'm like I know I can get into a thousand or 1500 within two to three months but then I focus and I improve those skills so if you're working on the table tennis skill set right and you're like first you're just hitting the ball like like this or something okay now you could keep hitting it like this for the rest of your life and you'll never improve or you could just actually watch a video be like okay you know I need to this is like the stroke is like this so then you start practicing right so you're like and what will happen when you start to play like that even though you've played like this for years okay you'll play like this for years but now you start playing like this and what happens completely we'll get destroyed the first few times or maybe even for the first few weeks or maybe for the first few months because now this is a new style that you've actually never tried before and it'll completely throw you off okay how much you can improve with this style has a way bigger ceiling then how much you can improve with this style but this style it's like you'll max out right away but that instant gratification is good but with this style you can actually keep improving and working on your forward stroke for years and improving so maybe in a month to two months you'll catch up to this thing even though it'd be painful in the time being and then eventually you'll just smoke past it and keep improving forever same thing with take it for code then you keep coding the crappy way forever or you can actually start learning new things and keep improving okay so one of the things I've learned is called vim and it was really painful to learn vim I guess if you're a developer or you know what it is you know exactly what I mean what happens when you learn them the first time you're typing sucks you can't write one thing it's frustrating it's like man I just want to go back to how I regularly did things but then what starts to happen you start getting good at it it takes few weeks it takes a month lots of frustration it's almost like getting your left hand to be as good as your right hand and then you get good and then you explode past so now I smoke anybody who just types code or anything regularly because it's vim I can like cut lines pace lines drag lines go to the end of the line go to sort of the line the end of a word start of a word cut two lines take four lines and indent them it's literally magic if you see my screen and what happened what's happening whoa whoa what's happening that's the same thing that you can actually bring into your life you know that's what I do and I'm improving every time and if I'm coding magic coding the same way every time I'm focusing on like newer newer challenges and bigger problems that can actually solve that keep me improving okay but I always know how much I suck at something and then where to improve and I'm very optimistic because I've done it so many times there's so many different skill sets that it's a system and almost anything in life is a skill and you can improve in it systematically okay so leverage your negative emotions and leverage knowing how much you suck at something and don't shy away from it embrace it because it's gonna take you out of that nasty place that's I call complacency I think it's the darkest deepest limbo that anybody can ever be in that's just like being okay okay like oh just hanging out with my friends and oh looks like today I'm just gonna go to Disneyland and oh oh so fun like I like this party and it's cool it's cool to do that and have those types of days but you do this for a week and month and people are just moving with their emotions and feelings when they look back there's not a single skill set that they developed over at that time they haven't made any forward progress but you take actually control and you get out of complacency and how do you get out of complacency by shocking yourself with those types of thoughts honestly you know that's why Gary Vee is has like really dark thoughts he's like hey I imagine my family member like getting killed under a car and he's like it drives me and I'm like oh Sh like I don't want to let that happen I don't know he's he's he's even a little bit more beyond me but it helps them okay so understand what helps you know what triggers you and don't give a about what the mainstream thinks okay use those triggers to move you forward if he puts you in a depressive state you want to cry then maybe don't do it but if it puts you in a similar mmm like let's go like it brings out that fight and that inner competitiveness and that like that domination that things like self manifestation and just think it and they'll come true like Lewis Howes that's why I don't really enjoy a lot of his stuff cuz it's just like pinky and the wisdom and love life I don't know just not me if the dark one doesn't work for you go the Lewis how route right go to embrace the negative emotions and actually use them as leverage those are my thoughts for today that I want to share with you I hope that you enjoyed this video that's it for this video as always I love your faces off I actually didn't say it in the last video if somebody got upset and they're like hey you should say it so I love your faces off and I'll see you in the next video
