this is so awesome i'm excited so we're gonna drop straight into this guys i'm not even gonna waste too much time because this one's gonna be good all right so what are we gonna talk about today all right like i said we've got all these amazing companies right apple google facebook netflix right amazon right these copies are your companies you want to work at right now i mean not a lot some people might not want to work with them but you might um i have personally just like just like a really just a really just a really simple kind of story i have personally interviewed a companies like google i've interviews the companies like squarespace like i've been doing companies like um as well as like khan academy pal interior as well so i've gone through this whole process we're gonna know this process as well but let's get it started so let's go who's ready you ready are you pumped i hope you are already all right so first things first i want to talk about some of the salaries in terms of what we have around you know these companies facebook for example guys it says crazy stuff crazy stuff crazy stuff we have facebook spot facebook software engineering salaries okay from 100 and from 139k to 414k guys that is insane like what that's insane guys so literally that i mean that's a lot that's a good amount of money right and the average salary for a facebook engineer right is about a hundred and forty thousand dollars right as you guys can see right for apple right we have an average salary from can become can be from a hundred thirty six thousand dollars right hundred thirty six thousand dollars to two hundred and seventeen thousand dollars which is insane insane again like i said average base pay is a hundred thirty six thousand dollars next up we have amazon amazon hundred twenty five thousand dollars to two hundred and nine thousand dollars guys and it probably honestly you know we say these numbers but these numbers probably go higher than that right these numbers are just like your average numbers and they go much higher than that trust me um now one thing one thing i want to say is don't expect yourself uh you know i will show these things but don't think that you know you can be making this much money you know and you know in a year or in a few months right it takes time but it's possible because people do it so other people do it they can do it and you can too you hear me yes you can alrighty sweet so let's get this party started let's get it going next up we have netflix uh average salary is around from 167 thousand dollars all the way to a 602 thousand dollars which is just insane as well um insane stuff insane stuff let me make sure that you guys are all good you guys are amazing so good to see you all so good to see y'all in the comments and commenting and chatting with us um thank you thank you for waiting and thank you for being on here thank you for being on here alrighty next up what do we got we got netflix okay we got google which i actually have got that i've actually had the chance to interview google they actually flew me out which is really interesting they flew me out all the way to cali guys all the way to california okay older california um and i had i had the first i had two interviews two three nine of us and then i flew out to california and had about five interviews there in cali as well so that was insane and i'll make sure to talk about my experience there there too okay so after a lot then the job of thing you know we're gonna get you know some money but obviously it's not gonna be easy guys it's not gonna be easy all right next up so these companies that's really interesting part you know the reason why you want to talk about um and somebody asked is this yearly seller yes this is yearly salary just so you know so one thing i want to touch on is the fact that you know these companies a lot of people think that you need to have for example you need to have a degree but you don't have need to have a degree netflix tesla does not require a degree uh twitter does not require degree whole foods does not require degree right google instagram facebook costco netflix do not require a degree guys right so do not get your mindset stuck in the fact that you need a degree that's not that is not right that is not true okay next up so let me ask you this question it's really simple do you want to get a job of thing do you want to get a job at big companies maybe you don't i don't know i'm more of a startup guy you know i like startups so i like to be in startup mode okay but i still want to ask you that question so another question you might be asking is like how how do i do this how do i do this well guys it's really simple all right it's really simple how do you think this is done the the first process that is the most important process is this process guys honestly is you just freaking apply okay i say this because to a lot of people come to me right okay a lot of people come to me and they're like wait nah how do i how do i get a job but you know google right and you know and i asked the question that hey did you apply even no i didn't well that's going to be your first process you need to apply okay even if you don't think that you might be able to to actually get the job maybe you don't have enough experience that's fine you can apply multiple times later on so you can apply now and if that doesn't work out you can apply later okay but don't be afraid that's the number one thing that's stopping you honestly okay so that's that's gonna be the main thing and best way but best way to apply so i know this is a funny one okay the reason why i say best way to apply is through here is through friends i thought this is a really interesting one it's actually because of one simple thing guys okay um the best way to get a job at any company doesn't matter okay it doesn't matter if it is you know i keep switching back because you know i'm talking a lot to the camera because there's a lot of it a lot of this is coming from my experience a lot of this is coming from what i know um the best way to apply for different people is to any company is through people you know because when you apply for people you know right you are a lot more likely to get that job my personally me guys my all of my all of my jobs came from people i know i asked around i asked my friend i asked this guy i asked this person and i say no i got the job because if you have if somebody knows you you're like 80 80 more likely to get the job seriously it is that simple so ask your friends ask ask you know ask your friends as your college friends whatever it might be you know but ask around if there's a way maybe maybe you want to apply for a company and there's one interesting thing that i will talk about later i'll talk about later which is how to actually um apply even if you do not have anybody in your friend group who works at the company that you want to work at right so there's a way just trust me there's a way okay next thing so big question do you need a degree well let me let let's see this look it says this is on google careers okay guys this is a google career said do i need a computer science degree to be a google soft engineer no a cs degree isn't required to for soft engineering or product management roles you see just that guys that gives you a lot of i mean that gives you like i know a lot of you guys might be watching this and you guys do not have a degree and that's okay and some of you don't that's that's that's cool too but if you don't that is still fine that is still fine let me make sure that emblem goes here okay that is still fine so so and actually initially enough they actually removed the the necessity of four degrees not too long ago cool and this is so cool elon musk said this really some awesome things here um so he talked about elon musk he talked about how this is you know a starship career day a starship building you know and he said that this is mainly for staffing up to four production shifts to 2047 operations but engineer surprises and support personnel are certainly needed to a super hardcore work so basically he's talking to the about the fact that you simply need a hard core work ethic a talent for building things common sense and trustworthiness are required the rest we can train this is really this is really good stuff right here right the rest we can straight he even says here don't care if you even graduated high school like what hold on let me make sure that right there there you go i don't care if you even graduate high school all right it doesn't matter guys see these companies are starting to understand finally that that that we don't need degrees that college college is useful especially for like software engineering it has changed a lot it has changed so much that um it's changed to a point of like to a point where where you know we can learn things things online faster and quicker and be more up to date and so that's what even most is talking here about so you're on board with me i hope you are you have you hope you remove that mindset if you don't you need a degree okay so you know just three easy steps guys to to to uh to you know three easy steps i mean i'll delve more deep into things like this but you know apply interview and then decide where you wanna go okay very simple so here we talk about you know um what kind of uh education education uh you know some developers have in general you know a lot of them do have for example like bachelor's degrees right but a lot of them do not have the degrees at all right if you take a look at you know 47 yes do have bachelor's degrees and this is counting for people who actually have answered stack overflow survey right but a lot of do not have a degrees guys most of my friends most of my friends who are developers do not have degrees and they work at big companies just keep that in mind all right keep that in mind beautiful so i searched up on google uh jobs at google south engineers 497 jobs guys that is insane okay i'm trying to show you this because i i want to show you that this is possible okay so let's take a look at a software engineering job at google okay a frontend software engineering job okay really interesting i want to make sure that i can see your guys's comments let me see let me make someone moderate how can i make someone moderator let's go make you add moderate so yuri thank you i see who's going to be moderate on that second guys beautiful so as you can see here what we got we got google and you know when you look at google the kind of requirements what kind of is required for google we have what it does say that there's a bachelor's degree potentially right but or a relay technical field or equivalent practice practical experience so what they are looking for here guys is they're looking here for practical experience this is from a software engineer a google software engineering position role okay when you go to apply okay and they're looking for one year work experience right there that's it one year work experience like this is what as you can see you can see experience developing user facing software so you do have you need to have some projects under your belt of course that's that's what we talk about so much is this is what you guys are building all these clones here on clever programmer right because you need experience of building these pieces of software right right you need you need experience with html css and so forth okay apple same thing okay no degree requirement okay five apple does require a little bit more so five years of software development experience design building complex but you can see they don't talk about here guys don't talk about degree and this is for a full time when you do like an internship if they don't require any like too much too many experience okay same thing for netflix guys does not require a degree okay very important does not require a degree they they are looking for like five plus years of experience but again this is for a full time if you're doing an internship it's going to be you know they don't need too much experience they need maybe like half a year of experience that's pretty much it and they're looking for something someone who's strong in like java you know react which is you're learning that right now which is just epic right no gs and other js frameworks okay facebook same thing no degree requirement guys right this is for a fulltime position you see no degree requirement now this is a little bit small but that's okay so so let's talk about a little bit really quickly right so we talked about right all these companies right and they all um relationship companies and about the possibilities and hopefully at this point you you have a gun to your mind the fact that it's it's possible it's as simple as that it's possible okay so what i want to talk about uh one simple thing but before i do want to talk about someone simple thing i want to let you know really quickly here they have you have a really cool uh free training down in the description if you want to become a javascript developer guys and web developer we have an amazing free training for you guys check that out in link in description okay link in description uh it's really good a lot of people have got a lot of value from it so if you if you thought about becoming a jobs developer check it out link in description um yeah just go there and we'll be all good let's continue on so one of the most important things right obviously when when when applying for companies is your resume and so i want you to take a pen and paper right right now literally take a pen and paper or have your phone ready to be able to screenshot or to take pictures here okay so your resume very important a lot of people mess this part up guys okay very important just simple thing please for the please please please keep it to one page for the love of god one page i see people i know this is i know this is a small a small image guys but this is me trying to show you you need only one page okay one page one okay that is it okay i see people with two three four pages you don't need that why because they don't have time to review that much time recruiters have 15 seconds to decide guys if you they have 15 seconds to decide if you basically have if you if you have the necessary things uh to to even go forward with the process okay 15 seconds i have to decide so please make sure it's one page okay next up next up is going to be let's see structure so structure off of your resume okay this is some really good stuff so make sure you take a screenshot okay and when you do take a screenshot tag me on my instagram which is like right here hey all right continue on so first thing you know and this uh just just really interesting thing guys this is actually my resume right here you can see this is nasa dominsky this is the resident that got me interview companies like pill and tier google i like interviews with companies like twitter and let's see squarespace and let's see khan academy and a few different a few other ones so yeah that's the this is my golden resume all right next up we got so structured like i said okay this is my structure that i use as a structure i see a lot a lot of people use okay um first structure is right here is you have a degree so you can show your degree uh the degree like you have a bachelor's degree if you do not have a degree don't show it you don't need it like i said next up technical skills so show the technical skills that you got okay so you know for example your maybe you know react html css right maybe you know whatever it is you know show those technical skills on there next up projects projects is your should be your up top okay very important some of you said you don't need one page resume anymore i still stick to one page doesn't matter because you can put everything you need on one page okay projects i could be you you need to have on top okay so what projects have you done did you do the facebook loan the uh the you know did you build the react home put those projects up top because people want to see experience that's the most important thing okay next up uh let me go back projects experience experience okay so what where have you worked at and then references so what people you trust who people can contact okay very important next up tips use impactful words what does this mean what does this mean what do you think it means it's very simple impactful words are words that that stand out to a recruiter or sorry i need my water to a recruiter or to anyone else or even to a machine who reads your resume potentially okay what impactful words are things like for example you know i improved a certain product so when you were talking about let me give an example when you were talking about and i'll give this example in a resume that that i kind of have when you were talking about um your experience at a company right let's say you went ahead and so let me go ahead and let me let me let me go ahead i'm gonna use screen brush here i'm going to say for example let's say you went ahead and at a company you went ahead and you where's my screen okay and at the company you went ahead and in the company you um you build a new website build right a website okay website okay you can say i built a website somebody said drinking one gallon of water yes i will be drinking won't get underwater so you can save one building or building um a website or under in your resume you can say something else which is gonna be better okay check this out now you can say now this what if you said what if you said what have you said um improved and proved uh site performance for for performance or what if you said what if you said okay what if you said um added 50 more leads right right through through through a new site right a new site right so what you're trying to do is you're trying to show results because that is what that is what that is what people are looking for that's required they're trying to show results right so increase efficiency right increase efficiency in something whatever it is you need to show results okay increase efficiency maybe um for example you know uh added edit 200 what is it edit 200 new clients okay improve the process okay improved improved the process okay maybe you decreased time decreased decreased process time i don't know i don't know what you did increase process time the main thing is actionable words okay so somebody oh ankit thanks so much thanks so much for thanks so much for the donation really appreciate my friend let me go ahead and let me show that let me show that let me show that for you hold on hold on hold on i'm keep 100 100 100 pesos i think that's what should i i could actually ask the question let me ask you let me show you this question let's see this question here let me go ahead and see this question right here boom boom give me a second here guys boom wait wait wait come on come on ah screen brush hold on guys where is this oh there it is okay i'm back here okay but i'm still not but i want to be hold on hold on give me a second here okay oh wait i got it oh there we go it's all good now anybody know how to quit this hold on give me a second guys check this out okay check this out what can we do can i what can i do what can i do with this one hold on okay there it is i know something has happened that's why thank god it's not quitting screen brush this is very funny oh thank god okay all right i got it we're good we're back we're back thank you for being here let's take a look with me we're back we're back guys okay no we're not back never mind now we're back okay all right we're good all right we're good here we go good all right so before before i go forward before i go forward i just want to go ahead and actually i want to show i want to show my friend here so ankit yes the question you asked the question let's see that's a question of i'm not good what should i do is i feel a lot of pressure at my job i'm worried should i quit and learn and help me i'm a front and react direct developer with one year experience i'm not good what should i do is i feel a lot of pressure what should you do um if what should you do you should just keep going you should not quit oh please god no please don't quit no do not quit my friend uh you need to keep going um honestly very important um it's hard right now it's hard right now but it's got going to get a lot easier you have to kind of push through it you know a lot of us kind of go through this you know imposter syndrome and so forth but once you get past it it's gonna be a lot easier so please keep going trust me um you know ask questions you know get help from others maybe potentially you know take on some coaching whatever you need to do but do not quit okay please don't because i'll be very sad alrighty keep going cool so we talked about impactful words right next thing let's talk about github links so i an under description of your experience of your project if your experiences kind of like how i have here you see guys how i have i don't know if you guys can see this uh easily but i have my projects right here and then my experience is right here okay and then under my experiences right actually i'm sorry under my project you can see that github links right here okay github links so make sure to add all the github links the amount of times that people have come to me have came to me and recruiters have come to me and be like okay yeah thanks so much i checked out your github link and i was able to get a good understanding of what projects you do and what code you write so yeah very important a lot of people miss that part too all right so add github links now let's talk about preparing for the interview this is this was your resume we've gotten we've covered some good resume you've got a good structure now right all is good it shows your resume you know again like i said make sure it's one page and so forth um now let's talk about preparing for the interview okay the perfect interview so google contacts you you're like yo can i please do an interview with you can we do an interview with you like yeah let's do it i'm so happy yeah you know i'm so happy and so step one is you need to start learning algorithms and data structures so unfortunately with every any big company you're gonna have to go through an algorithms algorithms technical interview and i personally hate it i hate it so much but we have to do it like it or not okay and so yeah that's this is uh yep this is going to be not again yep yep we did it again so data structures and algorithms this is this is it's going to be a process for you guys okay it's going to be a process for you in terms of what you need to learn and so forth um now some some things to consider a word to learn from okay a few things uh lead code read code very important tool lead code you can go on lead code and you can actually when you log into leadco you can go ahead and actually select google you know facebook twitter and it will give you algorithm questions based on the company which is really good hackering similar thing okay kraken economy of you you need to get this book you need to get this book trust me okay this is where you'll be learning a lot a lot a lot what happened is everything okay this is where you'll be learning a lot a lot a lot a lot of your a lot of your things so a lot of your uh you know uh you know algorithms are going to become from here especially in terms of understanding it uh this is where it's gonna come from okay so let's talk about what are some companies what companies are looking for in terms of algorithms and so forth well if you look at for example if you look at for example uber you can see they're looking for like dynamic programming uh depth first search this is this is dfs is depth first search so they're searching for search algorithms breadth first search search algorithms looking for math backtracking sorting so one big thing you're going to focus on is you know sorting searching for example through binary search trees okay big manipulation i actually one of my questions came from bit manipulation when i was when i had an interview with pellentier okay sliding window divide and conquer so it's really greedy algorithms right binary search tree is actually a very big one so that's why it's like eighty eight point eight percent next thing microsoft same dynamic programming right depth research you know and so forth again very very very important and you can learn all those things in the book and you can learn all those things through the other resources that we will talk about right right now okay okay let's continue on let's continue on so microsoft you can see interview questions distribution on microsoft trees hash tables okay linked lists right stacks cues all of this you need to be able for example you might be given you might be given for example hey uh you need to go ahead and loop through a linked list okay you need to go and look through the link list and give me the highest number in the link list that might be literally one of your questions and so you need to be able to do that you need so you need to go ahead and understand what to treat what's a hash table what's a linked list what's a stack what's a queue and what functionality or most importantly how do i create create those specific structures okay and you can use it with any language you want maybe that's python maybe it's javascript for me i did it in python because i love python okay because it was easier for me to do those kind of algorithm questions if you want to do all javascript you can do javascript another problem as well okay let's continue on all right same thing uh kind of you know we talked about right top seven some seven algorithms that you know you need to know like this sorting algorithm search algorithms like you know through binary search trees through hashing dynamic programming okay binary exponentiation right all those things don't focus so much like binding expression not so much string matching and parsing yes very important right here very important um probability testing ah not so important now we put the same but some of the things are not important okay so that's going to be a big one for you before i go on though one thing that that i did not put on here is actually going to be what do you think we forgot on here it's something really simple but something so important that my friends is actually it's actually big o notation um big notation so we don't have the line here but big o notation you need to need to know so big o big o notation okay you need to you know what you need to exactly know here's a good picture for you guys check out this cool picture see you need to exactly know right which algorithm so when you go ahead and you do an algorithm you know let's say you know you solve the problem you need to know hey is my solution is that big o of n squared big o of n big o of log n or big o of one now you might be asking what is this i have no idea what what is big o you go just a o right what do you need to know about big go well here's the thing guys okay with big o what you need to understand is very simple uh you need to understand that you need to understand that that uh let me see let me see let me see let me see you need to understand that it's about complexity it's about like how fast does your algorithm work okay so one example here one example here is for example let me zoom into here boom let me open up let me open up the fancy is it option tab screen brush come on oh no that's not what i want there we go okay there you go so here so here for example here okay very important so big o of n is when the function runs in constant time so for example if it's you know you can see here this is a function okay you know it's first element and this simply all it does is it returns an element okay it's just it just returns now that's all it does it's nothing too much okay so it does you know it does one function if you scroll down if you scroll down big o of n big o of n is let's say you have a list now you have a list now oops that's not what i want you have a list now and you look into the whole list and so you're saying that my my algorithm runs as fast as the the length of the list so if my list is a million a million arrays like a mirror you know is a million right um then my algorithm is gonna long run for longer time right if my list is 10 for example 10 you know elements it's gonna run for that long the time it's very important very poor stuff so you can see right the looping through they have a for each loop here and you know that's looping through all the elements that's big o of n now big o of n squared i don't want to get too much interest right big o one squared because squared is like for example is when you go ahead and you have a loop and you have another within another loop right so now you have two loops so you loop it through the loop twice that's where you have big o of n squared right and that makes the algorithm a lot less um a lot run a lot more slower right or a lot longer right you know which you know increases complexity so you have to know these type of things again i don't want to get too much into it but i just wanted you know could just kind of uh lightly brush it okay but this is something that you have to know because obviously obviously what we want do we want an algorithm that goes an algorithm that's this fast or do we want an algorithm that's this fast what's better obviously this one right the goal of n and so that's what they look for they look for can ukraine algorithm that's like big goal when by the way want to save thomas so much thanks let's see somebody somebody asked somebody asked we got wills wills donate two pesos thanks so much so disguises still have 400 js and python courses yes we still have the pipeline courses hundred dollar courses guys there are link in the description to them if you want to check them out okay um yeah we still have the courses and will wilson thanks so much for the donation appreciate it my friend all right let's continue on we talked about what you need to do now let's talk about one of the most important things um one of the most important things you can do to prepare for an interview or something you said it's heroes nonpesos heroes thank you so much cassie all right so one of the most important things you can do is for an interview is actually is it's um it's doing mock interviews so what mock interviews are my friends what mock interviews are is they are simply basically you having a fake interview with someone else so maybe you it's your friend okay maybe it's it's whoever it might be maybe it's your friend or my whatever it might be but it's you doing a mock interview now there's a ton of mock interviews on youtube which i highly recommend you could you go check them out even google for example has one okay how to work at google right there's a ton of uh interviews for example the author of cracking the kona interview right she has an amazing mock interviews crack in the coding interview amazing interviews for example um on google so just in google type in you know cracking according interview um you know click on if you crack in the kona interview a video with dna right here just type it into google and you should be fine okay before i move on i actually i want to address something i'm going to address something really quickly here we have let me see let me see let me see we have someone else donate donate anik ankit donate yet once again appreciate my friend so much and you said sir i felt like doing oh my god okay because you cannot complete your task i'm afraid that i will not achieve anything in my life organization will kick me one day i'm keep listen i'm kid there's only one way you can go about this okay you can you know because ankit is talking about you know he donated 100 100 pesos and he said that you know you know i feel like my audition is is going to kick me out listen a very simple answer for me well actually not so simple but you need to kind of you need to have kind of trust in yourself my friend i trust in you i believe in you and the fact that the fact that you know you the fact that you will be able to solve any any problem or any challenge ahead of you okay like if you look back if you look back you currently have one year of experience okay and you think about you think about what have you done with that one your experience okay what challenges have you went through you've gone through a lot of challenges my friend right you've gone through so many challenges it's insane so if you've gone through those challenges what's stopping you from going through this challenge okay what's happening on this challenge it's about belief in yourself i believe in you you have to believe in yourself too you've got through so many childhoods right you you've pushed right you currently want your experience you already you got the job my friend and now you're saying that you can't you can't do it yes it might be harder but it's okay right take these three steps kind of step back a little bit step back a little bit don't think you don't think so don't focus so much on that you can't do it but focus a lot more on how to do it and how to approach it focus a lot more on that i don't want to take up more time on this right but if you want right if you want to reach me out directly on my instagram and nas dumansky right here i would love to help you out okay reach me directly on here and i'd love to talk to you directly okay so reach me on there and we'll talk anyways guys let's keep going all right so the site the third way to for you guys to practice for you guys to practice um do mock interviews is practice with a friend literally take someone and take a friend and be like okay let's go ahead and do role play okay right now right now you are the interviewer i'm an interviewee and you're going to interview me and you're going to ask a question okay so do role play with that person okay i did that multiple times multiple times right you know and then you can switch it up you know and so forth all right next up next up very important i see this i say this so much guys practice practice practice practice practice practice practice okay practice practice practice practice nonstop okay this is going to be about practice you just keep doing doing do the same thing over and over and over again okay keep learning keep learning keep learning and your your algorithm questions are going to start becoming a piece of cake for you not not kidding somebody said i love your accent do i have an accent i didn't know i had an accent but thank you so let's say you went ahead you went through an interview you went through the whole the whole pro the whole process of like right trying to get an interview and you got the interview boom you got this now what your party your party your party your party okay anyways so i was like so guys interview time right interview time what do we do now so we're going to talk about a few things that i i want you to touch base again really really really fast i want you to kind of write this stuff down i'm going to go through things and i'm going to explain some things for you you know kind of from my experience okay um so one dress clean okay you don't want to look like a bum okay dress clean look like a million bucks you don't have to there's no need to wear a suit you don't need to you don't need a suit or anything like that okay nothing fancy okay but just dress clean just be fresh you know look fresh you know nobody wants to nobody wants to you know go ahead and interview someone or work with someone uh who's just you know uh you know maybe smells bad or something i don't know but ask questions so really important you need to ask questions you need to have for example i had questions prepared okay so you know let me go ahead and i will do this have questions questions prepared ahead of time okay ahead of time really important guys have questions prepared ahead of time okay so you know maybe for example one big question that i like to ask is so you know what team what team are you working for so when you're working for okay the reason why you're doing this is you're building rapport with your interviewer okay maybe i say okay how many you know um how many how many team members members okay you might be asking the question of like okay um what what is your process is your process right what that shows is that you care about things that's going on in the world in in that company you care about that that's very important okay then you might be asking the question okay what's your process maybe ask a question okay you know um what interests you the most about this company about this job what interests you you the most right again you're trying to get you're trying to let me show yeah what interests you the most right you need to get your bullet rapport with with the recruiter very important stuff okay let's go ahead and do this all right so ask questions i had questions prepared kind of you know and then obviously as i was talking about the person i went ahead and i you know i asked more questions depending on how the conversation is going so you have to prepare and kind of um you know well talk with people just imagine the recorder is your friend that's it it's as simple as that imagine the recruiter is your friend next talk slow please for the please talk slow um i say this a lot when in my in my coaching and my private coaching when i when i coach students um i say this a lot guys you know don't don't be like hey guys how's it going guys you know you know i really want to talk about you know this is so cool you know so what you guys are doing it is so awesome uh i really love we know what's going on here you know you know i've been doing this kind of stuff you know i have been working on algorithm questions i have been working at this company this company and i went ahead but we're thinking about that not good right so slow and steady wins the job exactly as lump said real nicely that's really good slow and steady so hey guys yeah so you know for example when you when you get asked the question um when you get asked the question of uh you know so tell me about yourself just like hey yeah so of course so yeah you know about two years ago i went ahead and i started uh working at a company called trandala it's just this is a startup company that kind of you know i approached two of my friends and i asked them if i can work with them you know and they kind of give me a chance that's where i learned my first experience right after that i kind of went to another company where i went ahead you know and i built i built some really cool machine learning stuff right i built a machine learning process to go ahead and you know and predict a number of leads for the next few you know next few months and so forth and so forth so you're taking it slow and steady but you're just taking that you're taking your life and you're showing your experience of what you've done okay that's it let's say no i need to be like because i have some i have some students who are like just go fast fast fast which is okay but you can you can you know talk slow repeat the question okay what does that mean when i keep switching this because i'm talking to a camera and i want to make sure you understand this correctly when okay when you go ahead and they ask you the algorithm question at the interview so let's say they ask you hey now so let's go ahead and you know let's go ahead and sort a list a list of um names okay so sort of list of names you know we have this is this is we have this list coming into a function right we want to go ahead and divide the list initially but then you know we want to emerge that list together and the goal is to return return you know a sorted list you know to back to the api whatever it might be so as the interviewee as me as me the person being interviewed you want to repeat what they have just said why the reason why is because that shows that you understood what the problem is and that rephrases that problem back to your mind so that you can actually think about it more better versus if you just if you just said they're quiet like this like you know you're listening to the other person that's great but it's not helpful for you and neither for the recruiter or for the interviewer so repeat the question so you can say things like for example okay great so um okay i understand you that's interesting so you what you're telling me right now is that we need to take in a list a list of uh of names into a function then we need to split up the list maybe you know into that list we can merge the list back together and then we need to go ahead and sort it of course and i'm thinking potentially using like a a loop to sort this and then we need to return a sort of list right so very important so so did that repeat the question and and then when i said ask questions now for example you can say you can say okay great so they say that and they can say okay great so then then you might follow that up with you might follow that up with a question like for example okay um how many lists of names are we expecting is this going to be a huge list right a smaller list right so how many lists how many lists of items are we expecting right so they may say okay it's not not just it should mostly likely might be 20 list of items right so you start asking questions okay so you can say for example and then you can say for example okay i understand this so we have this and this okay and so since we only have 20 list item lists okay i'm thinking no potential just using just a normal loop without anything fancy and they're like okay all right all right so let's continue on so i'm literally taking you right now this is interesting because i'm taking you through a process that i went through this as i'm talking to you guys this literally reminded me of what what i was going through sorry i'm taking my time this is you know what i was going through when i was doing these interviews because they're tough they're tough i know but you know you can they're doable so like i said repeat the question take time to understand the problem do you understand the words that come out of my mouth do you want to do anybody notice this this uh this is coming from this is hilarious yeah this is coming from russia by the way so um so take to understand the problem okay you can say hey and you can say for example i'll do this oftentimes i'll be for example um yes and devon devon said uh you can drink water during interviews it helps you to relax yes very very very very much that's that's a good point so you can say here for example um things like can i can you just give me a minute i kind of just want to you know think about this and then i'll get back to you here in a second here so you can say things like that right say you know just let me think about this and then and then i'll get back to you in a minute okay no problem okay so take time to understand really what the problem is assumptions really important okay a lot of times actually let me go back to here assumptions right here these are the assumptions i'm talking about so some of the some of the questions might be very vague for you the question might be for example maybe the question might be for example for you is like okay you have two parallel lines on a board okay you need to find you know you need to know actually you need you have two crossing lines you need to figure out where are they crossing that was literally one of my questions at a company called palantir right and then you what you need to do is you need to start talking about assumptions you can say for example okay in my assumption can i assume that um can i assume that these parallel lines you know will always continue on on and on they don't stop can i assume that that um can i assume that these these lines these lines for example i think let me think let me think you know can i assume that the data we can get in about these lines are just x by coordinates right so you can say things like that okay but you have to state those assumptions because then because you because you can't make assumptions by yourself okay that's not good that's not good as a developer you shouldn't be ever be doing that you can't just assume and not be doing it you know just assume things you can't just assume things and then then go ahead and go with them without telling anybody about them that's not the way to use our development okay and so you need to talk about those assumptions very important guys let me go ahead and keep going with this it's not wrong it's your process somebody said uh future code nas what do you say it's good to discuss your edge cases first yeah you can talk about edge cases of course you can talk about excuses those are really important i would say you can talk about yeah talk about edge cases is is good too i like that that's that's a good future code that's a that's a good suggestion i like that yes so it's not wrong it's your process what do you think that means let me ask this question huh what they look for what recruiters look for or interviewers look for when they ask you a question another good question it's not so much about are you right or are you wrong it is a lot more about what is your process are you a good developer are you someone who knows how to divide let me go ahead and do this and just really quickly check this out divide and conquer really simple divide and conquer okay can you divide and conquer can you take a huge problem can you take a huge problem that's right in front of you guys okay huge price right in front of you and then divide it into smaller bits and pieces correctly communicated and then solve it even here's the thing it can be wrong guys i'm not kidding your answer your answer to the question can be wrong sometimes well a lot of times they your answer question it's okay if it's if it's not precise you know the most the most correct question so you just say it's not about getting it right it's all about are you able to break your small parts and solve it yes exactly okay it can be wrong so this is why i emphasize so much about this process this is why i talk about these things that communicate ask your questions okay uh take time to understand the problem okay things like that it's such an important aspect okay here's another one here's this important aspect okay check this one out check this check this one out communicate communicate communicate communicate communicate what do i mean by that so what i mean by that so for example i can so i'm gonna i'm gonna you know i'm i'm going to go ahead and um imagine i'm currently being interviewed okay imagine i'm convincing interviews and somebody rich up i see you you asked the question of nas how do you suggest improving communication skills i got you give me a second here so let's go ahead i am being interviewed and i want to go ahead and i need to go ahead and let me go ahead and bring this up and i'm going to talk about somebody asked a question for me okay let's go ahead and create a loop to you know to loop through a list and and and then and then return and then return a started list so see here's how i would go about this process i'll be like okay great so what i'm going to do right now um i want to go ahead and i'm going to loop through the list of items that is given to me in a function i'm going to loop to this list of items then i'm going to use a sorting function like for example like you know a depth first search and not not that a starting function um sorting algorithm where i will just loop through the elements and then i'll check which element is greater than the other element and this will probably be this will probably be a two loops and because i need to sort them i just sort them okay so they're like okay great so go ahead and do that so now i'll say okay i will go ahead okay so so then imagine again i'm being interviewed this is me being interviewed so i say okay first i'm going to under function i'm going to say function function sort sort sort names right boom function like this oh you can't do that never mind oh never mind sorry sorry about that so most importantly what i'm trying to say for example and then you can say for example i'm going to loop through now so for loop i'm going to loop through the elements so for for um for element in for element in elements okay boom and so forth so what i'm trying to say here guys is main important thing is talk talk as you code talk as you code do you want to see you communicate they want to see how good of a team player are you okay do you want to see you be someone who they wouldn't work one to work with would you want to work with answer this question would you want to work with someone who's just quiet doesn't say anything and be like yeah you know you do your thing i'll just do my thing we're all good just you know byebye you know sounds good i was going to enjoy my water outside no nobody wants to work with that person but they want to work with someone who communicates very well okay that they want someone who communicates very well and so that my friends is what why i emphasize this specific part so much communicate communicate communicate communicate communicate i obsess this part so much guys okay so as you're talking and then um so you already mentioned tell them what you are thinking tell them how you are thinking about solving the problem every minute isn't it right yes exactly tell them what you are thinking how you're thinking to approach the problem everything just imagine your brain is just loud it is a big mouth and you're in the interview and you're the big mouth and your brain is a big mouth it's not about being in here and cooped up this is guys this is not the time to be cooped up this is the time to be loud it's the time to be yes let's go okay that's the time all right it's the time to be allowed to be time to be someone who talks a lot you're allowed to write things out like i said write things out if you anything your assumptions write them out your problem write out state the problem on the board you will have a drawing board state the problem on the board here's my problem blah blah blah my assumptions here are my assumptions blah blah and so forth state all those things i sometimes will even write pseudocode you know what pseudo code is so the code is i have a general basic general rule of what the code will look like basically a general like okay maybe for example you know for example i might say for example like okay first i'm going to start off with a for loop then i'm going to start off with for loop then i'm going to loop through you know next loop through next item okay then you can say for example things like okay check check if next item is greater than the first item oh you know i know i don't see that but just just just listen to what i'm saying the first item and so forth and i'm writing pseudocode right now okay i write that out too so write it out okay but also you know be very mindful all the time because you have 45 minutes to complete the stuff but they like that guys they like this kind of stuff because they like someone who communicates well like i said next up show them you're a team player right right nobody wants to work with an [ __ ] i keep saying this all the time i don't want to work with nassau you don't want to work with an [ __ ] correct you want to work with someone who's good to work with who's pleasant to work with you want to work with someone who want to work with someone who like i said communicates very well someone who does that doesn't have a big ego as that's what they're looking for they're human beings at the end of the day and if you can be a good human being you're gonna get extra points okay and that's it guys right show the youtube player write these things out communicate and so forth and that's it my friends and then what then you're done most likely when i say done actually you're not actually done because you're gonna have to go through a few interviews okay a few interviews and the interviews most of the times for example you might be going through you know you might have you know five interviews back to back okay so one important thing is so for example if you want to take a break you want to take a break you know it's okay to take a break so for example tell the recruiter or the interviewer you can say you can you know ask to ask the interviewer hey can i take a small break or can i take a water break or can i go to the bathroom you know i would do that honestly not just because i actually want to go to the bathroom but actually because i just really tired and i wanted to take a small break and i did that okay and i did that so that my friends is covers kind of what your process should be during the interview do you guys have any questions do you guys have any questions let me know in the comments below and we'll take those questions okay and then obviously one important thing guys keep applying and keep applying and keep going okay keep applying keep going how do you like this uh this uh you know don't just be stuck on one company i have applied to 50 companies when i was applying for companies 50 plus companies 50 different resumes yes it was a little bit insane but i did it okay and you can do it too because if one if one company doesn't it doesn't you know reply to you it's okay if the second comment does reply to you it's okay at some point one company is gonna reply to you but you have to keep applying you have to put in the work that's it that's it guys okay and i'll tell you a small story here i'll tell you a small story um let me see i'll tell you a small story let me go and go on here tell you a small story so um my interview my interview process here's kind of so i went ahead and i applied for a google internship so let's go ahead and let's go through this i'm just going to go through to what my process was okay so let's go ahead and google intern google internships okay so i applied for right there see so i was applying for this right here south engineering internships applied for google here so there's an internship where for example you can see you can see they don't really require any specific degrees or they don't require for you to have any experience honestly and you can apply you can apply right here just as a soft engineering intern right there right there see if you're in college you can be applying for internships even you might not even even have to be in college you can still apply for internships or in california for example right there see apply for an internship uh with my resume and one one really cool thing that i did actually is um i went ahead and and i connected with people who worked at the company yep so i connected with people who worked at ads who worked at the company i want to work at and who and who went actually the same universal who i who i've had some kind of connection with so let me give you this is a really cool thing so let me give you some suggestions right here so one of the cool things you can do so let me see hopefully kazi has linked it linkedin up i hope so quasi it's okay so linkedin all right a really important tool so let's say you're trying you know you're trying to go ahead uh you're trying to go ahead um if you're trying to go ahead and and um uh you know maybe get some suggestions or maybe make connections to other people so i highly recommend that you make connections when you're applying to companies you want to work at you start making connections with those people so you have a linkedin okay this is literally what i did i went ahead and i typed in um so you can see for example from me i went and wait no wait wait there this is me right here there's me you know interesting smile interesting guy pretty cool guy i feel like no pretty cool guy right here's me and i um right i went to university of michigan dearborn okay and what i did did is let's say i want to work let's say i'm looking to work apply a google okay so i typed in google actually i typed in university diversity of michigan of again and it doesn't have to be someone at the same university i'm just giving an example you know dear one okay uh no i want to search for people okay and people and i want to search for no no all filters okay that's cool so you say university for city of michigan this is really cool guys for those of you who are actually universal let's say university michigan it's fine similar thing okay uh let's say and i wanna they are in the comp okay so let's just go ahead and do that and they are they are in and they work at certain companies past companies let's say google check this out site so i said this i want to search for people who are university of michigan and they work worked at google previously click apply boom right there okay now i want to search for someone who's actually like a soft engineer so i want to go ahead and do all filters i want to search for someone who is in the computer software business let's see industry industries computer software for example you know something this of this industry apply okay so you will start to see you are starting to see people who went to the same university for example we have marcy here you access designer marcy here for example see marcy ux designer at booz but it looks like she was a ux writer a ux intern at google okay so what i literally would do this is literally me i will do this guys i am not i'm not even joking here right now okay so let me just turn up the volume a bit let me see can i turn the volume a bit can you guys hear me well now you can see me well now i think so yeah i will literally go ahead and i will contact i will connect and i will message the person i'll message the person and hey be like hey you know i saw that you you want the same university as i did do you mind uh you know maybe give me some pointers on how to get a job you know at the specific company at google right i really appreciate that i literally would do that and i start i start i start making connections i start talking with people and people i'm not kidding i had 90 success rate people were replying to me that guys remember how i showed you remember how i showed you this specific what is it what did i show you i showed you my resume right which was this one where was it or was it right here this this right here one this one right here this resume was built uh because i sent out this resume to different people who i just reached out to who went to the same who went to the same university as i went to but you don't have to people you don't have to contact with people who are at the same university guys okay you don't have to do that you can be you can just simply search for people who are doing the exact same things that you're doing so it doesn't have to be specific specifically at the university you can still search for people who simply are you know working maybe for example if i do all filters and i do like google right current companies at google and you know um and for example you can say things like computer software let's see intermesh technology boom industries that's the industry apply right so for example let me see let me search for a software developer developer software engineer vice president software engineer at google for example you see i know i'm showing actual real people on here but this is just you know this is this is in the internet so i will literally contact her nicely okay i will literally contact her nicely and be like hey um you know it's really cool and she looked like she worked in microsoft too actually and i'll be like hey you know you could you might would you mind giving me some pointers on how to get a job you know as a software engineer at google i literally contacted that person you know through here i mean and i actually remember i paid for premium for linkedin for the specific month okay that's it and that's it guys keep doing that you literally you keep keep keep doing that guys this is some great stuff for you guys let me know in the comments below if you're getting some value out of this like if you are actually learning some new stuff this is some interesting stuff to give you to do let me know down in the comments below devon is like i'm gonna hit this person up right now don't [Laughter] i leave hilarious oh my god so yeah i'm showing you guys this because it's what i've done somebody somebody asked hey can you go ahead and show us a bigger picture of my resume yes i i think i can can i wait can i i see can i show a bigger smear let's see see let's see if i can show a big resume no it's not that's not doing me any good oh look at that as i decrease it increases this oh look at that i think this is a bit better right you guys can see that a little better yeah i think you guys can maybe not the best as you can but you can see here so yeah rachel was like great content honest no i'm not working with google right now no i'm not working with google i'm working with you guys right now you guys can see so you guys can see here this is this is my resume um the way i kind of split split my things up which is really simple you can see all right hold on hold on i'm trying to not show a few things on here hold on you see for example that i had you know i you know i went to hackathon right then you can see my technical skills right here this is my technical skills so for example i had my languages right here i had my frameworks my contents my programs and i listed them out very easily very simply right so this is again my goal here was very simply to okay to get the point across you know in a very easy manner about what i do the next thing you know you can see that i have my projects for example i had an ecommerce project right here so maybe let me see if i can show it to you better through this yeah like an ecommerce project you can see ecommerce project right here we have software engineering ice cream check management system i specified the time when i did them right let's specify what what did i do for example on the ecommerce one i said i led a group of five students to create a recommendation engine using using collaborative filtering okay right then for example for for the python nlt key search cleanser i went ahead and i said parses a person's natural sentence into parts needed for searching i was involved in the whole project from start to finish from researching to creating the script okay and here's my github link very important you see you see how i keep putting my github link and stuff in here see this github link for the relay then i have my experience of course right here you can see this is my date of my experience this is the job and then here's my experience a software engineering intern it's prague llc in troy michigan you can see and one of the big things i i remember i talked about those those and those key words those really like powerful words okay and those powerful words right the powerful one of one of the most powerful words here like that i talked about was like you know impr in increased product based by 100 improve products curation time by 50 right um you know improve search by using python analytics machine learning library all those things right so basically i'm using those very very powerful words and in my resume and that was really important and i of course i specified the link to the company where i worked at so yeah this was my resume hopefully you guys can you know i what i'll do is if you guys want we can do a specific uh or this this could be interesting we can do a specific um we can do a specific live code just on how to perfect your resume because this this resume guys this resume was perfected by so many people by so many like google people at google people volunteer people linkedin i contacted people linkedin i sent my resume to them i sent my resume to people at google a friend at google and so forth and they perfected this resume for you know me i mean i perfect i perfected it from the tips they gave me right so um if you would find something like this valuable let me let me know in the comments below and we'll do a separate live call on just how to perfect your resume do you want to do that yeah i think so yeah somebody said showing grades isn't good idea um no you should not show grades but you can show gpa if you have good gpa if you don't have a good gpa don't show it yeah so if you have a good gpa then yeah but if you don't have a good gpa at the no show but anyways guys that's pretty much it i think that's kind of what i wanted to cover in terms of like specifically specifically you know my whole process but you can see that you know i applied google internships uh then you know really simply what happened to me as i went ahead and um you know they after like a month or two they sent me an email saying hey would like for you to go ahead and do an interview with us i did an interview at first it was just a cracking a coding interview initially where i went ahead and i did a small coding project without actually talking to anybody then i went through that process and then after that process i went ahead and i talked with a recruiter at the recruiter i had three interviews with three interviews technical interviews um then when i passed those interviews guys i passed those interviews so it's a crazy process like i said when i passed those interviews um they sent me and they said hey we would like for you to come out to uh to san francisco california went to mountain view california my bad so i came out to mountain view california this is really cool i'm not kidding guys when you when they when you come out to mountain view california they will actually pay for everything they will pay for your flight they will pay for your hotel they will pay for your food for your uber for anything so this is the best two days of my vacation ever not vacation but this is the best two days of like three days i've ever got so that to me was actually really awesome guys so yeah that was like holy moly that was cool um so i went through that and then obviously interviewed if interview day came prior to the interview i was doing a lot of a lot of practicing from like lead code and hacker inc and so forth so i did a lot of practice through there through that um and like you know like i read the crack and i caught an interview book i was practicing through that very much and what happened up in the end is when the interview time came you know i arrived you know they took my they took everything they took my in my information um at first i talked with someone just in general about about the company about what we got we're about to do and i went straight into the interviews i had my first question my first question i bombed the first question the first question guys i'm not kidding the first question i bombed so badly um it was like it was remember i talked about those those proper those lines that you need to figure out what those lines cross i mean i tried so hard to try and figure it out i just i couldn't um it was really hard for me so like and i kept trying kept trying he helped me out the person helped me out in the end and you know um but in the end i think we kind of like we kind of we solved it we solved it not so much by myself so i wasn't too proud of that but uh but i think my process was good like i communicated everything very well and so he appreciated that so i connect i connected with that person very well then my second interview i did i did pretty good uh my second interview was pretty good i don't remember what question that was but um you know again kind of come in a second person so basically what happens is that let's say you are in a room one person leaves another interviewer comes in then you're done with that that person leaves another interviewer comes in then you're done with that you that person leaves another interview comes in so you have four back to back four yeah four not three four four back to back interviews so it's tough guys it's it's not easy it's tough like you're going to be dead tired by the end of this granted really cool thing a little thing that happened to me personally um really cool thing really cool thing is like uh at the end no actually after my second interview we had a lunch break which is really cool we had a lunch break um and and a googler they call them googler so people who basically people who work at google they come googlers actually took me and took me to lunch and it was so cool it was so cool it took me to lunch and and we went to lunch and i got to talk with the person right i got to talk with the person and i asked and i asked the person oh by the way the launch was free lunch was free and it was amazing because lunch at google is free everywhere so if you work at google you get breakfast lunch and dinner for free what oh devon gray is saying google is giving me five interviews in the same day ah devin yes exactly i feel you bro devin i feel you but awesome job devin you got an interview heck yeah let's do it i love it so but anyways oh this is cool devon that's cool maybe so that's in this case this kind of applies to you this is this is helpful for you like in this case which is good so um yes i went in you know um went in and and i talked with the googler which is really interesting uh we went ahead and and and um and i asked the question really simple question i was like how did you get to google okay and the person said that the person didn't even have a degree there was no degree guys i'm looking interesting so way how she's like so i actually got a job at google after high school after high school so when the person was like 17 years old or 17 or 18 years old they got a job at google what how so they explained well what they were doing is they were they were um that person was was building projects or was helping out projects on stack overflow yep on stack over they were helping out with projects and there was a specific project they were helping out with and google noticed them google noticed them helping out with those specific projects and the next thing you know next thing you know google contacts that person and is like hey would you like to work here boom done done that's it now that person is working at google and has been working for the past i don't know how long a person i was 30 years old doesn't have a degree graduated high school and went to google all that person did was simply showed interest and the ability to do something by themselves in the ability and the the earning this this earning inside to learn to learn and to grow and you know and to you know to help out the company right it showed the company that's what the companies want to see they want to see someone who it thrives to learn to grow you know uh from scratch even potentially right because you know for example you know google do you let me ask this question do you think google actually cares if you know a programming language or python or javascript do you think they care about what kind of a program do you know hell no no they don't they don't care what programming language you know because they can teach you that they care about one how good of a person are you two okay two is is how can you divide up a problem a problem into smaller problems and how good of a problem solver are you that's it that's all i care about okay very important stuff guys and so yeah i talked with that person i thought was really cool we grabbed some lunch and so forth and then you know after that i had two more interviews two or three more interviews two or three interviews i think those went pretty well they told me they let me know you know how things going and then i kind of and then i went back to the hotel and then i relaxed and i eat some good lunch and dinner and and then i flew back home the next day and that was the day guys yeah it was good it was it was great times you know it was it was a good this is interesting process for sure had a lot of fun with this you know interview i learned a lot that's why i'm able to tell you this this my story um and maybe i can you know tell you a more deeper in look into the story maybe in a video in a separate video or something like that but yeah guys so uh that is my story that is how the practical guide to getting it to get an interview at google um hope you enjoyed it if you guys have any questions let me see what questions we got before i go ahead and leave then i said bro i was working a wordpress job when my google recruiter interviewed me they didn't care about the language or framework they want tech skills and experience exactly and experience health my background isn't googly thank you devin as you guys can see devin had that messy let me screenshot this maybe i can show it to you oh here ah oh hold on here devon great bro i was working wordpress job when my recruiter interviewed they they don't care about the language or framework like i said they really they really don't guys focus on the experience focus on uh focus on building projects focus on problem solving okay language they look they can teach you don't worry so devin thanks so much for uh sharing that that's that was much appreciated guys so like i said guys so i would say any other question before i go ahead let me let me see if i have got any any good questions in the end let's see let's see let's see let me see if i get any questions if i don't have i will just go ahead and leave here in a second something captain america said google's perks are just too good i agreed i agreed and actually just interestingly enough googlers will actually bring their families to eat as well so their whole families will literally come like with babies and like you know you know their wife you know or husband right they literally come in and they'll literally like you know just eat together and you if and the cool thing they literally have everything to eat you want tacos you go here you want european food you go here you're mexican you go here you're an indian you go here it doesn't matter they got everything yeah that was cool oh my god i see any questions let me add questions devin actually sent an email to that person that we just talked devin this is funny oh my god you guys yoma of course happy happy enjoyed this somebody said how to be a group good problem solver and kid asked a question how to be a good problem solver and keep that on is just coming from experience you need to learn to take a step back okay you look at the problem as a whole right from the you know for example don't most important thing is do not do not rush into do not rush into solving the problem by the way you now rush into coding that's the most important thing take a step back think about okay okay i need to solve this first how do i divide this whole problem first i want you to solve this this first this first this first and this first okay and then do that and then do it again and then do it again and then do it again and again and again again and again and again and again and then it's gonna get easier for you okay do some research right maybe maybe you need to do research on what i really notice is sometimes when i'm really stuck when i'm really stuck and i don't know like you said you're really stuck you don't know what to do you just have to keep researching you just have to keep searching and somehow i don't know how this happens in life somehow it just turns out to where you find the solution or you get yourself out of that rabbit hole that hole that you just dug so deep in but you got yourself out of it somehow it just i don't know how but it just always happens so you just keep keep doing it keep repeating and that's how you improve problem solving also a good way to improve problem solving is to do algorithm questions just like how you know if you guys want us to do algorithm questions if you want me to do a live call an algorithm question i'd be happy to do it let me know in the comments below i'll be happy to do because i love this kind of stuff you know so you have asked a question i have done some of clone projects using react now i wanted to start job as a junior front developer what will be the approach just approach as i said start applying start apply my friend okay that's my approach that is would be your approach start applying maybe you won't be able to get a job a paid job initially but do not be afraid do not be afraid to um to work for free maybe for a startup company if you cannot get a job at a big company just yet okay do not be afraid to work at a startup company like or a company for free and keith said yes sir please awesome guys so yeah this is this is this is great this is has been an amazing live call and i'm sorry that for the wait i know you guys had to wait quite a quite a while but you guys stuck with me which i really appreciate i love you all and then all i can say is i hope you guys have an amazing day and i will see you where in the next video
