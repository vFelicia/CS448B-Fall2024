day six of building an AAS to 10K a month my cofounder Nas and I decided to leave everything behind and moved to San Francisco to build our Dream SAS we left behind our home family friends and even our relationships first things first it's time to settle into our new home but we realized we got a big problem we found out that our Visions aren't fully aligned Kazi wants to focus 100% on the sasay tool but me I want to still Focus 8 20% on my current business and 80% on the SAS AI to I think that's fair my problem isn't fairness mhm what I'm thinking is what if we got together how much farther would we go and how much faster would we go could we do in 1 month what we would have done in three so if you want to be on this journey with us follow us for day seven
