hey guys what's up this is kanji from clever programmer calm how do you make money in weird ways how do you hire somebody to run errands for you the entire month let's talk about it so this is a question that kind of nobody asked me but I want to answer it anyways because I think that everybody could use some help with this and you know and maybe even learn something I don't know so one of the things that has helped me so much in life is just being very flexible and always trying to dig deeper rather than say like like just I can't or use words like wish which I think I'm you know I talked about in one of the videos so you have to dig deeper than can't and I wish right like when it comes to can't words like can't you just stop right there I want to be able to do this but I can't you just stop right there you are unable to kind of dig and dive deeper into it and find a solution you just limit yourself so let me give you an example let's start with my first story of how I just few minutes before just hired somebody to run errands for me for the entire month wouldn't it be nice for you to be sitting at your job or your school and somebody gets you the food that you wanted from wherever either your home or they picked up food for you from a restaurant your favorite Thai fried rice I love Thai fried rice or you forgot your equipment somewhere or you forgot your laptop somewhere and now you have to drive back five out of ten hours thirty minutes but you can't cuz you're in the middle of something so you need it so I think this is something everybody can use help with somebody who can run groceries for you someone who can run errands for you whatever how did I go about doing it how did I hire somebody from one month okay so I found like I did a lot of research found a website that lets you hire people that run tasks for you this person's hourly rate for a task was 38 dollars an hour which is a lot right that's that's a lot so how are you gonna afford this person for one whole entire month that's not the question I let myself like that's the question I asked how I didn't go that's way too much and just stop looking a lot of you would stop looking right there and even me a few weeks ago or maybe a few months ago would stop looking right there but I stopped doing that so I was like okay no this is the person I want this is the person who looks like I can trust to have good reviews this is the person I want to run errands for me so I messaged them and I said hey you know how's it going blah blah um this is the errand I need to run can you do it he said yes I said give me a shoot and give me a call when do you have time he said I have some time in like two minutes I said okay I got I jumped on that call with him right it was a call started I said hello to him introduce myself I said I'm a crazy youtuber who does coding um apparently people love it so thank you you guys and he said oh you know wow like that's so random that there could be people who have followers for being a coder and we just kind of hit it off off had a good conversation and then I said hey look I'm looking for somebody who can do this not just for one time but over and over again because realistically I'm starving even right now I'm starving like I'm in my office and I'm making videos for you guys it's 700 p.m. and I haven't had food since like 900 a.m. and this is like this happens this has been happening so much recently because for me to get out of here and do something takes like two hours and then come back and in the meantime I can be making more content more videos more amazing stuff for you guys you know either writing you guys interesting emails that you want to open and read if you're on my email list buy a joint enclosure program or making videos for you guys or whatever it is right I have to keep busting out content like this can't stop so going to a place just to get food to cost me time high levels of productivity takes me a long time to get back into into the zone so what's my solution I got to hire somebody who can do it for me but why is there price is $40 an hour or 30 something dollars an hour how do i afford them because if they're constantly doing this that's way too much that's very expensive I want this person to be able to do this seven times a week five to seven times a week like grab me food so that would cost I don't know what would that cost let's let's do the math let's say I want them to come run an errand one time I'm going to do the math right here on the computer 40 times 7 times 4 that's like 1,000 hundred and twenty dollars every month but that's ridiculous it's over $12,000 a year so that's odd crossed my mind because I can do calculations kind of fast but I'm like I'm not going to let that stop me so after I jumped on the call with him I said hey look this is not a realistic budget for me but before I continue on the budget here's what I would like to do I'm willing to be flexible because I know you're running errands for other people as well and so that would be helpful to you notice what I'm doing okay notice this this is very strategic because I'm trying to offer him something of value and I'm trying to speak from his perspective if I just say hey look it's when I gotta fit in with my budget I'm a student global he's gonna be like dude I don't want to work with you but he's not going to talk about anything after that he's just like I'm gonna do an hourly rate so I said hey look I am willing to be flexible you can come here anytime so let's say that you're running an errand for other people and you're swinging by O'Hare Airport you can come to the office you can come to my office and since there's no time restriction you really make it fit in with your schedule so it will almost be like really easy for you and he said Wow he goes that's great thank you so much I said also I am looking for somebody who can do this for an entire you know an entire month that would be awesome so I'm like is there a weekly or a monthly retainer that we could discuss that got his interest that got him talking in his light yeah that seems pretty interesting maybe we can think about that so I said okay and I said look I want this retainer to be seven times seven times a week like you know every single day but realistically man a lot of the times I'm not going to need it every single day like there are going to be weeks where you only come in once or twice so basically it's going to be like a little bit of extra cash for you once in a while but I would just like to have the security and have somebody that I could trust again that's very valuable for him because again I'm thinking from his perspective so he's thinking wow already he's such an easygoing client I'm he's helping me kind of have a monthly raid because usually when people have locked in a monthly rate it's really nice because he's thinking okay guaranteed my phone services paid off guaranteed my Netflix is paid off guaranteed my Hulu is paid off whatever already this is really nice for him then he's also thinking we could just client is thinking of my travel which he's made so easy so that objection is gone he's so flexible and oh look he might actually not even be calling me once in a while and I might just be actually making money without even going so there's already all these amazing bonuses that he's thinking about ultimately I said hey look I'm I can do this for one hundred and fifty dollars a month and what do you think about that you know is that something that sounds reasonable to you and if it doesn't you know let me know we can we can go week by week I can pay you I can pay you in advance and then you can take it from there and by the sound of it I have to still hear from him tomorrow's gonna be the first day is going to deliver you know and run an errand for me so for $150 a month I have a fullon personal assistant or an errand runner and that is very useful because I respect and value my time and my time is you know like what that one hour the two hours or one hour he would save me every day is massive because a lot of people just miss out like devalue their time and misjudge it because when you're not here when you're doing something else for two hours or one hour it's not like you're just doing that thing for one hour you're not thinking about how it's affecting your productivity one or two hours before that because let's say you have to do something at 200 when you're when it's 1200 p.m. are you willing to really get into something that's massive when you know you have to do something like at 200 p.m. you're not you're just distracted by the side of something coming up so that thing that's happening at 200 p.m. is really affecting your productivity since 1200 p.m. or 1100 a.m. and then after you come back now you're tired you got to get back in the zone it's going to take you a few hours again so even if you're doing something at 200 to 300 it's not just taking up one hour in terms of productivity it's taking like five hours of your time four to five hours of your time like it's massive at least for me it's massive I mean maybe some of you guys should come in and like shift gears like that I can't do that so there you go fullon person again I had to think outside of the box for this I you know this stiffness that we have nowadays in society like everybody I talked is you're so stiff and I feel like it's my service to say this to you guys because these things are helping me so much and I guarantee you everybody's going to laugh at you first when you do this like I'm just used to it now everybody it like when I tell this first time to anybody like friends they're gonna be like wow you're stupid you're paying this much I just went from having to pay $1200 $250 and the stuff that I could do in that time trust me is going to make way more than hundred fifty dollars even it didn't I would do it for my personal enjoyment because it just saves me so much time in pain so in terms of like restricting yourself and thinking in these you know boxes it's really important to get out of it because it can be devastating for you you know like money right another one of the questions that others I mentioned start of the video it's weird ways to make money look at how creative this guy is for making money for running errands somebody would just I told you guys somebody on the email was like I don't know if I can teach some beginner programming they don't want to pay me because I'm shy or whatever and I don't think they'll pay me these guys making money like $30 an hour of $40 an hour literally literally driving from point A to point B if you're 16 or 15 and you can't drive there's something wrong with you like it's the easiest thing right so for driving he's charging 40 dollars an hour another thing that I saw was like snow removal people are charging $60 an hour $50 an hour for snow removal so don't tell me that you can't find people to teach programming there's just so many ways to make money there's so many different ways I have been making money doing these things my whole lives like to me this is just natural like for everybody else when I talk to them like for me I get a lot of things and the academic world are like rocket science but you know and but for me like this stuff comes really naturally to me so I hope that this can help you like wherever whatever position you're in this is something helpful let's say you're a college student somebody runs errands for you and does all this for $150 a month you can use that time that's saving you to do private lessons to do somebody else's snow removal for a higher price to help somebody run errands like their groceries or whatever there's a website called TaskRabbit which allows you to actually charge for these services like there's just some bajillion ways to make money and programming is a really really massive one it just comes down to you actually hustling finding the people and making this happen and again for me the bigger things here are freedom and the willingness to say no and just willingness to not say no and always try to say yes in my head and it transcends above money and Present transcends about jobs or whatever else this is how I do things in real life I was scared shitless of skydiving and I didn't say I can't skydive I said ok to skydive what do I need to do so I would do small things that help me get over my fear and then I went and skydive skydive last year being in the dark and closing my eyes scared me so I went into a sensory deprivation chamber and then ended up surviving that for one hour and then that helped me get past so many of my fears so again it's not limited to just money or whatever guys the camera is dying I'm sorry I'm gonna have to cut this one short but there are different ways to make money different ways to think outside the box you can make partnerships as long as you stop saying can't wish just make it happen think I promise you guys can do more and college is not the only resource just one of the resources that's another way people restrict themselves like oh I'm just going to learn from here learn from multiple resources I'm not discouraging academic knowledge I am discouraging handicapping your own brain okay be entrepreneurial and everything in life it's not just about money it's about education money and the lifestyle okay you can be entrepreneurial in all different kinds of ways guys that's it I'm out this is Kazi I love you guys so much and I'll see you in the next video
