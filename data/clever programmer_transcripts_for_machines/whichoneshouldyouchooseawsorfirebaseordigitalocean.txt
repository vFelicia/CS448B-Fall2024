which one should you choose as a developer aws firebase or digitalocean aws is a pretty well known solution but the biggest problem with aws is it's way too complicated as a developer if you've ever tried it you know exactly what i mean i would recommend it for maybe huge businesses but for small developers i would not recommend aws next up we have firebase this is a really good solution there's easy setup it's easy to implement and you have a realtime database however the biggest problem is you're logged into firebase's ecosystem which means that if you want to use sql or sqlite or really any other type of database you can't really use that here your vendor locked in now the last option we have is digitalocean it's fast it's incredibly easy to use and best of all you're not logged into anything and in fact you actually get to whip up your own cloud server online in a very short amount of time and you have your own app up and running and then it's also very powerful and scalable like aws with a lot less hassle it's cheaper and it's much much faster so i'd recommend you go check it out
