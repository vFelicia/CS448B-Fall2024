what's up youtube your front end roadmap to becoming a developer in 90 days this is going to be a week by week stepbystep guide that is going to blow your freaking mind so if you're excited smash that like button subscribe to the channel and let's get right into it so that is right guys bring your nose together make sure you have something to write with very very very important bring your energy guys if you're ready with us drop some fire down the comments as well and let's get started guys let's go let's freaking go guys we want to make sure we just give you value we do this fast and youtube we're going to be announcing something very special today so be on the lookout you don't want to miss out okay stay all the way till the end uh let me take my zoom here out of the way so on youtube it looks a little bit better and uh let's start going okay so roadmap to becoming a frontend developer and this is going to be different than the first day that we did guys because this is going to be a week by week guide so definitely have something to write with as usual go ahead nas no i was saying guys make sure you guys there's a lot of intricate parts in you know in this talk specifically we did a different guide before now we're breaking things down a lot a lot deeper yes tag us on instagram cleverkozynostomonsky and this is your frontend guide so let's do this now let's quickly recap day four we got 6 500 views on youtube 200 people watching us live so that was incredible 30 homework submissions and without any further ado let's jump right into it what's the top secret there's a big top secret that's gonna be revealed today and we're gonna be revealing something we've been working on behind the scenes for quite some time and i think y'all are gonna love it okay i'm excited let's get started with today's training so here we go you're a road map to becoming a friend and developer in 90 days first of all who here wants to become a frontend developer in the next 90 days either raise your hands or drop it in the comments so i can see it i'm really curious guys come on come on come on seeing lots of hands go up fabio anthony nice david zachary beautiful guys this is what we do at clever programmer okay over 5000 students are learning from us and have gotten incredible results we have students that have gotten jobs at companies like spotify amazon sonos microsoft disney paypal blue origin youtube google facebook and the list goes on are there any companies here that you guys would be excited to work for if yes give me put your hands up or just say i in the chat or somewhere so we can see it okay i'm really curious what company would you want to work for if it's not on here what come with your work i'm really curious to see fair enough drop that in the chat as well so we can see it apple yep google apple tesla nice i want to work for clever programmer pedro nice okay beautiful um so guys on youtube we have officially hit over 1 million subscribers which is kind of crazy to say that but we finally hit that goal um and you know we are over in 200 countries with our online stateoftheart education program so just want to say thank you guys so much for all the love and the support um can we get that on mute please oh hold on hold on okay that got really loud okay yeah yeah okay did you admit yourself by the way make sure you i mean yourself yep i'm good okay so according to glassdoor like we showed you guys this is how much a frontend developer makes on indeed there are tons of job openings available as you guys know and we've shown you guys the bs everybody shows you when it comes to frontend developer or becoming a fullstack developer but it's just not true you need to know a few things so here's what we say instead we said the technologies you need to know to become a frontend developer are html css javascript and then the next thing that you need to master is really algorithms and data structures and that's really interesting why why did i structure algorithms i'm curious because it's so freaking important to know these at a deep level because look at this your fancy projects will get you the interviews and then algorithms and data structures and your problem solving skills will actually help you land the job it is your foundations guys right it's like whenever you build a house guys definition that you got right that's the platform if you got a bad foundation that house what happens to the house it falls down yeah we don't want that so we want to have those down really really solid yup that's exactly right and that's why we say going slow is fast the reason why we said going slow is fast can you guys tell us in the chat why you think we might still going slow as fast okay now here's what i'm going to say going slow is fast and that's our slogan because people want to learn all the fanciest frameworks you want to learn next you want to learn like the hottest things you want to learn react and all of that stuff is really really good but if your foundation is weak everything is going to come crumbling down if you actually work on problem solving and you just learn things like javascript really well and really deeply and then you learn react then your skills are really strong and so you might be slow in the start but you actually become a much better developer over time okay exactly what you call this is like you prevent yourself from being a pinball machine right you probably raise your hand here or probably if you're in the comments on youtube let us know in the comments if you've been situation where like every single thing you knew you see you want to do that thing right you go from one technology to another technology to another technology and then you just feel like you're not getting anywhere raise your hand if you feel like that i'm really curious raise your hand up high up high raise your hands if you think you've ever been stuck in tutorial hell where you just go from tutorial tutorial and it doesn't make sense and you get stuck i see tons of hands going up right this is exactly the problem and so now we're going to start giving you the things that you need to master so start writing these down you need to actually master react okay react is going to be a very fundamental key component in you becoming a frontend developer especially if you want to become a react developer okay master this before you move on to things like next or something else yeah and again that's because right these are the core principles right companies will look at you what you know in terms of javascript html css but in order to build large scale applications like we're talking facebook netflix all these other ones then you do have to you know learn technologies like react absolutely learn a state management tool like redux so write the word down state management okay and then you can learn anything underneath the state management umbrella you can learn context api you can learn redux you can learn whatever else is out there but redux is one of the most valuable ones because a ton of companies use it and tons of projects hundreds of thousands of projects depend on redux and a simple way to describe to you what redux is have you ever used an app like let's say instacart or maybe even amazon or something else and you go and you order food right when you're about to go order food and you add it to your cart well nothing refreshes yet it adds things to your cart and if you go back and forth between multiple pages your cart still remembers where you left off right how is that happening and all lightning fast and your car remembers it that's where redux kicks in it's actually managing the state have you ever gone to a website where you hit a toggle button and all of a sudden goes from bright screen to a dark screen that's also state management and redux is at play there even for example you go on facebook guys you go on facebook you log in with your facebook account and then you exit facebook but then you come back it's still there right it'd be a really bad experience if you every time you go to the browser you go to facebook.com and you always have to log in like i never remember a password right yeah so you don't want to do that either so that's why remember redux remember state management very valuable next up is git version control which is like we've told you already so we're not going to go too deep into it but this is your time machine for your uh code and github is where your code goes to live so this is just a little bit of refresher from what we did on day one now firebase is going to be where your data is stored plus you can actually allow users to be authenticated so make sure that you have firebase under your belt because it's a very good realtime database to learn in combination with react exactly and so if you want to build like applications like whatsapp messenger to have like a live messaging you ever wonder how that happens yeah exactly firebase allows you to do that yes absolutely uh now let's break down your journey into next into 12 weeks how you can actually go step by step in next 12 weeks and learn these skills all right so week number one here's what you can write down on your roadmap to do just practice and learn html and css okay and build a portfolio website using html and css so make that your first week's mission all right this is very doable and you can make a you know portfolio that looks like this or you can model something that looks good you know something that you like but you can take a screenshot of this right now if you want because this can be a really good portfolio project for you to do okay i'm going to give you guys five seconds to take a screenshot of this five four three two one okay mark winters i'm going to read his comments my main reason honestly for switching was because there isn't as much enthusiasm in other languages you guys are in fire and make react interesting awesome thank you yup um cool all right moving on this design is from dribbble.com and dribble with three b's cool yeah and if you know by the way by the way guys if you want to find some really good uh you know portfolio websites where where you know where to get them like joe.com is a good not a good one the fundamentals was a really good one as well another uh good website you can see absolutely portfolio building just copy them you just like copy them slash you know build on top of them yeah exactly now learning the fundamentals of javascript is going to be your week two all right that's what we're moving on to week two so write this down learn the fundamentals of javascript so when we say fundamentals these are like the core for example you know what's a variable uh how do you add two numbers together what happens what's a string what's an array what's a object how do you write a loop how do you write a for loop how do you write a while loop what's an if else condition all these things are the fundamental building blocks of javascript and most computer science and programming languages so you need to understand them really well before you start going to more advanced things even if that's react okay that's that comes later and i think it's very important because like you know a lot of students tell me a lot of people told me hey nas i know html no css i'm a developer now this is easy stuff i'm like oh you haven't gone to the real stuff yet right so like raise your hand i'm really curious if all of you guys maybe some of you guys have no html css yet i mean anybody here know html css beautiful beautiful right your next step right or no matter what it is right no matter where you're at your next is going to be like to learn those javascript concepts as well absolutely um so like we're going to write them out here as well right variables conditionals arrays objects functions for loops dom manipulation so if you want to take a screenshot of that uh you can so i'll go here five four three two one okay awesome so now week three should look like this week three should be a combination of html css and javascript in your learning program that you do for yourself okay and you should build a clock app using html css and javascript that should be your week three's plan all right so that clock app actually can look something like this it's a very cool app it's 11 37 and then i'll go 11 38 11 39 11 40. but when it hits 12 now it goes back to 1201 1202 it doesn't go you know 11 62. so you need to learn how to be able to do that with javascript and html and css okay beautiful let's let you guys know we actually got this project from fundamental guys right so a lot of these products that we talk about they're they are out there right the designs are out there you just you can just use them inspiration and just build on top of that right there's so many things just have to kind of put in the work now at this point yes absolutely so let's keep on rocking and rolling here okay frontend mentor now this is your week four okay and let me know if i'm going too fast guys for you but this is gonna be week four so week four is to be html css javascript and what we want you to do is build a beatbox app beatbox app using objects in javascript so this is a fun one guys this is a fun one basically whenever you click on any button for example asd it's actually gonna play music it's fun for the kids a lot of students that we have actually used it with kids and they had a ton of fun so how like when you guys build this one as well yeah it's really cool you can play music right so whatever you play we have melissa on this live call and she made a beatbox app that made sounds of goats so you would hit g and it goes you hit h it's like like different goat sounds so you can do whatever you want um you can have it play like beats and all of that but this is going gonna really help you learn how javascript works what's uh event listener how do you connect event listener to buttons to your keyboard when you press h music plays how do you do that so it really will help you learn some core fundamental concepts yeah and one last thing guys is this simple nap actually will actually teach you something called object and write this down guys object oriented programming because you might have to use classes and such such a thing right so objective program one of the most important content you need to learn to actually get a job as well so this project will actually teach you that too yes absolutely here comes week five week five javascript learn data structures in javascript okay so when we say data structures we're talking about arrays cues link lists trees graphs hash tables which is a map okay and just going back to it you know all these things are something that's really important to learn in most computer science concepts and this is going to be the building blocks for you to really understand let's say like how the google search algorithm works what's up oh no it's good okay so these are the things that help you learn things like what's behind the scenes of a google algorithm right how are they using their search to make it so fast you know how is facebook using its algorithm to give you the best recommendations possible now they might be using some more complicated stuff with machine learning and algorithms and stuff like that but if you learn data structures you'll be able to understand the building blocks behind such fancy algorithms that are actually used on a daily basis like even when you're about to watch a netflix movie it knows what to recommend how does it know how to do that exactly and i think the most important here thing guys here is the fact that these things you need to learn not just because for the concepts but because most interviews will ask you about these right most interviews you go to make that big google facebook you know any interview maybe i even i went to right has asked me questions around this so if you want to pass the interview which is i mean probably what your goal is you have to literally you have to screenshot this this right now it is one of the most important slides you need to know to actually get that job you guys capisce yes got that very important a lot of people unfortunately missed that you know a lot of people just don't know they have a bunch of projects but they don't know those core concepts including these ones you know yep so make sure you guys learn that really really well now here's week six what you need to do learn algorithms in javascript okay so this is going to be things like you need to you should learn bigo notation iterations recursions sorting methods and just going back oh thank you for a five dollar donation for con really appreciate it um let me just go back to the right one week six okay and these algorithms like recursions and recursions and sorting methods it's like it sounds complicated but like if i gave you an array like a bucket full of numbers can you sort them in the right order recursions you know it allows you to do like if i have if i had a game like a maze game could you solve the maze with your like can you create a bot that can figure out the maze and how to get out of there and if you could solve that then one day maybe you could work with tesla and i don't know if you guys know but but now is my um you know he he showed me he can just press a button and his tesla car will actually drive itself out of the parking lot and towards him so how does it navigate its way out of these other cars like zigs and zags out of every other vehicle's way and stops at his footstep i mean that is absolutely mindblowing but that also is using concepts like recursions or iterations and uh algorithms at the end of the day okay so it's just a simplistic i'm overly simplifying it but this hopefully gives you an idea of why you need to learn these things exactly exactly okay um with that said let's go on to what will be covered in week seven or what you should do in week seven as you're going through becomes the fun stuff guys the fun stuff we got react.js guys okay react just 101. now what does this mean right this means you'll be learning things like components right you'll be learning things like right how to pace how to like how to how to pass and data from one component to another component right and then today you know you need to learn the basics of react.js right and this is actually one of the funnest things you probably will get into as you become a front developer yes that's absolutely right react.js is going to be a really fun part but give yourself the treat when you deserve it after doing all the good boy and good girl things earlier okay don't give yourself the treat of react.js too early because trust me what's going to happen is you're going to start tripping over because you're going too fast all right uh so react.js right you will need to learn jsx so write that down this is basically your writing html um in javascript exactly functional components so you'll learn how to actually you know write functional components versus classbased components in the old days it was mostly classbased now functional functional looks way easier it's way easier to understand in my opinion and if you don't think about components guys by the way components are like little things right like who can tell me actually zoom chat what are components to you what components do you know we built that app for the uber clone right we have the components like for example the map was a component right yeah it's little blocks of code you can just put in anywhere you want so for example a fun component can be like a navbar it can be a component a sidebar can be a component a news feed can be a component um you know social icons that are underneath the post can all be one component the common section can be one component so you can think of things like building blocks or legos when i think of components i think of legos and when you put them together you get an app exactly exactly okay beautiful props you'll need to learn about that it's going to be important states so good job somebody said in the comments below you'll need to learn states you'll need to learn react hooks okay how do they work you'll need things use effect right the ones that we use right to be able to initially for example when you load a page and let's just say you go to facebook and you want to load you want to see all the posts well facebook is going to use like a react hook like use effect right use effect to be able to you load all these posts right after you load the page does that make sense guys yeah good and virtual dom is a concept that react introduced which essentially goes to you know um without being too technical and instead of like manipulating the real dom you manipulate a virtual dom which essentially just means you do things blazing fast okay and and react allows you to do that um cool now what you should do in this week which is i believe week seven in your week seven what you should do is build a todo list app that looks somewhat similar to this this design is from frontend mentor and i don't know would you guys agree that this todo list app looks freaking wonderful it's a lot mad better to list than what i used to build yeah so like build give yourself a project like this by the seventh week to do this let me ask you would you guys be excited if you were in your seventh week of learning coding and you were to build a project like this would that be exciting to you yeah i mean even that the clock app which was like week three week four like would that be exciting to you to build all those projects already like starting your week three big four because guys that is possible yes and i'm saying you'll be building this from scratch right not you're just watching a tutorial and copying it the goal is by week seven you should be able to build something like this from scratch bushrust says yes pedro says yes let's go yes yes yes yeah tons of people okay so week eight uh here's the plan rebuild the clock app but this time using react js so this will show you how you go from pure javascript to react and why you'll never go to pure javascript ever again because react just makes your life so much easier honestly yeah yeah yeah so rebuild this app in week eight week nine combine javascript and react and build a weather app with react.js that also has an api okay so this weather app you can make it look like this and it's pulling weather from a nearby location and whichever location i should pick like birmingham or manchester new york it should immediately change the weather just showing what's how many degrees it is outside what city is it uh and then whether it's cloudy or not with an icon right and then over here i can actually even search a location and type it in okay so take a screenshot of this project i'll give you guys five seconds to do that because this can be a good project for you to build in week eight and put on your portfolio late guys how cool does this look give us some fire if you think this looks amazing just like imagine imagine the recruiter who looked at your portfolio and saw this application right or saw this project on your portfolio right i mean even all the projects that we've included in here and they saw it like okay this person is serious they're not here to kid around they're not a joke around they are here to build amazing things would you agree with me on that one yeah i think so yeah i think if i saw your first project with your todo list and this one i mean it's it really speaks volumes of your design and honestly one thing i had a conversation with somebody earlier and it's like your design skills are so important when it comes to front end developer world because you could be so freaking good and react but if your design looks really terrible you won't even get a chance for them to look into your code and see all the cool complex stuff that you're doing exactly all right so this is from dribble let's move on uh week 10 build a restaurant app with react.js so you can have a restaurant oh first of all this looks freaking awesome this is one of my favorite types of designs i love these types of designs they're so cool yeah and this actually comes from dribble too and if you guys search up if you go guys go to dribble.com you search up any for example website right may that be like a weather app or you search up you know like a restaurant app they'll pull up so many means designers you can use them just for inspiration just like this and if you create it like oh my god it looks so good yeah this is beautiful so build something like this in week 10 all right this is going to be a good thing that you guys can build uh 12 weeks in total is the game plan that we're showing you somebody just ask week 11 we're up to week 11 now you're very close to becoming a frontend developer okay and starting to even apply to jobs at this point as a junior developer but you can build an amazon clone with react.js so at this point honestly you should be able to do it by yourself but if you're not you can watch our videos on it as well and this is the amazon clone we want you to build because the actual amazon clone too many people have built it um i think if you build something like this this is super modern it's freaking cool it looks better i would say so it looks way better honestly and it just makes you stand out yeah yeah like i mean yeah like if i saw it as a recruiter again it's like holy moly like if i imagine you actually applying to amazon right with this project you're like yo amazon check out what i did right you guys should listen to me you know okay i think they'll be like okay they're like actually yeah you do the redesign i'm gonna leave thank you yeah exactly so bill yeah so build something like this in your week 11 and this project here i freaking promise you like this recruiter see this they are gonna hit you up for a interview they see this they want to go look deeper into your code and give you a chance for an interview so these are massive projects we've had so many people put projects like these on their portfolios and actually get interviews and then get jobs you still need to have skills to show when you're at the interview which our goal is that if you do all of this right by week 11 you'll have those skills okay but at least you got the interview right that's one of the hardest things to get just in general guys right yeah to get the interview right you want to get noticed first and then then you have to worry about the other problems which is okay how do i pass the interview yeah that's yeah that's a whole different problem okay and week 12 is essentially you should do job hunting in that week all right so in that week you should like be looking at what other job opportunities are out there what types of things you can do we're showing one of our students nasir he's 16 years old and i think like this is a really good example to show you guys because he's 16 he's not even in america he's in pakistan so the opportunity to be able to get jobs are paid is even way harder out there right and he has made over 12 thousand dollars freelancing and using his react and django skills to be able to land jobs like that's pretty freaking cool and as soon as you guys think by the way and now he's actually in the zoom click on the j gonna bring him on as well oh yeah if he wants to jump on real quick here he is right here oh he's here nice that's what i'm saying he's here okay bring him on hello what is up nick looking beautiful we are doing amazing so nasir just like i guess share with us you know uh what have you like what did you do and how were you able to actually generate income from coding at such a young age i think everybody wants to know that and are you even 16 i thought you were 15 or something i thought you were yeah last year you were you were making an income even at 15 right i remember that that's amazing so nasir thank you so much for jumping on bro i appreciate you we might bring you on a little bit later as well because we just want to make sure i keep providing value to everybody that was here but guys how cool was this story of nasir's if you thought it was cool either give me a thumbs up or something or drop some fire in the chat is that inspiring to you guys like to see like somebody who just kind of to get started and right away start making money and actually changing could have a complete new career yes damn it's a lot of fires lots of suppliers coming through so thank you nasir for sharing all of that i mean but what i want to do a disclaimer i know how hard this kid works and he's a gogetter and he doesn't make excuses so great job on that this year and now guys the moment we've been waiting for for this long are y'all ready can we share this with you i don't think they're ready i don't think they're ready man okay awesome they're like yes let's go all right guys here we go we're about to reveal the top secret we've been so freaking excited about this and introducing profit with react guys this is a brand new course that we have just launched okay um and essentially profit with react is a selfpaced course and is designed to help you learn the skills you need to become a frontend developer within seven weeks now before i continue is it okay if i can share more about this program with you guys to have your permission for that can i get a thumbs up guys can we get a thumbs up can i get a high five yes yes beautiful dakota's like let's go dakota anthony's excited okay beautiful okay thank you so i'm gonna i'm gonna keep rocking and rolling here so here's what you guys get in profit with react and you know uh it's seven modules of react.js and it covers what we were showing you guys to cover in 12 weeks the goal is to jam pack that into seven weeks so you can even get those results faster now keep in mind you'll have to work hard right to be able to make up for that time since it's not 12 weeks or seven weeks but if you could have those skills in seven weeks would that be exciting to you guys yes or no yes god this is not for those this is not for those who want to sit down lay down watch netflix so they know it is for those who work hard right and if you do work hard you will get the result it's just it's just i think it's simple down it's like yeah i mean i will probably get into my story at some point if you guys are ever interested but like yeah i when i started coding and picked it up i worked my goddamn face off uh to learn the skill it was brutal but it was worth it at the end so how this will work guys this course it's going to be a preorder of this course okay so this course will start in december 8th okay december 8th is when the official start date will be and then every module for the next seven weeks will be dripped out to you does that make sense give me a thumbs up if that makes sense anthony says yes dakota says yes cool that's right that way you guys get excited every single day everything is there's something new right you guys like oh what's coming up next then what's coming up next you know so guys now on top of that here's what makes this course a banger above any other course you're gonna find on udemy or anywhere online this course comes with seven weeks of coaching as well so from the time you join the course you're gonna also have seven weeks of group coaching with the crew that you're gonna be with so you're all gonna be getting trained at the same freaking time okay and everybody's gonna be just as hungry as you are so you're gonna be in a community of absolute winners and gogetters and there are a ton of people in our community who take these skills and then start applying it start landing jobs and those are the people you'll be connected to guys this is not your regular udemy course it's not your regular any course in terms of like you just watch the videos and you follow along no right you have to you have to come to the coaching goals there will be that with people who will be pressuring you to make sure you do come so there's accountability yeah right of course then you have to actually build the projects right so it's a lot more than just your normal course you watch the videos and i'm sure raise your hand guys if you're kind of sick of that you're sick of those ones where it's just like you watch a bunch of videos and you don't want to keep doing that anymore yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah so that's the goal to give you that accountability that support that you keep showing up and you keep getting the skills if you get stuck you have a community and instructors around to help you out okay um so and these coaching calls will also be starting on december 8th for you okay now this course is designed to help you learn the skills to become a frontend developer that's the goal of it and we want to give you the skills you need to be able to go get a job that's always 100 our goal with any program or any course we ever launch yes knowledge here is the value guys the more knowledgeable you are guys the more value you want the more value what the more value you have exactly yep absolutely now in this program you're going to be learning everything from scratch right you're going to be mastering react you're going to learn things like npm what the heck is react router and how does that work you know master things like redux you're going to master things like firebase and versailles and how to deploy and of course you're going to be mastering the other things we've shown you as well html css javascript because those things are very very important for you to learn all the building blocks that we just talked about guys right the bottom lines that we talked about which are really really important those who do need them you will be learning them as well absolutely and we're also going to be having you build some fire projects in this course so there's some projects i'm going to list out right now and then there's some projects we might just drop as a surprise bonus for you all but check it out you're going to be building an epic realtime chat app kind of like what's app okay and we're going to be going deep into how to make it work and just make it absolutely amazing but how this is going to be more different than any youtube tutorial on it out there is we're going to break it up into projects and stepbystep exercises for you so when you build this you completely build it yourself by completing tons of exercises not just by watching a youtube video and like copying the code and now you've built it does that make sense guys yeah that makes sense now i want to just copy a bunch of a bunch of code raise your hand i'm really curious yeah that's right right so it's like our goal is very important it's very important right copying code is good but it's not what's going to teach you right a lot of our students a lot of like people students that i know who just copy code and then they just end up kind of like when they are faced with the real problems with the real you know world coding problems they have a harder time so our goal is to put you right there in the driver's seat yep to make sure you're actually coding there with us and actually brainstorming and problem solving too absolutely okay absolutely you're also going to be building an amazing project another amazing project which is close to my heart because i love i absolutely love chess any second that i get for free i am like finding ways to play chess so in this i'm going to be putting my heart and soul for you guys and having us build a multiplayer chess app and i think this project will actually have you step above the crowd so much because it's a unique project not everybody's going to have this on their portfolio and it shows some incredible skills of yours like how do you actually have multiplayer game with react because most people don't show you that right yeah this is going to be the the thing that actually wows the recruiters right yeah like that's you know it's all cool you know it's all fun and games to build these projects who are like landing pages and stuff like that but when you get to interact with multiple people and you have multiple technologies like react router like react gs right and firebase even right that's when it really makes you kind of think differently and it really puts you above everybody else on their critics side absolutely and with this project you guys are going to be doing react you're going to be mastering react router firebase even howler gs which is a sound library because when each move happens it makes a sound when you checkmate that makes a sound how do you detect if it's a check i mean there's a lot and plus if you don't know how to play chess you'll even learn how to play chess in this okay which is going to open up a whole new world for you and you can challenge me at any point you want and and this also has a crazy amount of other things like user authentication you can log in you can see who the user you're playing against is it goes deep so i'm excited for you guys to see this you're also going to be building an amazing todo app which is going to use react redux style components and things like that so those projects are going to be learning and putting it on your portfolio as well on top of that you're going to be getting an awesome exclusive slack community so you guys see in the chats right now you guys are all talking engaging you see all the amazing faces that are around you these are the faces and the hungry and the ambitious people that you're going to be seeing inside of this community as well yes what's the problem guys raise your hand guys if you feel something's alone when you're coding well raise your hand if you feel like alone when you're trying to learn this because this is not an easy field to feel exactly everybody right it's not an easy field to be in right it's very complicating right complicated it is very confusing sometimes right and there's a lot of people trying to do it right and when you try to first start out you might feel like you're just by yourself and so it might even discourage you but versus raise your hand if you agree with me if you have a group of people who have the same goals who are trusted driven to push you attached to it as well would you do it then raise your hand yes yes yes exactly ton of hands that's the difference guys you have all those people with you supporting you you're gonna crush your goals it becomes simple at that point so you're gonna have a community like this inside of slack every day people are gonna be there jumping in talking you know coming up with ideas sharing with you everything that they're learning you're gonna be sharing the stuff that you're learning you guys are gonna be making progress together right and then the coaching calls whenever they're happening we'll also drop in the times for you guys so you can jump into those calls now with all of that said the other thing that we're going to be giving you guys with this is 30 day money back guarantee okay and the point of this is we don't want you to risk anything either you love the course or you get your money back okay hopefully that makes sense to you guys we want to just make that super simple cool guys so guys if on 29th day 59th hour 59th minute 29 seconds you're like no no no no no don't worry you guys get your money back but most but we we have so much confidence in that right because we always our kids to provide a ton of value and we know you guys will love it just in the end absolutely and guys we will i mean you're going to be surprised by what things we're offering you but i'm going to keep going through this okay now guys there's tons of amazing testimonials that we have from clever programmer from our previous courses i mean ingrid went on to make over 50 000 a year just teaching her frontend coding skills you know we had jen who went from you know being laid off due to the pandemic working as a junior developer making forty six thousand dollars a year to after going through a course doubling her income at ninety six thousand dollars a year as a senior react developer i mean yeah she literally built one of the projects like we built like this coveted tracker project right together with everybody and she used that project as you know as a for her portfolio and really now when she got off the coaching call she calls me right right off the couch she's like nos guess what i got the job no way i'm like what she's like and guess what they told me they loved my project and the emphasis on that clover tracker was the reason i pretty much got the job so i'm like what that's crazy but yeah she really you know she's amazing person just in general but i'm really happy for her yeah so that's those are the results that this program is bringing for students okay now just to recap guys here's what you're gonna get okay this is gonna be a completely beginner friendly course you're gonna have seven react js training modules seven total react coaching calls and all of these calls will be delivered to you weekly okay so for seven weeks you're gonna have access to exclusive slack community you're going to build real world projects like a realtime messaging app you're going to build a chess game all of these projects are going to be portfolio ready that you'll be able to slap onto your portfolio um and guess what that's not all we're gonna make it better for you guys okay we're gonna make it a lot better i love that sound sting so here's what we're gonna be doing we have a pretty ridiculous bonus for the people who joined during this call this will not be happening after this call let me show you uh this is the most insane deal we've ever offered and we're just excited because we want to give people the chance for everybody who's been so loyal for the five days like you know anthony you've been showing up brother dakota like eduardo fabio sam you know sam sehar dirk like all of you guys luna like if i didn't mention any of you i'd been seeing you guys over the five days you guys are hardcore fans so we wanted to give you guys something special okay um and in the next 30 minutes only actually scratch that in the next 20 minutes only okay here's what we're going to be doing as a bonus here's what you're going to get profit with javascript that's right that's right so you guys get two courses basically yep so profit exactly so you're going to be getting profit with javascript guys this is our mega flagship course we've launched it over the last two years we have thousands of students enrolled in this program absolutely love it their minds were blown with the value and this is over 13 modules of training okay and this goes deep into javascript so if you guys were like hey do we also get to learn javascript and master those skills before we move on to react this this course will help you master that in so much detail it's insane and what this will do is that one month you're waiting after you preorder the profit of the react course you'll be able to go through and master react in that master javascript in that time so then when you get to react you're going to be so much stronger in your foundational understanding of everything that's happening does that make sense guys yes so guys who here still needs to learn those foundations right who feel that they still need to learn those foundations right so if you that's what you need guys right this is going to be it right this is going to teach you all those bare bones nasir is actually part of this right how do you think he got to where he is today right he was part of those these courses courses like these yeah mar was a pro part of this course and she started making 96 thousand dollars a year nasir was in grid was as well that we showed you exactly it's an amazing community right and so you guys will get to be part of that community which also includes things like coaching calls right and so forth so maybe you can talk a little bit more about that and check this out guys so here you have four to five projects that you're going to be building inside of profit with javascript itself so you're gonna be building your own blog app a blackjack app you're gonna build a twitter app you're gonna build a google maps store locator and you'll even be building your own chrome extension and you'll be deploying it to chrome that's right you actually have your own chrome app it's crazy i have a lot of students who built it and put it literally on the chrome chrome app store and people are actually using it the chrome app that we built you know like the first one that i built to teach you guys right literally is being used by i think the last time i checked and don't quote me on this one i think it's like 400 people or something right that downloaded it it was pretty crazy and so you guys get to build that too oh really yeah yeah it's like there's a lot of users and there's a lot of five stars too as well oh snap i want to actually take a look at it after this it's called the rocket planner if you guys are interested it's called the rocket planner that's nice so you guys can even look that up and then at the end of this right you guys are going to see react gs101 so if you watch this and go through that module it'll really help you be prepped and ready uh for when you get into the profit of the reactor on december 8th okay yeah okay actually i looked into it this rocket planner has a thousand plus users right now wow on the comment website plus yeah a thousand plus users right now yeah that's insane that and and they all went through this course to find out about it right or did something i mean people just people found out about about people who wanted wow that's absolutely incredible okay maybe after this slides we can even show that so yeah you guys will have really solid understanding of everything guys i highly recommend that you don't miss out on this seriously it's gonna cost you another this course is 700 this will cost you another 700 to join and i promise you a ton of people are gonna pay that and join that in the next day when they miss it today so i don't want you to miss that today okay that's why i'm just like going hard at it showing it to you guys and making sure you guys understand so here's more about profit with javascript it has 13 modules so we showed you these are available now these are already out so while you're waiting for profit to react you're hungry you're like man i can't wait for this thing to come out jump in dive in eat eat your buffet all you can eat that's what's going to be here with you for javascript now this is designed to help you learn the javascript part that that will allow you to learn the react.js part at a very deep level okay it is the foundation level to get you to the react.js portion got it does that make sense guys it's the first thing you need to learn to get to react to yes yes okay so profit with javascript this program is worth 700 by itself all right profit with react is going to be worth 700 so both of these programs are going to be worth how much who's really good at math here 700 plus 700 is what guys this is this is going to be a value of roughly around 1400 if you want to be technical is going to be 1394 but around 1400 of value but if you preorder profit with react in the next 20 minutes so i'm going to start the timer all right i'm going to start the timer here and i'm going to hit start all right there we go the timer has started if you preorder it in the next 20 minutes you're gonna get the bundle of profit with javascript 13 plus modules and profit with react with the seven coaching calls not for fourteen hundred dollars but for 3.97 damn this offer is only available for the next 19 minutes and 30 seconds left after these 20 minutes here's what's gonna happen the price is going to go up to 497 immediately after this okay we're only offering this for you guys who are watching this live and the bundle is going to go away in 18 in 19 minutes and about 15 seconds now okay that bundle is going to go away so then you have to get profit with the react by itself for 497 and the profit with javascript uh by itself for 700. exactly so guys i'm really curious guys if you guys are fired up and i'm interested in potentially joining something like this in learning react they coming from developer guys i want to see that fire in the zoom chats right now so i want to see that fire in the zoom chats right now if you guys are able well can they chat right now with me i think maybe i'm not sure if they can chat i think we'll put the chat in the pause for now just so you

you make the decision in the next 17 minutes and 50 seconds i think that's what the time is left now um if you guys want right if you want it to be easier for you and if you're like hey paying the whole thing is a little bit tricky uh you're gonna have to pay a little bit more if you go payment plan but here's how that works it's going to be 160 payments and three payments of 160 okay so if you want a payment plan option you can do that as well we have dropped it in the chat for you so you all can see that's right so you guys go just go into zoom chat the links are all there right i'm really curious can i get a raise of hands anybody who's interested at all anybody who's ever literally hey beautiful beautiful beautiful let's go okay beautiful awesome um so guys yeah these are the students that have gone incredible results working with us right this is what we do and we would love to help you inside of this program we try to make it as cost effective as possible especially considering it comes with group coaching calls right most boot camps for that will charge you way more but we wanted to make it something that's affordable for everybody exactly we actually have a lot a few students here who actually can talk a little bit about more about their experiences too yeah yeah definitely that's awesome so yeah i think let's bring on some of the students and hear their stories but just going over this guys get the course bundle for 397. we've shown you what you get beginner friendly you get 13 javascript training modules you build five projects with javascript and react you

all right who do we have that we want to bring on and should we continue on this year who who did it who came on the last time just continue on with him do you we do we have uh dina on right now oh do we do let me see let me see let me see he's asking but yeah guys so i just want to share with you guys the results that the students have gotten and i want to kind of go through it for you guys right so dina she joined our program and she came out as a frontend react js developer and now she went from you know her previous job where she was making ten to fifteen thousand dollars a year to now making forty thousand dollars a year right we had joshua who recently actually graduated from one of our programs and he got a job as a friend and engineer he blockchain startup um and this startup is called teller so that was super cool um and i got on a call with him recently and i learned so much about blockchain i was like yo i'm mind blown he's a really cool guy yeah we showed you guys ingrid right we have ajit who landed a full stack developer job for 72 000 a year i think was it in canada um i don't remember but i think either in canada or u.s but he landed a job as a full stack

honestly at this rate they're probably gonna run out tomorrow um not even until november 12th honestly yeah by the way guys those of you asking like why is it you know cost more if you pay than 160 you know for three months it's because you get this kind of people paying full that's just as simple as that right so if you fully get a discount if you're paying in three months of course it's just a little more expensive that's it yes okay cool um derrick uh dirk says i'm in it beautiful yeah when you pay in full yeah you you save more um that's the whole idea okay exactly exactly all right and also i have a few people as well who joined from um from youtube as well like muhammad for example you joined welcome welcome welcome my friend so many amazing people uh godfrey level says i'm trying to draw my cards can't decline it's all good just keep trying my friend okay if somebody's having trouble uh send a text message to this number over here uh send a text message here i dropped it in

what makes you excited about what makes you excited about this like path i'm guessing is my question um all the new platforms have different um stuff like i didn't know about redox and all those uh firebase and when i built my app so now that i have an opportunity to learn those items i'll be able to be more dangerous sir you will be you'll become really dangerous that's the goal with this

hearing that i wanna i'm gonna unmute sean as well at the same time uh sean tell me what what made you pull the trigger on this call man well i wanted to land a job as a developer right now i am a certified at pharmacy technician okay right now i think it's time for me to change my job where are your cvs where do you work cvs no i work at a store okay with my older brother okay so basically i've been starting coding last in like 2000 technically i started coding before 2020 but ever since it i have more time to start coding and i first learned sql was my first language technically and then i started focus and i started doing python and c plus but then after that i start focusing on javascript but as of right now i need to start strengthening my projects start working with people and start doing my portfolio and make it as good uh sean keep working really hard in this program keep building the projects that are going to be there um one thing i'm going to tell you is i'm committed to getting as many people to quit from pharmacy work and get the developer work as possible it started with my friend one of my best friends in life his name is tenzin and i remembered i spent like six months trying to convince him to quit his pharmacy job at cvs oh yeah he told me yeah and then finally one day he quit and then he uh you know we just we were just coding together every single day years and years and years ago and then he finally got a job as a developer and then we were both on pace to be making six figures um but yeah and then he started his youtube channel called what's dev i don't know if you guys know him uh but what's dev was his channel so sean thank you so much for sharing um sharing everything you've shared brother i'm gonna hear from dakota now um what is up dakota hey what's going on bro nice to have you in what made you pull the trigger and join honestly um i've been debating for the last few this is my fifth year and i still have another year after this semester so i'm going to be halfway through the sixth year wow i even graduate uh and i don't even know hardly anything for what i'm actually going for i'm going for game design and development and i've had like maybe four or five classes in five years that have taught me anything related to my degree i've actually learned more web design uh or ui design or whatever then i have game design wow what i'm actually saying you know so i've originally was just gonna learn html css to build a portfolio but uh now i'm really getting into it i just i want to learn more and i want to learn javascript and react.js and all these web technologies for front end development uh and an internship by next summer hopefully um so that way i can have that on my portfolio and maybe start some freelance work as well smart man very smart very yeah it's so true a lot of students unfortunately you know do not get the education they they want when they go to you know university right i'm not trying to bring down universities right but like to me like i went to university as well but honestly like what i know today is not what i learned from university right like there are some aspects there are some good teachers that i did love there were like one or two classes that were really good for me right but most of classes like i was learning c plus you know and like some java and that's pretty much it right but there's like new technologies which is like like i was learning like like git but it wasn't even get you know what i mean like the old kit right before you became kid it was crazy like why do we need to learn this right but yeah unfortunately you know just it's harder for some types of universities to keep up with it with you know the new technologies that's it yeah yeah i'm kind of lucky that the school that i go to is very cheap i went to kind of a local school but it's a satellite of a bigger university so i'm only paying like maybe five thousand dollars a semester uh so it's not too bad but i mean it could have been way worse i'm just not learning what i wanted to learn and now i'm starting to get into i really want to learn it more beautiful well well excited to have you here dakota my friend would you tell those people who are looking to join or maybe are not sure about what would you tell them i tell them honestly go ahead and join it's so much cheaper than college don't do what i did don't spend five thousand dollars a semester spend three hundred dollars or four hundred dollars now yeah beautiful guys 60 spots left 40 spots got taken right on this call that's crazy and so just make sure if y'all are interested that you jump in now rather than later so all the spots don't get booked out um with that said i mean at this point i think uh what's best to do is we'll take any questions you guys have maybe there might be some last minute questions you guys have okay yeah uh and so i'll i'll jump we'll jump into that so if you have any questions start raising your hands and uh um and we'll start bringing you on yeah let me see if you guys have any questions just let us know okay let us know i lowered everybody's hand because i was assuming they were from the past yeah yeah yeah that's right that's right yeah cool looks like albert had a question uh but you have a question yes yeah yeah it looks like you have a question go ahead albert uh yeah um yeah um i'm gonna be uh probably getting a job in uh as an electrician like a electrician apprentice uhhuh uh maybe maybe in a month nice um i don't know when i'm job searching right now um but that's like you know like my fulltime thing but it's like a gig just until i become a programmer sure yeah yeah um when was the i know i know the program profit we react to selfpaced yes when was the when when did it start again december so december 8th it'll start and then it'll come out every week like one module every single week it's going to drip out for seven weeks okay okay and in the meantime in the meantime while that's happened you guys have proper javascript right that was a bonus but you'll kind of start learning right that's going to be your base foundations that you need to start to learn got it and then there you go you have a lot of projects as well a lot of amazing community too right i don't think i have profit i i don't think i have profit with javascript when i when i bought profit with react reactor said do you want to buy java so so what's going to be happening for everybody that joined so that's what's going to be happening with everybody who didn't join on this call they're going to need to buy profit with javascript but for you all that joined we're going to we're doing a special deal so uh manually our customer support team will start giving you guys access to profit with javascript okay all the the 40 people that joined on this call and um one more thing um i know it's selfpaced so after seven and just want to say one thing for anybody that joined make sure you book that call that's very important because we're going to go through the full onboarding experience with you guys we're going to get you set up in the program you're literally going to get like 300 percent more like access and better results by going through that okay so that's usually what we see and that person is also going to become your accountability coach so make sure you book that onboarding call got it guys good and uh after seven weeks could we still go at it if we're doing selfpaced yes like you have a job okay yeah okay thank you you got it brother thank

lueck wants to come on too so let's uh i'll put him on a spotlight melissa can you please turn on your camera so i can't knew you because i think otherwise it's really hard for me to let me go oh there she is hold on let's go hey let's i [Laughter] i don't like those chest tables with the chest thing i'd i'd rather have to roll up like the actual board downstairs to do tournaments uh melissa tell us like how you know after joining clever programmer like how do you feel like your coding skills for you have changed um i have gotten a billion times better even in the last few months and honestly my confidence has changed because i came into this not really knowing anything like i barely even know how to use my computer you don't believe me ask robin and like just learning like everything and kind of doing it like on my own time like because i started in uh javascript so being able to just kind of start online but then when i got like a little bit better i was like okay i need better coaching so that's when i joined the big boot camp and uh yeah it kicked my butt but i'm getting joining the prophet with react is that correct yes yes beautiful i'm excited for you we're excited yes yeah i would love to have you in there and uh yeah i mean we love melissa we love your energy and even when we did the javascript tour you were there for javascript there was only like 20 of us yeah we're done melissa we're doing the react intensive online now from the 19th of november to 21st so i'm sure we're gonna have we already have a few people like four or five people signed up for it uh we're probably gonna have a couple of more people coming through joining the react intensive but you should let the people in the boot camp know about the react intensive definitely yeah i'll tell you robin too okay she can spread it she also has other things those people who are considering getting into this course what would you tell them join now it will make you so much better and the teachers will kick your vet and make sure you're on your game yeah you're gonna like they definitely make sure you're on top of this and if you're falling behind they make [Laughter] i'm looking forward to the next uh go to uh go to uh machine code app that you you yeah uh let's i'm gonna have uh hey melissa all right melissa thank you so much see you later byebye dave i'm trying to unmute him i got you we're doing amazing now i'm doing better now that i see your face dave i will say um occurs 40 salary increase in three weeks let's go that makes me happy um how do you consult like hello hello world i think that's always the starting point right how do you feel like when you know of course you know why do you think education is important to you in general well we're in this field here today exactly that's a really good point that's a really good point yeah yeah it's always about learning like of course the more skills you learn the more you earn you know people say that right and i'm a big believer that you know who you know in this world right knowing a lot of different skills not specifically is going to be the most important thing right yes you know we always say learn one thing first and then of course expand from that but you know nowadays people are learning and react and moving on from that right so the more you learn the more fundamentals you know um i think the more valuable you just become and then and then at that point like you know employers look at you and you're like like we just need you and that's it you know yeah absolutely i mean i've been doing full stack for for 10 years like i said before you got to learn the basics you can't build it's like trying to build the roof yes before you put the house up before you put the laws up the foundation that's right these guys will start to add the foundation dave very very basic all the way to the advance dave thank you so much for sharing that brother i'm gonna bring on pencey um and let's actually bring on armand as well armand as well uh yo guys come on let's go armand uh what it what is up hi let's start off with pencey how are you doing pencey good good amazing am i saying your name right yeah i'm sorry um just feels so good i don't know i like your style so thank you but tell tell us you know what brings you to private react um so i i was in a boot camp um i don't want to mention the name but um it was you know it was a good experience but like i just felt like i needed more um the lesson i just didn't feel like it was really really rushed in um i didn't really take much value um so i was basically doing things on my own researching researching things on my own and trying to you know um you know talk to other students in the slack community um but everyone was just you know working on their own thing you know yeah um to reach out with instructors but like you know everyone was just like hey i'm just worked up like for that reason and then you're just like i don't know what to do but so i just had to wing it the whole time um i graduated but like i don't know like a lot of things a lot of things like there's like a lot of things you guys mentioned and i don't know it no a lot of students that i know as well who came back at these other boot camps right as well like you know one of our students but on came from a different boot camp actually you know also like when he graduate i'm not gonna name that name as well but he graduated too like he felt like he you know didn't really learn much right so yeah right he felt like he just wasn't ready and so we actually taught him those fundamentals that he needed to learn and that's how he actually got you know a job of gravity payments that at this point actually i know he said 70k she now pays in 93k i actually talked to him recently what the hell yeah he actually gets paid 93 he get a bonus he got he got a raise now yeah so i talked to him like about i think two weeks ago actually yeah but yeah it's i totally don't understand that so we're excited to have you here and thank you so much for joining and what would you tell those people who are potentially thinking about you know joining something like this i think they should go for it because if they want if they're hungry to learn how to you know make a websites or web applications for it pencey can i ask you something um oh fabio says when i'm done with the program will you give me a job at cleverprogrammer if you're really really good and you're a good human that's right you know i just want to ask you like you you talk to me about your coding bootcamp what makes you feel like what makes you take a chance on this right because if i'm you i'm a little scared at this point because man i just invested so much in a coding boot camp so now this is a risk for me what made you what made you take a chance on this what makes you took a chance on us because you teach well that's the whole thing if the experience is well you teach well yeah you're gonna you're gonna do well you're gonna you don't understand you better grasp everything you're gonna understand like you go things step by step um you are able to teach us you don't you you're just not like slapping things and then like here it's like learning yeah take this yeah you just it's um more like i feel like it's more real real world projects yeah um so yeah and where did you test the teaching experience was it the uber challenge were you here for the whole uber challenge yeah yeah okay amazing like very you know precise and like you know like why did you put this component and why did you do this and like i really loved the fact that like you were showing us um the readymade like uh you know um design i guess i would say yeah like um the back button and then like you know you gotta put the um you know this is a container this is another routine yeah i didn't i i didn't learn that like you know it's basically like the framework like you need to know the framework first as a designer i didn't learn that like so i think that's really important oh wow hear that yeah yeah thank you so much for sharing that and on youtube we just got a 15 donation so thank you so much for that huge shout out wow that's amazing thank you so much though i don't know yeah it's a good one uh okay armand how are you doing brother hopefully i'm saying your name right uh talk to us you know what made you join the program brother let me just can i actually good to see you my friend it's been a while in the world okay how can i make money from the engineering career they didn't quite panic for me and when i saw these guys i was like hey you know they went through a whole lot of loops and figured out a way to make money with coding which you know they don't quite teach this stuff in college so i'm like yeah i could see the value you know coming from this program and uh seeing a whole lot of testimonies just gave me an encouragement to really believe in this program so that's where i joined beautiful bro that makes that makes me really happy and just talk to me like what has your experience been with coding so far in the you know like how long have you been coding or or been exposed to it uh well it started with my first programming class in college and i like that how i can take my ideas and code it up and make my program work are we going back a couple of years or is that a couple of months yeah we're probably talking like five years back but i haven't really been consistent with coding yes uh throughout that time but when i came to know you guys that's where i got really curious and how long how long ago was that how long ago did you come across us uh about two years uh okay nice man wow that's been a long time that's why nas has just probably started with us around that time yeah oh me oh yeah that's right actually about two years ago probably start with you guys yeah that's right early 2019. um yeah wow man that's incredible so you've been watching the stuff you've been watching you know uh probably our videos and then what made you join this challenge i mean it's been two years right like we've been talking about profit with javascript for like years so what made you decide to like at least even join the challenge this time around well you know um i follow this quote that my mentor tells me that you can't walk into a bright new future being your same old self so if i wanted to get those advances if i wanted to give myself a raise i love that i love the dedication my friend that's good that's good yeah the certification when i first got a call with you yeah so yeah i'm excited for you my friend wow amazing thank you for sharing that brother appreciate it um yeah we had luna had a question do you have questions right yeah i just wanted to quickly just to make sure because i know this is one of the biggest things when i very first joined when reach out to me to talk to me kind of making me feel welcome and i always want to make sure that that energy is already being given so if you guys ever have questions while you're still waiting for things to start reach out in the general chat reach out to either myself like there's so much that happens with different people it's gonna be someone available yeah and i think that's really really freaking cool if you ever have those questions please

just said they're gonna clip that moment where you called us both nazis [Laughter] oh man here comes a new video on us oh no so no i appreciate that and and honestly i think for for you guys who are waiting you don't have to just like sit there for a month and just wait and do nothing like look you're still gonna have access to the slack community you'll still have access to the people who are in profit with javascript you'll have access to you know all of that so i would say take advantage of that um and you know even if you want to sneak into some of the coaching calls that are happening they're like probably do it like take advantage of it you know your official classes start on the december 8th but i'm just i'm just putting it out there yeah yeah okay awesome any other questions if not we will be done for today because we want you guys to get your program started we want you guys to get your calls booked and uh outside of that we need to get to start making the program for you
