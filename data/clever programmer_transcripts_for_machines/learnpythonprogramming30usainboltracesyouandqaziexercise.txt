hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and we are going to be building working our way up to tictactoe so this is going to be one problem that I'm going to give you before I put you guys on to tictactoe project because once you do this you'll have a better idea of how to complete that project okay so this is going to be a pretty important video and after this you guys will be ready to write your own very own first game and what I have done for you guys is essentially it's not just going to be a boring textbased game I've created a full GUI for you guys so once you complete the code and complete the functions the whole GUI application but will work all right so without any further ado let's get started on the helper assignment I created for you guys so this assignment is called Usain Bolt races you and Kazi okay so here's the backstory Usain Bolt you and Kazi had a race okay surprisingly Usain Bolt won I don't know why and then you came in second and for some reason cos just sucks at running so I suck at running somehow and I came in third so I didn't do too good all right now can you write a function that given a person's name returns their place so for example if I gave you Usain Bolt's place already Sainz name so I just said you saying you give me back zeroth place or sorry first place if I gave you like if I type in you or mean in your case I would have you write me okay so like here if you see the test case so if I give you me then you should return second place and if you put in Kazi it should give you three all right that's how your function should work and can you also write a function that does the opposite given a place it returns their name so maybe your phone so your function will be called number two choice and if I give you one you should give me back Usain and if I give you two you should give me back me when you're writing and typing this code me will really be you right and if you give the function number two choice three it should return toddies name okay so my name if it works then you get back a nice little graphical gooey thing that I made for you guys you'll have a turtle they'll make a nice little circle and say good job okay my graphics are getting next level okay so give this function a try see if you can solve it see if you can solve a choice to number and number two choice okay those are your two functions so essentially if I give you you here then you should say okay that's first play a second place if I give you you saying here you should return okay that's first place and here if I give you two you should return your name or sorry not your name but you and I'm sorry I'm confusing you guys it should return me if I gave you two this function should return me okay you can look at the test cases and that's what they say this whole mean using is kind of confusing but if I give you three it should return Kazi all right number so I'll leave that there so in this I've already written the function name for you and I've already written the argument names for you to make your life easy alright what you have to do is complete both of these functions and then go at the bottom and uncomment this line if I uncomment it right now and try to run it you can see it says incorrect keep trying if I run it again I'll say incorrect do not give up which means that my code is incorrect all right once my code is correct it's going to make a nice little green circle and say correct good job so if you've not given a try yet go give it a try otherwise I'm going to go over the solution right now okay so let's get started so how will we write the choice to number choice function all right so let's let's write it up if choice is equal to you saying then return 1 else if choice is equal to cos e or sorry me return to else return or let's let's actually just do else if choice is equal to cos e return 3 ok so that will essentially do what we want if I try to print here and go print choice to number and give it cos e right let's see what it does just run it you can see that it gave us back 3 that's exactly what we expected because I came in third now what if I gave it me which is going to be you and you're writing this function it's going to say ok that's exactly what you want and let's say we give it you saying it says 1 ok so it's working correctly that's exactly what we want but is there an easier way we can do this function so there's if else if and else if that we wrote is there a way we can make it easier perhaps using dictionaries that we learned earlier remember we have choice and that's associated with or sorry we have this thing here and each choice associated with the value over the number so this should automatically be telling you guys like hey maybe there's a key value relationship if you put in one you get back you saying if you're if you put in you say and you get back 1 if you put in me you get back if you put in cos you get back 3 so what we can essentially do is rip this whole thing down and replace it with the data structure that is that that does it for us right it's called a dictionary so I'm just gonna say our choices what should I call it let's call it race dictionary for now okay to keep things simple and I'm gonna say if given you saying I'm going to write it on actually let's just keep it simple given you saying return key you're saying should be the key and the value should be one me key is me value is 2 and then Kazi key is Kazi and what is the value value is 3 so then we can say return race underscore dictionary and we can index it by the choice that's given to us so for example if you put in you saying here it's going to look through this dictionary right what's the way that dictionaries work its dictionary you index it by its key and then it returns the corresponding value so here race dick is the dictionary we index it by the choice so if the user gives us you saying I'll put a new sign here and I'll return this whole thing we'll evaluate to the value so in this case 1 same thing will happen but the rest of them okay so hopefully that makes sense and can we simplify this yes we can do we really need a variable that we're just going to use like a second later not really um and it doesn't make our code any dirtier or any harder to read so in this case you can just do this and it's done you can assign it a name if the dictionary was really big but here the dictionary is pretty small we don't need to use an extra variable here so I think this is good and let's use the same idea here and we can say return if given one return you saying oh by the way let's let's test it ok that's that's a good thing to do let's let's run this here by hitting run and let's see what we get and we get back one that's what we expected let's put in me here let's see what happens and we get back to what happens here we pass in me to the choice to number function so you really pass in me like this it goes in the it indexes this dictionary by me right and me has a value of two so this whole thing evaluates the two and it's done okay let's hit it run and it returns two so it's working and let's do the same thing for a number two choice return oops earn two would return me and then three should return Kazi right and we index it by the number because this time number is the key okay so okay it looks good to me let's uncomment the line 67 and see after it does it pass all these tests I've written here right does it give in the same return one given one return the scene and all that let's run it and it passes all the test cases and on the righthand side you see it made a nice little green circle with the turtle said good job and so we are done okay awesome if you guys didn't get it the no worries if the dictionary thing was new to you perfect this is all supposed to be new for you guys now these concepts are going to be directly applied in the next video where I'm going to have to take Tac Toe project for you guys I have the notes for it I have the solution guide for it and I will help you guys build the whole thing on your own and it'll be something that you can proudly share with your friends family whoever okay your girlfriend/boyfriend doesn't matter it's going to be something that's going to actually work it's going to have a link that you can share and it will directly be playable so I hope you guys are excited for the next video and I'll see you guys there
