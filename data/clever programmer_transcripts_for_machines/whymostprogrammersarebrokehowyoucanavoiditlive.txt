that's it hey guys what's up this is Kazi from clever programmer calm and in this livestream again we're live on Instagram we're live on YouTube and we'll be live on Facebook in just a little bit we are going to be talking about why some of the best programmers are broke and how you can avoid that I'm also gonna show you how much you're gonna be earning as a Python developer so we're gonna actually do some math in this video so you can start to see what it looks like for you so we're gonna talk about how much a Python freelancer at a lower rate could charge at a lower hourly rate and I'm gonna show you what that income for you can look like weekly what that income could look like for you monthly and what that income could look like to you yearly okay and we're also gonna talk about the profitable program or master class which is now live and available to you for free and all of that is available to you in the links in the description below okay so if you're on youtube or if you're on Facebook all of that information is available to you right below me hi guys how's it going wow what is going on with 28 people watching nice hopefully we'll start getting more on YouTube all right how's everybody doing today is the name of the decoder hi Hans official we got nine dunkey de Pancho high high high on Facebook we got Paco Franco one lovin a leak crashing I'm just ruining these names and then having fun doing it it crow hiya crow how are you doing we got code dads I could add or sorry that's actually Instagram hi Instagram on Facebook we've three so far cool cool the second video will be released tomorrow at 11 a.m. you don't want to miss it okay that's when the second video is gonna be released this is official announcement for the second master class video the second part of the PLC good evening good evening love from India hi Varun love right back to you King decoder says I just love your videos that's good to know hi rviz rviz I did get your email you sent us an email about when the course will be open the course will be open I don't want to give a specific date but the course will be open midnovember okay so midnovember is when you should be looking out for the new course called create apps and land your first client with Python in less than 90 days and get that first paycheck cool so look out for that in midnovember watching on Instagram and YouTube as well great you're getting two camera views that's great you can keep switching your screens from Instagram to YouTube hi Ryan you're welcome for the support okay this is the camera sorry hi Facebook yeah guys so if you guys have any questions keep them coming and I'll answer your guys's questions as they come along as well as go over some of the main points of this livestream so in this livestream we are going to be covering why the best programmers are broke and how you can avoid that we are going to be talking about your Python earning potential and what you could be looking to make as a Python freelancer okay so we're gonna be talking about that and I'm also gonna show you where you can I've put together a calculator for you where you can go and calculate your Python freelance for earning potential and you could literally click this link and use my calculator and steal it okay so I've also got that for you so those are some of the main things we're gonna be doing other than that we're gonna be going into the third thing is we're gonna hit the Q&A and get some questions and I'm gonna answer them for you guys cool yes the decoder says I'm an Opie student will the course be free for me so everybody who got my previous course called oo P create apps with Python the new course for you will be completely free ok so that's my gift to all of my existing students who've gotten my previous Opie course so yeah yep we are gonna be going over that math so we can specifically kind of look at what kind of numbers you could be looking at and again I'm gonna give you your Python earning potential calculator so you can see how it works yep you're welcome the decoder and if you want to jump in there and answer some questions for people who are live that'd be great and you can also log in Sinclair on my accounts and he can also help out with the questions on YouTube he can help out with the questions on Facebook or Instagram yeah so what when that course is released to create apps and land your first client with Python course that course is not live course it's you know you get lifetime access to it so you don't have to worry about if you have exams or you have something going on right now you don't have to watch it at this moment you could take it at your own pace okay so even though we are gonna be it's gonna be like a few weeks long course you can take it at your own pace all right so why the best programmers are broke and one of the main things is so basically you know I'm talking about the people who have been coding let's say for 30 years and their rate is thirty dollars an hour and I know that because I actually had a few coding pewters or mentors that I had hired and I was working with and that was a rate they were charging and we're very closely with them for a few for a few years actually and I was looking at I had one mentor who was essentially broke who was a great coder with 30 years of experience making $30 an hour then I had another mentor who had you know only few years of coding experience but then he was charging 150 to 200 dollars an hour as a Python consultant he even had clients who charged $300 an hour as a Python consultant and that's what made me you know started thinking about okay hmm you can have somebody who has fifteen thirteen thirty years of experience and you can have somebody who has less experience and are actually less hot you know less good coders they're not as good as somebody else who has 30 years of experience but how are they when it comes to the pay so different like what is the difference they live in the same country they live in the same state they live in the same city they have a room to apply to the same pool of jobs so what's with the disparity why is one guy make five times as much and other guy making five times as less why does it take one person to do in five years what it takes other person to do in one year why does it take one person to do in two years what it takes other person to do in ten years what the hell is the difference what is it so if you guys have some thoughts on what that difference could be why there's such a disparity and why we see that put it in the comments below tell me what you think the difference is okay and then I'll chip in and give my opinion for it as well so some people are saying what you studied cool some people say experience effort ideology cool still waiting on the YouTube comments alright people are like I don't know creativity cool we're getting we're getting some stuff going in Facebook not hearing from you guys what do you guys think it is what do you guys think that difference is where somebody could get that huge jump even though they have a lot less experience even though they're not as good coders some people are saying dedication of time some people are saying selfconfidence entrepreneurship the difference is probably having insight in the industry smart work okay all right so here's it what in my opinion what the difference is it's a lot of self limiting belief that people put on themselves okay and it's a lot of here's what the most important thing that I think people overlook 85% of your financial success and listen to this very carefully and if you're watching this live stream here's what I suggest bring um bring some notes with you bring a notepad and take some notes all right write down what I'm saying and this will really really help you 85% of your financial success comes from your personal likeability your interpersonal skills your people skills your negotiation skills all right and the other 15% of your financial success comes from your technical skills how crazy is that and this is it this is according to Carnegie Mellon University they did a research and that's what they put out and I think it's true it's the 80/20 rule 85 15 in this case but that's really what it is quality of work of course it matters your dedication of course it matters your time of course it matters but how come the dude who's put 30 years into coding and literally codes every single day has eyebags underneath his eyes doesn't even change his shirt like this guy literally was my mentor and I hope he's not watching it um and I love him to death but he literally wore a blue hoodie every single session we've ever had okay and like had crazy eye bags under his eyes and he was the best coder I've literally ever seen okay this guy was like a wizard he'd been coding since he was five years old and he'd been coding all the way through and his work experience was 30 years so I imagine that you've been coding from five since you were five years old and then you also have professional job experience for 30 years so he was probably coding for over 40 years okay yet that was his hourly rate and again you know why is money important a lot of people are like why are you talking about money why do you bring up money so much here's why because I care about you being able to support yourself but not only that you being able to support your family and your friends okay those around you this was something I kind of figured out or it happened to me and I had this realization a while ago and I've told this story where my mom got an accident and I couldn't afford her surgery like literally our family couldn't afford her surgery so for 12 years like she just kept being an agonizing pain and me feeling helpless was the moment for me where I realized that I only need a little bit of money to be happy and I just need to eat food and that's pretty much it and I'll be like good but I need to have more for other people around me and not just enough for myself because I think that's selfish to just have enough for yourself so now going back to the two programmers right one making 30 and other making like 200 an hour that's literally one person's one year of work is equal to the other person six years of work so you're saving yourself a lot of time which gives you freedom you're obviously making good money so you get paid what you deserve you're not overworked and underpaid and you can help out everybody else around you and also you're like I said you have that freedom and that freedom is what we really want right that's what we're alternately looking for and here's what I like about it the most when you're getting compensated well for your time you end up having a lot of extra free time and now with that time you can choose to put in a lot more work maybe even build a business on the side or work on really cool coding projects like nerd out whatever but you could work on your own things and that's the freedom that I like you know for example if you're charging let's say let's say you're happy with making $2,000 a month ok let's just talk about some practical math now let's say you're happy and you enjoy making $2,000 a month and you figure it out the what would keep you happy you could be working 40 hours to make you could be working 40 hours a week to make your $2,000 a month so let's say you could be working 160 hours a month to be making your $2,000 or instead of working hundred and 60 hours a month how about if you had a higher hourly rate that you charge how about you worked for only 40 hours and made $2,000 how about instead of your workweek being 40 hours long your workweek was 10 hours long and you get 30 hours extra now you could take that extra 30 hours and put it towards work and now instead of working 10 hours you're working 40 hours but your income instead of it being 2,000 it's now $8,000 that's one thing you could do the other thing you could do with that 30 hours is literally start going to the gym that time you complain you don't have enough hours in a day to spend with your family friends or your girlfriend whatever take care of that I don't know the third thing is enjoy your life like travel go to different places go to different states go to different countries see what is going on in the world check out different cultures it's unlimited which you could do at that time so that's why it's important to understand and what your earning potential could look like so you have this clear map because most people what you what we do is we just applied lots and lots and lots of jobs and then the first one that comes to us we just accept that and it can even be like some really crappy opportunity and then we just go from there right and then we just go day by day not thinking about what we're doing we work we come home we watch stranger things or house of cards and there's nothing wrong with that if you're watching it from a place of just enjoying it but most of the times our lives are so hectic that we literally need to numb the pain by watching some stuff to keep our minds off of the pressure and the headaches and all the problems so we come home from 900 to 500 a job that we uhhuh we're like it's okay I'm not really feeling it we spend the rest of the time maybe watching a show or something and then we sleep and then we rinse and repeat and go through life like zombies and then we look back and we're like I have an average job that pays an average income I have you know either a partner in life or I maybe don't even have a partner in life I'm physically in just an okay shape if not poor shape and I wish I could do a lot of the things differently and then as soon as that thought creeps into your mind what do you do boom back to Netflix back to watching the TV back to watching your favorite reality show back to calling that best friend that just makes you feel comfortable and feel good and you guys just eat cookies together and you guys just like hang out together and eat ice cream together and both of you try not to remind each other of where were the places where you could have really succeeded and pushed yourself and had that tapped into that potential that you know you kind of had so again it's important to understand that and not go down that path okay just have always have that in the back of your head and like I say you're true friends are not the ones who make you feel comfortable or cuddly or just enjoying yourself those are people you can I mean I honestly hire just hire a therapist or something just pay them hourly to listen to your problems it'll make you feel nice and cushy they'll make you feel cozy you'll be great if you make money you can just hire them that's it that's the type of friends I see a lot of people have just just always trying to make each other feel as comfortable as possible only to then later look back at their life and then regret it I honestly think a true friend is somebody who pushes you and makes you feel uncomfortable not all the time but at times calls you out and it's okay if they make you feel a little uncomfortable but enough to challenge you so you can push yourself forward in in your income in your financial success in your relationships in your you know your body your fitness in your emotional health your mental health whether you do meditation or whatever it is in every aspect of life you should be around people who push you forward and truly care for you that's what it means for somebody to truly care for you like they watch out for you okay so keep that in the back of your mind yeah Netflix Netflix is too expensive for some some of us jaunty so again when you're working on those little apps on the side and you're freelancing you could be making that extra income and then just pay off that Netflix pay off your Hulu subscriptions pay off going to movies pay off those fancy dinner dates pay off your phone bills pay off all these annoying little things that nag at you and even if you do ready to make that full jump yet you could be doing this on the side and save yourself time and just be making that extra income to give yourself that breathing room okay all right here's what I want to talk about now so let's talk a little bit about the calculator that I've put together for you guys and let's talk about your earning let's talk about the money you could be making okay and before I do that one second what's the pho in the in the Facebook it's not really a free program it's just like a free master class we've put together for them so just change it if it doesn't take too long okay so let's talk about kind of your earning potential that you guys could have all right as a Python freelancer you could be charging the normal Python freelancer rate which for whatever reason is not available online I had to find out from my mentor and this was something that helped me you know I've told that story where I was on a phone call and I went from literally $50 an hour and I talked with my mentor he's like go 200 he's like no he goes I don't care how little experience you have you've only been in coding for three months whatever he goes doesn't matter they're trying to you $50 an hour for a Python freelancer is not right 150 an hour is what a Python freelancer should be making if not more so he goes I know you have less experience if you don't feel comfortable 150 just go with a hundred so I didn't feel comfortable at that point to go to 150 I wasn't sure about my skills I got on this phone call and I said hey it was a scary phone call I've talked about this literally my hands were shaking I was like deathly scared and I went I'm like hey so that $50 an hour rate we agreed on yeah that was just like my rate for doing like tutoring or coaching students but for my Python consulting rate I'm gonna charge 100 an hour and if that's okay with you we can move forward otherwise you know we can't and then on the other side he just goes he goes okay we'll see if it's in the budget and hangs up and keep in mind I'm a college student with a 2.0 GPA I don't have a fancy degree I don't even have my associate degree yet I'm in my second year at college and for those of you guys know who don't know what a 2.0 GPA means it just means you're a terrible student okay just take it like that and for me this is opportunity of a lifetime and I'm getting on this call and going from 50 to 100 it's a scary jump but the next day I received a message to set congratulations and you start this Wednesday and when I got that message I just saw it from the notification at the top of my phone I mean it was just like I was sweating you know for the whole day and then it just all that tension all the headache just gone and then eventually I started realizing it's not really that big a deal to charge a hundred dollars an hour though it was scary for me and also that shows the power of having mentors because everybody else to me was just saying you're looking a gift horse in the mouth you're ungrateful and don't charge that much just accept what they have offered you already especially as that student okay alright so now I want to now and tell you this $50 an hour is a pretty low rate for a Python freelancer to charge really low rate but let's say you start at that rate cool you start at the $50 an hour rate somebody said give some other examples other examples of people who charge so yeah I'm giving you another example so one of my mentors charge $30 an hour another one charged $200 an hour as a Python consultant I had a mentor who charge $300 a Python consultant I know of many people who charge 70 or 80 dollars an hour I know because I've hired software developers and they worked for me and I paid them 70 to 80 dollars an hour to work for me on Pi on projects so $50 is a pretty low rate and again the 70 $80 in our people some of them are wearing in United States and some I hired that were actually in India but it doesn't matter to me and it doesn't matter to a lot of people are hiring these freelancers they don't care what country you're in as long as you're good okay and as long as you can communicate that to them all right and you can get the job done so anyways lower hourly rate is 50 now let's say you have one client at $50 an hour let's say you land you spend the next few months and you get only one client okay you you try really hard but you only get one client for one or two three months you try one client at $50 an hour and let's say they don't give you 40 hours of work let's say they don't give you 30 hours of work let's say they don't give you 20 hours of work let's say they are only giving you 10 hours of work per week if you're charging them $50 an hour that's $500 okay in one week for 10 hours of work and that's $2,000 a month okay I'm gonna say this again one client at $50 an hour for 10 hours of work per week gives you $2,000 a month write this down just like that you can then do the math what can happen as you add more clients or as you increase the income or as you increase the hours the $2,000 a month is $24,000 in one full year I know that there's some people who are watching this right now that don't make $24,000 in one full year and you could do this with one client and you could do this with something that's actually enjoyable and fun you could be working on a security project you could be building a social media app for what you could be working with the team who's building a social media app so it's not even that hard you just communicate with them and they like you they just tell you what to do in the train you and you pick up those skills and then you start putting in that work and giving them what they need again it's not easy it's hard okay but if you follow this path okay and you use this this is possible all right it's doable the reason why when I say is not easy as I don't want people to come into this with like no intention of putting in any work you just want to like be lazy you want to be doing exactly what you're doing right now and for some reason come in here and think you're just gonna get massively different results if you start taking action on this and actually doing these things you'll get those results fast but again this is just one client I'm talking about all right $24,000 extra a year could mean you could start up extra business on the side could mean you could pay off all these annoying things that you don't like or it could mean you could pay off the mortgage or you know get a nice apartment that you don't even have to worry about it essentially free again what I've done for you is I've put together your Python earning potential calculator and that's in the description below or if you're watching this on Instagram that's in the live bio what happens is on on YouTube I'm going to show you this what happens is when you go to this page so whatever link I have on Instagram and Facebook if you guys click it and YouTube if you guys click it you're gonna go to a page and the page says free masterclass the profitable programmer go from zero coding skills to landing your first client with Python in under 90 days you put in your name you put in your email all right those are the only two things you have to do then you click get instant access after that you get my your Python potential video that I've put together for you literally spent weeks and months working on this thing all right it's awesome and it's really gonna show you the road map that you need to be following to land first client in less than 90 days and underneath the video I have your Python potential calculator and for those of you who want to figure out your Python developer lifestyle you want to figure out whether you should be you know you maybe you're gonna be a freelancer maybe you want to be a fulltime developer with Python maybe you want to be a site hustler maybe you want to even know why Python okay why are we choosing the language Python why not JavaScript why not some other language okay why is Python the best language of 2017 and is growing to be the number one language as the years you know proceed and we get closer to 2020 all of that is gonna be on this page for you put in your name you put in your email you unlock access to my profitable programmer master class that I've put together for you along with your Python earning potential calculator and I also give you that Python potential worksheet so you can figure out your lifestyle and you can figure out what this could do for your family and you could figure out how much money you could be making and what kind of projects you're gonna be working on all of this I've put together for you for absolutely free all right and they'll be crazy for you to not take advantage of this go right now Instagram click my bio link YouTube click the link in my description do it do it now like stop what you're doing YouTube do it now if you're on your phone pause the video whatever you have to do go click it and Facebook same thing go down click that link alright and once you've done it and you've signed up I want you to come back and say yes I've signed up okay or just say yes I've done it or the number one whatever is easiest for you or just say banana any of those will understand that this is what will help you was this helpful for you guys so far was this helpful for you you you tell me nice cool cool cool the decoder I got it you don't have to spam the section oh really great yo when will the course release on Instagram say you'd asks when will the course release midnovember that's when the course will release abhishekh great yes I've done it awesome armour Khan says man this calculator is amazing great cool coach Patel says cucumber I think that means no because cucumber wasn't an option John says exceedingly nice I took it many days ago and it's very good see the wizzy is telling you guys it's very good yeah and if you guys have belief like if you guys are thinking you know maybe you're too young or too old it's for anybody from you know whether you're trying to go to high school or if you're even younger or you're thinking of retiring I've put it together for everybody dependent regardless of how old you are what your age is okay if you're like 15 you're not gonna be able to well you can actually still Python freelance as early as 15 so I'm not gonna put a limit on that at 9 it probably is illegal right but even if you're 9 you could get a lot of real practical skills and starting around 10 or 11 you can start working on building your own business I had a 9 year old who took my class master class actually and he emailed me he's like Kazi and I'm 9 and he's like I'm learning about he goes my earning potential he's like it's he says it's like $300 a month and I was like oh that's cool that's 300 extra dollars and that was exciting but yeah I mean it's uh you know as a business you could start working as a business if you're really young I mean you can't even legally get a job yet you can start to work as a business I had a 15 year old who was designing some stripe like a while ago hit me up on clever programmer comm and he even wanted to work with me but he was a fifteen year old he had put together a platform kind of similar to stripe for Russia and this kid was making like fifty thousand dollars a month and he wanted to even hire me to work on this project but at that time I was working on clever programmer so I couldn't do it but yeah he was a programmer and he was killing it but it but yeah you know sometimes you could even build your own thing and what's your Python earning potential if any of you guys have opened my page and have gone to the calculator and if calculated earning potential or maybe you have launched a video already and done it what's your earning potential put it in the comments put it in the YouTube comments put it in the Facebook comments I want to know what your earning potential what you're thinking it is and even if you haven't gone through the calculator let me know what you think it is here's the link YouTube press that goddamn button right here hmm go on this page and sign up okay do it and can you look at the emails we have now and then then make a note of it for today and then it will take off okay so second our second part is gonna be released tomorrow November 5th 11 a.m. stop it everything you're doing and put it in your calendar the second part of this video is absolutely mindblowing if you thought the first part if you think this livestream was good if you think that your Python potential video the part one of the masterclass is good just wait till the second part the second part is gonna absolutely blow your mind okay as I said earlier it's gonna blow your brains out well my friend said that that's pretty aggressive so I'm gonna hold back on that one but this one is gonna blow your freaking mind I mean you guys are just not ready for it you guys are not ready for it I'm honest go sign up and just watch it I mean it's exciting as hell it's tomorrow literally I'm like yeah we have been working around the clock if you've been watching my Instagram or Facebook or whatever snapchats you guys see us in the office I'm with my entire team and we're literally working 20 to 30 hours a day I think yesterday what did we do 40 hours we didn't sleep like we literally did not sleep for like two days and we're fine we're completely okay but we work really hard to put a lot of this together and make it just awesome for you guys all right and again it's very practical so it's not just fun and amazing stuff even though that's in there but it's a lot about your earning potential what kind of jobs you could be doing what type of developer do developer do you want to be what kind of companies you're looking to work at how soon you can get started how you can get your first client in less than 90 days get that first paycheck and it's actually you know very realistic I go through the math I also show you literally the code I use to land my first client who paid me $20,000 with two months of work coding I show you literally the code I used okay and with that I also prove to you that coding is actually really easy doesn't require you to be some kind of weird rocket scientist mathematician some complicated genius it's just what coders make you want to believe so they can hold on to their self esteems that's it okay that's literally it they just care about their ego and their self esteem but I don't I don't care about my ego or selfesteem and I'm just gonna show you guys literally what it takes it's like pretty easy all you need to do is just spend time coding you know and learning this and following the path then I'm gonna show you in these videos yeah no no math is required okay math was one of my weakest subjects in college it was never really like I don't know it never really clicked with me maybe I'm just a bad student but yeah math is not my strong suit thing but I was in Oakland Community College and in one year I made a hundred and four thousand dollars okay and just one year at Oakland Community College doing Python freelancing so just connect the dots bad at math you know kind of a dumb college kid but this is possible again it's not one of those like things I for me it was really really hard to figure it out because I didn't have like I didn't know what were the steps I needed to take and everybody in the world makes it so complicated and all the online courses just gave me all this theory and didn't connect the dots for me like okay I know how to write a Fibonacci recursive solution but how the hell do I charge somebody for it and then I looked online and there's not a single job that's like I need you to write me off a Bonacci recursive solution and I spent literally weeks trying to figure it out so it's certain things then I realize are not necessary if you look at my code that I show you the behindthescenes of PLC to what you're gonna see tomorrow is gonna get released it's super simple stuff what I'm showing you obviously if you're good at math you'll have an extra advantage and you can be working on even like you know cool projects that require math you can be working on like data sciency stuff using Python there's nothing wrong with knowing math or liking math or even loving it you can go down that path but I'm telling you there's also a path where that's not necessary and you can get jobs you can use libraries in code it's called libraries and you can import them into your code and literally just use them and how I like to put it it's some developers who have lost their sleep for weeks and months writing this library for you that does all the math they're literally like probably got got in a divorce because they spend so much time coding these things up and you get to write these few commands like import in Python that imports all of the library and you can just leverage that code so all the math a lot of the times it's handled with the libraries you're using for example I'm not good at math but I can even put together image recognition and video recognition software without knowing any math I just import these libraries with Python and then boom boom boom I just go and use them there's a library called OpenCV in Python for example and I just imported in a simple code that I write and then it does image recognition so again guys a lot of it is not as hard as people make it out to be as classes make it out to be and that's really what I want to show you and if you want to learn this stuff and you're serious about it click on the link in bio on Instagram click on the description in facebook facebook and youtube and sign up for the master class that i have open right here for you and yeah so basically my goal is to give you the whole roadmap of what you need okay and in PLC 2 I forgot to mention right there are gonna be some other freaking amazing things I'm giving you guys literally you can steal this thing I'm gonna be giving you guys a full on portfolio and it's special specially designed for Python freelancers I've interviewed so many developers to get the best aspects of like what it takes to put in a portfolio that can almost sell itself alright and requires you to not even learn all those crazy negotiation skills it sells itself by somebody looking at it I've gotten jobs using this portfolio and my close friends have gotten jobs using this portfolio and we've taken all of this and put it together and we're gonna be giving it away literally giving it away with video instructions on how to use this portfolio in PLC 2 so I just don't know how to make it any better and give you guys more value and you're gonna be getting all of this for free ok and the road map and all of that stuff so I'm really excited I mean these master this master class is phenomenal the videos will be amazing and it took a lot a lot a lot a lot a lot of hard work to put it together but we wanted to make sure that it's perfect and it's ready to go and then as you build your career as a Python freelancer I've made this portfolio in a way where you can literally plug and chug okay you can literally plug and chug your projects so it has a my work section and you can just go in boom boom boom boom plug and chug your Python projects and it'll show all your my work as a Python freelancer and then you just link this to other people cool and so for example if you want to get started with things like upward calm and freelancing there you can link this to people and I'm gonna show you much better ways to freelance than up work okay that's just one way to do it and I'm gonna show you guys how to even get jobs on places like up work and all that but that's the up work part or what ever is not covered in the master class but I will show you the portfolio's and things that you need to get going and then you can use them in places like up work okay yep so Python again the reason why we chose Python Python is um you know like I like to say it it's at the intersection of being the easiest programming language being the most paid or one of the most paid programming languages average Python web developer makes a hundred and ten thousand dollars plus every year according to indeed.com okay a Python web developer on average makes a hundred and ten thousand dollars a year according to indeed.com okay you could be on the higher side of that why not all right but that's average developer and that's regardless of where you are living you don't need to be living in United States or a specific spot to be earning that income you could be living in a different part of the world you could be living in Pakistan you could be living in Sri Lanka you could be living in United Kingdom you could be living in India it does not matter that potential is possible for you that's one of the benefits of software developers that they have you can work remotely captain looper asks so now I'm gonna take some Q&A is okay and I'm gonna answer those for you guys why are we not getting any comments on Facebook oh you didn't scroll down oh man I didn't see any of it um sorry Facebook we just didn't see your comments but I'll answer some of your guys's comments right now Siam career says yay oo p students can be a part of it too Kazi man love ya Oh P students can be part of the master class and enjoy it and when the course is launched midnovember the o P students all of you guys get it because you've already gotten the course you guys get that for free okay only the students have gone the o P course alright let's go I'm not sure these questions alright hopefully you guys know where to start now on Facebook list some books for Python one of the books I like lots of books but by John Zell I don't have it right here with me hey Sinclair can you see it says computer science and Python on it and it says by John Zell and make sure the light doesn't drop yeah do you it should it shouldn't be anywhere crazy just one second I'll get the book for you guys yes so this is one book I recommend to you guys it's a really good book I like it a lot I've used it it's not showing clearly on okay it's showing clearly on YouTube it's showing clearly on Instagram they can't see the Oh with them okay now they can see it and fish on clearly alright it's called Python programming and it's by John Zell and you can just get the newest edition and I really like this book it doesn't show you how to get clients anything like that but it takes you through some of the basics of computer programming and it's cool but I'm not really crazy about books I'm more about watching stuff from videos and learning that way so that's why everything I've put together for you guys is you know for video with the video that goes along with everything so you know I'm gonna be showing you all the Python I'm gonna be showing you all the coding stuff but then I'm gonna be spending the right amount of time showing you guys the stuff where you can actually get how you guys can actually get clients how you can get build the client getting system so that gets you like this endless stream of clients without you even necessarily putting in a lot of work it can be automated and I'm gonna be showing you guys some interviews with the top Python developers and freelancers and you know that stuff again comes later that stuff is not in master class I'm getting ahead of myself I'm just really excited but in the master class I have put a lot of stuff in there for you guys okay your Python potential worksheet that helps you figure out your Python developer lifestyle your Python potential calculator that's part 1 part 2 of the video why the best programmers are broke or you're unfair advantage the part 2 which gets released tomorrow in part 2 we talked about building your Python freelancer portfolio and I literally give it to you so you can plug and chug it and I give you a lot of other amazing stuff one of the things being I literally show you the code for the project I built that the client who paid me twenty thousand dollars for less than two months of work and I'm gonna show you how I landed that client because I had only spent ninety days learning and then I landed this client okay I just started from zero coding skills I'd spent 90 days learning coding and then I landed this client and I'll show you how my mentor helped me with that and how I got that so you two can make that happen for yourself okay guys so we're about to wrap it up at this point you're interested you're here you want to change your life you you're interested you want to see what's going on go click the Masterclass link in youtube do it right now Instagram do it right now go down below click the link sign up for the master class Facebook below sign up click the link and sign up for the master class all right it's called the profitable programmer master class yes the profitable programmer master class is free for everybody no matter what country you're in all of the videos

it like it it just literally would actually be stupid alright so if you're interested I would say join it and take a look at it get all the value suck all the value out of it get that portfolio in Python freelancer portfolio and give yourself a head start you have nothing to lose yep link 4 masterclass is in the bio Thank You Sinclair um geez this is really funny yep it's free how can I create my own programming language learn a lot of lowlevel languages and you'll learn how to make your own programming language yeah you don't need pointers for that yep I'm gonna be showing you guys that I'm gonna be giving you guys multiple ways here's a simple way right now they can use right rub rub rub right now upward comm search for clients there look for jobs there but again the missing piece for you would be you go on upper calm you type in Python jobs and then you go how the hell do I do them how do i how the hell do I apply for them how do and these clients how do I go through their interviewing process how do I actually start charging what rates should I set what can I charge for this job how do I do value based proposals you have so many questions and I go and I help you guys out with all of them that's the goal but again if you want to go right now resource for finding clients upwork.com is one of them okay that's just one resource and I share with you many others over

meetups and conferences as a noob how you put it as somebody who zero skills in coding especially then go because you can find people because you can go and find people who will love to mentor you and actually train you because there are people who are dying for hungry students okay and they're not even gonna charge anything and you know there are people who are hungry for oh thank you captain looper just paid again yo this is awesome I'm actually the live liking live streaming I'm just kidding I love live streaming can I join five days later because my tenth fun guys let's talk a little bit quieter please because it's picking it up when will we get second class of Python course second class comes out tomorrow what are the questions here how can we make code slowing our mind for every problem sir be Sony there's a website called code to flow I think Co de the number 2 and then the word flow comm so code to flow calm let me just double check I'm not lying and basically what it allows you to do is really easily yeah just make these little flow charts and instantly and yeah I really like it so sir B maybe you could use that okay check it out type that into the Facebook thing are you on Facebook okay just type that into the Facebook oh this is awesome almost says hey I'm gonna start donating soon as well I can donate in pounds right of course yes you can this is so cool I don't even care how much they pay me it's just like so fun to look at it it's like super chat I know that's what I'm selling you donate it twice that's so awesome thank you I appreciate it it's just fun like there's something about it it's like addicting it's like you know when you're playing video game sometimes and you get that achievement you know it's kind of like that ha Koons asks how long did it take you to learn and all question in all caps and in double question marks I don't guys don't be like desperate to get your question out there just ask calmly because this is something important I want to tell you because when you come off desperate and needy like this I don't want to answer it and then when you send out emails like this that come off desperate and needy people in high places don't want to answer it so no matter how good of a coder you are if you come off like that they're not even gonna read your email and that's what a lot of the time can make the difference between you making $30 an hour and 150 dollars an hour okay so keep that in your in the back of your head now I'm gonna go ahead and answer you a question it took me three months going from zero to landing my first client with Python and then after two months of working for them or less than two months they gave me a nice little check for twenty thousand one hundred and seventy three dollars and thirty cents I got this when I was in my second year of college at Oakland Community College with a GPA of 2.0 so not your smartest student and Oakton doesn't necessarily sound like Harvard so hopefully that answers your question Viraj asks kazi while coding if any errors occur where can a beginner like me seek a help you can look on Stack Overflow but that sometimes complicated so to seek for help what I would do is if you have money hire a mentor on a platform like code mentor that's what I would do any money I made for my other job when I was trying to pick up my coding skills I would either hire a mentor and if I couldn't hire them I would go to meetup groups and I would try to learn everything that I could till I found a mentor okay yeah those would be the best places or find people who are in web development or do do coding near you okay it may be a friend or whatever and ask them that would be a good whoa we got one dollar donation from Aamir Khan this is awesome Thank You AMA I appreciate it man god it just feels so good like now when I go get that coffee and I know that it's been paid for it's like wow it just feels so good look at how juicy that looks hold on let me can I report it no you can't pin it I can go to his channel apparently Sam shareer says Stack Overflow is my Bible yes but Sam you're you are a little bit more advanced but yes Stack Overflow is my Bible as well my front the master classes will be recorded but the master class will be released tomorrow and it will be taken down soon so you don't want to miss out on this literally put it in your calendar take a notepad take a pen right now write down tomorrow 1100 a.m. I will send you an email that will have all the details for how you can go and watch that master class and go to my page clever programmer calm right now or go to the link in the description below and click on it and opt in for the master class hmm and be like here how long a day should I program to be good MA teacher asks ma teacher I have a video I'm hiding my face here I have a video called how long should you coat every day and the best resources on YouTube so go ahead and watch that video or make a note of it and watch it later what does it take for a beginner like me with no coding skills at all again I started with no coding skills zero coding skills and this thing that I've put together is for people with zero coding skills and also for people who are busy and can only spend a little bit of time every week ok so I made sure that I make it so it's in a way where if you don't have any coding skills it's even perfect for you right now it's 1200 p.m. where I am located but that will be confusing to anybody who's watching the recorded video of this live stream so sorry for that confusion but for people who are live it's you know 1209 p.m. in Chicago and the video and I release it tomorrow 1100 a.m. it's gonna be 1100 a.m. CST Central Standard Time which is Chicago time or really or really and says oh no you should have said you would be here what do you mean by that do you mean like announce the livestream earlier all right let's see what kind of questions I'm getting no questions on Facebook can you scroll that down a little bit how do you design a game in Python there are some courses on Coursera that are pretty cool for games in my course that I'll release later I'll show you guys how to do web development in Python and using that you can design games in Python and then put them online so people can use them oh that was on YouTube okay can I build a mobile app with the decoder asks if it is freeforall then what does advantage for olp students the advantage is that when I release my course create apps and land your first client with Python in less than 90 days and get that first paycheck that course will be free for the opie students ok it is a paid course but it will be free for the opie students George Kirino asks where can I find a place that tells your shows you want the different things you can do with code the functions that are done and what else started it up the master class if you sign up for it which is in the description and right here this is what the page will look like so this is where you just go put your name boom put your email and you can sign up for that that will show you all those things ok and if not that I also have a free coding course on clever programmer comm on my website ok and you can take that course and I'll show you lots of things alright if I am making a game with Python where do I actually see the code that works oh people do that for everybody new Opie was my older Python course that I launched last time I made my course available which was in at the end of June and that was the course where I showed you more of the technical coding stuff objectoriented programming and I also built we built some apps and I taught some graphical user interface things of that nature so that's my older course but my new course that I'm gonna be releasing is the one that's called create apps and land your first client with Python in 90 days best laptop for programmers I enjoy I enjoy MacBooks a lot alright guys thank you guys so much for watching glad you guys are here I'm gonna be bouncing if you were here up until this point you found this valuable I'm just gonna end it with this my master class the profitable programmer master class I've put it together for you so I can give you the roadmap on how you can land your first client in less than 90 days get that first paycheck I tell you my story of how I went to Oakton Community College as a 2.0 GPA student made a hundred and four thousand dollars in one year and how you can to following the road I also give you literally hand you a downloadable portfolio app that you can use as a Python freelancer which has a my work section which where you can just plug and chug Python projects as you go forward in your Python freelancer journey and I literally also show you the code behind my twenty thousand dollar app that I built that took me less than two months that I got to do while I got to travel meet my nephew who was born and and some cool other stories that go in there okay so there's a lot of stuff that's covered in the video that I just don't have the time to go here but that video shows you literally everything and you can take those things and start applying them right away in your life hopefully this was valuable for you thank you guys so much for watching I love your faces off and as always I'll see you YouTube and you Facebook in the next video
