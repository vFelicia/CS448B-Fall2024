back exactly hey look at this i love the energy dude i'm loving this cu says these guys build the craziest things in react i guess super hyped over a simple sub alert love it hell yeah yo here is another react native app that i really enjoyed actually taking a look at like take a look at this one and this is like one of those apps that seems um you know like those super popular apps that you get you see and that's like millions of downloads you know do you know what's impressive dude if this was actually their first app that is so clean for a first half that is a fullon ready to go into the app store yes because this is how like those apps are like you know kayak which allows you to pick time you know travel and airport and um flights and stuff like that yeah things like that this is clean if you guys enjoyed this app make sure you smash the like button fetty says you're an inspiration for me i really like to be on the team one day hey nothing's impossible guys i actually used to watch cp and now i'm on the stream so oh yeah that's true yeah exactly i just i totally i almost forgot about that yeah um let me actually fix up i'm going to zoom you in too bro so you look myself look at that that's intense right that looks great yeah yeah alright cool so let's see david says love these live streams you guys rock amazing so do you so this is another idea of what type of apps one i we highly recommend that you actually go to reddit and type in react native and sort by top apps and year here's the url for it although at the top you guys can even go to this url directly if you want and you can use this to get really good ideas for what types of apps to build oh dude check it out middah tahir says i just earned 30 dollars from fiverr from a react project thank you sonny and kazi that's dope dude yeah thank you for sharing that really really appreciate you that's awesome that makes me really happy oh i love it there's an app called oh yeah you've got the screen it says let's fork my first real native react native app and an app to help couples groups of people decide where to eat that's that's a pretty clever name that's fork yeah that's a really great app by the way it's kind of like tinder oh wow you have a new oh yeah that's wipes right yeah for food that's cool that's really really cool um almost a year of learning react native here's my first full project ledger oh my god that looks good what's up um oh damn it's a training app sick dude it looks great look look at that barbell curls yeah dude wow i really wish that this app is actually published yeah and you know what this is cool dude because a lot of people watch react native as in like they see tutorials and they're like yeah but if you guarantee it's not going to look that great you know if it's going to compile down to ios and android but guys these apps look beautiful and uh and it just goes to show you that you can get any app pretty much made with react native so uber those kind of apps all done with the react native holy crap wait uber is done with react native that's insane yeah i think it's ubereats i think it's on it's actually on react native's website at the bottom you've got a bunch of the uh the builds crazy dreams really do come true after two years of playing with react native my app is finally on the app store and pending approval from google play wow dude that's cool man and guys we want to do this and see the same thing with you guys like because when we teach you watch us building it and things like that go ahead and release your apps that would be so cool to see your apps in the app store oh man these apps are amazing recently released a deep fake gifs app built with react native oh this person released it actually nice oh [ __ ] this one's called bottom sheet model feature is out yes i was looking at that yep yeah that's handy man yeah i thought that was really cool too yeah actually be able to just go here and play with it have it in your app yeah because that simple sort of swipe up from the bottom sort of thing you'd probably want in a few different use cases yeah that'd be cool josh says thank you uh for making our lockdown a bit of fun and interesting yep you got it you're welcome dude i'm in the uk and we just went under another lockdown so hey exactly that's that that sucks bro hey somebody just fg just subscribed let's go thank you for subscribing my friend appreciate that all right um guys if you're enjoying this we're up to 182 people which is absolutely fantastic go ahead and smash that like button so this video goes out to more and more people exactly thank you guys i like these swipe left swipe right type of apps these are clean and it seems like simple enough to make and check out like this is pretty cool how this guy's done it yeah it's like a was this a try to create a recreate ux ui or watch on instagram would love something about cider it's dynamic items a map from an array and jason oh [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] jacked array that's kind of like cool to just visualize an array like that yo i say us cuevas thank you for subscribing to our channel oh this one's beautiful dude like it's if you scroll up i think um there's one where it says after falling in love with react native less than a year ago here's my first project tour you see that one where so go up a little bit i think you've skipped faster but it's such a nice app uh it up a little bit more um that one there i think it's that yes that one recent no no oh no oh okay so it's not actually shown it's my one was underneath this so um i guess it's not showing up on yours but it will yeah it should you should yeah got it the xbox store oh nice someone created oh man somebody weaker the xbox stores and it's lightning fast that's cool that looks like it's made for ipad or something yeah right that's pretty cool yeah i was wondering that because he's gonna i don't know how that would come out on a phone but um that's pretty clean all right let's try making the width of this thing 500 to the width now let's see if people chat with it oh [ __ ] did i mess it up that one yeah nice oh no yeah now it looks cool all right awesome there we go hey okay so let me go here this is aurora is a cool app like the design of it looks super slick like i love all this type of design like even when i go here i love this type of design of apps very flat kind of design very modern it's kind of the material ui finish yeah i love that let me actually filter yep popular these are react native apps i'm looking at oh this is clean this is clean look at guys notice how every single one has like a flat consistent design and the colors are the same that's that's nice dude where's this is his current house it's like a fantastical and a calendar calendly sore style app yeah looks beautiful what's this digital signature app wow these are gorgeous man like all these people they make such beautiful apps and the thing is that it doesn't even have to have that crazy of a functionality when they make it look beautiful it just kind of blows your mind even if it's simple functionality exactly exactly it just needs to be clean and then like it really like you could have the craziest app but if it looks all complicated and like an admin dashboard it's just nobody's going oh what's up i can't read that name thank you for subscribing really appreciate it and if you guys donate now the donations actually come up on the page which is cool yeah we need to see that in action that'd be cool yeah oh this looks so good look at this one last investments that's clean dude that's like a revolute style oh yeah oh investment nice like i love um i love this type of [ __ ] they do you see how there's like the flowing yeah like stuff's floating and then it's like on top of it it's floating across two different and it's floating on top with the drop shadow and [ __ ] like that looks so cool venus thank you for subscribing really appreciate you thank you uh it's really good to look at dribble like as a source of inspiration because like before you come to dribble you would pretty much like kind of be like yeah i might build like you know some kind of financial app you come past it scroll a few a few times and within seconds you see this yeah i will give you a media like it literally would give you features to build like like last investments that you previously made and things like that you're gonna get like a nice outline from just literally a bunch of designs this is so cool and then yes and if you build something exactly like this i mean you can't go wrong i mean imagine having stuff like this on your portfolio like jesus exactly dude insane like if you have oh dude look i've got a first super donation whoa somebody just gave 10 000 something thank you this amazing channel i'm quite doing the web development work and your channel has helped me a lot appreciate that thanks so much ctb thank you for the donation really appreciate it wow that is amazing um maybe we'll have to put something behind our chat because otherwise it won't show yeah you have to have some kind of like you know border or something yeah okay boom that's sick oh damn oh dude this is actually really cool go back to um um reddit for a sec ready somebody yeah so somebody made a clone of snapchat it should be a little bit further down whoa microsoft ditched electron for react native damn oh [ __ ] they're actually goodbye electron last ring result memory um i never thought microsoft would use that oh damn that's awesome man wow that's pretty powerful where do you want me to go so there's a snapchat clone so if you keep going further down oh yeah yeah yeah check this out because like it's pretty cool because it actually shows you what you can do with the pwa yeah so add to home screen that's how you get uh that's a react app that's crazy right that's actually not really that that's a react app but you he add to home screen which you can do with every react app that not many people know yeah and they have everything as a native app yeah i did not know that until you told me about pwas and you're like yo i can just add it to my home screen now it's like an axe like an app i'm like what yeah because now look at that you don't get this the little sort of safari stuff at the bottom you just pretty much get a seaming this like app experience wow that's kind of insane that's so cool like it just saves you all the time saves you all the time and then imagine you get the benefit of being able to deploy and then i'm immediately getting the updated version michelle says you guys are the best thank you so much thank you so much dude i got one from him on this app holy [ __ ] like this guy actually just made a fullon clone yeah crazy dude oh look on this on the topic of cards check the one below it look how clean the card design is on that that's clean gorgeous man i love this type of stuff let's show you how let's show you how to make an awesome prototype for card payment with react native you think that somebody posted their tutorial on here oh nice they even got their source code for it oh yeah yeah i would want to take the this type of source code and play with it you know that would be super cool yeah the code here advanced thank you so much dude appreciate it whoa this guy released his first react native app but look at that he [ __ ] went crazy like he made a [ __ ] video trailer man like he's even got dragon drop or equations oh [ __ ] that's sick what the hell wow i'm on it bottom tab navigation oh that's cool bottom tab navigation like beautiful navigation yeah and i don't think dude even before like we we kind of went on this video i typically wouldn't have looked at reddit for inspiration yeah you pretty much get the best features like that bottom tab is actually going to be super useful if you're building on a oh black ice says keep putting out great content guys decided to watch on here today instead of youtube nice that's cool where is he watching from is that on twitch yeah watching from twitch hey we just hit 200 live viewers guys thank you so much let's go let's keep this energy up smash that like button if you are enjoying this content you guys exactly guys we'll get the video out to as many people as possible yep all right savings open source spotify clone oh damn dude i think it's i think that build is probably coming soon check that out a little bit further down oh this app is cool as [ __ ] a little peek of savings going that's cool like look this guy is working to save up to airpods like an arcade type of design that's sick that's clean oh spotify whoa wow i think that's definitely a build guys if you want to see a react native spotify build yeah and that's something you guys really really are interested in let us know right now in the comments and smash the thumbs up button but let us know and yeah we can pretty much go ahead and get that done once we get to these builds that'll be a cool project to build that would be a lot of fun look at this microsoft outlook is moving to react native oh nice oh my god dude that's this is actually crazy i didn't know that a lot of big companies including xbox like uh microsoft that they're all moving to ragnay which is insane that's really insane dude react native net wick slash react native navigation oh damn transition oh that's a clean transition dude while we're here i finally remembered what i wanted to show you once thank you etta ed dia for following thank you so much i appreciate it i've been tiger transitions react i've always wanted to show you this but yeah i literally forgot it um a while back and then i finally remembered it um that's kind of cool so go to tiger where where on google on google type in tiger transitions react tiger as in tiger isn't like a lion tiger trigger the british accent bro [ __ ] me up uh the the pita one yeah click that one yo thank you for subscribing really appreciate you guys thank you so much oh see that so now go down a little bit there should be a documents and demo link and then click on the documents demo link i was trying to find this for so long because it's so powerful and then um what you want to do is click on demo when you get into the section and guys if you ever need these kind of transitions it is so sick like uh go to demo at the top and then you've got the different effects like glide and then click start demo oh we that's crazy right that is slick let's go glider that's literally a web page dude like that's gorgeous that's using react and that's him upgraded some of your app transitions to that no don't overdo them with it but as in like if you gave like the user when they go into their settings screen and it kind of flipped out that would be kind of crazy right yeah i would just make them [ __ ] get like a headache yeah it's [ __ ] just nonstop all right this is unfold oh wow that looks fun yeah it's crazy if it's on your portfolio or something you can get away with that kind of thing if it goes if you go a bit too mad then they're probably gonna get like a c a seizure or something from that yeah all right guys i'm gonna start blocking people who are spamming the chats so no i'm sorry no warnings just straight blocks if you're not adding value to the chat i'm just gonna block you i love you but uh just you know keep it clean exactly damn wow oh nice even back on reddit there's a uh animated tab bar which is clean oh my god that is nice man i don't know why some apps don't don't use that like imagine instagram use this kind of thing so if you go to reddit um i think i'm on number two eight three so on the left is 283 is in the output oh see i mean yeah yeah i know i'm going finding it that's funny it's probably skipped on yours built an instagram clone with react dark mode took seven days to build oh wow look at that green that's been that's probably before two months ago no so instagram had dark mode i mean was it two months ago they had a dark mode was it it was a while before but oh either way that's still that's an awesome project yeah that's an amazing project wow i love apps like this dude their visual timer was react native you're like anything with visual where it's like sort of like kind of help you out or it pings you with a notification or like you know if you're doing pomodoro yeah actually let me see what type of app i would really like to log in come in let's see oh yeah uh maybe income or something uh i mean something simple like that could be pretty really cool actually like this one right here oh yeah that's queen that's clean like hot where are we at with the monthly earnings so far see i would use i would use react js for that yeah that's fine i mean i would i would be happy building that in react by the way completely happy yeah um but you see we could do like a react native app something like this would be cool too like you see the cards with that sort of 3d it's all flat but 3d this one yeah that's gorgeous yeah oh my god this looks so good oh my god that looks so [ __ ] good like imagine here yeah imagine here you have net worth oh that's clean right imagine here you have recent sales that would be nice scheduler could be a very cool sort of like calendar view when you click it pop up your skin like you're kind of for the day yeah oh my god that would be sick imagine over here right so this is pretty cool so imagine this okay all the red days are where you lost money like you were net negative all green days are where you're net positive that's clean man right yeah that's clean now this is a good design dude you should save this on yeah this yeah yeah guys if you're enjoying it smash the thumbs up button and let us know what you would want to build in terms of react native apps all right that is so good wow like this would be amazing so like if we're logging daily income and if it looks something like this oh 10 up or whatever like that's so cool this is like a really modern app that's nice right yeah that's that's really nice that's kind of like the banking app i use right now they you they have a very similar design to that dude we should start posting these apps on our like slack channel that'd be really cool [ __ ] yeah i mean our instagram channel what the [ __ ] did i say yeah channel instead you mean like uh oh my god yeah like ig post like oh my god look at this [ __ ] this looks so amazing that's nice it's so cute it has like a cloud somebody said this is brill oh that's maribel i i was like some british person is here your friends in the chat like dude look at this line graph it it's like [ __ ] 40. that's clean we just got a super chat oh nice thank you rahul thank you appreciate you brother lads all right all right all right visualization that we've really m3js also this would be sick too so like i love seeing bar graphs if i could actually see a bar graph of the daily sales just simple like that would be really really cool yeah yeah i think the first design was was actually really clean man yeah because it was in in a glance you could see everything yeah yeah the first one meaning the one i sent you yeah i mean that's also pretty that also requires a lot of things like that requires like net worth and [ __ ] like that but that would be that would be cool yeah because all of these would just require the income in some form of like you know some kind of import there and then you would pretty much just go ahead and build it into that that kind of look like what i want to do is like for example i think this is like overkill for step one of what we're trying to do for step one we just need a way to log income and see it like literally just income so barbara something like that is b1 so like v1 even forget about that purple line just the green line alone is [ __ ] great yeah yeah and some way of visualizing it on the back so like even if i manually just log how much income we made today it just if it makes that graph that's fantastic that's perfect yeah exactly somebody said something i'm a developer like you guys working at volkon web solutions llc nice rahul hey we just broke 200 off [ __ ] my life i hit the chat by mistake yo did you see tesla is looking for react native engineers really yeah it's in reddit four months ago oh i didn't know there was a talent on this sub but my team is looking for engineers and uh that's straight from tesla dude this kind of looks cool the blue graph oh damn they've all got that kind of swipe up you know overlay you could use that library that we saw inside oh yeah they're using that library yeah you see this dashboard where they have this like line graph below ui oh yeah yeah like that for income i mean like the app that we're kind of building seems pretty good to be honest yeah like this is cool this bar graph is really cool yeah getting i mean getting this stuff out there initially like just functioning right yes and then getting this sort of design paint on the ends 93 of the job for me is complete if i can just add my income and see like a like like this here right yeah if i if i can just add my income and i can just see the graph i'm happy exactly somebody so bala ganesh says like firebase github netlife is there any source to host react native app apart from expo i mean i don't really know why you would want to go away from expo um because expo makes your life so much easier um but beyond that you can use something called test flight that's why is pretty cool it's how you test the ios app before it goes into the app store uh we talked about that and when the coaching course actually has awesome uh test flight like i want the app to say some encouraging messages like you guys are doing like you're doing 23 better this time than last month like keep going like if you keep if you keep up with this pace of income for the next week you'll beat out your last quarter you know what i mean like yeah things that design behavior change for our team like we'll push like um oh paris is in the chat dude oh [ __ ] what's up paris hey yeah i know what you mean dude like is it it drives habit if literally if you're because every time i have a few apps that just ping me like random stuff like don't be lazy go and do this or like don't be lazy like read this book don't be lazy go get crazy yeah i agree like this is too much like i don't like this design because what the [ __ ] like it's like yeah i feel like it's a bad i feel like i got paid in like usd on this day and like somebody paid me in like [ __ ] pastries on this day yeah cause for a second hey we just got a donation of one dollar thank you so much hey thank you i saw one where it was like the red like it had a red color and i was like oh but then it didn't really make sense because the other one the larger bit was red so yeah just gets like too too much here's another one like income boom income yeah that's clean how much did we make so far this month a total like summation right there this is the one we can follow bro this is the one we can follow yeah that's like pretty simple and we can use that layout yep we're already using the line graph right yeah that's good we just need to be able to log the income right underneath it and then boom the total amount right there and that's that's a good one save that because imagine on the left we've got dashboard pretty much rendering out all of that we already have the grass doing that in react would be pretty it will be easier than react native and then on the right we could have like a live feed of it of the events you know the last three events yes preferences open drop page after upload nope nice say that again sonny what's up i wasn't saying that on the right side that you could have like a list of the last live events you see where it says income spent that's cool by this person sale by that person expense out you know yeah yeah yeah yeah like some live events exactly that would be really cool like frankie closed the sponsorship deal or like sale for this or that okay that's cool exactly that'll be awesome here's another good one simple income um i like that that's pretty clean as well yeah i'm a fan i'm a fan of the the straight simple you know simple graph dude i love [ __ ] like this too where it feels like it's coming off the screen or something like yeah that looks so yummy like i want to eat it like i literally like i want to grab it eat it they got rid of that old style like 3d effect it's it's kind of it's it's like flat but pops out with a shadow that's all they do now really so like this this is like the modern design because it's flat but it just pops out with a shadow that's all it is it's flat with a shadow but oh really old ios update is that what makes it feel like but what makes it feel like it's literally [ __ ] real or something yeah it's that clean like because they used to go like i mean it's like everything goes in and out of trends you know like back in the day ios apps used to kind of all the the app icons used to be like this 3d looking shiny shine to it see that's a bit like as you know that is pretty good for crypto that's pretty handy for crypto i'm just thinking uh hmm this is like maybe the percentages can tell us oh that's cool so like okay for example i would want to know our daily average of sales that's i think important yep um that was top left yeah even if we don't know the net worth i think that would be fine but like even for version one like my average of daily sales yeah would be huge because that's one thing i practically always need to look at or i manually try to calculate it um yeah and then i'm trying to think um so and then like day by day activity is is pretty good i'd say you know like because then you see that bottom right graph if that's like your day by day because that will you from that one visualization you'd be straight away see that okay are we making the same every day or is it kind of up down up down up down or are we going downhill you see how i mean like a bar graph here yeah yeah okay cool yeah and then like a percentage and the only the what percentage basically just means is compared to last month yeah like month to date basically see what i'm saying comparing it to previous period of month to date are we better so it's like in the first 14 days of november are we doing better than first 14 days of october yeah it's in like you what you would have two date pickers and some kind of select like comparison or no not date pickers just a permanent percentage that's there that's always comparing current months to date with previous month to date so if it's november 14th it should just be if we're on november 14th right yeah and looking at our sales there should also be a percentage sign that's telling us like oh you guys are actually out performing last month by seven percent so far yeah that'd be clean i really like the idea of of that and then remember that the the calendar view with the either the green dot or the red dot um oh yeah oh yeah yeah that would be really cool but that one is i think version two because it requires us to log expenses as well yeah that's true yeah but that one i mean that is really really cool damn these react native like look at this like for example if we have something that's telling us how much our profit is over the quarter that would be really cool and for it to look like that type in on dribble let me have a look on dribble um type in like somebody suggested earlier like a graph or something like graph really like you know like graphing kind of apps because you kind of if you swipe through them you kind of get you get like some because they all have like a similar look and feel there's something like this this is pretty sick so okay so let me oh man i can't actually you can link it to me oh yeah that's it okay um oh no um that one is really cool you see like dark mode would be amazing you see where it says income look at the dark mode of income at the top see that yeah that looks incredible how many girls suddenly laughed at my joke i was kidding was the joke you guys are crowding the youtube server [Laughter] have you ever noticed you know alexander i think it's alexandros tuition always comments with a plus i've always noticed that i don't know what even when he messages me on instagram he messages with a plus i don't know if he's really consistent with that or what yeah that's crazy man man i kind of just want somebody to build us an app like that take the work oh you know we should do we should actually i'd be happy paying them for it i just would love an app like that where i can log react native [ __ ] sales for the team yeah what were you gonna say sony girlfriend i love how everyone's supposed my name is sony alexandra he said plus consistent plus fire plus alexandra's please give us an explanation dude like so he's actually a monk by the way no way really yeah he told me that because i was reading uh jay shetty's think like a monk and he responded or something and he said i was training to be a monk or something along those lines that's cool that's cool yeah i'm reading that book right now that's it yeah nice man 10x rule for me right now is game changer yeah yeah that looks awesome holy [ __ ] jacked oh man look at me being a tyrant over here just blocking him and i was like oh [ __ ] oh this is cool as [ __ ] that's pretty cool wow look at that at the bottom you can actually see your run mapped out that gave me an idea imagine we had a way of because when we track a sale um for one of the products like we have we know who it comes from right so imagine if we had bar graphs and then each bar graph had a picture of the person on top oh that would be so cool how cool would that be because i mean as soon as you go into the dashboard you'd see like and they can pull the picture from one of their social profiles like for example if they give you their email then you can actually pull a picture from either their facebook
