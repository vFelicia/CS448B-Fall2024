hey guys so here's our challenge I want to promote my new online product and find top influences to do that as you may don't know who answers marketing is getting more and more popular and basically you can find influencers pay them and they will promote your products for example there are beauty influencers tech influencers even Fitness influences so the idea is to use Python and create online database which stores all of the influences in a selected nation checked already online products and there are a couple of them but all of them are not free so why shouldn't we do our own let's do it so first of all we have to make some research about influencer marketing what I mean by that is how to actually find good influences and what is necessary to know about them I mean we can find out about some indicators like daily growth average likes for post engagement ratio those indicators are necessary to know if our influences are not using any BOTS or they are not buying any likes or followers and in order to do that we have to gather the data in Instagram in a time for example in a period of one week then we will know that they are not using any boss they are not buying likes there are a couple of ways to implement that one of them is using Instagram API or thirdparty libraries from github or we can even implement our own API then we have to also think about technologies that I will use python django Django rest framework and then got a choose database probably Postgres SQL or MySQL or even SQLite we got a plan all the relations and database models and then we got to think about the script which will actually gather all the data remember we don't want to make just one single request because then the data won't be accurate we gotta use some additional service such as cron jobs to be able to make requests every few hours and govern good data and of course we gotta think about deploy of our application probably will use AWS services such as PC to sir turned out that Instagram API allows us to do only 200 calls per hour which is in my case not enough so I also decided to check existing libraries existing repositories in a github but they didn't satisfy me so I decided to implement my own I plant a rough ink on a white board and we will need one API and three scripts which I'll talk about just in a minute so our models look like this we get a category for a selected niche for example tag then we have Instagram accounts which is pretty clear we have Instagram posts which we'll be updating together with Instagram accounts and of course we have Instagram account reports to know how many followers do we have on Monday then on Tuesday Wednesday and so on so we can somehow calculate the growth the daily growth and of course we have hashtags to discover new accounts oh hey before we continue this video is sponsored by Atlantic dog net a planting dotnet provides great VPS hosting and they are very a free one gig virtual server with SSDs and block storages for free for a year a free snapshots for one year plus $25 and free credits to use their other services try Atlantic dotnet to develop test or launch your next projects ease of use is something I like as it frees up my mind to focus on my code that's really valuable to me especially when I'm coding and I don't want to get stuck so don't waste your time go to Atlantic dotnet slash clever programmer and enter code Kwasi to get $25 credits which is just special for this channel I asked these guys to do something special for you guys and they did so try them out so now we gotta create the first scraper and it will be a scraper which finds the new hashtags for a certain category let's say well we want to find the influencers related to technology we have to supply it with the first hashtag let's say coding and as we can see here in Polish this is the related hashtags so we can create a recursive function which will work like this we do coding then we iterate through all of them for example then we create a click on computer science and again we iterate through all of them and go deeper deeper deeper and in the end we have set of the hashtags related to our category so our next scraper is a scraper which actually finds I influences finds good accounts and in order to do that instagrammed gives us the popular posts whenever we are in a hashtags and explore page first nine posts are promoted by Instagram so we can iterate for them and we can get on those accounts and add them to our database so as you can see there are totally different accounts and we'll be adding them that script aesthetic route which will actually update our account here which is the most important thing will be updated every few hours would be checking every few hours if the accounts were actually updated or not and so here's the API view but there's also like the script view which will ask the database if the accounts were updated and if they weren't then it will update them and also we'll do reports we'll get a new info board posts and everything so let's run our script and yeah as you can see it's updating their accounts or checking if they were updated and as you can see also added me which means that I may be the influencer related to tag as I saw it added some of my friends which I also follow so we are basically it's pretty cool and now let's see how it looks like in a API so this is the API view from Django rest framework here I set the category technology which we added next are we going to take a look at our accounts so we got a couple of accounts here we got also Mead we can also order our accounts for example by daily growth and this crazy account grows more than 1000 followers every single day so it's a huge page we of course has our reports we have posts and hashtags alright guys so it turns out our group is actually working we got everything we can right now promote our favorite online product because we got influences the one thing which I have discovered is we don't truly get own influence account we also get those huge aggregations account we just re repost other accounts but I guess it's still fine for a short project and yeah guys it's open source project so you can go to my github and get the whole for free and even develop it by own add some new features and yeah let me know some comments what do you think and subscribe to my channel and thanks for watching
