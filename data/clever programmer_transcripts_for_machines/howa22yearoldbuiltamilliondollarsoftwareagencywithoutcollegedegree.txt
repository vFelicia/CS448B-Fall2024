old i thought you were 23 years old 22 years old guys and blake is the ceo of assad regime called modzi he started this back back back when i started this in 2018 so was that three or four years ago three four years ago and he's built it to become this amazing empire now and he's doing an amazing job he's probably one of the hardest working people that i know personally and this is the type of person like when he starts something he just goes fully in you if i correct me if i'm wrong you did not go to college right you went ahead and you started building software in high school while everybody also doing some other stuff and going partying you're like know what i'm gonna strap down and i'm just gonna focus and do some you know and build some software and build some webs is that correct that's completely correct yes and then after that from what i know is he then he's he then went to a company you were doing some bitcoin stuff as well and you did an amazing job there after that you started this modus software agency and you built it now to how many employees do you currently now have we've got eight right now eight employees guys and from what i know he's a top rated company on upwork with over 500k i mean probably 500k plus in revenue just from upwork just as uprook says on there so guys welcome welcome blake i'm so pumped to have you on here we just got this is i'm very excited to talk to you i'm very excited to share your story and to inspire so many so many people out there in the world so blake welcome how are you doing man doing very good definitely glad to be uh connecting with you again we've had a long history together from you know us us working together years ago and then we even met up in miami so yeah great to see you again man yeah we met up in miami i remember i went to there i went there for a little bit just i think for a conference or whatever it might be and i'm here blake let's get together i remember at that point you were working on a project or something and then you will you were working the project and you were literally doing an allnighter because you had to finish i don't think we had slept because it was uh hamilton and i don't think we had slept in probably three or four days so holy [ __ ] that's crazy that's crazy so yeah uh blake i know you have introduced you often juice a little bit but tommy kind of a little bit of kind of like what do you currently do i know you don't you do monzi but tell me about what yourself you know in terms of like what your current situation is because it doesn't matter it's been a while since i've since i've talked to you so tell me kind of a rundown of what you're currently doing are doing specifically yeah so i've got my hands in a couple different things right now um really majority of it is still software related it's just different sectors of it so you know one is obviously mozzie the agency we've actually shifted a little bit of our focus from what our our focus was last year so for the past three years we've been really focused on automation software specifically in oil and gas clean energy wealth management automotive those spaces and then the past eight months or so we've really shifted um and this is something we'll get into we can get into a little bit later but we've shifted because uh we had a client that came to us and needed some telehealth related um application support so telehealth what what is what is still health telehealth is going to be things like um integrating video chats or things like zoom into applications voice calling a voice over ip call center technology so really the past eight months we've gotten really heavy on that kind of technology and a majority of our client base has shifted initially into that and then branching out to do automation software software with us after um but that's kind of the core focus of where mozy is at right now um some of the other things that i'm working on as well is uh addiction recovery software mmhmm six or seven months ago connected with an organization that provides uh health record management platforms for addiction recovery clinics so if somebody comes in they may have an alcohol or substance abuse addiction they come in and they can use our platform to go from initial intake all the way to post recovery and connect with um we call them peers so people who are helping people go through recovery and so is this like from a client that you have or this is just like your own application you start decide to start yeah so this was initially a client that turned into a development partnership no way that's awesome that's amazing and has that become successful uh i would say very successful and we've we've served over 160 000 people last year for um going through addiction recovery services through our platform wow that's insane so what to do they basically they go on this platform they sign up for subscription and stuff like that and then what they get like coaching or something like that correct yeah so really our tool is is more focused on providing the clinics and organizations with the tools they need to service their uh participants or people going through recovery so we'll work with organizations to build out custom forms or data reporting that allows their participants to come in and say hey i need to you know basically keep track of the full process so keep track of documents status updates they can call video all that kind of stuff through our platform gotcha gosh that's amazing so you've been doing some great stuff man plus i see that you have an audi r8 which is just [ __ ] amazing i love it i recently bought myself a tesla model y that to me has probably been one of the funnest things i've got to drive so far it's just like like the speed on that thing in acceleration is just insane yeah yeah well i saw i think you i think in the story you posted today you may have been in that because i saw the glass roof and then the white seats yeah yeah yeah i love it it was so funny i had this one uh this one guy and we'll get into a story really quickly here but i had there was like i was um i was driving the car and it was like 11 p.m or something and there was like a every time somebody wants to race me like they see a test they want to race me for some reason you know and it was like 11 p.m on this guy and he's got his his girl on the righthand side you know he's like he's revving the engine you know something like that and he's running the engine and then i'm like all right sure let go i pulled i'll pull down my window and he's like three two one i go man i'll leave this guy in the dust i figured you would that's awesome it's so crazy we tried it three times every single time he just did not succeed and then he just kind of went his own way after that he gave up he was embarrassed enough in front of his girl oh my god it's so funny it's so funny but anyways yeah so so that's amazing that's amazing man and how like what how is your company so far like monster i know you've transitioned fully do you guys still do like you guys still do with you still deal with big companies as well like enterprise companies you have completely shifted into this or and you guys don't have those conscious contracts anymore yeah so we still do have the uh some of the existing contracts that we've had previously that have been going with us for several years the interesting thing is that the demographic of our client base has shifted a lot so previously it was more small to mediumsized companies now that we've started focusing more on the telehealth and telerelated communications over over the internet we've built another partnership with a fairly large company that services that provides apis and services for those that kind of technology and so they've been uh processing a lot of referrals to us and a lot of their referrals are a lot larger companies so more enterprise grade customers it's just the technology we're building has changed a lot from that more automated automation related work to more telecommunication work gotcha gotcha gotcha awesome so guys by the way guys before we fully get into it i just want to let you know guys if you have any questions for blake here right he is he's done over his years right you're 22 years old it's crazy he's built a this month's agency right a very successful company i don't know if you can share and if it's like a million dollar company or not i'm guessing it's a million dollar company at this point right but yeah so right if you have any questions for him please put it in the chat i will i will ask him but before that we'll just get into it right now so so blake let's go from the beginning kind of tell me kind of you know what like how you got started like i know in high school you start up let's go from the beginning in terms of in in high school what were you doing back then and what got you into coding yeah yeah so it's a fairly long story so feel free to cut me off at any time and tell me after but so when i was in um i think it was either my sophomore junior year in high school i you know i'd always been involved in computers i played video games growing up always computer games when i was probably 10 or 11 i figured out how to do port forwarding so that i could host my own game server and that taught me a little bit of java but i had no clue what i was doing but it kind of set the because years and so um junior sophomore year of high school uh i found something on a forum about bitcoin and this is when i first got into crypto and i found that um there was a potential business to be to be made there where people were wanting to transact bitcoin through um individuals and not go to an exchange and purchase it so i came up with an idea that was a website that i i just found a theme for and put some random like html code in for just change the text um and it allowed people to transact bitcoin with between peers so you and i could come up to each other and say hey i want to buy 50 worth of bitcoin from you i provide you 50 us dollars you provide me 50 bucks worth of bitcoin and exchange it back so now how do you how now that's awesome but how did you for example i'm microass is like how did you get it well known it's like did you put it like in the forums that hey i'm doing this like how did you get known for that so the first piece was a form that um that's where i got the idea because because i saw all these people that they were just writing form posts basically doing the same thing but inside of a tech form so like okay let's build it let's build a site for this the second piece was there was already other peertopeer exchanges like paxful and local bitcoins where you could go on there and do the same thing already we just wanted to make it faster so that you can go on there and instantly start working with somebody right away um so that's how we were able to advertise is by using the forum and those places to bring in customers um into our platform gotcha and was this only by yourself was it only by you like you did this noah and you use your port forwarding knowledge from the from your previous so the technical side of it was extremely simple it was it was literally like an html website with some php and the thing was this this is where the light bulb switched on after all of this you know kind of after i stopped the bitcoin stuff so we had to uh initially we were allowing people to transact with paypal and i was like okay how do i add paypal to a website so funny thing is i went on upwork and i found somebody who could integrate a paypal checkout piece to my website because i could do the html that made sense yeah it was too hard yeah um and so we hired this person i paid him 180 bucks and they threw the paypal thing in there and got it to work nice and so we were able to start transacting and making money so we run this thing and i say we because this is the this is the funny piece here so i was not 18 so i couldn't hold uh i couldn't hold any merchant accounts or like paypal accounts or anything or even like a legit bank account that i could send money through because i wasn't 18. because you were 16 17 years old probably or what yeah i was i was 16. i was i think when i started this i had just turned 17. um so i couldn't hold any of these accounts right and so i'm thinking i know i can make money off this how do i do it so i go to my mom and i say hey mom you know i have this idea i'm like 100 sure it's going to make money and this is a business lesson for everybody today this is my this is my mom so i i couldn't care less but if you're ever working with somebody else in business it's not like your mom always remember this so when i went to where i said i got this idea i just need you to hold an account for me like literally open up a bank account for me and i could run with it right and i'll make the money i told her i'll give you 50 of everything i make oh wow if you just hold the account okay right that's a pretty good deal a pretty good deal right so we started running through it we run for about probably eight to ten months um this is when bitcoin was fairly early on so prices were 200 to 300 each fluctuating around there and we did really well the thing was the regulations as it started to pick up it got got really harsh yeah and even now you can go to the same sites and that is 10 times harder so we stopped doing it and i went from making pretty good money you know anywhere from 1000 to 2000 a week while i was 16 17 years old holy [ __ ] yeah to making zero um because the regulations i mean i'm thinking no did you at least get to save some money like while you know while you're making 2 1 000 2 000 a week well being a 16 year old kid that has a passion in cars um i actually spent pretty much every dime of it that's the that's the bad thing was i was like okay this is funding all of my car projects and all of those were pieces of crap cars so um it all went to waste but so i definitely learned from it but this is the most valuable piece i went from that to zero within about a week i even remember when it all happened it was on my birthday and i was on a trip with my mom in florida when it all just kind of we realized hey we can't do this anymore because the regulations are too hard right so i go to making zero dollars and i'm you know 17 years old and i'm like holy crap i was able to spend spend spend and i had something really working for me what do i do why can't i just do exactly what that guy i hired on upwork does and so that's when i got into programming and at first i didn't think pro for some reason it didn't click with me that programming was an actual career that people got paid really money yeah i just thought this was something that like you know kids do that play video games they just hack stuff together and like build it randomly i can't actually understand that you could go out and get paid you know 100k or whatever the amount is for it so like like this this stuff just comes up magically right like using a computer that's like magically made right by something like that or something you don't connect the dots like the whole time i was never connecting the dots like hey all this stuff i'm using somebody's building yeah and so that's when i that's when it clicked with me and i actually signed up for a freelancer.com account and started doing some jobs and i i remember literally every single first job because it was like a hundred dollar job for a full ecommerce php website holy [ __ ] like no wordpress or anything custom coded 100 wow how long did it take you to build that site like two months and the guy was pissed off because it took so long right i'm like you paid 100 but at the end of it i was like holy crap i made 100 bucks like i may if you equate it out it's probably like five cents an hour for all the time i put into it but i was like hey i made it i made 100 bucks yeah and it just slowly started growing and i saw that by december of my senior year i had a job for 800 bucks and i remember coming downstairs my mom was sitting on the couch and i was telling her like hey i got this job for eight hundred dollars for programming i just made eight hundred dollars for program for something i thought just magically appears you know yeah like somebody literally paid me 800 bucks to do this yeah so that's when when it started i started realizing because that was i i always knew i didn't want to go to college but i had to uh why tell me why tell me why you wasn't doing the clutch i'm curious um so i've never really been somebody to um like socialize a whole lot outside of like my business and close friends group and this is this also ties in a little bit um to why like how i found one of my new passions which is helping people with addiction um so i you know family line has addiction related problems on on my dad's side i know a lot of people who've gone through alcohol drugs substance abuse problems and so college the life is is very focused on alcohol substances are used quite often there and it just didn't seem like something that i was really comfortable with and that that was the personal thing that really kind of dug at me was was i knew the partying side of it i know there's a large majority of people who don't do that and are very focused but for some reason that just um that's kind of me a little bit too much and so in my head that's when i started thinking okay i have to figure something out here because in my head college just wasn't an option um even though it was like financial and everything it was so like financially you can afford it but like because of the partying because the alcohol it just did not work out like it's just like it's like your mind was just blocking you like you know what because was it because like you were scared but if you got into it then you will go back like an addiction potential or something like that is that why yeah yeah i think i think that's a big part of it um is when i see like i know if i surround myself around something long enough most likely i will become a part of that and from all my previous experiences i've i've talked i i've felt enough to know i don't want to be a part of that and i've especially now like working with 160 000 people on a platform and having like a complete power bi reporting system on it yeah you see you see how big of an issue this is and so and and some people i know plenty people think i'm an extremist on on the whole alcohol and drug thing but yeah it's just because i've had to deal with it and felt it so much that it's it's such a um kind of soft spot that i've got so honestly i still understand it because it partially i'm like that too actually um partially like i'm very much scared of that of that portion as well and i know this deviates a little bit from what we're talking but we'll get to this in a little bit back back to our story but right i'm like that too like i've had some family past family as well who've always struggled with addiction you know in ukraine right may that be with alcohol or anything else and to me that's always been scary it's always been scary to try for me for example alcohol that's why even when i went to college like i was very i was like i couldn't go to parties like i was not much of a party guy right to just i want i drove to the class i learned how to draw back to home you know it's like class home class hope you know what i mean so it's kind of like i i totally get it like it's it's it's definitely it is a worry to think about because that can lead to not such a good path you see what i mean but but you realize that and you figured it out right you're like you know what i realized that that's not main option i want to go to you're like i want to try something else but my question to you now is before we go forward is like right you said that hey you know what you started getting jobs you started doing jobs in freelance you signed up for freelancer here's the thing blake most people are afraid to even sign up for a job or sign up for a freelancer to come on up pri up work you know when they don't have that experience or don't have the knowledge just yet yeah what was different in your mind that was like you know what doesn't matter if i don't have the experience doesn't matter if i you know don't know it what what different your mind said that you still went for it it it so in my head i never looked at it as like oh i need to have all this knowledge first like the first 30 days i started programming i was like okay i have a lot to pick up on here but and i have kept this whole mindset even up until today you see some of the deals we close and i do it the same way i did it even when i when i first started in terms of the mindset i have because it's always worked and it's every when i started i would look at a deal and be like okay i have no clue how to do this but i know for a fact if i give it a week or two i can get it done and so i'd figure out how to close the deal put that into the timeline so if i knew i needed two weeks to learn in two weeks to implement it or i guess that's what it was i'd throw that in part of the timeline i'd keep the cost the same as just two weeks but i'd factor in the learning time and so even today we get deals that you know we'll straight up tell a client we have no idea how to do this but we've done similar stuff and we can figure it out wow and they still buy into it because they know they have confident confidence in us that will actually deliver on it so the biggest thing in my opinion is yes actually figuring out the problem and figuring out a solution for it but don't be afraid to jump in because as soon as i saw i can make 80 bucks on a site i knew i could make 160 bucks on something else and then eight hundred and two thousand five thousand ten thousand and on from there and a hundred thousand four getting it yeah yeah exactly that's insane i mean that i think that's a that's a really good mindset that you know not a lot of people unfortunately have it's really hard to get that you know for one right to have that kind of monster like you know what i'll throw myself in and then because the heart is the first thing that's stopping us is what it's us the fear like we're scared and and think about this though this so this is one piece that adds to my my pieces i knew in my head i had no other options right it was literally either succeed or succeed like there's no failure because i'm not going to college right like that's just not something i'm going to do so either i succeed or i succeed like there's no i can't can't fail at this so in my head i'm thinking i'm going to just go all in and get at it right i think that's a big thing for a lot of people that don't that have a hard time getting a hold of that mentality is figure out something find a purpose that makes you forced to succeed right that's the stuff we do with addiction recovery like it's we have such a big problem that we have to succeed with it because we have to provide this service to the people when we do deployments it's not just a oh somebody's not going to make money it's oh we're not going to be able to help potentially thousands of people recover from this so find a purpose with what you're doing and you will always succeed with it that is true it's a it's a that is that is so that is so very much true it's like whenever when i remember like but any start when i with any startup that i started or with anything any project i started there was always a purpose right for example for me personally one of my first products that i was started was like i did this thing called techhelp.org back then it was like it was one of my first websites and i built it using dreamweaver i don't know if you know what it was oh my god man i was copying the header and every single page i didn't know what database was back then so i was just like building something more stuff yeah it was pretty bad it was pretty bad but but like my purpose for that was like for example you know what i wanted to like teach technology to people right i want to teach i want to inspire and so forth then then for me for example when i started doing another star that was like my first okay well i want to you know one of the things that we did was like a trend application which is like an app for clothing like well i'm like i suck at clothing so i'm like i want to build an app that will help people clothe themselves right like style stuff stuff like that so you're right i think when you have a purpose it makes things so much easier versus just like oh you know i'll just i'll just give it a try yeah you know and i think that it's very easy to associate especially in the tech world to um you know associate success with money in the tech world because everybody in tech is for the most part making pretty good money um but at the end of the day if you're you know i caught myself last year thinking i'm building all these tools and they're making people a lot of money and it's making me a lot of money but i have absolutely no purpose other than to generate other people money and so that's as soon as when as soon as the addiction stuff came up that was like here we go this attaches everything that i've been working for to a purpose now really and like that did everything change for you like i said i remember you told me this i remember like you were speaking about this on your instagram where you felt like you had no purpose and stuff like that like did that one project really make such a big difference in your life or like holy [ __ ] it's just a big differentiator and like you feel like you're alive now like you feel like you're just like you know you're working towards something yeah no no 100 literally so october of last year um my recent post kind of described this a little bit about how i was going through like one of the hardest times mentally for myself and that's when i was really struggling to find what that purpose was and so that's when this addiction stuff came up um and in october so i have a business coach that i meet with every two weeks and we talk about um you know what are some of the problems in my business what are some of my goals and so i kept telling him for for months hey i for some reason i have this really weird feeling that my car is holding me back the gtr that i had was holding me back like i just had this weird thing i'd wake up every morning and i'd look at it and be like i love this car but for some reason it's holding me back from something that's much bigger and told like everybody i knew this and i don't think really anybody understood why and so literally i sell it a week later addiction recovery project comes up and it's like focused like fully on focus like the car took so much of my attention away as soon as i let it go and this came up it was perfect timing because it allowed me to completely focus on something that was going to become something much bigger in the next coming months wow talk about talk about timing man yeah that is interesting how sometimes i mean honestly i mean a lot of sometimes that works out in weird ways right life can be like that sometimes like like i mean similar thing for me it was like like i came here the way i started working with clever programmer in kazi was like the weirdest ways you know you know even how i met you was the weirdest way right which like which inspired me to do other things right yeah it's like i don't know sometimes you just like you you get this gut feeling to do something you do it it's just like you know it's like almost like the universe is telling you something yeah you're just gonna have to listen to it and then when you do it just poof yeah like like like what the [ __ ] so yeah guys for those who are listening like it's like guys if you really feel like there's something that is in your gut that you want that you feel like you need to do you know sometimes it's it's okay to take a stab at it it's okay to to you know to listen to yourselves because i think the most important thing that we don't do i mean i sometimes don't do it as well is i'm not selfaware of myself as much as i should be you know and i listen to myself as much as i should be sometimes like holy [ __ ] like gotta tell me don't do this but i'm like i mean i don't know just you know why not you know so but but yeah so man that is amazing i'm so happy that makes me happy to hear the fact that you know someone who felt like there was no drive or you know no purpose to now someone who's actually has a purpose and towards the project and actually your partner on the project i'm guessing is what you're saying correct which is just that's correct which is just [ __ ] amazing man i'm so happy for you congratulations um thank you so so so awesome so you're building these projects you went to freelancer on network.com okay what's next what now leads you to like because at this point you're probably 18 years old now or something yeah so just turned 18 um december got the 800 project figured out i could make you know some and my eyes good money i continued doing it so i had actually graduated high school a semester earlier early so december was my last month of school and um january i was completely free so i was like okay i've got to spend some time and figure out what i'm doing here because i've gotta register for college you know if i'm gonna go um i have to do it by like april or may because that's just a deadline so i was like i gotta figure something out quick and so i start taking on more freelance jobs still pretty small stuff i mean we may have gotten two thousand or two thousand dollar projects um around there and then march comes around and i was like you know what i need to be a little bit more professional let's set up a linkedin profile so set up a linkedin profile i connect with everybody i know like my teachers coaches that i knew like just like principals random stuff like friends just cats dogs and then so everybody knows the linkedin deal um you put software developer in your bio and you get blasted by 10 recruiters within the first week and so that's what happened to me guys here in oklahoma that um said hey we've got some positions we want you to take a look at and they're like can you send your resume thinking i don't have a resume i just started this six months ago like there's nothing to put on there and so i was just like okay i got to figure some out so i put a resume together i just throw in my freelance projects in there i threw them some some skill that i definitely didn't have like node.js and csharp i think i put on there i fill this in a little bit more right because it's gonna look super blank and so i sent it out to him and surprisingly they were both like okay we want to schedule an interview and one is in okc which is like an hour and a half from me and then one is five minutes from me mmhmm um this and so you know i tell my mom hey i've got i've got interviews she's like what i was like well these recruiting companies and i remember she was like oh those are recruiters like it's a very normal thing they just they're they're headhunters they're going out trying to find people because they make money off of you and so she's like well it could be it'll still be a good experience to interview and so we had very low expectations so i go in there um interview at each of them the one in okc was a php job left went home a week later they asked me if they could talk to me again wow i wasn't really interested in the technology they were building it was like a cms system very boring and then the one in tulsa they're like okay we want you to talk to the owner of the company now so i went and had an interview with the owner of uh of the company that they were recruiting for [ __ ] and this was like i definitely think that there is some like perfect timing involved with all of this stuff right because the owner of this company it was funny how well we connected because he basically did the same thing when he was at 18 he was like not really interested in college so he started learning to code he did end up finishing college later on but he learned to code and then started his own agency um very similar to how i how i have done it now wow he's been somebody that i've uh pulled a lot of plays from and so we connected very well at the start and ended up uh getting a contract to hire position for um sixmonth contract fifty thousand dollar salary um 18 year old 18 years old 18 years old yeah with a really bad resume and i had the guts they offered me 40 000 i told them i wouldn't do it unless they paid me 50. holy really damn you got guts man and because this is a good thing and a bad thing that i have is the confidence um sometimes when it comes to business stuff is like you know i was thinking i was like in my head this was so not true and in my head i was thinking i could make 50 000 a year doing freelance this year so i'm not going to like i'm not going to take 40. and i probably i probably could have made 50 000 but i definitely didn't have the work ethic back then to do that so i was like yeah i need 50 000. um but you but you had that mindset right you had the it's like uh what's a muhammad ali or what muhammad ali i think he's like he said that he was the best the best you know boxer yeah you know even even before he became one yeah he's the best in the world before he became one yeah it's good that's that's the mentality to have while also keeping yourself humble enough so whenever you're in situations to uh to you know back down from that that you do and so but i think when you're in negotiations and stuff like that uh i mean think of it you have a 50 50 probably 55 year old ceo has been in the industry for 30 years 30 40 years or so and you have some 18 year old kid come into your office with a shitty resume and say no i'm not taking 40 i want 50. and you know it i i really think it does it did something where it was like okay this kid has this this kid has guts if you want to do that yeah you know and so he um he agreed to it i started work a month later wow and just kind of took off from there i mean i had a sixmonth contract a month in um he said he wanted to this was the second negotiation piece he said he wanted to cut the con cut the contract and just go straight to employees yeah a month in and i said no i'd really like to continue the full sixmonth contract to see if this is something that i'm really interested in wow and so yeah because this was this was and in my head i'm thinking if i say yes to this right now i'm at 50 000. i don't want to be at 50 000. i want to be at 75 000. and so in my head i'm thinking okay if i say yes to this now this removes my ability to negotiate for at least the next year right because he's given me something yeah so i waited till the six months and then negotiated that higher and exactly so because in my head it didn't matter i was still getting paid either way it was just what i was classified as yeah and so go ahead no that's all i've got on that no it's i think it's just very interesting like how do you set up that mindset right of like of like okay because the hardest thing is like when you go into negotiations a lot of students that i see because we teach a lot of students of course right and those who's here are now watching you you guys are watching you know they might be lacking confidence like they've done projects they've done crazy stuff right but they're lacking confidence like even to be able to say like hey you know what i don't want to offer 40k i'm a monty 50k you don't like it go byebye you know it's like holy [ __ ] you know it's like um no that also that shows guts but to the other person what i've realized and that you know that text takes a very hard um strongminded person to do this but when you do that you yourself not only get this power yourself belief in yourself you get that confidence yourself because when you go through those negotiations as you the more you the more you go through life where you don't back down no you set yourself up you set your standards up right yeah yeah has happened to me too right in negotiations as well and i was like no i don't want to do this i don't want to i feel like this is my value and so forth i want to keep this value right and now the question is how like what does it take to get is it just a matter of just like you know what just saying it and being afraid to not let go like what does it take to actually have the mentality so i i think there's a couple pieces to it right so i it's it's not that um i do think it is like you said a little bit of guts and definitely confidence but it's it's the core of it is understanding your value right so i would i would not have had that conversation and said i want 75k right away because i knew i was not worth that in my head i wasn't worth that yet and so i knew i was worth 50k because i looked at the average salary for developer and it was 75 85k in my area and i was like well i'm probably at least half of what they have in skills so i'm probably you know 45 50 000 a year um and so that gave me some confidence there just kind of looking at the numbers and doing my research um but another part of it was just applying what i had already taught myself in other areas and i do this today still so um you know for example i i feel like i can go into a business room and full of business people and talk very confidently and have a really good meeting and be 100 confident however four months ago uh you know when i when i just started going to the gym i felt like i have no clue what i'm doing everybody's looking at me they all know i'm dumb and have no clue what i'm even doing i'm probably doing it wrong but i started thinking okay what was my mindset what is my mindset in work right my mindset and work is i don't care if i don't know what i what i'm doing i'm gonna learn it i'm gonna do the best i can and if i have to i'll ask other people for help and so as i started going to gym and keeping that same mindset i started working with trainers to get the knowledge started talking to friends to ask how they were doing things and watching them and really focusing on how can i become better and more confident here but that initial confidence from my business side i was able to easily translate it over so my tip for other people would be find what you are confident in it doesn't even have to be a career you know it could be whenever you read you feel really confident you feel really well about yourself and you feel like you can really understand what a book is about yeah translate that same thing over software development or your business so that you have that same mentality to say okay i got this i can figure this out yeah and it's actually very interesting because i see similar things when it comes to like being become a developer right and overcoming the impartial syndrome yeah because for example yeah to overcome the partial symptoms the way i like to think about it is like every single big every single beginner is going to have that right absolutely beginner's gonna feel like hey you know what i'm not worthy of this or because they just haven't had the experience yet it's no matter what you do yeah you know but what i say is like [ __ ] use that like yeah use that scarcity use that scare or do a fear right to push you forward but most importantly use what you've done previously because if you know for example you know that hey you know what blake here right you went ahead and you probably like you know you did you start you start freelance you did bitcoin stuff like that right you took that on yourself and no matter how hard it was you were able to get it yeah if you keep that mindset you know what i did this other stuff previously why can't i not do this why can't i do this yeah and think of the risk though because like you look at and you're like okay think of what you're think of the problem you're looking at whenever you say i don't i don't think i'm ready to start freelancing or start doing contracts or start developing think of what the what the failure could be so what you lose a hundred dollar client who cares like there's gonna be a thousand more and i have always tried to keep this mindset as like if something doesn't work out in the first initial stages and and it's you know maybe because you don't you don't know something there's always going to be one more thing like failure is not indefinite you're not going to um not do very good on a job and then just everything else is out the door there's always going to be more yeah it's just it's getting rid of that narrow mindset that's true that's true and so when do we when like when would you recommend for somebody for example you know a beginner developer like when should they get started into like freelancing let's say or even applying for jobs let's just start with freelancing at which point do you feel like you should be someone like you know what let's try it out 45 days i think 45 days into your to your learning period wow just because that's exactly what i did so i started on code academy around 30 days of that just very basic html css but that didn't teach me anything compared to what i learned while i was doing freelancing right and it was just making sure this is a key point here make sure that when you do start freelancing you're taking on very small pieces of work like not full websites like i did like very small things like maybe a plugin upgrade on wordpress or static html site like simple things uh like css fix i remember i remember i did this once you says it was like three dollars i got i got paid three dollars for this like a small small css fix that took me like probably a day honestly to do but like holy [ __ ] you know i did it yeah i gotcha yeah and that's that's the thing it's like you pick up a job and you realize okay this is what they need and you do it and sooner or later you get six months a year in you've hit just about every technical use case that you could probably have right so you build a website you build a user system um check out process integrate an api like you hit enough of the core fundamentals that after that it's just changing up little pieces of it you're not really like even today end of the day yeah we know what we're doing but it's just a lot of core concepts and tweaking how we actually use them that is true that is true so that that is amazing that's amazing with you know what kind of got you started especially with with that guy and so now let's continue on right what happened with him after right you said that you know what i don't want to take that contract and so forth kind of what moves on next yeah so we get six months in we do another negotiation i become an employee with that company and we just you know we were able to form this kind of bond or relationship where he knew i had the ambition to do something much bigger like my he knew my end goal was not to be an employee the rest of my life right nothing wrong with that just it wasn't my interest and so um you know everything he would do i i just this is just part of what i do you know if i saw him doing something then i was like man how does he figure that out i would ask him how do you do this or like how do you how do you handle this stuff because one thing you'll realize is people who are uh where you want to be they want you to ask questions they like when people ask me questions about how do i get like this kind of stuff i love this i feed off of this kind of stuff because it's like if only i could tell myself this stuff four years ago think of where i could be right right and so you realize that like ceos owners of companies they want you to ask questions because it shows you're trying to be much more than just a resource yeah that's on the time sheet or whatever so you're trying to learn you're trying you're trying to it just you know it's it's a it's amazing to see somebody who is inspiring for someone is aspiring because like it makes them relate with them like right for example with that person right if i see someone who's like you know what either asking me questions or someone who's asking you questions right and they're like they're intrigued and they're trying their best like holy [ __ ] i want to help you out too you know it's like you give me 100 i'm going to give you 100 back exactly yeah and that's that's the whole deal and so that's that's what i kept doing was just i wanted to learn like it was something in me that actually wanted this information so i feel like it was really genuine when it came out and that's why what do you think what was it in you like what do you think was in you that like wanted to learn like what do you think was that like genetically or was it just a push what was it i think i just i think i knew i had more potential than what i was being used for and uh you know at the end of the day i would write i would write code and build applications or whatever and it was real it was cool but i just i felt like i had a bigger purpose than that so some people they have their purpose is to do those things and that's 100 okay and everybody we all need those people but for me it was always like think of the bitcoin stuff did i really care about bitcoin no um even now it's like do i necessarily do do i sit at home on the weekends and code all weekend absolutely not like def you will not see me you know custom code project anymore i haven't done that in years and i have no interest in doing it right and this so this is when i started figuring out a little bit more of um what i'm meant for and and where i want to be and so i started picking up that i really like business i like managing money like i like figuring out the nuances of how to get people to be confident in you and close a deal with somebody and set up all the resources for it like more of the architecture and management of a business than actually sitting there and writing code you're basically like the the steve jobs yeah so they put all the pieces together yeah he takes pieces from everybody else and puts it together in one thing you like that you like the comparison i think yeah i think yeah even though steve jobs was a dick i know but you won't really we won't relate that portion to you yeah fair enough fair enough but yeah and then i think that's um you know where where uh the owner of that company i really related we were able to i was able to ask a lot of questions that was like a gold mine for me i i saw somebody that had everything i had wanted and uh not not uh not like uh materialistically or anything it was everything that i wanted mentally like work and careerwise basically yeah like all the problems i had in my head that i couldn't solve he had the answers to all of them and so that's why i would always ask those questions it built a really good relationship even up until today right uh so that was a huge part of it you know one thing i see with you like one thing as as i pay attention in terms of like like one thing i see with you is that you you very much um gravity towards towards people you want to learn from of course and that makes sense but you like to learn from others yeah you're not that type of person from what i'm saying correct me if i'm wrong you know that person who's like you know what i'm just doing all by myself this is me i'm going to figure this out all but full of my full by myself and that's pretty much it i feel like from what i'm hearing is like you're like hey you know i had this other person to learn from him i had this i'm going to learn from this person right nonstop and that just upgrades you like a like like nothing else yeah yeah and i think that's i actually had a i feel like i had a big problem with that starting off was i felt like i could do everything myself because these things started happening and i started getting super cocky because i was 18 and i was like oh i'm this is all working like i can do all this myself i start working for the company and it was more on a technical level i remember always going in and instantly being pissed off when somebody would say my stuff is wrong because i know it's not my stuff's always right like there's no way and then they'd prove me wrong every single time and that humbled me a lot and told me yeah be confident in what you've got at the end of the day listen to other people if they know more than you realize that and listen to them true so that's big part of what what i had to learn even if they don't know more than you even that because here's what i mean by that i'm a teacher and i still learn a lot from my students yeah right like even in some cases like you don't know everything sometimes the student can't become the teacher in some cases right but there's some things that you just don't know because that person might know something else right you think even in those cases i think that's applicable too and i myself i work with i'll be honestly i've worked with some [ __ ] developers i'll be fully honest with you right developers who like you know what it who are like this is all perfect i got this done i had this i was working with this one developer who uh i'm not gonna name the names of course but um literally change the whole back end within two weeks didn't say anything to any of the front end people nor anybody in the business change the whole back and push that live broke everything that's alive and said that it was our front frontend's fault and when we asked hey can we fix it together that person was like no it's a documentation you guys should be able to figure it out yeah yeah i see those people all the time still yeah like what the [ __ ] yeah you just messed up it's messed people who don't care yeah nobody wants to work with those people so that's the one thing i think you could take from this is being humble and i see you being very humble like you're very confident but also very humble right you know kind and humble at the same time if you can put those two together you know that's a perfect combination now i'm very curious like at which point did you realize did you make that change or like no my stuff is always right to you know what i'm actually i i can be wrong sometimes at which point did you realize that it was just over time that that happened i think over time it gradually changed in what aspects i started to realize it more um you know it started off with code and realizing hey i can definitely be wrong when it comes to code as time went on it evolved into you know with some of the freelancing work maybe i'm not managing this relationship correctly as soon as i got developers on my team and you know it's very easy to say to point at the developer because they're doing it and and you're just managing the job to say oh you did that or to you know point fingers it's much easier to do that so that's when i realized like hey i've got a i've got to be a leader here you know i have to realize that some of these things are my fault like part of being a leader is when something fails inside of your team it's your fault at the end of the day because you failed to do something that could have prevented it in the past and that's a big thing that helped me with my team is when we missed the deadline i could have prevented that somehow right because i'm the first one to get to it i could have set the expectations different with the client i could have hired more people to help with the job so i think really once i got into my agency that's when my uh my shift and and how i how i thought about these things happened um as it grew that's amazing and how did you like learn from on this type of stuff right because at the end of the day you know these soft skills the leadership skills right it doesn't just happen out of nowhere sometimes it does but like a lot of the times it's like maybe you might find culture like where did you learn that specifically i think the soft skills have been i mean when i was 14 i had a photography business i had tshirts i was doing all the school photography really you did photography too yeah holy [ __ ] freshman i shot all the sports events football basketball baseball i did prom homecoming all that shot photos for it and then sold them on my website um i had like a squarespace or something whatever it was back then um and doing that that that taught me how to start communicating with people um i did yearbook all throughout high school so i was writing editorial pieces um for four years and interviewing people that way and then um you know afterwards you and and let's say you don't have some of that experience it's not impossible to get it still i mean it's it's super easy to correlate when you're doing something right when you're doing something wrong closed deal means you're doing something right lose a deal lost deal means okay either it wasn't meant to be or potentially you did something wrong so make sure you look at potentially what you could have done wrong in this business it's super easy to figure out are you doing good are you doing bad because if you know you're if your majority of your deals that you're working are lost compared to one you're probably doing something wrong results speak for themselves exactly as simple as that but you know what the interesting thing is like you mentioned this whole photograph so your business goes back to not just like coding it goes back to photography so you were like i was thinking that brought me to the idea of like gary vaynerchuk garyvee you know he was like selling them and they stand and stuff like that you know so like your business kind of knowledge was was brought up very early on yeah i mean like seventh grade i had this thing where i found out you could buy uh replica beats headphones on dhgate and dude i'd show up to school i'd have like six of them around my neck and i'd be delivering them out i still have facebook messages from people hitting me up like hey i'll give you 110 bucks for this pair of studios i was like all right what color you want ordered them through my mom's account come from china deliver them and i'd bring them to school so you sold fake beat studios huh yeah yeah when i was i had it in like 12 or 13 back then i think that was like the first thing i ever really did wow so that's where your guts came from yeah i guess for me i was just like shoot everybody wants beats because they're cool so you know let's give them to them for a third of the price and my whole thing was they're not fake they're replicas nobody knows better they're like oh replicas are the same thing so i gotcha i gotcha and they're like everybody's like my mom i got i got these new beats for only ten dollars you know yeah yeah exactly that's awesome that's amazing wow so that that's it i did not know that about you that's really interesting so so okay so you went ahead and of course you were working with with him and then of course you saw potential in you and so forth and then at which point now did you realize that you know what i want to do something different i want to start my own freelance agency or you know or my own business i just got fed up honestly i was i was extremely frustrated so i made it two years into that company before i started switching things over switching you know kind of my mindset with things but i remember what happened was um it's funny because his son actually was like hey we were talking in the office one day and he was like have you ever been to miami i was like no and he's like you should go like okay so i schedule i schedule a trip literally like the next week for a couple days next weekend to go to miami for a couple days and i go and it just instantly opened up my eyes because it was like i stayed at a really nice hotel everybody i saw there you know you walk out of the hotel you see three lambos everybody's flashy you know it's like material heaven there if you like material stuff you go there and it's just like yep like heaven right and so i show up there and i see everybody they're working hard they look really good everybody's fit they look happy the weather is perfect and i was like this is where i've got to be like this is it and so why why is is it because like you felt like that's what you you want to be near the materialistic portion what was that drive or you just you just felt rich at first that's what i thought success was right it was that kind of stuff so i went there and i was like everybody is successful i want to be successful so therefore this this is like this what they have the lambos the way they look this is the clothes they're wearing this is success in my eyes back then and so that's why i was like all right i've got to move there because oklahoma doesn't have this i mean literally you look outside my window and it's a field of grass i mean for some people that's heaven for some people they're like it's a place to grow stuff you know who knows yeah sure it wasn't for me back then but so i would you know i saw that i was like wow i got to do this and so i come back and i remember having a discussion with my boss and saying hey you know i i'd really like to work remote because um you know i want to move to miami and he he kind of understood the tone he was like you're gonna do it whether i let you or promote or not aren't you right i was like yeah either way i'm doing it wow and it was just like i knew i had to do it because that's where that's what was gonna take me to my next stage feb so november was my first trip there um went back three more times february i was moved there moved all my stuff from tulsa to there even still had an apartment in tulsa that i had a lease on um that i was like i'm not finishing this like i'm dipping out i'll pay for both at the same time if i have to that's sick and that's when i went to miami and it miami in itself is like a whole hour conversation but you know the thing with it is like it was two years i had very little social interaction it was probably the hardest time mentally for me that i've ever experienced because uh you know think of think of somebody in miami that doesn't never drink alcohol i don't party um i was really focused on my career everybody where i lived was partying every night extremely social people for an introvert it's probably one of the worst places you can be really and so it was extremely tough because i'm working from home working in my apartment until i got an office later on um but it it was it was like i had no no friends like nobody like i'd call my friends back home or whatever and i remember i'd i'd literally fly back to oklahoma usually once or tw once a month or once every other month because i would get so tapped out i would be there alone for a month just working 12 hours a day on my computer and go to sleep and i just forgot you know what day it was every day because there's just this loop but that built some insane work ethic so when i came back here and was able to you know rejoin with all my friends and you know family and stuff it was like it built something in me that no matter where i go or what environment i'm in i will always be focused like with my work um so long i was like oh i can't be focused in oklahoma i need to be in miami and now it's like i'm more focused than i was in miami here because of what that built me into so so why why do you think that in miami you couldn't find potential people like yourself like like why did you feel so so alone right so because i'm sure there's different things you probably could have done right there are that's that's a really good point actually and that's what i was actually thinking about this couple days ago i was like man if i was in miami now i probably could have met a lot more people that that were similar to me um but i think it was just something that i had to go through mentally to understand like the first phase was i thought i couldn't be in oklahoma to be successful or to work to work hard and grow my business so i moved to miami i went to miami and realized i can't really meet people here came back to oklahoma and was still kind of like eh i haven't really met anybody new here like everybody's kind of doing things so what's the problem here and i realized that you know maybe i need to start doing different things like i went to the gym and now i show up to the gym and every single day i go there i know at least three or four people i could have done the same thing in miami and met very likeminded people but i just think it was the phase of where my mind was that didn't allow me to go out and meet those people because i didn't think that i could really do it um i think the odds were against me too partially in miami i think a majority of people were um not likeminded and that i got kind of tired of when i did meet somebody it was just you know it was the epitome of what not to be around so i just kind of got tired and was like you know what no none of this is good for me so i think one don't put yourself into an environment where the odds are very much against you yeah that's the easiest way to avoid it but you're always going to have abilities to true people but the same thing you don't know you never know yeah like you never know like you know what move might be the right move yeah and and so on the miami piece like i say i never really met anybody there were like three or four people that are very close people to me now that i may have hung out with 10 times but i still talk to him this day one of them was a work client that i met in miami because he found me on instagram and we met up and we ended up doing a deployment where uh he flew me out to new york and we deployed it in the world trade center wow like no way you're talking about like i may not have had like a lot of buddies people to go out with and stuff but some of the some of the stuff i i did do with the close people there was were things i'll remember for the rest of my life i think that's what's super important too i think it's important to consider honestly right and it's it's not to downplay miami right i know that miami you felt probably like very lonely but it's a lot of times it's not the amount of friends that you have it's the quality of people that you have around you yeah right so like even for me here in l.a i'll be honest with you i don't know too many people yeah yeah but the people that i know are [ __ ] epic you know like i am the happiest i've ever been yep good right and it's like as long as you surround yourself around those people and like as long as you push yourself to even those even those those few that that come around i feel like that's that is what makes up forever for everything else honestly right now now so now time with this right so you're in miami correct and you have at this point are you still working for that tulsa company or are you yeah okay now from what i remember you started your mods agency at that point is that correct that's right so literally as soon as i moved to miami uh we started it up it was like january i had the business license wow and where was that where was that from like where is it like did you so you told me you were fed up with the other company right and what what else pushed you was like you wanted to build something bigger what was it and to be clear i wasn't fed up with the other company i was just i was so the main reasons that i had left was like i saw miami was really cool i didn't like working in an office it just felt like i was not using my potential um and there were a couple you know relationships that that were in tulsa that i i viewed as toxic and that i wanted to get away from um and so that helped moving to miami was just super easy to just disconnect from all of it right yeah um so but yeah still worked remotely for them what was the last part of your question the last part the last part was like you know then then what else was it that pushed you to create your own your own company besides you just want to move to miami i think i mean think of the numbers that's that's the easiest way is like i thought in my head because i had done freelance i had started um you know basically what i did was i was doing freelance and i kept getting jobs where i couldn't handle enough of it so i'd hire another freelancer to do part of it and pay them a portion of what i got right so i just thought of it and i was like what am i doing sitting here when i don't even really enjoy the like a whole lot of the code aspect it's like why am i sitting here doing this um when i could run an agency and just find the deals close them because that's what i really enjoy and then get other people to actually develop them and that's when it clicked for me because i was thinking in my head okay if i charge um let's say 50 bucks an hour if i charge 50 bucks an hour to the client i find a developer for 25 an hour every single hour that gets worked i'm getting 25 hours for 25 dollars for and i'm not working that hour yeah uh you quickly realize that it's not that simple of a calculation right if there would be no point in being an agency if all you did was middleman the deal that's not what an agency does um i probably work way more than i do did then like when i started my agency so a lot different than you think but that's the numbers were a very clear sign for me to start in ages what were some of the the most toughest projects that you have to do though like you either are lost on or you're like holy [ __ ] what the [ __ ] is this right what was that the toughest part like because i know the beginning is usually the hardest right the hardest was probably first first probably year of it wasn't that bad um the second year we got a project where we like we had two projects actually this was the project that um when you were in miami we were stayed up for four days working on this was the first one that was really bad um we had under quoted it and we did a fixed price um and underestimated the timeline very bad yeah and so you know we're three or four weeks in to the project and we're just super behind and we're working all day every day to get it done and i obviously had to pay developers to develop the product and i wasn't getting paid anymore um and i think we ended up uh underestimating by a hundred percent so we had basically uh used up all the profit and all of the all the money we got paid for so we zeroed out i think we even lost a little bit of money on it wow um and spent all these days uh you know pushing super hard and pushing everybody really really bad and then uh you know that that taught me a lesson there don't do i don't do fixed price anymore um hourly i learned my lesson there too yeah pretty much everybody does um once you get to that point it's just not we're not worth doing fixed price yeah yeah second project was actually about a year and a half ago we had a lady come to us that wanted a applica a reporting application built seemed pretty easy and we she i didn't want to do the job though because i didn't really like her attitude um i didn't i didn't like the way that she she talked to me and and and kind of wanted to manage the upfront of the project so i was just like okay you know i'm not doing this so she just kept following up with me like every day she'd follow up like hey we want to work with you guys like that wow and so i just finally was like okay find a number then i was like oh this is you know random random number that i thought was good for the project i didn't do my due diligence on looking into it um and she took it and we started doing the project and we get to the point where we're like deadline is september 1st it's september 1st and we're not we're not close yet we need like another month so you know she stops paying us and i obviously have the obligation to fill the contract feel the deal because it was a fixed deal and so i lost a ton of money there um there's actually a third one this last one i'll mention this one is really really bad so those were minor those were like maybe maybe 10 15 000 lost lost lost yeah so so not even not even zeroed out lost additional um and so this other one we had got a contract with um with this company that you know had recently gotten a lot of funding young ceo uh racking in like a million bucks a month in funding uh from different vc firms so they were doing really well and so we start on we bring like four developers on our team um we started billing them first week invoice uh payment fails and we're like okay that's weird but we we keep going with it so even though i failed you're still like paying developers you're still putting the project yeah yeah because i was like okay this is you know we're talking at that time we're 90 bucks an hour 40 160 hours of developer you can do the math i mean 16k times 4 64 000 a month you're doing pretty good so in my head i'm like oh it's fine we'll make bank off this right yeah and so you know we're rolling we start getting paid it works you know everything's fine after that you know six months goes by payments start to slow down and they get less and less and less and less and um in terms of in terms of cost in terms of like how much they pay you yeah so we would let's say we billed for 20k we'd get paid 12k and i was like like okay we'll get it next next two weeks because this next round of funding comes in it'd always be the next round of funding and so we built this balance up to where it was like 55k um of what they owed and uh was out to us right so all these lawsuits started coming out against them um for for misusing investor funds so they ended up uh their business wasn't even actually that good it was that they were just pulling all these money from investors and what happens with vc firms a lot of the times is once one vc sees that they've that a company's got an invested investment the other vc doesn't want to lose out on it so they give them an investment as well and so that's the cycle of of these ceos who are investment angels is because they just get the hype from all these vc firms and so this is what this guy was doing and we ended up losing about 55 000 bucks on it it was never unvoiced and [ __ ] yeah october i cleared their invoices off my book i had them on there for a year and just wrote them off so holy [ __ ] yeah that was the worst one that is safe but honestly it doesn't compare to the upside of what i'm guessing you probably made from all the other projects right well yeah yeah definitely so i mean it's it's and even with that project the technique we were owed another 55 000. we didn't get paid but we did get paid 200 000 out of it so we paid 200k we didn't get paid 50k so we still didn't necessarily lose out oh we just kind of get what we were owed gotcha gotcha that's not that's still that bad 200k we pay that's still not bad probably but yes of course you're still paying your developers and stuff like that right so exactly yeah huge expense yeah of course of course of course awesome so we got a lot of people but joining this stream a lot of people are asking a bunch of questions which i'm going to take a look at later on but so so that that is i mean let me ask you this question like like um while you're building this like what were what were some of the toughest things that i want to go through you know the good things the bad things of of being a freelancer right like and just having your agency let's start with what were some of the good things when you when you started this right you went from working for someone to now doing some things on your own what are some of the positives you saw i'm gonna i'm gonna mention one thing because i think this is this is valuable before we get into that so um while i was starting my agency i never quit my fulltime job right and another super interesting piece is i also still haven't quit that same agency job so i'm right now you're still working with them still working with them four years ago wow and i think this is a super important thing for people to realize is a lot of people think oh to run my own business i have to quit everything you don't you really don't i mean i've been doing this for four years and i haven't quit literally i haven't quit that position i haven't i haven't had to stop really anything i've just figured out how to handle how to architect all of it so that people still get what they need and they still feel like everything is fair so to kind of dive into now starting off uh you know what were some of the pros of it i guess you know obviously you get to be your own boss theoretically but at the end of the day your clients become your boss so i'm not really a pro people think it is but it's not um a little bit more flexibility because i did establish that relationship with the company in oklahoma that i was working remote out and did tell them that hey i'm going to start my own agency so they were aware of it definitely got more flexibility out of that a lot more scale like scalability and opportunity because i knew i could you know get two more deals and double my income for the year right so i knew i could make a lot more with with hopefully a lot less effort the con was really figuring out what an agency meant um at first i thought an agency was just this kind of holding company type deal where uh you just hired developers and they magically did the work perfectly and what you realize is developers take a lot of management um yeah to to get something done successfully because developer developers are very um logical people so you you give them a set of instructions and they follow the instructions to the t if you give them the wrong set of instructions they will follow those wrong instructions to the t and you'll end up with something that's not right and so figuring out how to manage those people and figuring out how to how to work with different attitudes and work styles and time time zone differences um that was definitely a challenge and the the first major challenge that happened was when i assigned a developer to a project and then they just disappeared like they literally just dip i had that happen probably 10 times where um hired somebody we had it happen in november we hired somebody and we got to the day before deployment and they disappeared they were gone um could you deploy it could you deploy that point or no well what happened was i had to build it that night i had to build a whole mvp for um the deployment the next day so yeah and it happens it happens all the time it doesn't matter what part of the business you're in you're going to have people that just you know they it's like what we talked about before those are the kind of people that are really confident but they don't deliver i always try to be confident and always deliver yeah that's what happens in the end that's honestly that's what matters in the end if you don't deliver then what's the point of everything else you just did right obviously it's like if you were learning you learning coding and then you didn't get a coding job yeah or did you do anything with it right you know there's no point to it no yeah of course not so so that that that to me is of course is is really interesting now my thing is now solo for example okay so so that's the con a lot of people think that for example it's very glamorous right to to become like this freelancer yeah right you guys you know you get to uh you know you get to travel around the world you know you get to make millions of dollars you know you get to meet all these people you have a lot of time on your hands and so forth it's a lot of people i hear is they go into this kind of like thinking about that is it like that no it's definitely not i think that's the that's the thing that sucks about social media too is because it's and i have a hard time with this because i know i can sometimes give off the give off the vibe that it's easy you know instagram name is easy so and the cars whatever else it's like people don't see uh you know stuff behind that they don't they don't realize that uh you know how much how many times about banging my head against the wall because i was pissed off or something wasn't working right or a client dropped me or i had to worry about i mean dude when i first started i remember literally there was no room for error i would get paid by a client pay the developer and back down to zero in my account wow pay by the client pay the developer like there there was so many of those times where now it's like yeah we can you know rack in 30 40k in a week and it's great and and people see they're like wow that's sick but they don't see when four years ago when i was at zero going up to 2k sending it to developer 0 2k up and down it's it's really not glamorous at all if anything you're going to going to be a lot more stressful going the freelancer route than it will be just working for a company that's why you see majority people working for companies is because it's a lot more comfortable but the reverse of that is if you do freelance uh and let's say you run an agency the scale is so much higher and that's what that's what for me i was like okay it's worth it i'm okay to go like i can go through the pain and struggles of doing this because it's worth it for me in the end some people it's not some people they'd rather work for a company and that's all through life with what they got and that's great that's so completely okay now yeah did it make you happy like did it were you like content with like with like the opportunity and what would you what were we doing at at the point in miami um i mean i think that there was a major piece missing and that was like the uh relationships and friendships i got to a point where you know i was just like man i'd rather say screw all this i would rather have the relationships and friendships um that are possible you know as i'll say in oklahoma um and the money and stuff wasn't really worth it and because you realize it doesn't really do anything for you right like you you get a nice car um or you get a nice house boat or whatever you want a nice clothes and you may get some compliments but what is that doing for you right it's not really doesn't make you a better person doesn't make you feel any better um it's just very short shortlived gratification so i just really realized that um my focus was too much on money because if i know you followed me for a very long time and uh you may have seen a shift in some of my content because very early on it was every post was money related like yeah how to make more money how to grow agency how to up your hourly rates like it all it was all money related and now i don't really even think about about the money aspect like i don't before i would set i want to hit this amount of revenue every month or hit this amount every year i don't really think about that anymore i just think you know do i actually enjoy what i'm doing um is it fulfilling me is it something that i enjoy am i stressed out all the time is the stress worth you know my purpose is my purpose actually being served here um i think those are the important questions to ask i think everybody has to figure out for themselves whether freelancing and the added baggage that comes with it is really worth it for them so then so then do you think that selling money is the goal do you think it's bad do you think it's bad to have you know a revenue goal like hey i want to make 100k this year or 150k this year right and whatever it takes i'll just get there do you think that that's that's a bad way of doing it i don't think it's bad um i think everybody should do that at first like that was when i had my course that was one of the first things i asked people is how much money do you want to make because you know when you're starting out you you want to make a change in your life for the most part i mean most people aren't going for making like 500k a year and saying okay i want to switch my career to learn how to code like nobody's doing that usually it's people who are like i want to start and start a career that's going to make me more so i think starting off like go for it monetary monetary goals are going to be important um you know especially i think it's once you get past 75k things don't really change in your life a whole lot the more money you get after 75 000 a year your life doesn't really change a whole lot after that um statistically so i think once you get to a point of saying next year i want to make 600k i i personally don't see the value in that i look at that as like why even why even put that through your brain just like at that point just do it you don't need to wake up and think you know i want to make 600k this year like you should all the all the stuff that you've built up should help you grow long term from there so i think it is unhealthy once you get past a certain point to continue to think about money all the time like that yeah i for example personally for example for me like i don't know why why but for some reason like i never put money on the pedestal yeah i never in my life was like oh [ __ ] this is this holy grail right i knew i could have and i was never afraid to spend it it was never a thing i was like oh [ __ ] i gotta keep this in savings and then i gotta you know i gotta keep it there just to make sure it's all good you know stuff like that i don't know if it's just because of i was very lucky that my parents put that mentality into me right or whatever it might be but for me for example was like you know what i'm going to use this money to maybe you know put it to myself you know one of the coolest things that i had is i mean i got lucky with this yes of course i was given two thousand dollars for example from my parents to uh you know when i was i think it was like 18 years old to put into stock markets they saw that i was doing the stock market i just haven't earned money just yet i was earning some little money of course but nothing crazy and crazy enough like how the kids like i spent like i lost a dog like literally i lost it all with on with it within [ __ ] weeks because i put into a penny stock that [ __ ] went down it went bankrupt [Laughter] but granted i also learned a [ __ ] time from that oh i learned a lot like from there what happened is then i just shifted my strategy to do long term to a point where now in my robinhood account and other accounts you're looking at around 140 150k and so forth yeah yeah well and the important thing as well is like you said not not necessarily putting it on a pedestal unless your goals revolve around like your goals revolve around that partially right so let's say you you um you're trying to buy a new house for your family yeah or you want to retire one of your family members you obviously have to have big financial goals to do that of course yes um and i i i think this is more discussion of what's healthy and what's unhealthy in terms of uh you know financial goals but i think it's extremely healthy if you if you're doing it with a purpose if you're just saying i want to make 600k just have 600k and blow it next year or 100k or 200k then it's like dude what's the point there's no purpose now like if you're living your life every day for that there's absolutely no purpose in your life like you need to figure out what actually matters so yeah that's awesome that's amazing so so so look blake so at this point right you you've got this you've got this company you've got the software agency now right you're you're a mozzie and i'm very curious i want to ask you like what happened where you decided like to go from you know completely switch to go from from miami to now back to tulsa what kind of happened that time frame um so at the end of my second year i had already um you know just just told myself yeah i'm gonna move i had i liked atlanta georgia a lot um i went there a couple times and met some really cool people i just knew miami wasn't really a good fit for me so i knew i was going to move somewhere uh at the end at the end of my lease which was february of uh last year so um atlanta was on the top of the list i actually ended up applying for a um for a house there just for like a like a lease a rental house and um didn't get approved for some reason they said my my business had to be in georgia because it was like somewhere deal where my income was florida and not georgia so they want to let me lease the house and she was like okay i don't have time to mess with this and i found a house back here in oklahoma and at the time i was actually in a relationship with somebody who was living in oklahoma as well um so it just made more sense um it was in that relationship oklahoma was good for me um i i wanted to be around some of the the business people that i had met here you know several years ago and also kind of collaborate with them on some stuff so it was just a natural fit to move back and now how does it feel now like how does it feel now in terms of what you're doing now and and uh you know being there around your friends and family i i think it's like the the perfect balance like i got i got what i needed from miami and i still get what i need from oklahoma um so pretty much majority of the time like i i feel good like i feel like i can work and be very productive and get everything done and grow my business in my career while also still having relationships like probably once a week this is how i think how big of an effect miami had on me like once a week um at least uh i'll walk in the gym or i'll go into a place to get a smoothie or i'll go eat food somewhere and you know i see somebody i know or i talk to a random person and have a really good conversation with them and you know i walk in i'm like this is what this is the piece i was missing the whole time was like having these people around me like a lot of people will tell you you got to move away from your hometown i i think yeah it's great go out and experience it but there's nothing wrong with moving back like when i moved back i was like everybody's gonna think i'm a failure like they're gonna think this kid moved out to miami and he came back because he couldn't afford it and he's a failure and then i i started thinking like no that's not it doesn't matter this this is me i know myself right started coming back and realized man i'm much happier being in this environment yeah than i thought i would be so it's really good yeah it's you know there's nothing wrong with definitely moving out so to try something right i was i mean for me it's like i moved out too late to try something out right and honestly i'm very happy with it for me personally for example i just like i moved out i finally feel like you look a little more independent now right right and has completely changed me my income and everything right yeah and and i'm very happy but my goal is at this at the end of the day is still to bring in like i want to bring a family to l.a you know like i brought them to like they came to l.a you know they came to a week ago and i'm like i'm showing them all this cool stuff with the secret plan of like trying to get it to move in here you know i'm like hey guys [Laughter] so yeah so that that's kind of that and so now so now blake so now now what does the future look like for you now like um yeah i actually had somebody ask me that question like two days ago like what is what's what's what are the goals what are the future really by 25 i like to be at the point where i'm pretty much done so not really involved in the daytoday agency work still have the agency but really be more focused on just longterm investments and just managing those because that's like step one was programming working that step two is agency being involved in architecture step three is like a much higher level view of everything so you know getting somebody to manage the business and managing them and managing different investments or potentially getting into real estate um just being more involved with figuring out how to it'll make the money work for me and that's three years is really the goal i've set to be at the point where i have enough money to be able to figure out how i can make make it make enough for me to where it makes what i'm making now basically so by itself basically it's exactly so are you look looking at it as more like uh what's it called what is it called the income the the automatically recurring income what is it what's the name of the the income cost passive income passive income is that which more so you're looking for um not i mean not necessarily passive like i don't i don't see myself ever getting to the point where i'm like a hundred percent passive you believe do you believe in passive income uh not really i mean i don't think it's necessarily possible just because i mean one unless it's like stocks or something i guess that's technically potentially completely passive if you want it to be yeah um but when it comes to things like an agency there's no way that could be passive yeah i don't think i mean you're shooting far so the way i mean the way i look at it too is like i'm i'm never going to stop working on things like i in in three years i imagine i i want to be the point where my money can make you know what i'm making now without doing a whole lot of yeah you know grunt work for it but you know i still love doing this stuff i don't hate what i do by any means like yeah i could i just want to get to the point where i'm 25 i can say i can be done now if i want to actually be done yeah really holy [ __ ] that's crazy because i'm 25 i'm like holy [ __ ] you know 22 i mean look i'm very happy for for people's success right yeah like for me that is amazing that inspires me it inspires so many other people as well like to be able to see someone who started so young 18 even younger than that you know to build up this agency build up this company to now have this and so forth it is it is pretty insane and it's not an easy job at all right and and now like what you you say what i think remind me of seven employees you said or something right seven or six eight eight eight employees right and are you guys over mold now at this point you guys are all remote workingly or you have an office um one guy is actually like 10 miles down the road for me but nice he's we technically work remote that's awesome that's awesome so so that's amazing so blake you guys have heard that basically right of his story kind of like what he is he's been through and where he has gone i want to now take a few questions kind of like from the audience and in terms of what they've asked you know and just just kind of go to them is that okay sweet so one person example asked is like so tell me a way to start like how did you start like what would you tell someone who's a beginner like who wants to potentially start freelancing right how will we how would you go ahead and tell them hey you know what maybe it's star freelance if let's start there what would you say yeah so i just something i taught a long time ago um is i i think that there's two stages freelancing one is um you know meg is using a website called freelancer.com i haven't used it in years um so i don't know if i can necessarily vouch for it anymore but the reasoning is freelancer.com is gonna or similar sites that are smaller like that will be able to provide you with smaller gigs that don't have a massive effect on your reputation right so if you do one you don't do so well on it it's not really going to matter that much long term you do want to be careful with it make sure you do the project as good as you can but not going to have a huge reputational impact long term besides like upwork sorry you have something should you start should you start with small projects you start with some small gigs yes definitely small gigs i think don't jump into big stuff yeah um the second piece of that is upwork upwork is like holy grail of freelancing um and a couple pieces of this so upwork um depending on what country you live in uh i assume there's people from other countries out in the u.s is that right i think it's all u.s okay okay again this is not a problem so yeah um other countries typically have a hard time getting approved to get into upwork so that's the only thing i want to mention there yeah um but uh up work you can make a lot of money off of i mean we've done i think somewhere over 500k through upwork and we're top 10 agencies on upwork that's insane so you can do a lot there the reason i say do something smaller like freelancer.com uh if you screw up your reputation on upwork you're screwed forever so just be very careful wait a year or so before you get into that because you can really set yourself up with a good career on upwork if you if you do it right how do you build up your how do you build up your petition there on upwork yes uh so biggest thing and this applies to freelancer.com as well um when you're going to get gigs people people often would ask me questions like hey i've put five proposals in this week why haven't i gotten anything to give you guys the understanding how much we do we do at least 100 proposals every single week and we still do that now um so the volume is there and we may close let's say two deals a month off of four or 500 proposals holy [ __ ] yeah but think about it you know we closed one deal say it's 40 50k you know i paid somebody you know an hour a day to do this it's totally worth it um so volume is super important there um that's always tough for freelancers initially it's just making sure you get that volume do you are your clients right now are they all still like uh recurring clients or is this you always have to get new clients um we have both so we have one for example that's been with us for two years they've had somebody developer fulltime for two years we have some others that are you know one and done we do a three six month contract they're done so um we just try to keep it rolling okay okay awesome sweet sweet sweet and what we what would you sell like what should they expect like what should someone who goes into this right what should they expect going into like a freelancing type of world um what should i expect that's a good question i mean i think the first thing is they're they're not going to know everything right you expect to not know everything when you go into it and try to understand the concept of something what i try to think of when i uh when i go into any new project is you know my job is to help take something from a concept to an actual product and that's your job at the end of the day as well because most of these people contact you who are probably not going to have a whole lot of technical experience so this is where your skills have to come in and your confidence has to come in that you can say okay i realized your problem and i'm going to figure out a solution for it as you build it up you'll be able to say i realize your problem i have a solution for it that's what i did today i was on a call with somebody we had built something six months ago this person needed the exact same thing i was able to say i already built this like 100 have a solution for your problem my biggest thing when you're starting out is just making sure you show that confidence that you're willing to figure out the solution and as you go into it that you're gonna have to spend probably a lot more time than what you're getting paid like if you're getting paid 500 bucks for a job you probably could have gone and worked a work minimum wage job and made more by the time you completed it but that's not the point point is you gain the knowledge from it and that makes you even more valuable for the next deal and the next deal the next deal how do you go ahead for example when you approach clients right in what format you usually you know more formally do you talk to them right to show them confidence to you know to close a deal what does it mean for you to what do you do to close the deal i guess in my question and the biggest thing is just going to be having confidence in your voice so you know when you talk talking like you know what you're talking you're talking about yeah when i started there was plenty of times where i was talking about things that i didn't know what i was talking about in my head i knew i could figure it out but i made sure that my voice my tone you know the way that i was if it was a video call the way that i was sitting the way i was dressed you know presentation is everything that's what i used to teach a lot and my very old course was that presentation is super important like the small details that people don't focus on like when we when we start with a new deal run you through the whole process so we start with a new client proposal goes in they instantly get a link to schedule a meeting with us uh so they get my whole calendar they can schedule a meeting with us right away they don't have to message me you don't have to talk to me or anything they schedule it um right after that schedules we have an automated email that goes out and says hey you know if you guys can send us any more details please do so just so we can be prepared for the call that's awesome that's the second piece of it third we get on a call video chat we have everybody on our team will have these shirts on no way clean backgrounds everybody's got them and we've got like 40 boxes in my closet full of like packs um oh back to give me one second oh background really this is this is gonna be uh show me show you guys something i'll pull one of these out here yeah so this is basically what my closet is filled with these are our boxes with our logos on it wow all of our website branding as well wow so you'll notice if you look at this and go to our website the lines are key elements of our websites colors are the same everything's the same so when we start working with a client as soon as we get them to sign an nda we send them a welcome card wow no way we send them a custom mozzie tshirt show show the tshirt show me the tshirt i'm very curious it looks really cool yeah so a lot of we got these in really soft versions a lot of like people like wearing these at the gym a couple people in my gym wear them uhhuh big mozzie logo yeah look at that that looks amazing we got mozzie mugs oh [ __ ] we got some nice pins i love it so this is just something small like once we get an nda sign and we get their address we'll send it to them they won't even know it's coming and it shows up i mean this is we closed like a 40k deal off of justice alone last year wow but that you know that that just shows the professionality and the care right if you get something like this from a company right like like they're not here to joke around yeah they're not here to they're not here to to [ __ ] around that's that's what that's that's what it says right yeah and there's there's like so many of those little things that holidays will send those boxes out but they'll be holiday themed no and it's like there'll be totally totally different things in there and so the thing is just trying to figure out even now companies our size typically aren't doing that stuff but you know one of the things that my uh my coach and i have talked about all last year was how can we make ourselves look like these massive companies but still keep our demographic right because the companies above us are charging 200 an hour we're charging 90 to 100 an hour um so in my head i've always been like how can i be playing on the same field as these big guys while also kind of staying at um our demographic because i'm very happy with where we're at and so that's when we started pulling these little elements like just making sure we look more professional when we get on video calls perfecting emails perfecting those boxes website stuff um just so many aspects like if you really focus on every piece of getting a client and you perfect it yeah it'll be so much easier because then little touches because then you you repeat that process over and over and over again and of course i'm guessing you know the whole process of like when you communicate right while you're building a project like i'm very curious how does that look like for you like what do you guys do you know every single two weeks you send out some you know you send out like you know uh information about here's the state of your project how does it look like for you i'm curious that so that's one thing that you kind of need to gauge with who you're working with and figure out why are they hiring you are they hiring you to be a supplement to you know their existing team um are they hiring you to just give you a problem and have you find a solution like that needs to be something you ask or figure out maybe not even ask but you figure out how to infer from your first conversations um let's figure out what they actually need because we have some clients that they don't want to talk to us at all like until we have something ready for us they don't want to talk to us like just get it ready and then deliver it then we have other clients that every every two three days they like to have a call and if people are paying us enough we'll do a call every two or three days um but if people are you know not paying that much like let's say they're paying for 10 hour like 20 hours a week parttime resource we're not gonna have three meetings with you a week it doesn't make sense yeah do it once a week around every two weeks um but you just kind of have to gauge that's part of your um you know kind of your vetting process at the front too i've had clients that i can tell they're gonna be on my ass about everything and i just don't take them because it's like i don't need i don't need that um i want people they're going to be like hey here's the problem they'll trust that i'm going to solve it and give me time to do it it's good in a day if you're it's good to be in that position and you're like you know what i don't need you yeah and that confuses people the most honestly like that's that's such a power play that confuses the heck out of so many people when you're like i don't like if you're not gonna follow doing it my way we're just not gonna do this at all because you came to me like i didn't come to you yeah right and so yeah when you're at that point that's that's actually how you close you can close even more deals is because people get confused and they're like oh this guy really knows what he's doing because he's going to say fu to me basically yeah that actually has happened to us as well as well we're like yeah if you take out the deal off the table interesting things that start to happen they do that's interesting so now let me ask you this like i know this is like uh kind of like at this point like how do you build up your environment in your company um like what do you think what do you worry about right or like or what's important to you in terms of environment well first you got to figure out you know people working for you what are their goals right and what are your goals and how well do those match so when you hire somebody um you know i'm not interested in hiring people that are late in their career and that don't have a whole lot of ambition you know my my whole thing is if we take on a client like i'm most the time i'm going to set a pretty realistic timeline and expectations and i'm going to have a high expectation of quality good example of this is last year we hired somebody he was a developer from microsoft 20 years with them um seemed like a really experienced guy and he couldn't keep up with the pace that we were working at and he was like well i i lo i had a lower rate because i wanted something more relaxed and what i just i just said that's not what we're interested in right so we're totally understanding that but that's not we're interested in so when you hire people you need to think about where they are in their life do you does your company and and your you know attitude towards things fit with their life as well because if it doesn't you're both going to be unhappy um i think a big thing is just making sure you and your employees mesh in terms of your your life goals like a lot of people work for us or young some of them have families that are very young families as well so they want to do big things for their family um they have a lot of ambition a lot of motivation so i think that's a big piece of it is just understanding your people um that's awesome and and also not being afraid to uh you know keep personal life out of things right i have a huge passion for cars uh pretty much everybody on my team knows that if somebody needs a new car usually they come and ask me hey what car should i get uh really and you're like get yourself an audi r8 get this one yeah but you know a lot of them have car passions too um so it just you know you gotta you gotta find what works well for your for your goals your team and uh get the right people in the door so that's amazing that's amazing yeah i think like honestly hiring is probably one of the hardest things you can do um in a company because we're doing it we're doing a lot of hiring as well here here at clever program right it's one of the hardest things to do but it's probably one of the most important things to do yeah right because your people like the whole company yeah people you don't have a good product exactly the people are the company right exactly yeah and it's like you're bringing one person or two people that they're like it's a game changer now yeah so let me ask you this like how do you find those people because i've had for someone one of the questions that was on there is like you know how did you go about finding people for your team like how do you still go about finding people for your team yeah so when i first started it was literally i'd go on upwork i'd get the deal on upwork i'd go find somebody on upwork and do it that way so it started to be coming to the point where a lot of the upward qual uh quality developers just wasn't very good in my opinion um so i started doing other things like referrals of developers that were already working for me they would refer one of their friends that would work for me um clients that we worked for let's say one of their developers quit you know six months down the road we had one guy that i worked with three years ago and he came back and asked me what i was doing and we hired him wow um so indeed um linkedin it's just the biggest thing is you've got to do a ton of interviews to find good people a lot of time what do you look for and i'm very curious because like the specific things that like for example we look for as well like what do you look for in in people when you hire them i know you said you know hunger things like that what what are some other things um so depending on what technology i'm hiring for uh let's say dot net sharp.net i would ask some questions specifically around that that may be fairly simple not really anything you have to think through hard about but i i listen to see how they explain it um do they explain it in a way that that shows that they have a lot of deep knowledge about the subject or is it very surface level where they they could probably integrate it but they don't really know what it's doing um just asking different kind of questions technical questions to figure out what is somebody's skill level yeah technology for example or uh asking questions like hey if i present this problem to you how would you go about solving it um how would you uh how would you coordinate this with a let's say a frontend designer if you're a backend a backend developer like just understanding more how they think um instead of like trying to give them a code test or something in that like that i don't believe in those i would rather just figure out how does somebody think um how quickly can they answer things well when you do a technical interview right are you do you still ask them any technical questions so do you just have them explain explain like a project um typically explain projects or explain uh how they took something from concept to an actual product but you know i'm not i'm not asking things like uh you know how does dependency injection work and net i don't because you know i can get enough from um those questions about projects or other things and the other day what you're gonna realize too is people are an investment some are really good and some are really bad um so a lot of the times you can only do so much in an interview and then you just have to hire the person and find out what happens um so you just have to be ready for that sound decisions you gotta test it out basically what you're saying yeah that's interesting yeah i mean because like the reason why i asked this question is well because you know a lot of people they're looking for jobs and you know a lot of jobs when they when they go ahead and they when they interview right there's a lot of things that you know they ask some some people some good jobs ask just kind of what you're saying right they ask you to explain a project some jobs do technical interviews right now granted i'm still very um very kind of like uh i look out for things on the tactical aspect as well like for example because what i see a lot a lot of times is i'm not sure if you've seen this before in your hand as well is there there'll be people who like for example who come from like maybe you know universities or you know other other institutions and you know they've got all these crazy projects on hand and they can do all this stuff but for some reason when it comes to like being able to create some stuff on their own or understand the technical aspects yeah or even do something even the simplest of problems they have the hardest times yeah it takes forever yeah i don't know that's that's that's have you seen that thing yeah no totally i mean there's people who are who are insanely smart from uh from the way computer science is taught on a uh education or college level but when it comes to implementation it's like what's going on here like where's where's what's why is why is it so difficult um and that's when i think it's you have to understand there's different types of developers right so with our u's case it's more effective for me to interview the way i do because it's shown to provide me the people i want when i ask those questions and get those kind of responses now when you talk about somebody like google they're going to have really strict you know code reviews where it's they're not asking they may ask questions like i do but it's not going to make their decision it's because those developers are people who they want they want that developer to sit in a room all day every day and focus on such a tiny piece of the program all day every day that it's good for those people who are coming out of college so what i realized is there's just there's different fits those people that are coming out of college that are like that are really good but not for an agency approach in my opinion most interesting interesting and so okay so for example now when you for example hire right uh how much do you have i'm curious like do you look higher every single do you look for hires every single what every week right because like from what we read from where we're learning from others is like hiring should be like one the one the number one things you should be doing every single time correct me i mean i don't i don't see it like that personally um i think if you're a big enough company yeah for sure like that should be a huge priority for us um we've got eight people there's there's not a whole lot of like it's not we'd be we probably do that for about two weeks and we have a full team if we if we knocked everybody off um but it's one of those things as kind of an as needed basis you know if we start seeing that we have a couple of contracts coming up um you know we'll start onboarding people or like for example all the telehealth stuff we've done we hired three new people um past couple months and started onboarding them on some of the procedures like technical aspect of that but it's really more on as needed basis for us it's smaller but that's pretty amazing like with eight people you've done some pretty amazing things like with eight people it doesn't take a lot that's the thing at first i was like i want to have i remember telling my mom uh years ago that i want to have hundreds of developers and then you realize what it takes to manage eight then you're like yeah no way i want a hundred and it's like i can do everything i need with you give me a team of eight people we'll get everything done and even if it's you know i think the the peak we've hit was like 14 and um i realized like i could be just as effective with eight and it's not about the numbers just how effective you are really that's awesome that's amazing so so look so so that your story your story is very inspiring and and of course you know um everything to get started with i have one question here that's like for example like that somebody asked is what drives you right now it's a good question i think it's um you know continuing the pursuit of finding my passion you know it's it's i remember a year ago i would walk out and i would see my car and that drove me um that was something that was like i want you know a bigger or i want a better car you know it's like i want a lamborghini in this case i got an r8 and it's like this it just doesn't uh i look at that stuff it doesn't really dry it doesn't dry me at all anymore like i could i used to go on trips and i would think about my car now i go on a trip and just like whatever it doesn't matter really i've i've thought about you know getting a nicer house like dude i got a home i got a roof over my head i don't care it's most important thing it just doesn't matter doesn't it doesn't leak water it's all it's all good yeah it's good it really is good and um you know right now i'm just i i think a big part of it is when when somebody like driving the r8 around i get pretty much every day somebody coming up to me saying what do you do for a living and i say i do addiction recovery software and it's like instantly this like i feel good about myself saying that and then their reaction to it as well and us getting to have a conversation about it like opening it up so that you know if they have somebody that has addiction problems we can talk about it like it just gives me so much more of a meaning than saying i run a software development agency like i write code like i i feel i feel like i am pursuing something that is really meaningful to me and that i have a passion about um that's that's definitely what's driving me right now do you think they'll continue to do that do you think over time it will change um i i think um potentially it could i think maybe the uh the scale of it will change if anything i mean i i after doing this for seven eight months it's something that i don't foresee myself ever really deviating away from now um i think the scale of it will grow i mean we've we've started working with uh several state organizations the past couple months and it's it's you know closed the whole state of uh i won't name the name but a couple states their whole addiction recovery department so that for me is a really really big thing like seeing the level of impact so i think that's awesome it will change in terms of what scale we're providing it on so yeah when you when you you're like for yeah honestly like impact on people and impact on the things that you care about is always always is just such a source of happiness right like for example for us even for example whenever we have a student that gets a job or whenever a student like you know he gets an internship even or something like that like holy [ __ ] like we're [ __ ] bouncing over our walls you know here you know we had this one guy on he got his first job like making 70k as developer right after doing postmates right and so many something about other other students it's and i remember like you know like uh he called us and he like started crying yeah and like we started crying you know like like yeah it is you know honestly it's [ __ ] it's [ __ ] amazing that that that i get to talk to a person that's also loved with that that what what he's doing right and it's just [ __ ] driven like guys [ __ ] in this world put yourself around people who are [ __ ] doing cool [ __ ] and [ __ ] just and make connections and and just do similar things like that's what's going to tell you because like that [ __ ] inspires the [ __ ] out of me yeah it's not even about like it's uh you know i've seen people that are completely different financial situations but you know are super motivating for me like there's for for example like there's this guy at the gym and yeah i've talked to him like every day and i'm like dude he's got like 60 followers on his instagram page i'm like dude you got to start posting more [ __ ] because like every time i see it it hypes me up and i'm like super inspired by you yeah right and it's like we're we're doing completely different things careerwise and i look at i'm like dude this [ __ ] is motivating i don't i don't care where you're at or financially or whatever part of your career or whatever it's like if you're doing something you have a passion about it that is inspiring like you putting that energy into something that you actually care about is super inspiring yeah yeah it always is like if you just put yourself out that's pretty much it i think that's a big thing for everybody out here guys is put yourself out there right is may that be on social media right may that be on linkedin make that be in anywhere show the best person you can show is you right yeah that's what people buy in right they don't people don't buy in sometimes a result even when you go for a job they don't buy into you know the technicals yes technical skills are important i agree yes 100 but they also buy into your personality you come in there with amazing personality with amazing tonality and with amazing just like you know and with amazing energy that's what they're going to look for yeah that's nobody's nobody's coming to us and if if uh you know nobody's gonna come to our agency and say okay i'm ready to close the deal they go through me first right so if i can't sell them on myself first then they're not gonna use the next stage so let me ask you i'm very curious uh on this one for you this is a business kind of related do you outsource can you outsource yourself like do you think that because you are that core piece right you are that first connection with the with the with the client right do you think that you can have someone else to be that uh yeah i don't think i could outsource myself completely i think i could outsource enough um i think a company gets big enough where their name speaks for themselves they don't have to do the level of selling that we have to do um i think once you get to the point of some of the bigger agencies where they've got 100 people it's pretty obvious they're doing stuff the right way they're doing it well and they're trustworthy except when you work with a smaller team where you've got eight to ten people or even sub like 50 people uh you have to have somebody that's really close to the client that's usually the owner the ceo of the company um the way i look at it right now though is if i were trying to if i was trying to outsource myself right now what would stop somebody from from just going and doing their own why would somebody do my job when they can just try and make more that's true that's true that's true and of course from your perspective like your job at this point is you don't see yourself just kind of coding at this point right you don't call it do you i'm very curious do you miss coding or no uh so i i still regularly code um like i'm very very much involved in um like a lot of the architecture and uh setup of projects and helping with some of the more complex problems but um definitely don't spend as much time as i used to on it so i i don't necessarily the time that i do it fulfills me enough that's awesome and then at the time the frustration time that doesn't frustrate you as much as i guess sometimes it could have before yeah yeah because that person for example i sometimes miss coding like like uh i mean i could of course i teach right but my number one thing for me is like i want to be able to like actually because like what happens is when you teach you you unfill your bucket like you've got this bucket of like of knowledge right and you're just trying to pour into everybody else right the most important you need to understand is like how to not fill your bucket at the same time too you know that's the hardest thing now awesome blake it's been [ __ ] amazing yeah it's great questions yes it's been a lot of fun
