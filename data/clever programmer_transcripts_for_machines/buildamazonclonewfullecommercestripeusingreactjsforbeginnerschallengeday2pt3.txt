that's good nice what's up guys i think we are back all right we are back you guys guys so sorry about this but this is gonna change this up we shouldn't be so it looks like because this connection guys is having a little bit of issues if it does cut out guys don't worry we're gonna go through this entire thing for you guys so nothing is gonna get lost or missed uh you guys are gonna have the full clone and we're gonna go through all of this stuff so do not freak out guys i'm just getting everything on the screen and then we can go ahead and get started guys so let's do it starting soon and we need to go sunny will be there to guide you but keep going sunny yeah because i was just thinking shall we maybe um if you could possibly somehow um just zip the the zip the zip the code right now send it to me on slack i'll open it on bs code and it'll be much quicker we'll do it that way and we'll just carry on because right now in case the connection drops we're gonna lose everything that we've done here got it yeah okay right in the meantime guys let's go ahead and fire off some questions that you're interested about the challenge let us know who's here and we apologize for this connection stuff guys it it just happens when we go live sometimes and it's a pain but it's going to be fine um yeah like the game sometimes it just happens and there's really not much we can do about it even you know you don't want this to happen of course right exactly um let me see guys i think it's pretty clear now it should be pretty clear uh for you guys um let's go ahead and see so we've got lux miguel says hi carson sunny what's up um youtube is not working at all so guys the best thing you guys could do is definitely if you are coming from youtube or you saw that things weren't working so kazi has come back as build a whatsapp clone with the mansac so we just need to go ahead and change that name again all right well uh guys on youtube again okay now as it says it's done beautiful so yeah change the name again but um i think youtube should be uploading the previous ones even if it crashes yeah so we should have everything on right now nice awesome guys so we are back right we are back we are back nice so everyone should be rejoining if it's all working guys let us know where you're at right now are you actually i mean this might actually work out well for some of you guys because you guys might be able to actually catch up with us with what's happening and even if we do i think the connection may drop on kazi's end so it seems to like it it looks like we're having a little bit of problems with the connection but guys if your energy is real and if your energy is strong enough then we can crush this kind of stuff this is hard guys if we can't handle a few connection issues then how are we gonna handle debugging right so this is what happens when you code this is what we gotta get used to this stuff will happen but we will conquer it we will overcome it and we will crush this stuff guys um give me two seconds guys i'm just getting the file right now yeah i'm here i can i did so my screen is frozen but it's okay i can still talk my voice is still there and good energy hopefully you guys are a good energy in the comments if you are let's go the file is there sonny let's go bro drop the zip file you should be good to go and we should be back on track no problem exactly guys i am hustling and getting this zip file up for you guys guys i love this when i look at my internet it says 700 down like download speed 700 megabits per second and then like upload is like 35 just like your connection is excellent yeah oh man i'm just trying to unzip this okay it's just unzipping now all right bear with us guys once we get down but we're up exactly yeah exactly google went down guys firebase went down so you know we're pretty good we're pretty good all right uh it's almost done guys i'll share with you guys the progress right now we've got a thousand people back on the stream thank you guys for being patient it's all good guys champs i can't believe that you guys are still here like thank you guys that is crazy just so much love and guys smash that like button if you're watching it on facebook or youtube or whatever like let's send this video out to as many people as we can that's the only way we can recover at this point we lost like freaking you know 10 000 people watching you but it's okay we can recover from it exactly we can come back from this guys it's all good right so i'm going to quickly pull in my code right now guys bear with me i'm opening up my downloads so let's go cd downloads and the file is the 8th of september there we go boom code insiders that's a little trick for you guys if you don't know this trick um inside the terminal so i have the code open guys let's go let's carry on at full speed guys who's excited drop it in the comments let's recover this and save this situation guys so let's go because he is so jokes man you froze in such a funny position and it's perfect perfect you can just use that as my image i'm smiling i'm happy i mean that's exactly perfect thing to freeze exactly dude it's the perfect thing to freeze right guys so here let's hop in back into the code so what we were doing previously i'm gonna go ahead and make this a little bit bigger for you guys so that you guys can see this and i'm going to go ahead and also pull up the actual clones next to the app so we can go ahead and see this in a very visual way so it's very simple for you guys to go ahead and see i'm also going to go ahead and pull the actual demo of the app because we're going to use this for reference when we're coding so this is the app and i'm going to go ahead and if you guys haven't already you need to do npm start so npm start like so and guys to be honest this would actually give a lot of you guys the chance to catch up on the build so use that time that you lost to go ahead and catch up and get caught up to the point that we're at right now so i'm just going ahead and installing the modules uh because i got cars these files sent over to me um so we're doing it on this machine and that should be done in just a sec but what we were doing guys is we were working on this right here so we were working on the amazon header so this thing right here at the top let's go ahead and it's just installed so we're going to npm start and boom guys we are back we are back we've got 1200 people uh okay what is that i have no idea anyway um god damn it dude the demo gods are evil today it's all good bro like as many challenges as you can throw on us now yeah everything exactly firebase went down something else [Laughter] exactly guys good bro exactly and look we've got people with the energy like nothing can stop us that's right guys nothing can stop us um exactly guys let's go so i'm gonna go ahead and make this super big right now so you guys can see everything and um there we go so you guys should be able to see everything clearly let me know if you can't in the comments but i think that should be clear right now um so with that said let's go ahead and carry on so we've got the header component at the top so what we're gonna do is we're gonna jump inside of that and inside the header component guys we are going to go ahead and check out so i'm just pulling up some notes so we've got everything available um so here so what we were doing right now is we were actually focusing on this guys this we built this part of the search right so with the search we actually had the header search the header search input and the header search icon we styled it to get it looking like this so in case you guys missed what we did there i'm going to go ahead and go into header.css and here is what we had we had the header search which was the container so this is the container for everything it was display flex flex one which flex one actually went ahead and gave us this where it's spread out to the rest of the um flex one basically says they want it to like stretch as big as it can go okay now what we're gonna do is we are going to do the right hand side so right now you can actually see what's over here but if i go ahead and zoom in you can see it says hello guest sign in all that beautiful stuff i want that to look like this okay so that's the end goal and that's where we're at right now so i mean it looks pretty close but we're gonna pretty much get to that finish line and get it looking perfect guys we have 1400 people back thank you so much guys for giving us that chance to get over this problem and we're going to keep crushing it for you guys so oh god got some flying okay we're going to keep on crushing it for you guys so let's go ahead and we've got the div over here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to have the so for each of these header options i'm going to start styling them as such as needed so the first one guys i'm going to go ahead and say header option so header underscore option like so and what i'm going to do here is i'm going to actually go ahead and find my styles for this i'm going to go ahead and give the following this i'm going to say display flex and what i'm going to do just to make it extremely easy because right now you can't actually see that text very easily you see on this one it's white so let's go ahead and actually give that white color right now so i'm going to say the color should also be white right so for now i'll just give the color of white i'm going to say display flex and we are going to say flex direction column margin left 10 pixels margin right 10 pixels color white so you see right now it's squashed right everything is squashed up and the reason why this is is because we need to target the head and nav and we need to make this responsive so i'm going to go ahead target the header nav and let's go over to head and nav here i'm going to say display flex and justify content space evenly so what this will do is if we save this now you see that it actually went ahead and because we've set the rules of this image we've set the rules of this container right here so the search the search container and then the nav container all of them are abiding by flex rules so what that means is guys is that it's going to equally share that space between what is ev whatever is inside so now you can see it's starting to look a little bit more like the finished product right so we're almost getting there guys we're almost getting there well the next bit we're gonna do is we are going to target the option nine one so we had here header option nine one option nine two for option nine one we can go ahead and do the following we say target header option nine one and then we can do the following so flies okay header option nine one and here we've got a font size of 10 pixels so um here we are going to do a font size of 10 pixels like so and then we're going to save and then we're also going to do an option nine two so here edge risa says you get them girls guys keep coding that's so funny i got that girl i know got them girls that girl all right so fun size 13 pixels front weight of 800. kazi are you still there of course bro i'm here in spirit and i'm [Laughter] i'm like like this loading energy now coming from the dead just it's so funny it's spooky when kazi is so quiet and not moving around but we love his smile somebody said love my mouth oh man somebody's like causing breathe man all right i'm here don't worry guys i am breathing just i got a very high quality noise gate on but you know it's so quick guys we're all good exactly right so we have the amazon clone we have amazon nav bar is looking clean it looks glitchy it looks like the amazon nav bar exactly it's looking clean guys now i saw somebody say what is the font family we didn't actually change the font so keep it as it is and everything will work correctly and it'll work as you expect so the final thing guys is we want that basket icon so this one on the right that nice little basket icon to go ahead and add that in what we're gonna do is the final uh header option needs to be added so the final header option that we're interested in here is this one over here so i'm gonna go ahead and add a div so i'm going to say div of header basket option oops like so option basket like that and inside of here what i'm going to do is i'm going to use the shopping basket icon from material ui so this we actually need to import so what i can do is i can click on the end of the name and i can do control spacebar and all my tricks not working okay so sometimes it doesn't work so what you need to do is manually go to the top and go ahead and do your typical import so i'm importing this from material ui and then we are going to have the next part of this uh so this actually needs to be oh yes we're gonna have this and then i'm gonna go ahead and add a span and this one guys is going to have the following class name so it's going to have two class names this one so i'm going to add the following ones so it's going to have a and this will say zero for now and what what we're basically putting here is this one right here guys so we're focusing on that zero now this has two class names it has header option line two and it has header basket count and this has a space bar between it guys so a space between it so you see there is a space between the two things okay so make sure you do that and this is because we're applying two different class names to this element at the top so we need to go ahead and style this stuff right here now what we're gonna do is first go ahead and target the option basket so i'm going to go ahead and say header option basket go into my css and let's check what needs to change so for the option basket i'm going to say display flex and align item center do that and we can see i'm actually going to change the color of it right now because we can't actually see anything with that so color white and now you can see we've got this so this is going to be important for later guys because we want this to be dynamic so if we go ahead and check the actual app you guys can actually see if i add to the basket notice how it actually goes ahead and updates over here okay so you can actually see their updates over in the top corner so if i go ahead and click and add some more items to basket it goes ahead and updates to the basket as such right so that's going to give us a clean look and feel to the app so with that we're going to carry on we've got the um basket looking a bit cleaner and then what we're going to do is we're also going to go ahead and target this header basket account so let's go back to our css let's zoom out of this page so we can see actually let's keep it zoomed in for now because that's kind of clean and then we're going to go ahead and give it a margin left and a margin right of 10 pixels so i'm going to go here i'm going to say target the basket count which is actually the span here and we're going to get say give it a margin left of 10 pixels and a margin right of 10 pixels okay now if we refresh we should be able to see everything is looking pretty clean okay so that is a clean finished header bar right so that's looking really really clean and what we want is it right now it says hello guest but the end goal would be when you sign in it will say hello sunny or hello kazi or whatever you're signed in as okay so it's going to be really really crucial to have this header looking nice and clean guys i also want to stress that look it's sticky so as we scroll down it sticks to the top of the web page so it's a very very clean um very very clean implementation we've done right now so with that said let me know if you're actually following to this point and if you're not it's completely fine so make sure guys remember as we said keep the energy high even sometimes just watching this stuff watching the content and then following it afterwards is more important i would say so make sure you follow this keep keep um optimistic and out of recognition this is how people get so good at things even if you just watched it and you didn't code along just a pattern recognition of you learning react hooks this is how this is built this is how this goes into the header if you just panic and spend all your time on panicking i saw somebody earlier in the stream and look i'm signing out like this is going too fast for me okay you're also not going to become a developer that's just the truth and so this is how people are weeded out but we want you to be that person who can actually stick through this and even if it doesn't make sense to you it'll make sense like your bill it's no joke you're building an amazon clone like amazon it took them decades to get to what they have right now those engineers are getting paid 300 000 plus 400 000 plus a year we're doing that live in this challenge so of course some of the stuff isn't going to make sense but if you just quit out for that reason then you're also not going to become a developer so you have to pick your battles and stick through a goddamn thing and commit everybody who's here is committing so that is very very powerful and stick through it i mean we're all sticking through it with you exactly guys and guys like cars he said if you can't stick through this those numbers that we said yesterday want the 120k salary those things they require that 110 that we talked about they require that discipline that sort of not quitting when the push gets when the push gets going and when it gets hard okay so just like now it's completely fine if things don't make sense do not quit though right do not quit keep that energy high and let's carry on so let's jump back into the code and you can see we've done the sticky top navbar in our build so it looks really really nice really clean and what we're going to do now is we are actually going to go ahead and build out the body of the app right so the body if we go over to our app.js we called it the home component let's go ahead and create that home component so here what i'm going to do is create home and i'm going to go ahead and create that file so i'm going to say home dot js and here i'm going to say rfce go ahead create that and you can see it opens up this i'm going to go ahead and give it a class name of home right now here i'm going to go ahead and say import home.css like so and i'm going to create the css file so i'm going to say home.css okay now here we have the home component loading right so just to prove we can say i am the home component like so we can go ahead and do this right so now what we can see is um if i go back to app i go ahead get rid of our little comment go back here say command space and import with our little nice trick so it's added this import statement save it now you should see here it says i am the home component okay so everything underneath you see everything here is going to be the home component so let's go ahead and deck this home component out and let's make it look good so what that what with that said guys we're gonna first have a container inside of our home component right so inside of here we're gonna have a home container so i'm gonna say home underscore container and i will and this is two underscores in case you're wondering it's part of the bem convention um a lot of people always ask what the drawing tool is by the way so this drawing tool that we use is actually called screen brush so if you're in case you're wondering there you go um so now what we're going to do is inside the home container we're going to have that beautiful banner that you see so this banner right here you see where it fades into the background right so this lovely little amazon prime bomber right here we're going to show you guys how to go ahead and build that so now what i'm going to say is i'm going to do image so image as such and then i'm going to go ahead and add a so i went ahead and found the amazon one that they use i'm going to go ahead and paste it in here so i've already got my quotes save and there you go so this is actually miriam real quick in the facebook group and she's like i'm literally sick right now but i'm doubling down on my efforts focusing on this got that on the screen that's awesome so you can't actually see the name but it says what's that miriam yep yeah nice she says i'm literally sick right now i'm focusing and putting double efforts i just love your tutorials guys that's the kind of energy we need here that's awesome and with that said we are almost back at 2 000 viewers so you guys are absolutely incredible and with this energy is what is this is the energy that we need to go ahead and hit those goals that we spoke about yesterday so you can see we went ahead and added the image here right here right but you can see it kind of spans across now this doesn't look right okay so we need to go ahead and fix this so let's go ahead and add a class name and we're going to add a class name of home image so i'm going to go ahead and add a class name of home image now let's go ahead and actually fix this right now so go to the home.css let's go ahead and pull that up right now and first thing we're going to do is the home container itself okay so the home container itself actually actually asked for the link so that link um you will so here's the thing some one of you type it actually in and then paste it in the comments so get somebody somebody from this call just please help out with that and also in the slack group i know we have over 9 000 people and they're actually helping out and dropping links to these things so look in both of those places exactly guys and if you're part of that slack community i've actually saved you guys a huge deal and i just went ahead and pasted that link inside the slack right now so you guys can go ahead and check inside slack and i've dropped that link but guys remember you can just pause the video and copy this out at some point afterwards as well so try not to get caught up on just the picture just remember what we're trying to learn here so now the first thing we've done is we gave it a home image class and what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and style that so we're going to go ahead and say that this image so this home image should be of width 100 now you see guys look i'm just going to comment that out quickly right so this just these few lines of code and look at the difference that we got right there so if you think this is cool let me know let us know in the comments right now so we're firstly going to work i'm going to slowly uncomment this out so let's go ahead and first if we do width of 100 you can see it snaps everything into the viewport and this is responsive by the way so you can see everything is super responsive and then what i'm going to say is give it a undo this and we will also want to have a z index of a minus one so we want this to be behind anything else that's what a z index is i'm going to give a margin bottom of 150 minus 150 and that means that elements afterwards actually going to creep into it mask image is what gives it that beautiful sort of a fadein effect right so we're going to say start from the top to the bottom and this is basically just saying go from a uh opaque to um go from a completely um like complete color to seethrough it's also a transparent so let's go ahead and save that and you get that really nice gradient so that's going to be really really clean and nice and i can see a lot of people actually dropping it in the chat that is really nice and that's the kind of stuff that we talk about guys that's what we're talking about nice right so that's what mask images as well so i saw a lot of you guys got excited about that so now with that said we're gonna carry on and inside of home container uh i think i can hear myself echoing a little bit on your mic cozzy just going to go ahead and go to home.js so now inside of home.js guys we notice we have these rows right so we have these different rows over here um right so now inside of these so you can see what we have is we have these containers here so here i have a row there's going to be one row and then i'm going to have a row over here hey sami anger card jumped in the chat he said stay hydrated guys he is 100 right i actually need a drink right now super thirsty so over here we are also going to have are you still laughing on my mic are you still liquid no no that's all good now that's so good something yeah something you you changed it but it's all good now got it so um now guys what we're gonna have is three of those rows right and these rows are gonna the really nice part about these rows are is that they're gonna be fully responsive so you see the top one has two the the middle one has three and the last one has one and the part of the homework is going to be that i want you guys to just pretty much play around with this and see what you can do with it but what we're going to do now is we're going to say div home underscore underscore row like this and we're basically going to go ahead and the goal here is to basically render out a product component so let's go ahead and say we had like the first one has two components and then we have another row so we have another row and this one is going to have three components so you can see right here so it has two components and it has three components and then the final one so dev home on this one scroll row this one has uh one component right so you can see exactly a really clear layout of what we're trying to achieve here okay so with that so you've got these three containers and you can see this one right here is reflecting so this one right here is reflecting this row over here and we have the two containers so this is that row over here this one over here is going to reflect these three over here and then we have the final one at the bottom which is pointing towards this one okay now this is going to um be completely responsive so it's going to calculate on its own based on how many products we put inside as to how to space them out and i want you guys in your homework to make sure that you go ahead and change this out and make it so that the first one might have one product in the second one might have five in the third one might have four in right so make sure you guys vary it up in your homework so we have loads of different projects that we can go ahead and demo and see um in a really nice cool demonstration tomorrow so in the first row we're going to go ahead and add a product but in order to have a product we need to make this product component so i'm going to go ahead and create that product component so product dot js like this and we're going to say rfce like so and here i'm going to say class name of product like that okay now here i'm gonna go and do our normal stuff i'm gonna say product is here so product dot css save it and we need to create that product.css so product dot css like this all right so we have the product over here and then what we're going to do is um then what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and actually start coding out the product itself so the product itself is going to consist of a few things so it's going to consist of a title a price a star rating an image and then a add to basket button okay so we need to go ahead and drop this out now so the first thing we're going to do is we may have a sort of an info right so we're going to basically go ahead and wrap um all of the so everything you see here so let me go ahead and remove this everything we see here is going to be and i can see a lot of people dropping uh homework ideas we actually have a really nice juicy homework idea for you so it's going to be some fun for you guys afterwards um so here is going to be everything that we're going to basically be calling product info so here i'll say div product info like so okay and let me go ahead and make this a bit bigger there you go good product info and this is going to have a title in so let's go ahead and say the lean startup nice so there's the product info is basically going to be the yep so the product is yeah the product it just cut out a little bit but the product info is going to be this top part right here so this one for this one you've got the kenwood here the samsung etc all of that sd product info uh no sorry the product info is everything here sorry it's a container around all of these elements and then you've got in the individual things yeah so here we've got the product price now here i'm going to basically be i'm going to give this one a class name so this one's going to have a class name and then we're going to go ahead and say product price like so so product price and here i'm going to go ahead and say a small so i'm going to so inside that tag i'm going to give it a small tag and i'm going to say dollars because we're going to use dollars here and i'm going to say strong so this is a very quick way of making something bold and small here i'm going to say a price of let's just say the lean startup is let's just say 20 uh 1999. right now if we go back here what i'm going to do is i'm actually going to render this out as we do it so it should be very clear so i'm going to go ahead and replace this with a product component so this one should be product component now my one actually did a nice little auto import so you can see here it says auto import import product from product so if we go ahead and save we should be able to see now it shows a it shows down here so you can see it says the lean startup 1999 and this is coming straight from this product here and if i imagine we had two products save you can see two products show up so the angle is we're going to get this to this so this entire little square block so all of this white stuff is going to be the part of the finished product okay okay so now what we're going to do is inside of product.js we are going to go ahead and we've got a p tag here and i'm going to say the next bit is the product ring so we're going to have some kind of star rating here right so we're going to have a product ring so i'm going to call this one product rating like this and then inside of here guys what we're going to do is we're going to essentially have depending on whatever we pass in so if we passed in a prop value of like five or four or three then it will render out that many stars now what i'm going to do here is we actually just lost cars you guys so it will it may just be me until cause he jumps back on but let me know in the comment section if you're still pumped because we this is the kind of stuff that we have to deal with we have to overcome this sort of obstacles and tomorrow or maybe later on or very soon because we will be back guys so do not freak out we have a whole week and we are going to fall into these problems but it's it's up to us guys to overcome this stuff so let's carry on strong so here we've got a p tag and i'm going to go ahead and do a star like so and you can see like we've got the star rendering out now imagine i added in sort of a few different stars here so i want to add in like a few different stars so let's just say three stars okay so you can see like in here for example it says five so i'm going to show you guys how we are going to get to the end result okay so we have that right there and then we're going to have an image so the image is going to be an image of the product so let's go ahead and outside of here we're going to say an image and this is actually going to be outside the product info now so we're going to say image and here what i'm going to do is i'm just going to pop it on me for a second and i'm going to go ahead and find an image of the lean start because sometimes you don't know what google is going to throw at you especially on the demo the demo days so let's go ahead and copy the image address and um yeah go ahead and guys if you haven't already and you're enjoying this smash the thumbs up button and try and get this video out to as many people as you can obviously we had a few technical issues earlier but we are over that and we are going strong so let's go back to our source and then what we're going to do is we're going to paste this and what this is is this picture right here so you can see we've got the lean start so we've got two products being rendered right now because i'm dropping two products here so i'm going to go ahead and clear that up so we have our one product now with this guys what we are going to do is we are going to i'm just going to pause there we go that should be a bit smoother now so so the stars by the way guys many people are asking about these you can use a normal emoji you can literally go on google and put in a star you can put in whatever you want you can do pretty much anything like that and it's going to it should be completely fine um can you guys i'm sure you guys can see there we go um so we've got the so let's go ahead and just say a one star for now okay so it's got the one star here for now and what i'm going to do is um we are going to go ahead and see so a lot of people are saying you can't see the uh the stars but i think we're good i think we're all good guys so we've got the image back up and then we're going to go ahead and add a button so here i'm going to go ahead and add a button and that button is going to say add to basket okay add two baskets let's go ahead and save and now you can see if we go back to our app we've got the add to basket button hey so it's clean okay very very clean and now what we are going to do is we are going to style this because right now this does not look nice it does not look very good so let's go ahead and use that so let's go back to our product.css and let's make this thing look beautiful okay so the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go to our product and this is the bit i like because this is where as we do it you guys are going to go ahead and see all of the changes visually pop in right so here i'm going to say display flex display flex there we go so everything goes into a row i'm gonna say flex direction column so everything goes into your and that it looks horrible so we're gonna fix that in a second um and before actually let's go ahead and fix that right now so we're gonna target the product container but we are going to say target the image inside the product container give it a max site of 200 pixels a width of 100 object fit contain and a margin bottom of 15 pixels okay so i'm going to go ahead and do that and then you can see what this will do is it will actually restrain the image so that it doesn't look crazy big like we saw it before okay now um i thought mohamed elfin says you good yeah we're good dude we're good so now we're going to go ahead and add a background color of white so let's go ahead and add a background color white and then we need to do a few things so a z index of one should allow this to pop up over the top but there's a few things that we need to do in order to get that color to pop and the first things we need to do is actually go ahead and add a few different rules in so we added this these things we have the flex direction and we're going to add in the following here so what i just pasted in was this i added align item center go ahead and save justify content flex and margin 10 pixels padding 20 pixels width 100 max height 400 pixels min width over 100 you guys can go ahead and just copy that and it's going to be completely fine you can break down those values if you want to and sort of digest that as you feel free but what this is going to do is actually going to go ahead and space it out as required and to do so so now we have that and for the price what i'm going to go ahead and do so we've got the product info here so for the product info i'm going to set the height to 100 pixels let's go over here and jump down height to 100 pixels margin bottom of 15 pixels and then i'm going to go ahead and say the price should have so the price should have a margin top of five pixels you can see it's starting to come together a little bit okay starting to come somewhat together the button itself i'm going to go ahead and target so i'm going to go ahead and target that button and say you see guys that that snippet of code did all the difference there so you see we have a normal button here and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and paste in this snippet and i just want you guys to copy this one because it's completely the styles that you need this is the amazon color the background color for amazon now you've got the border one pixel solid right here and it adds a little very very subtle border but it adds a nice little border in there so over here and then you've got the margin top so it slightly pushed it from the top component a little bit we've got a margin top of 10 pixels and a border color and we have a nice little gradient border because it's very subtle but these things make all the difference right and we have some i think it's just some black text okay so it's just some very very simple stuff okay so very black uh just black text and then i'm just gonna double check because i'm a bit paranoid that i haven't actually got the right style here so i'm just gonna be sure there we go yep so everything's good so that is the product okay so we have the product right here and what we're going to do next is we are going to go ahead and go to the go to home and for each of these products right so we have this product right here but for each of these products let me go ahead and go over to home.js so where my home.js and we still have over 1500 people watching so you guys are awesome let's keep this energy high guys so here now what i'm going to say is i'm going to go ahead and target the home container okay so let me go back to your home css and i'm going to do a few rules here and i just want you guys to follow along and you can break this down as you feel free afterwards so the first thing is the surrounding container is the home container for this i'm going to say display flex right so display flex now i'm going to say justify content center then i'm going to say margin left margin right of auto and a max width of 1500 pixels now the reason why this is important is because what this does is what we just did here is let's go ahead and make this full screen you see we actually limit so if it ever goes past a certain screen size it's not going to just keeps like stretching everything to stupid ridiculous lens it's going to actually stop it so now it's very very fluid right so we actually got a lovely donation by jay courtney thomas thank you so much dude we massively appreciate that i'm just going to pull up on the screen right now he says your work is amazing guys i am a paga low code developer but this has really got me back into proper coding exactly the guys that is some british slang being dropped right there proper coding that's what we're talking about this is some fun stuff guys and we have a whole week of this content so if you're excited let us know that's awesome dude thank you so much so yeah we added that little piece of code in which protects us against that max with issue the next thing we are going to go ahead and do so we're going to go back to our code is we're going to go ahead and target that row okay so here i'm going to say the home row so i'm going to target the so if we go into our home component you can see everything sits inside of our home row let's go back into home.css and we can say display flex a set index of one margin that five pixels margin right five pixels save the file and boom so you see that's actually a magic piece of code where that kicks in because what that did is that actually allowed us to then go ahead and it will use up the entire space that it needs to use up and it does all of the things it needs to do but the product itself so the home products we've got home let's go ahead and go inside of here we've got the actual let me go ahead and find this one second guys we've got the home the product itself product info let's go ahead and just want to double check this so imagine now what if we what we do is if we had two products so let's go ahead and go to home let's render two products inside of here and you can see there we go guys so it's actually using up the correct amount of space that we expected to be using up right but you can see this text is actually getting pushed around and we don't actually want that we want it to kind of use up or left align that top container so that is the product info so that most likely means we need to go ahead and target the product info uh correctly so i think what we could do here is we could do text align either left we could either do that nope that hasn't done it or we can actually go back to our product and then we just double check i'm probably missing a piece of code right here but what we can do guys i'm going to show you a little debugging trick so if we go ahead right click inspect and what i can do is i can actually go ahead and check on this component so i can see the product info over here and what i can say is i can say a width of 100 let's go ahead and see what that will do hey there we go so we can see you can give it a width of 100 and give it a width of whatever you want it to at this point but we're going to keep it as what it was for now so here we have two product components um and they're rendering out as required so if i go ahead and add a third look what happens guys it just does it in a very responsive way add a fourth it's gonna figure out it's gonna do that thing it's to make it work in the way that we expect it to so i'm going to add two in here and then what i'm going to go ahead and do is go ahead and go back to our product dot js and here we go so we've got the product info we've got the p tag i'm going to go ahead and change the product info here to i feel like i'm missing a style um but we will figure that one out let's go back to your product okay we're all good so we have these two products which is awesome let's go back to our home and we've got this too over here and basically i'm just going to populate these as we as we accept as as we saw it previously so we've got the three products down here and for this one we had let's go ahead and we had one product down here so now you can see it's somewhat along the lines right so it's somewhat along the lines of getting there but you see the background color is not exactly white okay so background color is not exactly white and that is going to be a bit of a problem okay so we want to kind of change that right now so what we're going to do to change that is we're going to go to our app.css or actually i think we've done it in index.css yeah we've done it in index.css let's go to our index.css and inside the body what i'm going to say someone say give it a background color of this right here now this is the amazon background it's gray okay so as soon as i do this can you guys see the difference it makes it's all about these subtle differences when it comes to coding in frontend development guys so that just by adding a gray background you can see it actually makes it super super clean and you have this very very nice finish okay so it's very very nice finish at the end of that when we go ahead and add that slight change now i'm going to close that one and let's go back so here now obviously the final app doesn't look like this right so i mean everything looks a bit different but how do we pass in different values to each of these components so in order to do that the way that we're going to do it is we're going to go inside of our header so i actually want to fix something quickly because right now the home row itself so let's go ahead and check we've got the home row i just want to check so home row max width width of 100 and the image is taking up 100 yep we've done that okay so here we go so for the home product okay i guess we're good so okay so that's fine so we've got this right here we've got the home row itself we've got the home product and we have the home product p tag we have the operator image okay i guess we're good so inside of the product itself then what we're going to do is we want to basically customize each one of these and have it so that it's essentially going to be different for each of these props okay so different for each of these right here so that we're going to use props for that so i saw somebody say different code guys this was actually written by us so this is all our code um we're gonna go over to product and now guys what you can do here is you can accept something called props right now props in es6 what we can do is we can put these curly braces and this means we break apart the object that we pass in and what we're going to do here is i'm going to pass in something as follows so i'm going to say you have a title you have an image you have a price and you have a rating okay so let's go ahead and save it let's go back to home and then what we're going to say is here we have the title let's go ahead and say is the lean start so the lien start up the price let's go ahead and say is 19 let's go ahead and just exaggerate say 29.99 and then we have the image now the image for the lean stop was the one that we had earlier which was i believe it was this one um so that's actually rendered really ugly so let's go ahead and do this let me save it so we've got the image and then we also had the rating and the rating what i'm going to say is let's just give it a five star rating now okay so four what we're going to do is here we are going to say so now we don't want to use a hardcoded value we actually want to use the one that we passed in so here i'm going to say use the title and what this is doing guys i just want to show you so you guys can see that this is the product where i called it right so this is where i called the product and i passed in a value here now this gets used so you see we destructure it over here okay then we actually go ahead and we use that value right here so and in the title so you can see this is the sort of way that we use props and actually allows us to make it extremely uh reusable and efficient this is why i personally love react and it's one of the reasons why react is taken off so well so i'm going to go ahead and create this again so now we have the title pulling in here so you can see now these ones aren't showing a tile because i've only passed props to the first one okay which makes sense so the second one we don't want it to be a 1999 i want this one to say emma uh price so this one's gonna say price save it and then here rather than doing one star i'm going to show you guys a nice little trick okay now the way you do this is here what we're going to say is oh damn dude we just got a huge donation that's what i'm talking about guys we got a 20 donation from xero.js background to amazon clone you guys are amazing much love and respect great job proud of you i know you deserve more but i'm a student rico from usa guys that's insane we love you guys and i appreciate you guys and i can see it so it's early for some of you guys so that's insane i really think you guys who are here watching this early in the morning you're spending your time well keep fired up if you need to get up stay hydrated i'm gonna have a drink of water quite now because it is quite intense doing this but we have over 1600 people let's go ahead and keep the energy fired up guys so we have the price which is pulling in so now it says 29.99 over here but what we can do instead is we can go ahead and have these curly brackets and say array we pass in the ratings what it's doing is creating an empty array for the rating and we're going to say fill and we're going to say map and then here what we do is so ignore pretty much you don't need to know what this means but you do underscore i right you underscore i and this has to be in a parenthesis and you do an arrow function like so right so an arrow function like so and basically pop in a p tag so this you can go ahead and copy right you go ahead and copy this and now you can see that it rendered out three right so i actually rented out three different things so if i go ahead and do product oops i'll go ahead and do product dot css god damn it right so product.css i'm going to go ahead and target and start the product rating so here i'm going to say product rating and i'm going to go ahead and do product rating and here i'm just going in order to get those stars in the line i'm going to say display flex because by default when you do display flex it drops it into a row so now guys this is really cool now because if we go back to our home and we see if i change the rating to a three you can see look at that it changed to a three now guys if that's pretty cool let me know this is a clear demonstration of how props work so you got four and if i do five you got five stars i mean if we do ten i mean you're going to get ten stars so it works pretty nice okay so five there we go now what we're doing is we're going back to the product and for example here we don't want to use the image the hardcoded image instead we're going to use the image that we pass in so we can pop it in there and there we go so now you're seeing only this the ones that we pass in to um all these stuff that we pass in is actually where it gets rendered so that's why you see these empty ones over here now for the final one we have this button over here so this is add button we don't actually need anything else so that's pretty good at this point right we're also going to accept an id but we'll come back to that later right so for now we're not too fast as to accepting an id but i'm just going to go ahead and add that in for now okay so with that said now all we're going to do is i've actually got some products here so i'm going to go ahead and copy and paste these products so these are the ones that you guys saw earlier this is just pretty much a product and i'm just going to assume that some products have a unique id okay so this is just a random number it's a random number and you can hear you can see here it's got another one we've got kenwood and we've just got some description a price rating and an image so you guys can pause the video watch this and just go ahead and copy this as you need to when you need to i'm going to go ahead and do the same thing for these three products underneath so let's go ahead and do the same thing for that so again i'm going to go ahead and show you guys a full screen view of this so you can see it and i'm going to go ahead and hide our faces like that so it makes it easier so you can pause the video copy that and use it as you feel free or as you need to let's go ahead and save it and i love this dude so i can't actually see the names on facebook so i'm really really sorry about that but this is a really nice comment here thank you so much because i think react is super easy to understand especially with sunny's explanations thank you dude like thank you honestly that's uh really really i massively appreciate that really really awesome um okay so now we're gonna do is we're gonna go to your home uh let's go back over here and i'm gonna go and add a final product to this final product at the bottom is going to be this one right here so it says samsung there we go um okay lost track of my code okay we're good so now you can see guys we've got the lean startup we've got this right here the kenwood we've got the three things over here and then we have this as such right now obviously this one right here it actually has some more information so i'm going to go ahead and actually copy the one that i have i have a full product description where as you can see the one that i passed in doesn't have a full product description so we save it now you can see there we go so if you are following along and you're actually at this point let me know right now guys because this is really really awesome to be able to show and share this with you guys and i just love the fact that so many of you guys are watching this is water by the way so a lot of you guys are asking what is and honestly it's unreal how many people we have today so and you guys are all sticking with us the retention is high this is awesome guys let's carry on right so we have the home row um over here now we pretty much just actually went ahead and dominated that front page so i'm going to go ahead and just show you guys what we just built fairly quickly guys so we actually have this amazing front page right now right now this is insane like i'm like come on let's be real guys amongst all of the connection issues that we suffered everything that we faced i mean we actually conquered this and overcame and we went ahead and built this front page pretty quick in my opinion like that was that didn't take that long right so this is really really awesome really powerful and i think it just shows you how powerful react can truly be okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to build the next page now the next page is the basket so we want to build this page right so this page is where all of the exciting interesting stuff happens right so now because we have all this basket removing functionality it's very dynamic it's very optimized and it can do a lot of stuff okay so what we're going to do now is we're going to in order to have two pages in a website you need something called react router okay now what react router does is it allows you so notice how on this website when i'm actually see if we notice the top url when i click the basket it says forward slash checkout okay so i'm not sure if you guys can see that but i'm pointing towards this part over here so it says forces checkout okay now um when i click the back you see when i click the amazon logo it goes to the home page and when i click this it goes to four says checkout in order to get that functionality we just need to introduce something called react rule and guys just wanted you guys to know that i see a lot of you guys asking do i need to finish it by a certain time no honestly all of the homework all of this stuff here as long as you guys are able to deliver before the end of the challenge that is amazing guys i mean that's all you need to do to be a part of the prize draw but guys if you go ahead and follow all of this stuff then you're going to get the serious value in and you're actually going to be able to land jobs from this stuff so make sure you go ahead and do that stuff so let's go ahead and jump back into the code so here what we need is app.js and let's go ahead and do the following so now we are going to go ahead and introduce react router so in order to introduce react rear we need to go ahead and install react root dom so let's pull up our terminal with command j i'm going to go ahead and add another terminal so we have this right here make sure you're cd into the correct directory and i'm going to do mpmi for install so npm install react rear dom so you guys just want to do the same command and that will go ahead and get you to the correct uh and that will go ahead and install react rear dom for yourself right now i just saw somebody says why is he repeating the same project this is not the same project we have full payment processing in this project on days two and three so stay tuned guys um okay so until in order to implement this what we do now is we pretty much wrap our app so we need to import a bunch of things at the top so you guys can go ahead and do the same thing you can import this from the top and then what we are going to do is we are going to go over to the return and we're going to wrap everything inside of a router okay so i'm going to go ahead and wrap the literally wrap the entire app inside of something called a router like so there we go okay now what you need to do is once that's up and done then what we are going to do is now right now we just render the header and the home regardless right we want to render it based on the route that we're in okay so what we're going to do is we're going to say switch right now switch and programming is usually when you have different cases or sort of statements right so what i'm going to do is i'll pop everything inside of here and then what i'm going to say is you define specific routes so the first room i'm going to define is when we're at the home page so this is how you do it you say let's go ahead and get rid of this so when i'm at this route render the header and the home component okay so if i do that now so you see i'm at the forward slash route and by default it falls back to this if i go to abc this will always get hit if it doesn't match anything so this is always your default route so this is what we call the home page room so right now you can see at the home page room it's very very clear and very very good okay and it works as we need it but what if we want the checkout page root how do we implement that so i'm going to go ahead and copy the same snippet but i'm going to say checkout now just to exaggerate this what we do is on the checkout page we're not going to have a home component we're going to say instead a huge h1 which is i am a checkout smash the like button save and let's see if this works and if it does work i mean listen to the code right so let's go ahead and go to the forward slash checkout and boom i'm a checkout smash that like button if you're enjoying this content i thought that was smooth af if qazi was here right now dude i think he'll be proud of that one that was a um yeah i mean it's just a bit of fun guys yeah but you guys can see that that is essentially how we use react rio okay so you can see at the top we pretty much have it says force checkout okay so let's go ahead and get rid of that and it goes to the homepage you see that all right so that's going to be super super easy okay so like to implement you see that's how we did it and now you can add as many routes as you want but make sure your default route is at the bottom otherwise it never gets listened to and it gets picked up okay and that's going to be a problem so with that said now what we're going to do is we're going to create the checkout component so instead of this i am a checkout smash the like button now what we're going to do is we are going to do or somebody said shoot that horn you know what let's shoot that damn horn damn dude does it like it's louder than i thought for my head right so now what is going to create the checkout component okay so here we're going to go ahead and create the checkout component now it's going to freak out it's going to freak out because we haven't built that component so as soon as i click save so yeah whoa whoa well you don't have a checkout component so let's go ahead and do checkout.js also i just saw something interesting from someone i will bring this up in a sec but we're going to create checkout on the rfce and then here we're going to do our standard bem setup so we're going to say class name check out and say import import check out css save the file and there we go okay there we go um save oh god what's happening here dude okay save and then if i do h1 smash the like button right so now it doesn't work oh it's working there we go all right so if i go back to home uh no sorry not home if i go back to app.js so let's go back to oh i actually need to create that checkout the css so check out css like so there we go okay so if i go ahead and create this and then we have this and let's go back to app.js and now guys you see where it was freaking out you can go to the end press ctrl spacebar and it says auto import so that will actually go ahead and drop this in for us save the file and we're back okay now this is a really good point you see we use header in both of these things so what we can do here if it's used in both we want to render it regardless of what we're in now we can basically go ahead and chuck this outside of the switch right so we can say render the header regardless and then based on the route render the checkout or the home so if i go ahead and save it you see nothing change but the header always gets rendered i'll go forward let's check out hey look at that you heard the page smash the like button damn it dude that's number two i think that was pretty smooth right now we have so you see that's actually a really good point though because somebody went ahead and dropped this in the chat and i think it's a really really good point to emphasize on if you have the uh header being repeated you can actually go ahead and pop it outside if you need to and that will go ahead and save you a lot of hassle and effort okay so that's going to save you a bunch of headache so let's go ahead and create the checkout page okay so the checkout page what i'm gonna do now is go and ahead and we have two sections of the checkout page we have the checkout left right so let's go over here and let's add something to our basket we have the checkout left and we'll check out right okay so check out left and check out right so check out left when i say that i'm referring to this and when i'm referring to the right side i'm referring to this okay so that's exactly what we want to do so now here i'm going to say div div check out underscore underscore left like so we still have 16 000 people got um you know uh 1600 people sorry it's amazing guys you guys are incredible like i can't believe the energy and commitment from you guys honestly it's so so powerful and it's motivating as hell for me so that is it's amazing to see you guys are still here all right let's go back to the image tag so let's go ahead and do our image and here i'm going to say that this has a class name of image sorry checkout ad okay so this is going to be checkout ad now for the source what i'm going to do is i'm going to go ahead and drop in the amazon link okay so inside of here what i'm going to do is drop in the amazon link so this is a this is actually this banner right here so this is a banner obviously this is too big right now so let's go ahead and make that a bit smaller so what i'm going to do is go to checkout.css and go ahead and target this and say for that ad go ahead and make the width 100 and the margin bottom so underneath it a margin of 10 pixels okay so let's go ahead and do that and that's going to make that a little bit cleaner and then going back to our code let's go back to checkout.js and then we're going to go ahead and do um so underneath now what we're going to say is we're going to have a div and this div is going to have so underneath we're going to say div and this div is going to have a h2 which is going to have a check it's going to be h2 and it's going to have check out underscore underscore title and this is going to say your shopping basket okay your shopping basket save it you can see it says your shopping basket and then we are going to have all of the products that you have inside your basket get rendered out okay so this sort of stuff is going to happen now i'll explain how we do that in a sec but let's focus on the right hand side of the screen for now so let's go ahead and jump on the right hand side of the screen um so let's go ahead and do this right here so div dot checkout i'm just going to just go right like this okay now in here we're going to render the subtotal okay so this is going to be part of your homework the subtotal but we have a lot of stuff to do before then um and thank you dude somebody said never thought uh react real is so easy sonny it was amazing explaining that thank you guys uh that is that means a lot when i see stuff like that it's very motivating and it pushes you to do more so check out right so you can see this stuff over here on the right we're going to go ahead and build that on that side of the screen so that's going to be a subtotal component so right now i'm just going to say i'm just going to put h2 here saying the oops h2 saying the subtotal go here we'll go here save that and you can see the subject so you see right now it doesn't look like like how we expect it to be looking so inside of checkout what i'm going to go ahead and do is actually go ahead and say the following i'm going to say checkout display flex padding of 20 pixels background color of white and a height of max content and the reason why this has happened is because remember we had that left and right the right has this um the subtotal where the subtotal will go here and the left had the image and the rest of the stuff so the h2s shopping basket and so forth now underneath the checkout the goal here is to have all of the baskets uh all of the basket items so here i'm going to have a basket item being rendered out and then so forth loads of them like that and that is basically going to be resembled in the fact of what we see here so just as we see it here is basically how we expect to go ahead and see it in our code okay but we're a few steps away from getting to that point just yet so um what we're gonna do next is actually go ahead and target the checkout title okay so the checkout title we are going to go ahead and give that the following code we're going to say that is a margin right of 10 pixels and that has padding 10 pixels and a border bottom of one pixel solid like grey let's go ahead and add that in so you see that actually added in this nice little line so if i go ahead and comment this out for a sec come back bring it back you see pops in that nice little line okay now i love this comment i've seen this a few times it says i'm amazed guys i'm watching this like a movie and you know what guys i'm actually kind of jealous because like i wish i wish i wish i wish when we were learning when i was learning coding that we had this kind of content uh because it just it's just like i find it the best way to learn let me know what you guys think i mean i always find the practical stuff where you can actually go ahead and get your hands into the nittygritty that is going to allow you to go ahead and absolutely crush it so there we have the shopping master okay so now guys what we want to do is we have this um also i want to be able to be able to click this link so you see i want to click this amazon link and actually take me back to the home page so what we can do here is we can go to our header component and i'm going to show you guys how easy it is we're using react rear just to go ahead and do that so this is the image for the logo so this is the header logo and what we need to do here is simply do a link and you see it says auto import from react to router dom so this is the import statement that you need but all you need to do is do a link and put the image inside of this link okay and i'm going to go ahead and say specify a to property and this is going to be go back to the home page okay so now you can see it's become a clickable link so as soon as i click it boom we go back to the home page that's awesome that's slick and that was easy to implement guys yeah so you see that are super easy to implement and what i'm going to show you is also another very easy thing to do and that lies over here so let's go ahead and well i want it to happen at the basket as well so when i click this basket it takes us to that basket page so as you guys might guess it we go here we type in link like so and we surround everything inside of it so let's go ahead and dash everything inside of it let's go ahead and do this link two and let's do four slash checkout save it and now guys if i click this boom it takes me to check out doom fix this everything works right now um somebody says the website has no ssl when we deployed to firebase it will have ssl so yeah you can you can recheck that one dude because it does it will have ssl um yeah but you can pretty much see now we have the shopping basket and the amazon and guys the beautiful thing is there's no refresh all right so there's no refresh it's super super quick and that's why we love reactor inside of react okay so carrying on strong still over 1500 people love and appreciate you guys uh this energy is insane right now um let's keep on going guys so so let's go ahead and now what we're going to do is we're going to go to our shopping basket and now i guess the next step naturally guys is what we're going to do is i'm first i'm going to create the subtotal component okay so the subtotal component let's firstly go ahead and do that because that will make our life a little bit easier for the homework let's go to our checkout component and let's see here so we have the subtotal we'll go ahead so let's go ahead and make a subtotal component so here what i'm going to do is i'm going to say sub total like so okay get rid of this save and let's go back let's do subtotal subtotal.js rfce and let's go ahead and pop that out and then what i'm going to do is for this class i'm going to give it a class name of subtotal save the file go back up here and say import subtotal dot css save the file pull it back and let's go ahead and code this up so what i'm going to use is actually a really nice called react currency format so in order to install this it's very simple guys all you need to do is go ahead and go open up your terminal so command j is my little shortcut do npm i do react currency format this will go ahead and import um let's go ahead and import the uh module into our platform into our project and it will it will allow us to use it and the reason why i love this guys is because it allows you to really easily actually go ahead and show money okay so it's may sound sleep it shows you rendering money is always the simplest thing okay so this is going to make it super easy to go ahead and do that okay so what we're going to do now is and if you guys are interested in getting exciting uh getting excited because we are going to be covering react context api so if you guys have been wanting to know about react or redux then let me know in the comment section right now because redux is on fire and i'm going to show you guys how to go ahead and learn all of that beautiful stuff with the react context api okay so get excited for that let me know in the comment section and it's completely fine if you are behind guys you can take your time you can watch us back you can pause the video you can spend 6 7 10 hours 50 hours doesn't matter just spend your time afterwards and you can go ahead and do this afterwards okay so um let's go back to subtotal okay so now what we're gonna do is we're gonna go ahead and import it at the top of the file so let's go ahead and import the currency format from react currency format like so and now what we're going to do is here guys i'm going to copy a big snippet and i'm going to explain what we're doing here okay so i want you guys to do the same thing i want you to copy this snippet and then break it down okay because it can be a lot to digest a lot to swallow so let's go back over to uh okay i'm gonna say here's zero items there we go okay and then here i'm also gonna say zero okay now let's go to our checkout page let's render our subtotal by doing auto import which imports it at the top of the page save it and what we can see now is it says get okay so let's go ahead and actually fix some of this so this right now let's say a value of zero and this also is freaking out because it says cannot resolve subtotal.css so let's go ahead and make that file subtotal.css save it i see so many people asking about folder structures guys don't worry about the folder structures just get the content down and that is going to be much more important than having fancy folders okay so screw all that stuff focus on the actual learning and everything behind it okay so right so you saw that worked and you can see we have this subtotal over here on the right hand side so we want to get that looking like that okay we want it to look like this okay so how do we get it look like that let's go and style this thing so let's go back to our subtotal.js and here it's where let's quickly explain a few of these things so we'll come to render text in a second but here we're saying decimal scale of two so go to your t two decimal places so like for example here two decimal places the value so this is the currency this is the amount getting passed in here so this is going to be part of your homework guys so this is going to be part of the homework all right i want you guys to try and figure this one out see how you guys can implement that display type is text we can leave that thousand separate so if you've got like six thousand pounds or something let's go ahead and add like a silly number of like expensive products here so let's go ahead and add like a few ipads and then you can see at the top it says 4 000 because we've added this styles and separated true the prefix here is not going to be pounds we're going to use dollars because you know most of the team uses dollars so let's go ahead and stick with dollars um and then what we are going to have is the render text so this is what actually comes out of the text right so this is what actually gets rendered onto the screen so at this point we can ignore the value here but this is the crucial part so it focus on the p tag and the small tag the p tag is essentially where we say subtotal the number of items and the value okay so here this is the value that we actually get past we pass in here so it's actually going to be used as a prop here so this is also a part of the homework all right so this is part of the homework right so pay attention to the homework guys because it's going to be juicy okay and i want you guys to do well in this homework and it's going to be a nice little challenge actually for you guys and you can see the homework is dynamic so as i remove items from the basket as i remove things it updates the number of items and it updates the price okay so it does all of that stuff and it updates everything okay so we have this over here we have the small tag okay now this is just an input type because it says the order contains the check order contains a gift obviously ours doesn't look like this right now so i'm going to go ahead and style it and then we can move on okay so the first thing i'm going to do right now is go to oops i'm going to go to we've got the checkout we've got the sub tool and then here so after this we're going to have a proceed to checkout button okay so and this is going to be a react router um and this is gonna have sorry it's gonna be a button which says proceed to check out uh so so let's go ahead and drop this in underneath so here proceed to check out okay now let's go ahead and make this um let's go ahead and make this an absolute beautiful looking subtotal form let's go to our subtool and what we're going to do is we're going to add in the following rules so i'm going to explain every single one of these in a sec so we're doing display flex flex direction column yeah justify content space between width of 300 pixels high of 100 pixels padding 20 pixels which can give it a bit more space around it background color of it's going to be like a white i think it's like an off gray okay then you've got a border with a nice little color behind it and a border radius which is slightly rounded okay so there you go as soon as i save that look at the difference it made like just by making that slight little change we get a beautiful looking um we have a beautiful looking ui already right so let's go ahead and let's target the gift next so let's go to subtotal.js and here we have the subtotal gift so we had it here so i'm going to go ahead and target that subtotal gift i'm going to say display flex and align items in the center because you see right now it's kind of very subtle but it's actually off so you see right now where i'm pointing it's actually slightly off okay so we're gonna go ahead and fix that so let's go back to subtotals.js and i'm going to go ahead and do back to css sorry go ahead and do this okay so this is awesome let's click save and then you can see it it went and aligned it centrally now i'm going to go ahead and target the input field i'm going to say give it a margin right five pixels so it slightly pushed it away and then i want to get the amazon button styling down so it looks like the amazon button and hey zombies as clean as sunny's hairstyle thank you dude um so subtle and we're going to target the button inside i'm going to say background of this beautiful amazon orange and we're going to say back border radius right here and we're also going to say a width of 100 pixels a height of 30 pixels and then we are going to say um border margin top border color and remember that's just like uh gradient that we've shown previously and the color is the black text so as soon as i hit save guys as soon as i hit save if this looks amazing smash that thumbs up button if you really haven't because guys if we're all part of this community let's help share this knowledge to as many people as we possibly can save it and look how clean that ui is like i mean it's i always like even as an experienced developer sometimes like you come back to these moments where you're like damn like subtle changes make the entire thing look different like it it completely changes your perspective on this stuff so looks really really clean now with that said guys we are going to actually go ahead and i saw a question asking about react brewing and history object yes we will be doing that stay tuned for days two and three and we're going to cover plenty of that stuff now guys i want to get to the juicy stuff okay so just want to take a second here so i know it's been quite an intense build so far but this is where it gets a little bit intense and we're basically going to crush this next bit so if you need to stand up stretch out have some like you know take a few breaths just give yourself a little bit of a break right have some water i'm gonna have a quick break and let's crush the next section which is the react context api okay we're gonna kill this section today because this is gonna be the big juicy part of this build and once we get through this part it's gonna allow us to have this amazing functionality to go ahead and add and remove items from our basket okay so you can go ahead and add items to the basket so let's go ahead and see we can add items to the basket we can remove items and we can do loads of stuff as such okay so this is going to be awesome and this is going to be part of today's um implementation okay so what i think actually is actually yeah okay let's go ahead and do it okay so what we have now is the react context api now we have all of our apps right here okay now whenever i add something to the basket i essentially need a data layer to push some to push that item into the basket so let's pull out the whiteboard okay so i don't know if you guys can actually see me i need to go ahead and share my screen let's go ahead and pull out the whiteboard okay so let's imagine we have a few components so let's go ahead we've got the header okay we've got the header we've got the body okay so this is the header of the app and this is the body and then here are the products right so this is one product this is another product this is another product okay and this is a fourth product so we've got four products in a row right now each one has an add to basket button okay so this is like an add to basketball and add to basketball and add to basket button and so forth okay then we have our little nice basket icon at the top okay so i don't know this is like a little basket okay so what i'm saying now is here what we're going to have is essentially an add to basket button okay so it's going to be an add to basket button and basically what we want to do is we want it so when i click this button we're essentially going to push oops we're essentially going to push an item into let's just call it the data layer okay so let's call this the data layer the data layer and what i'm referring to here is actually the react context api okay or it's similar to the redux pattern so many of you may have heard of redux or wanted to learn redux so basically anytime i press any of these buttons it's going to push the item that the button belongs to into the data right now why is this so powerful it's because once it lives in this data layer what we can do is we can essentially go ahead and just put it into any component that we need we can go ahead and pull it into the basket we can go ahead and pull it into the uh into this component for example we can pull it wherever we need it okay so this is going to be crucial for your homework and this is going to be crucial for example once we push the item into the data then for example when we go into the my basket page or checkout page we can see what items are inside the data there so this is going to be why we need the reactor there so let's go ahead and actually go ahead i just want to see i just got a message um on skype one second maybe because he's actually rejoining us guys so what we're going to do now is we're actually going to go ahead and add the uh prerequisites for the context api so now guys what we're going to do is we're gonna create the state provider so here are a few steps which i recommend you don't stress over too much okay just follow my steps follow what we need to do and you will get things working in the way they need to work okay and once we get to that point you can understand how they work afterwards just follow what i'm doing right now and everything will work super smooth okay so now what we're going to do is we're going to go to state provider so let's go ahead and add state providers let's go ahead and do state provider.js dot js and you guys can pretty much copy what i'm about to write here okay so here i'm going to copy out a snippet now this snippet right here pretty much it's just a few different import statements okay so this is a few different import statements um that we have right here and then we have this is essentially creating the data so this basically prepares to say prepares the data there okay we'll make this a little bit bigger prepares the data layer so we're going to prepare the data there and here we basically have um one second so here we have the essentially the preparation of the dialogue and then here guys we don't need to essentially know what this does like but what but i'll explain this in in a different video or maybe in the comments afterwards but all this is essentially doing is basically this will wrap our app okay this will this what we have right here is basically setting everything up and it's going to wrap our app and provide the data layer to every component inside of our app that's it okay that's all it's doing so we don't need to know about all this fancy stuff all you can do at this point is just copy this out okay just copy it out that's all we need to know and this is how we're actually going to be able to pull information right right so pull information from the data layer now i can see some people asking like should we actually go ahead and copy and paste and things like that guys trust me when i say this i've taught so many students me and kazi everyone else has taught students like trust me it's all about pattern recognition do not be freaked out by the stuff okay i want you guys to copy this out and you can actually go ahead and focus on how we use this and then the sort of implementation this stuff won't be as important okay so we're going to click save and now what we're going to do is we're going to go over to our index.js and here what we're going to do is we are going to go ahead and wrap our component okay so we're going to wrap our component in something called the state provider so i'm going to say state provider and we're basically going to go ahead and close this like so and it's going to freak out because we don't have these two things we don't have the initial state and we don't have this weird thing called the reducer okay and um this is a really good comment by hajira she says so that every comment a component can get access to the data layer yes so this is why we actually want the um this is why we want a data so that every single component can have access to that data which means that if we push information in then we can basically go ahead and pull information out wherever we are inside of our app okay so this is why we actually need to go ahead and use that so with that said we have that pretty much working um but we need to have these two things the initial state is what does the data look like daily look like in the beginning and the reducer is how we sort of manipulate with the data how do we play with the data so what we need to do now is create something called a reducer so let's go ahead and create reducer.js now don't worry about what reducer means as such um it's just think of it as the data layer right so in this case what we need to do is create the initial state right so we're going to have a user at some point but for now we're going to leave it blank but initially in the data layer we're going to start with a empty basket okay so we're going to have an empty basket to begin with and then what we're going to do guys is we're going to create a something called a reducer okay so this initial state remember we saw this earlier we actually used it here so i can go ahead and import this into and we've actually go ahead and we've fixed the first part so the second part is actually getting this reducer now what is a reducer right so a reducer is essentially when we have this data layer right so when we have this data that we spoke about earlier a reducer is essentially how we are able to you see this arrow right here how are we able to actually dispatch this action into the data layer okay so when i click and add to basket button so when i click a button like this how does it then go and dispatch the action into the data layer and how do i actually go ahead and pull it right so the pulling part is easy but pushing into it is where the reducer plays a very important part okay so here when we click add to basket we essentially all we need to know is what product we're actually adding to the basket and we're going to shoot it up into the data and it's pretty much going to sit inside there there up here okay so let's go ahead and head back to our code and what we're going to do now is and i love this joshua thomas still says he is still pumped right that's the energy that we're talking about guys right so what we're going to do is we're going to go back to our reducer and here what we are going to say so the context api and redux are not the same thing but they are the same pattern okay so both use this idea of a store like um a basically a global store for your application and then you basically have this pattern of dispatching actions into this store and the reducer just listens and says okay you just updated a basket all right i know what to do okay you just removed the knife from the basket i know what to do don't worry like that's what the reducer is doing okay so at this point in order to write the reducer we need to do the following so we need to say const reducer and it takes two things it takes a state and that's the state of the application and then it says the action okay now the action is what are you trying to do are you trying to add to the basket you're trying to remove from the basket what are you trying to do here okay so here what i'm gonna say is it takes a switch right now the switch is based on the action dot type now i will explain this and everything will make sense with practice so do not freak out guys okay so here we're going to say case and i'm going to say add to basket okay add to basket like this and then here i'm going to say return right now this basically means whenever we receive and add to basket action so remember we talked about this earlier so um oh damn it i've lost that snippet okay nevermind remember we spoke about when we sort of would press the add to basket button so every time i would press the add to basket button it would dispatch an action with this type add to basket okay now when we so the reducer imagine the reducer is just something that's always listening for for a dispatch or something like that it's always just listening okay and what we're going to do here is we're going to say return and what we're doing is we're returning whatever the state originally was but we're going to change the basket and we're going to say the basket should now be whatever the basket currently was so whatever it currently was plus whatever we actually decided to add so the action dot item that you passed inside of the action okay so this will make a lot of sense shortly okay um um okay so so now what we are going to do is we are going to go ahead and actually export the reducer so we are going to go ahead and export the reducer and we also want to have something called a default state okay so default state so here i'm going to go ahead and say default return state now guys again this you don't need to really know exactly what this does but at this point we need to go ahead and hook it up okay so go up to this reducer go ahead and connect control spacebar auto import done okay so guys all you need to do is just copy those steps copy those steps and everything will be okay and you should get to the point where the state provided is not defined so we need to go ahead and import the state provider as such so save that and guys at this point if i go ahead and do this well now we need to connect our add to basket to basically go ahead and push something inside of the data layer okay so let's go ahead go to our product and now inside of our product when we click this add to basket button we want to dispatch and add to item add to basket object okay so let's go ahead and go to our product so product.js and what i'm going to say is when i click the button so when i unclick i'm going to say um add to basket and this is going to be a function that i'm going to write up here so i'm going to say const add to basket like this okay now this will take no arguments and all it will do is it dispatches an action okay so here we're going to dispatch some action into the data layer and basically the goal here is saying dispatch the item into the data layer so we have it okay so just copy and paste it if you need to do that okay now what we're going to do here guys is in order to pull information from the data layer i showed you previously in the uh when we were setting things up inside of the state provider that this bottom part i said you don't have to understand what it does is it's going to essentially allow you to pull information from the data so here what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and say const basket like this dispatch and we're going to say use state value so i'm going to explain what this does and basically what we have here is we have the state and we have a dispatch okay now the state we're not too interested in right now so we can pretty much ignore that this is basically the state of the global store and here we have the dispatch okay so the dispatch is going to be how we manipulate the data so here what i'm going to say is dispatch and then i'm going to say dispatch an item dispatching object into the data layer so this dispatch is like a gun right so it essentially allows you to shoot into the data layer so like and shoot an action like we said like that arrow that we showed previously um that's what we're going to basically be doing here so i'm going to say type and here we're going to say add to basket okay and then the actual item that we're going to push into the data is going to be an item with the id from here it's going to be the title is going to be the title that we pushed in over at the top the image is going to be the image that we passed in as a prop the price is going to be the price that we passed in as a prop and also the rating is going to be passed in as the rating at the top okay so what this does now guys is we essentially are going to dispatch and add to basket action now the way that we check that this works okay is we open up our inspector we go here if i click on add to basket nothing shows okay so let's go over to our reducer let's go and make sure that i like to always do a console.log so let's go ahead and do console.log and i like to always dispatch the action okay so now if i do add to basket whoa we got an add to basket action it dispatched this type of action so add two baskets so i picked it up in this case statement and then it said item and you see what we're doing here is we actually went ahead and said so i'm just going to go ahead and make this a bit bigger for you guys so it says change the basket so that the basket is now whatever the basket currently was plus the action.item and the item is this stuff right here so this will push the basket into this will push the item into our basket so now we should have the um now we should have the actual item inside of our basket so how can we check very simple thing we can do we can pretty much go ahead and this is our state right here we can destructure and we can say hang on get me the basket outside of the state and all you guys gotta do is chuck a console log and say something like this you can say this is the basket and put something like this and now guys look what happens so you see it says this is the basket on many renders and we can go ahead and add to basket and whoa we had an item in the basket so now we have this one item in the basket okay okay that's cool i'll go ahead and add a second item whoa okay now we've got two items in the basket add a third now we've got three items in the basket you see like this is really powerful stuff and like we're basically all we're doing is we're pushing into the data layer all right so um so you can use i saw why is he using the function instead of arrow yeah you can use arrows you can use functions you can do those whatever you want guys but yeah you can pretty much see at this point you have the three items inside of the basket okay and we are almost at the finish line guys so stay with me okay we're almost at the finish line um for today's session so if you guys are pumped up and you are ready to do that last final push i know it's been a while i know it's been a while but come on guys there's huge prizes here the prize even if you didn't win is essentially getting that final job that you deserve okay as a developer so stay with me guys let's bring up the energy and let's put finish strong to that finish line okay so the fi what i want to do now is essentially you see at the top over here where we have this right oh god oops where we have here right we have the zero now what i want to do is when we add an item to that basket we want that to dynamically update i want this to dynamically update like this like this is the this is the actual app it dynamically updates right so this is going to be really really cool to actually go ahead and implement so we need to actually go ahead and implement this um so let's go ahead and do that so i love it i can see the energy coming up this is awesome right so let's go ahead and go to our header component and what we're going to do inside of our header component is we are going to go inside to the top of the function go to header.js and as i explained previously guys we can pretty much go ahead and do the following we can use that magic use date value to pull information this will be the state right so we can go ahead and import this so remember you need to go ahead and import this at the top and then you've got the state and you've got dispatch okay now we may not use the dispatch in this case we don't actually need the dispatch but i'm going to leave it in there to make it simple for you guys now here we have the zero okay so we hard coded as zero here but this is how easy and insane the powerful the react context api is what we can do is we can get the basket okay we can get the basket like so grab the basket and what we can do is we can scroll down go here and guys all i need to do at this point is say basket dot length that's it that's it guys do that and what i would recommend is that you put a question mark here and this is called optional chaining and what this would mean is that if you for any reason don't have the correct value or basket becomes undefined due to an error it won't freak out it just will gracefully terminate okay or gracefully handle the error okay so let's go ahead and add this now guys i think if we go ahead and click add to basket we should see update in the corner but you know things can go wrong things can go insanely crazy everything's not being on our sides i'm going to make this a bit bigger and let's just go ahead and pump up the crowd and let's get everyone sort of anticipated because i think if we've done this right boom guys there we go can you see that if i go ahead and click this in we're getting this is the number of items inside that basket guys so that is insane that is awesome it's working okay like it's working we go ahead click it in and we have the shopping basket stuff here so this is really really powerful okay this is really really powerful stuff now what say guys do you want to do so i'm going to leave this down to you guys i'm going to ask you guys a question now so today what we can do is i can either set you your homework here and we can build out the remainder of this stuff so we can build out the remainder of the shopping basket list right so we can set the homework and we can build out this list or shall we set the homework for today and that should i show you how the solution to the homework and then we carry on with the shopping basket today you guys let me know okay i want to know what you guys think at this point go ahead and let me know in the comments right now what you guys want to do do you want to build this shopping basket today this sort of this check out page functionality where you have even removed from basket or should we go ahead and set today's homework and wrap up there and pretty much we can carry on tomorrow in tomorrow's day two of the build okay so we have a lot of people saying set homework some people saying set homework re uh redo so um as in redo and carry on with the shopping basket somebody says let's finish the game continue yeah basket to homework homework homework continue okay so we have a mix here guys okay so right so what i will say guys is because it's been a huge dream okay it's been a huge dream if you guys are super excited tomorrow i'm going to show you how to build that lovely shopping basket that we saw here okay so that lovely shopping basket that we saw over here i'm going to show you guys how to go ahead and build that right but today what their homework is right so every day if you guys want to be a part if you want to be in this to win the prize that we've set what we ask is that you go ahead and finish the homework and we submitted the homework yesterday which was the portfolio but today what we're going to be doing the challenge for you guys is quite simple okay so challenge for you guys is pretty simple and what we're going to be doing is we are going to focus on the following for today's homework okay so the homework for today is can you guys can you guys build so we pull in we pull in the dynamic information at this point right so i showed you guys how to go in and if you add to the basket it updates this value over here now can you guys get it to show the number of items over here so inside the subtotal and can you also go and uh actually calculate the price of the items inside the basket okay so that is your homework okay so i'm going to go ahead and just put a little snippet on the screen right now and i'll visually show you guys oh i wasn't actually sharing the screen i'm sorry guys let me go ahead and make this a little bit bigger right so let me go ahead and make this a little bit bigger so this is going to be today's homework so i'm going to go ahead and visually demonstrate this so you can see here guys i showed you guys how to go ahead and add the dynamic information over here so when you actually go ahead and add items to the basket it actually dynamically updates at the top right so it dynamically updates at the top and we can pretty much see this happen in front of us okay now what i want you guys to go ahead and do is actually go ahead and is actually go ahead and for homework use that solution that i showed you for the header but go ahead and do the same thing for the subtotal items so we can see the number of items that get pulled in from our basket okay and then the juicy part of the homework is can you guys then take those items that we have in the basket and actually calculate the total price okay calculate the total price and the finished result should be a beautiful looking application so we won't have this for today's build but that will be part of tomorrow okay but now what i want you guys to do is um what i want you guys to do is actually go ahead and get this working okay so basically once we add a few items to us i'm going to refresh and show you guys so let's say we added the kenwood and the lean startup go to our basket it should say two items are inside the basket so it should match up to the top right here and then it should also say the correct total that's your homework guys for today right now we are going to drop instructions inside the facebook group and also inside the slack channel right now i'm about to bring on nars onto the stream and he's going to talk a bit about the homework the processes and what we like to do with the homework and also guys one thing i want to tell you guys is that if you don't get this homework it's completely it's okay right it's completely okay do not give up because we have three days where we're gonna run through everything with you guys i'm gonna show you guys how to go ahead and do all of this stuff okay now when not we were gonna originally ask you to deploy to deploy the app as well but at this point what i think is if we can get
