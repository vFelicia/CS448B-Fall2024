what do you feel like have been some of your biggest losses or biggest regrets most recently you know i had this company legal tech company called atrium we raised 75 million dollars didn't really work out spent most of the money returned some of it and obviously that's a lot of money what's up guys how's it going this is kazi from cleverprogrammer.com guys today it is absolutely insane we have the cofounder of twitch who sold it for almost a billion dollars to amazon and now he's moved on to doing a lot of web 3 stuff he's an investor and he's launching fractal and there's stuff with sin city there's a whole lot that we got to talk about but before i continue any further i'm just gonna shut my mouth justin welcome hey qazi what's up man thanks for having me i'm excited to be here yeah absolutely thank you man thank you i appreciate it um there's so much i want to talk about but i think like let's start talking about kind of what is going on with this web 3 world you know and what makes you interested in it yeah i mean so web 3 it's been around for a while right there's been a lot of people uh pushing it as a i guess it's not just a set of technologies but also i think philosophically how you design your app or community your project and it's been around for a while i've been kind of watching from the sidelines but really only jumped in in the past year and i think what happened what changed for me is that i finally saw the opportunity to really make applications that are more widespread consumer apps that a lot of people use and that's kind of what i'm i've been most excited about throughout my career you know so i'm uh in the past they start a lot of different web 2.0 apps yeah the one that people know about is twitch yeah and we sold that to amazon 2014 like you mentioned and then since then i've been investing in a lot of different startups and uh you know i finally feel like the technology for web3 is at the point where you can build these really interesting uh communities and applications that are based around communities you know yeah reward people for participating and that's what i'm really excited about that is exciting you know um something that's interesting is almost everything when i was looking at kind of what you were doing is really gaming related right like twitch became a gaming like big game streaming platform you're now launching fractal um since city the pro one of the projects that you were invested in i believe um that was related to yeah they changed their name to mob mob land right exactly yeah um so what what's up with this whole gaming thing you know what what made you interested in the first place and it feels like it's a pattern you know what's exciting to you about that well you know i always played games but i never set out to work in games yeah i'd always loved games when i was a kid i played you know hours and hours i mean i would spend all day playing games like what kind of games well many different ones uh you know when i played uh warcraft 2 i remember was one of the first nice i played that was yeah that was fun yeah have you ever played a frozen throne warcraft dude that's sick i grew up on that yeah that was an expansion of warcraft 3 right yeah warcraft 3 expansion yeah yeah so um play warcraft 2 warcraft 3 came out when i was in college i was playing that but i played a lot of 4x games you know like massive orion you know games like that like where there's like a you're building like civilization style games you know so i played civilization and i really love this game called colonization actually which is kind of like probably you know it'd probably be canceled today but it was like colonial style expansion of um of uh civilization where you're like you know one of the european empires uh discovering the new world yeah love that game and then i played a lot of world of warcraft a lot of mmos i loved ultima online that was like the first mmo i ever played i think that was the first mmo ever um so loved games throughout my you know one was young and then my early 20s and then um you know kind of fell into it accidentally when i was we started this the company that became twitch is this company called justin tv which was us trying to make our own live streaming show on the internet back in 2007 and this is before there was you know instagram live or facebook live or youtube live so you know we were we thought like live video was going to be a thing on the internet so we created our we want to create a show and then we created the show and it was kind of a splash but people didn't it was really boring like our content sucked you know i wasn't like you guys or anything i was like you're just programmers trying to make something happen i guess i was kind of like you but like i wasn't as entertaining you know it's like um we ended up uh turning that into a platform for live video called justin tv yeah we launched that in 2007 and then uh that pivoted to become twitch about four years later and um uh then you know that was kind of like how it got started that was about 11 years ago twitch kind of came into existence got it amazing yeah and i i kind of understand your journey of like what got you into gaming now you're continuing on that trend right so why because there's so many different fields you could go into so you know what made you go into and stick with gaming still well i've actually tried a lot of different startups in all these different areas you know i've started uh i've helped start a you know pharmacy startup i've helped i've done like a legal startup we're like a lot of different online offline companies and as an investor i've invested in everything from sas software to selfdriving cars to synthetic biology like all sorts of different fields so i'm always curious about new things i'm constantly curious about new areas of innovation yeah um but gaming is like one that's just constantly been fun you know i've always been curious and interested about gaming obviously it's something that i personally have enjoyed and throughout my life and so uh i think when i saw you know this year when i was thinking about web 3 startups to start uh i kind of came up with a there were a couple ideas and one of them was you know to build something in nfts and you know nfts my friend dave was like hey we should we should build something in fts uh he had been interested in investing in nfts for a couple of months and um and then i was like well the next thing is going to be clearly game related assets you know games like the stuff you buy in games because that already exists you know if you look at free fire or fortnite or any of these games out there called i mean i used to play borderlands dude and i would like buy so much [ __ ] in borderlands or like fifa you know i spent hundreds of dollars almost thousand dollars like buying packs where i'm like i hope i get messy you know and then you get these collectibles like yes so you're exactly you're already buying stuff in games right like you are like you're one of the you know hundreds of millions of people who are buying stuff in games right now this is something that people already do yeah and so the idea that you're going to create that we could create real ownership of those things and then people could take those you know real ha really have ownership and after they're done with the game they can trade them they can sell them they can borrow against it they can do whatever they want with them that's i think a kind of a next level that really opens up the economy of these games and once games do that i think it will be pretty obvious that it's it's better for both parties in the game both the game developers and the players i was i was like this is gonna be the future let's just you know i was like i was convinced it was going to be future i was like let's yeah start this so we we ended up incubating you know creating this company fractal and uh fractal is uh you know a platform for players to discover buy and sell gaming assets gaming nfts inside of their games got it you know something that's that that like popped into my mind and it like excited me to ask you this question is i have founded one company clever programmer this one and i've been just working on growing it right for the last half half a decade and there have been moments that have been incredibly humbling and like the failures were so freaking hard went through so much stress right even like maybe last year there were times where i lost so much weight stress count sleeping was difficult right and then um gotta support the team financial there's so many things where your ambition kind of like goes like this up and down where you're like i'm gonna take over the world and it's gonna be the number one country uh company in the world and then you're like guys we have seven days runway i hope we can just get to like ten right so like when i think about you and i'm i'm trying to just think from your perspective you have way more experience you've been doing this for a lot longer yes you've had successes but you've also had heartbreaking failures so how do you still feel that level of confidence to go okay we can build this big thing um you know where does that come from well i think i've always had this excitement and exuberance for new ideas i'm an enthusiast i don't know if you've ever done any gram but i've done an enneagram and i'm a type 7 which is the enthusiast and it's you know i'm all about new experiences discovering new things and i like i love new ideas i love learning about new ideas and so for me a lot of the starting of a company you know you know you're an entrepreneur you know what it's like i've had those times too it's like i've had the horrible times i didn't want to get out of bed it was like this is not working i was like i've had the times when i felt like i've let everyone around me down or my employees or my investors you know i've raised 75 million for a company and burned most of it like failed you know so that's scary obviously yeah there's like the big successes like you read about like the twitch or you know other companies i'm invested in or whatever but then there's like a lot of failures in there too and i talk about that on my youtube channel i'm like very public about that yeah i saw that video i think yeah it's not about it's not just about be you know every like always winning right like nobody has a life where they're like winning 100 of the time you know and so yeah um for me it's important to talk about that and and for me though the entrepreneur the seat of entrepreneurship comes from that like for me it's like my creative spark i love to learn about something i love new ideas and so the idea of like oh how could this idea become something in the world right yeah how could i um i have this idea for a new product or a new service how could it become something in the world and i started thinking about like what's the strategy for how we would build it how would design it i would market it you know all those things it's a very crossfunctional learning for me you know because it's it's everything from you know uh technology and design and engineering to like the marketing component of it communications and like the psychology of like how people buy things and then like to economics of like you know and a business and like to me it's fun entrepreneurship is fun yeah it's my it's my hobby and so in the start i have like this creative energy and then it's like okay once you start it you know there's a lot of excitement and then you have the reality of okay now i have to run this company yeah like i gotta like keep going yeah and then there's a lot of like real the real world hits and there's like pain and like oh you hired the wrong person or is legal yeah the clients left because they you know there was some there was a problem or you didn't weren't able to deliver something or whatever and then yeah you know obviously that part is the tough part so in the in the beginning i would say in the first part of my career i usually had a lot of energy for the spark and didn't have that much energy for the like hard operational part yeah and i i would get discouraged and i think i had to you know i was best off when i partnered with someone else who was really good at that part today i think it's still the same i have a lot of energy for that spark but i also like i'm a lot calmer like i don't have a need for it to turn out any sort of certain way you know i seem like more like i used to have a lot of like this has to be a billion dollar company because my friend has a billion dollar company in my whole life i want to be as good as my friend and i think i'm like you know i had a lot of ego around it it was like very driven by external motivations and today i would say i've really embraced internal motivations of like hey what am i do what do i do that i really love to do every day yeah it's like what gives me joy right you know maybe it's working on a product maybe it's recruiting someone maybe it's pitching someone on my new idea you know it's probably some set of those things you know and then like can i just do that every day and then if i do it is that success you know like it doesn't really matter how much this company ends up being worth because like i've got to live my life in a way that i really enjoy yeah so uh do you think how i view it now and go ahead yeah and it's it's like a little bit like it it takes the pressure off you know so even when things aren't going that well it's like okay well i still had a good day you know i i can understand that now okay from somebody's perspective when they look at this they go easy for you to say because you've already exited and have built a billion dollar company so do you think it was like a philosophical switch that you had to make or because you've hit that goal you're like now i have nothing to prove and it's easier for you well well actually i know it was the former because one if you know when i started in off and i remember starting justin tv i was like if i could make a million dollars off of tech then i'd be set right and obviously i kind of blew past that goal that was my dream i blew past it and then we sold the company for like 970 million dollars and then i was still i remember i was after like a week for a week i was like that's awesome after a week i was like okay now what and then after a month i was like bored and aggravated and i was like i need to do something and i looked at my friends and my friends had started companies like dropbox or airbnb and i was like i didn't do that good actually i have like other friends who did better and so then i was like really driven to start another company and make it even bigger i was like what can be a 10 billion dollar company right yeah and so then and i was like torturing myself the whole time like oh i didn't do good enough i'm like not you know so i was very dissatisfied i would say despite like obviously having a tremendous amount of material wealth like just dumped in my lap right so yeah it was only later when i like made internal changes i would say and like philosophical changes um that i was like oh actually it's all good like i've got enough and i'm like happy you know and it wasn't about it really wasn't i mean it's easy you know people be like oh it's easy for you to say it's like it wasn't really about the amount of material things or anything like that it was there was more about a mindset shift wow and so you could have that mindset shift at any time but what how did that mindset shift come for you like what what were there particular things that you did to have that mindset shift because it's something i struggle with right as an entrepreneur where i'll just give you our example right a few months ago we had like uh we were like oh my god if we can take the seven day runway to like 30 and we're bootstrapped so we don't have any funding yeah we can take the seven day runway to 30 days i'm like justin that is like the best thing ever you know and i was like literally would cry out of happiness but now in the last months we're really like we figured out a new business model and we've closed enough deals where we have almost two years of runway we've like partnered up with some really big companies in the web 3 space actually and when that happened it's like i was really excited but then it normalized again and i'm like what the [ __ ] like this is my normal runway yeah i'm like i should feel way more excited like the excitement shouldn't stop i'm like what is this is like was kind of frustrating to be honest because now i'm like thinking how do i make it more than two years you know what i mean like how do you did you fight that and did you ever have to figure out like how to be truly just [ __ ] grateful and like love every moment or is that a fight you fight today yeah so no that's i mean it's well obviously so that's the hedonic treadmill right like yeah yeah it's no matter where you're at there's always something next and then you're like when you get that thing that's the next thing and then after that the next thing and so you know like when i was a kid i had this i remember i wanted this toy it was like some sort of like medieval gi joe or something like that and um i was like if i get this thing that's the last toy i'll ever need how old are you it's like i don't know i was like ten nine days or something like if i get this toy it's like the last toy i'll ever need i've got it for my parents bought it for me and then after a week i was like i'm bored with it you know and i saw i remember that entire arc and that's like the same thing with you and me right that's like oh i sell this company for a billion dollars is the last thing i'll ever need yeah like if i just get two years of runway then that's the last thing i'll ever need and then next boom no that's not enough like now i need to get more i want to grow my team whatever it is like the next thing around the corner pops up so that's a human condition so the first thing is like to realize like that's not bad that's the human that's part of being a human being is to have this hedonic drive for more and it's because you grew up you evolved right human beings your ancestors and it was involved in an environment that was a scarce environment yeah right where it's like actually good for you to have more if you had like x amount of food you wanted 2x because you're like i don't know when the next meal is coming so we got a stockpile yeah yeah that's like human nature right yeah so to understand because a lot of people are like why am i so greedy why am i so selfish why do i think it's like an evolutionary thing like even the jealousy and getting upset that your friend is winning over you like for example how you were like hey my friend launch dropbox is like from an evolutionary perspective maybe it's a good thing because then it makes you want to kind of step up but it doesn't feel good internally all the time exactly exactly that's exactly right so it's evolutionary so you could just say i accept that about myself you know i'm a person that's a human being and that part of that is that i want more yeah there's part of me that wants more and then for me it was a process of stepping back and like doing a lot of things to retrain my mind right so for example like being grateful for what you have is obvious is like correlated with being happy right yeah so you can practice that like just like anything else like so every day i have a gratitude journal app i open this app i write down three things i'm grateful for that's how i start every day got it you know sometimes i like actually just write a ton of things i'm grateful for i've sat down and written list of 50 things i was grateful for because like then you're practicing the path you know your neural pathways that are focused around like gratitude and you know that's that's a way to like contextualize hey like actually i have a lot yeah i don't mean i have a lot in the material senses like i have a lot in like the sense of i have a lot of uh you know love in my life or family or opportunity or like relationships you know so that's one thing i mean i meditate also every day you know do a meditation to like really understand the you know even just your experience so like for me i'm like feeling oh i feel upset right now that i didn't you know this thing happened like i wanted to close this deal and then they like the client disappeared or whatever right like and then i'll be like in the past i would be swept along by that it'd be like what the [ __ ] yeah yeah like i must have [ __ ] this thing up or i should have done this i'm so stupid i should have like pitched them a different way or whatever yeah but now i'm like seeing that but through the practice of meditation it's like oh i see this thought pop up that's like oh wow that really you know that sucks and then i'm like just observing it and you're observing the qualities of mind the things that happen in your mind and then they just float along right like i'm more able today to like instead of being in the river and swept along to be on the banks of the of the river but the full point is that you still have those thoughts right those intrusive thoughts that are like oh i'm i [ __ ] this up i'm stupid or something like that it still pops up but you're not as engaged in them you're not as necessarily swept along with them you know this is that's another technique oh yeah good yeah go go go if you want then like there's lots more i mean i've i can do therapy i've done therapy you know like i have like a lot of there's a lot of physiological things you can do to make yourself more at peace like when you are in the state like if you are in a state where you're triggered by something you're like obsessed you're upset because you you know lost a deal or whatever and you notice it now instead of like being subconscious you're like conscious about it you know i work out a lot or go for a walk whatever i mean simple stuff really but really that's the that's that's it's funny i mean all this money in the world and like that's the [ __ ] that makes me happy you know what it's funny is that it i feel relatable to you you know because i um because i haven't met you up until today i'm you know it's not justin it's the founder of twitch or the xyz or running this thing and you know it's like because we're all operating on different levels and since i judge myself because i'm an entrepreneurial game right entrepreneurial race so i judge it based on levels right you're like the [ __ ] you're playing in the olympics um and i'm like winning a high school championship and i'm like all right you know i'm gonna be there but speaking with you i feel leveled and connected because when you share how you're feeling and you know you're having frustrations and you're feeling envy from your friends i'm like those are feelings i've felt you know uh you're feeling like you've lost or or certain things felt like a win or focusing on gratitude i'm like those things feel like the things i feel and my friends feel uh i think i can get justin you know so that's actually really um really cool i think you know for you i guess like when you were when you're doing all this stuff and working on yourself for me one of the big problems that happens is i will put i'll still end up putting business above health and things like that by mistake kind of you know in my mind i'm like after this one deal is done or after this is done then i will go to the gym and then i will do these other things have you made it a priority or kind of nonnegotiables in your life like this is what i do and this is how i take care of my physical and mental health and then i do all the you know material success stuff yeah absolutely i've like i so you know i there's a set of things that it's like i'm gonna do it every day no matter what like that's more higher priority than work and it's i still work a lot actually right now i probably work you know 10 hours a day yeah i wouldn't be surprised eight to 10 hours a day but like it's like every day i'm gonna you know maybe less than that actually you know to be honest it's probably probably like eight hours a day right like i don't wanna i don't need to work martyr myself but i think i'm working eight hours a day but i like it you know yeah being on you know i'm doing stuff that i love making content i'm like you know building new products you know stuff that i love so it doesn't feel like work but um i uh i think the the main point is like you know every day i'm gonna do my gratitude journal every day i'm gonna work out if it's just five minutes you know it's not necessarily an hour but i'm gonna like start with five minutes and then it usually is more than that you know i'm gonna every day i'm gonna meditate um every day i'm gonna spend time with my family like that stuff is like if i don't do that i'm not gonna be my most effective so to me it's it's you know just a matter of efficiency right like it's like i clearly am a much more productive and like much better person and boss yeah like when i have taken care of myself yeah so i'm gonna do those things yeah i think that's true a lot of people think that they're not they're like oh if i if i spend time meditating or i spend time exercising i'm not working but it's like you know if you go into a work situation and you're triggered because you didn't take care of yourself or you could have alleviated that situation of being triggered because you like you know by taking care of yourself yeah then you could actually be negative in that situation you know i've had so many situations at work like with other people where i've like probably created a negative environment because i was like in a bad head space maybe misdirected anger and [ __ ] like that yeah or just making decisions like that were the wrong decisions yeah i agree and you know alex for moses i don't know if you know him or not but uh he's blowing up on youtube as well he's uh um he's also growing his channel on the entrepreneurial space and he sold his company recently um but he talks a lot about as you start kind of leveling up um you know it goes from you know it goes from actions you take to the decisions you make and so the decisions start becoming more important than the actions and so in order to make good decisions then you have to be mentally and emotionally in a really good space to be able to do that so if you're spending time with friends family whoever really matters to you you're going to be less likely to you know misdirect one of the people on your team or lead them the wrong way or be irritated or agitated quicker now what are you know um for you what do you feel like have been some of your like biggest losses or biggest regrets that you've experienced you know over over the years well i have a lot of losses but i don't really have regrets um because like everything even the things that were difficult i think you know i learned something from them i got something out of it like most recently you know i had this company legal tech company called atrium we raised 75 million dollars didn't really work out spent most of the money returned some of it uh it was kind of like a fiery crater in the ground right like a startup and obviously that's a lot of money right like 75 mil so what happens when you lose that money like for a normal person to understand like do you lose relationships and friendships over that does it have you know more consequences i was very supported by our investors and they were like it's okay and like you know people who are good technology investors know it's a numbers game and they're investing in a portfolio and some of them aren't going to work out you know unfortunately obviously you don't want to be the one that didn't work out but like everybody moves on like these com funds have raised billions of dollars they're like gonna be fine yeah all my employees got other jobs like even if i thought it was like horrible at the time and it was difficult but everybody got a new job they got most of them got jobs they liked better they you know everyone who worked at the company everybody who like all the investors are fine they've like you know 20 20 that a year we shut down yeah you know 2021 was like the best year for tech in like a decade right like so it's just like people were fine afterwards and so at the end of the day it wasn't that bad um but obviously it was difficult and obviously if i could go back in time i'd probably start a different company i wouldn't start the same company but i don't have a regret over starting it because through that difficulty you know in the difficult experience i actually learned a lot of the practices i'm talking to you about now like how to live my joy every day and like just how to focus on the intrinsic motivations instead of the extrinsic and so for me it was valuable you know even the things that like are difficult or like that don't that that are that are tough or you know end up being valuable 100 in some way i love it let's switch over to why web3 because i think we haven't touched base on that right that's what he wanted to talk about yeah yeah yeah on the rabbit hole no no i love everything that we've talked about i yeah i'm okay with that because i think it brings like i feel like it brought me value i know they're gonna be other people it's gonna bring value to so that's huge uh so thanks for sharing that and so openheartedly sharing that you know i i do want to touch a base a little bit on web 3 because i'm personally curious and i know a lot of my community is curious why web 3 like why did you jump into it you know uh you've already built successful companies in the web 2 space you know maybe you might want to just continue on that trend right but what made you take a leap and jump into it yeah so i'll just start with here's my story of me in web 3 right like my participation i started off when i was you know in 2013 i was like saw bitcoin and i was like i should buy some bitcoin because like if this thing works the fomo is going to kill me if i don't own any so uh because there was like so much you know it's in silicon valley friends of mine were talking about i was like i should just buy some bitcoin so i bought some bitcoin and then it immediately crashed and i was like i'm the bag holder i'm an idiot wow then it kind of like i forgot about it for years years then it kind of went up again and then at that point like there's you know ethereum and i'm like i don't get ethereum so i like invested in a crypto fund to like invest in crypto you know positions and then i was like okay i'm in this fund and then i can just not worry about it and then it was only this last year where i was like finally like checking out web3 again like a year ago i'm like okay and then i'd invest in a couple companies but like i didn't really you know i was like i don't know if any of this stuff is going to work yeah so i was checking out web3 again i was like i went to the site audience.com it's like a friend of mine site that i was i was like an advisor to this company and they like spotify on blockchain right yeah it's like blockchain music right so like spotify or soundcloud and what i was like you could use the app and it's all powered in a decentralized way without the user ever knowing it right you don't have to like log in with metamask or anything like that just like use this app and it's like it was actually easy and i'm like this is actually pretty good right like it actually works and so that made me interested in like what could you build on top of this and then my other friend that started this company called brain trust as a project and they basically created decentralized upwork and by decentralizing you know they by by creating this token they were able to distribute it to a hundred thousand people who are freelancers and like create a marketplace out of nothing right but you know to compete with upwork because they were you know they they just like had this incentive right they created an incentive through this community token and so to me it the light bulb went off and i was like oh this is a great way to create it's not just about the technology of the trustless part but it's also about galvanizing a community towards a certain goal yeah right which is kind of what you see with like these creator dows and like all these different dials like links down stuff like that it's like creating community around a specific goal and you could have done it without web three yeah but the decentralization is part of like the ethos that gives people the trust i think to like you know believe in this mission and like kind of that that there is that they will be able to participate in the value of creation right yeah and so to me that was like that the the the light bulb went off and i was like this is how if we were making twitch again today we would do it as a decentralized project um to galvanize this community you know and so that was really why i got interested in it and then ended up um really wanting to dive in yeah to me like so like right now i think if you're not if you're young and a programmer even if you're not young if you're a programmer yeah you want to build something on the internet i don't know why you wouldn't be working in web 3. let's so let's okay let's bring it down a level to like make it really layman terms so for example you know if i don't really know too much about it i listen to you and i just hear it like fancy words let's just say like decentralized right but i'm like but spotify works just fine and spotify is growing so like why do we need audience the only things i heard there was decentralize on blockchain but i don't really understand how that's so much different than spotify you know or how brain trust is so much different than let's say upwork um yeah so yeah like so here i'll explain it in the sense of bringing the example brain trust right sure because i asked the same question for the longest time like upwork works fine right yeah yeah yeah exactly there's a website i'm like search for like designer look at them to email them through this thing and then like i booked with them right yeah and my friends adam and gabe who who created the braintrust project were like they were web 2.0 guys before right they had created like adam and created a ton of marketplaces and adam was like look these marketplaces are extractive right there and by extractive it means like they are exploit they've become exploitative to the internet right and so what happens is like like twitch is the same way actually like all these things like kickstarter twitch patron patreon you know amazon ebay like every marketplace right uber airbnb like br and and upwork yeah all these companies and like everything is a marketplace and you know most a lot of these web web 2 companies or marketplaces yeah the way they work is they come in and they spend a lot of marketing to get users on both sides both the like supply side so in the case of brain trust it's like people who are um providing it's for brainchild it's like people are like freelancers right like so designers engineers stuff like that and then the buyers like the buy side that's the people who are buying things like the in this case in the case of brain trust it's like you know people i want to hire programmers so like big companies and stuff like that yeah and what they do is they're like they market to these people so they make the market marketplace and then they can charge them like whatever they want right once all the work is on brain trust or sorry on upwork once the work is on upwork then if you're a freelancer you kind of have to go to upwork right yeah once all the apartments are in airbnb if you're traveling it's not like you can just book directly right to save yourself money you can you basically have to go to airbnb and then you have to pay 20 or sometimes more right to all of the different to the middlemen right so true 20 for operating this website is that fair i don't know but it could be lower right yeah if you think about the 20 it's 20 that's coming out of the mouth of that freelancer right got it and so yeah i remember like i um sorry to cut you off but like just to relate with what you're saying i was i in 2015 2016 i used to teach i used to tutor people in chess and coding on this website called yzant and it was a marketplace for students and teachers and i was making majority of my income from there like a lot of my income from there and like uh close i was making close to six figures from there and for me at that time it was huge because i was going to college uh you know near that time and i remember one time they just decided to ban my account and like literally i got no customer support they would also take 40 of my income and then at some point just banned my account i had no customer support no way to ever get it back and like overnight i lost all my income and i'm like [ __ ] this i'm like i'm just gonna build my own uh platform and a channel and provide value to people that way um now i'm dependent on youtube but like yeah that's why i cut them off but i'm i was just trying to relate with what you were saying but i apologize exactly that's that's an exactly perfect example because i mean in your case you're a very competent motivated person so you were able to like say okay i'm going to take that and i'm going to move forward and move on with like something new right yes like you said you're still dependent on youtube but like yeah you build rebuild back better right but like not everyone can do that right not everyone's going to do that and it's like if you think about your relationship with wise and it's incredibly extractive they're taking 40 of your income yeah and they're there for and then they can shut you off at any moment which they did right yeah so the point about making why should upwork become a decentralized protocol like brain trust right well yeah number one the fees on brain trust go down to like zero percent right so they they basically take no fee so it's like it's just an open protocol anyone can put labor on it anyone can book and the fee is zero and then so that's like much better for you right the community who are people are making it and then the second thing is like they can't kick you off right like it's an open protocol and so you are it's much better for you to participate in so brain trust so brain trusts like company can't deactivate there's no company it's like a protocol like it's just like it's a protocol that they made to like uh manage work and then that's it like so there's no like customer service person from there that can just come and deactivate my account if i'm on brain trust that's right so wow so that is powerful and and then the last thing is like you own tokens right for participating in this for bringing your labor like you're saying you're making you're part of the market you're making that market so you get a reward of in terms of like the governance of this variance you get government you get tokens that represent like some portion of like how much you're voting if this what what happens with the braintrust protocol that makes sense it's not like the founders control it they can say i don't you know like cassie i'm gonna like kick him off you know yeah like yeah but here's my here's one of the questions i had let's say that you made twitch today but on the blockchain or somebody made youtube today on the blockchain if it's truly decentralized and you can't control anything well there's certain things i do want controlled like i don't want uh you know i don't want to go on the youtube page and see like extreme amount of violence or somebody posting some random video right um so like what about those types of things because there are there's a certain level where i'm happy that youtube is censoring and those videos aren't coming to my page right like you don't want to see like uh you know isis kidnapping and getting or somebody yeah beheading exactly i don't want to see that right so i'm happy that twitch doesn't show me that you know and youtube doesn't show me that so so you know the way that these com protocols are addressing that today is uh they are doing some sort of moderation where like there is like community voting there's like some subsection of the community is basically voting and moderating and then are rewarded for that and so you know there are ways to like basically have reintroduce control that but that instead of it being like a centralized company it's done by like a community of people understood got it okay so so i mean i guess it depends on like do you think censorship from your peers i mean it's the same idea as america right which is like if you're gonna put on trial you get a trial of like the jury the jury decides right yeah we're saying like that is better obviously we don't want to live in a world where people can't commit any or can commit any crime so we're going to like have to try people but instead of it being like the king is like okay off with his head it's going to be a jury of your peers right then that's maybe more in line with how web 3 is work is shaping up to work and i would say it's still really early so we're figuring it out what's the incentive for the brain trust people that made it so the incentive is like the everybody who's participating in the creation of this is rewarded in some tokens so the founders of brain trust all the people contribute to brain trust all the freelancers who are bringing in both other talents and then also um you know clients like everybody gets rewarded tokens and then these tokens are used as the governance you know to govern brain trust got it okay understood and then i'm at some point they'd be able to like so say i was i created braintrust or i'm a developer that tomorrow starts uh app like braintrust i get a bunch of my own tokens in the start which have literally zero value but i bring all these people into the community and then as more and more people started using this the value starts going higher and higher higher and then like let's just say i initially had 100 tokens or a thousand tokens if the value becomes ten dollars or a hundred dollars now all of a sudden i have a hundred thousand dollars yeah exactly it's it's kind of like people are buying or earning these tokens and then if the project does well you know hopefully they share in the success of the project got it that is really cool i think the economy part you were hitting on that was super interesting to me because twitch essentially created a a new economy right for example uh my friend eric rosen who's a chess player he's super popular now on youtube we went to high school together played chess and now he has now he's making an income from twitch and a bunch of creators i know yeah right it's so cool uh hikaru nakamura who i used to i loved watching him uh play but i would get i would so rarely get to see his games before but now because he makes a living from twitch he's just like streaming all the time so i can just watch his stuff anytime that i want and like this is exciting so like twitch truly created an economy uh for people i feel like with web 3 you can you can even take that one step further like you know i think you play league of legends right or do you or i have i i've played before but i'm not i wouldn't consider myself a league of legends player so let's say some starcraft 2 was my my game that i liked okay so say starcraft 2 or league of legends or whatever but i feel like people who start getting good at these games now will be able to actually make living off of them because they'll have their own economies like axe infinity is a very basic version of this being implemented and already kind of working and i feel like new games that are coming out because i when i was young and i was playing borderlands and i would just grind away for 15 to 20 hours a day that would have been so cool if i was able to make an income off of that too because i would literally just be gaming like all the time you know i would never do anything else do you feel like that's kind of true or like what do you feel about that well i think people are experimenting with different types of economies and different types of games so i think there are games where they're like okay we want people to be able to you know make money primarily as like a you know make a living i guess by by playing this game and uh you know that requires an inflow of people who are like they're saying okay i want to buy the stuff that this guy's earning like if you know person a is like earning a bunch of stuff by grinding this game or playing the game then person b has to come and say like i want to get some of that stuff and i'm willing to just pay money yes right which is kind of like the dynamic that exists today in some games where people are just willing to pay for like cosmetics or like you know to advance or whatever yeah um so you know it could be that could work like i could see that happening other other games i think are more like you know the stuff that i would say there's a lot of games that want to be like have you know you own this thing you can trade it but maybe the primary purpose of you playing this game is not economic you know i think in order for games to be fun like you have to have a really high ratio of like players who are not just playing it for economics yeah that's true and i yeah so i think and i think most game companies will come around to being like oh the most important thing is like that this game is fun right that's yeah that's playing that's 100 true and you personally are you um trying to create a gaming company because you're focused on the gaming side or are you creating are you currently working on creating like a marketplace a gaming marketplace i guess i want to know what fractal is yeah fractal's a marketplace and it helps people basically we help launch game companies who are building these games in um you know like web 3 games so they're building a blockchain game and there's some sort of you know open economy or open economic portion of it so that looks like you know oftentimes these games have nfts that they're selling to their audience and the nfts are you know skins in the game their characters their items you know whatever it is yeah and um so you could think of like the existing freetoplay model where you know there's a game like league of legends you have to like buy characters or or you like you know or i guess they're heroes right you buy heroes or like you you can get like um and like you can there's stuff you could buy in the game but in in the case of a blockchain game it's like this stuff is yours right like you can resell it to someone else you can send it to a different wallet like the company doesn't control what you do with it after you buy it got it and so i think it's just a natural evolution of free to play and and that's what where our games are headed yeah yeah that makes sense and then for you like um you know why i think you guys chose solana right for yes or this why solana right because everybody chooses ethereum or whatever so solana you know what what we want to do is be where the games are and so we went and talked when we started off we went and talked to a bunch of games and i think a lot of games were choosing ethereum and then a lot of games were choosing solana and solana was the platform where it's like if i was a developer and i was building i would probably pick solana myself you know because i mean i am a developer actually so like it was kind of like the choice that i would have wanted to make technically yeah you know for this yeah because it's like a fashion you have the experience being a developer like yeah yeah i was a programmer that's how i'm how i became a tech entrepreneur right huge that's [ __ ] respect that's sick yeah i was a programmer and we built our first apps myself i built the original justin tv api which you know like became the twitch parts of twitch anyways so like ham okay um yeah so i you know i i wouldn't say i was the best developer but i definitely you know was a programmer so yeah for me we kind of made that choice but we want to be everywhere games are you know so like ultimately i don't know if you know if that's solana if that's other places you know we want to be um can we want to be everywhere the games get the games go and so uh yeah yeah that's that's kind of how we think about it got it um go ahead yeah the last thing i'll say is like you know we are hiring because i mean this uh this is a channel full of developers we're hiring people to come work on fractal it's growing really quickly i mean yeah we're selling tons of uh nfts and primary mints that's like where we help the um the developers drop their assets to their audience so we help them sell their assets to the audience and uh you know we've been live for just a couple weeks and i've already done like millions and millions of dollars of sales so uh it's working pretty good um and we're looking for people who want to join the team like talented engineers uh solana you know also ethereum and also you don't have to know anything about crypto if you just like want to be a you know you want to learn like we're uh yeah we're excited but if you're a web 2 developer and you are just jumping into crypto and maybe you have like two weeks or one month of experience because i know a lot of people don't have any because solana is on rust most people don't have any rust related experience so what if it's somebody who has maybe a bunch of experience as a developer but just jumped into crypto like a month ago or like two weeks ago yes i mean that's perfect i want to hire people who like they don't need to have a crypto experience there's like so many rules like there's you know front end rolls back and rolls you know that are non nonrust or or um a solidity you know but obviously if you have solidity or rust experience that's great too so amazing yeah okay awesome so guys we'll uh have the link in the description for a form and you and i can talk about the form if you want additional questions or anything in it just fill that out guys yeah um okay amazing yeah so i think that's super freaking cool um you know i think as the last couple of questions do you have a couple more minutes yeah yeah okay okay awesome you're good cool so i think like a lot of people want to get into this web through space a lot of developers want to get into it like what's the opportunity for a developer to get into this space you know is it going away sometime soon is it kind of a risky thing to jump into because that's why i think a lot of developers are not like they're they're scared and they're holding on and they're like web 2. so you know why why should a developer jump into this space right now yeah so you know i would i would say that this is where i think most innovation is going to happen and i think the most interesting innovation is happening already on the internet um i think the idea like when i was starting off in web 2 it felt like we were discovering how people were going to talk to each other on the internet communicate on the internet and like you know so that was instagram that was twitch that was facebook that is a [ __ ] cool way to think about it that is really cool yeah yeah that is and then but now it feels like we're discovering how people are going to value things on the internet right so like now it's like nfts are like they're they're people regarding it's like how people regard value like in art but also like people are selling nft access passes and people are selling like parts of you know access to communities and there's all these different things that people are like valuing there's like digital value now in in kind of digital goods and assets and that to me is really interesting um and so it just there's a lot being invented it moves really quickly um and i'd encourage you to just dive in now that being said i think there's gonna be a crypto bear market and there's gonna be a bear market in all like speculative assets i think uh it's already happening right so the late stage tech like and then all the way down like crypto and pokemon cards and like everything else that people are just yellowing into right coins and wall street bets stocks and all you know everything so yeah you know if you're looking for like uh what's the shortterm play like you know i don't know you should figure that out yourself i don't know but i think longterm crypto is going to be there's gonna be a lot of amazing stuff invented here and i think it's a it's a good longterm career move for sure absolutely uh yeah i think crypto that that makes sense to me why crypto is a good move uh long term for people you know um i think a lot of developers have trouble understanding this but i think there's a lot of you know even if you're watching this right now and you get even slightly curious i would just do some learning around it you know that's that's personally what i did justin like i was curious and skeptical and then i just started learning stuff and then i just discovered this whole new world and i was like holy crap this is amazing and i'm i'm not gonna say i get it completely there's a lot that i don't get yet and i'm in the process of learning but it's i feel like it's worth learning the space and a lot of solid amazing web 2 developers that i know from big fan companies or all of them i see them switching over to web 3 and they're getting web 3 jobs you know um when it comes to starting a company like fractal what's your process right now like you know for a normal person they spend a lot of time building traction blah blah when i think about from your perspective and this is just this is from my layman understanding and i would love to know you think about i want to start this company and then do you go uh this is a good idea i'm going to talk with some people it makes sense all right now i'm going to get funding for this and then let's build a marketplace or i what's your what's your um i guess in a simplified way because i know we don't have so much time to get into it it would be a whole other podcast but how did you go about building and launching this freaking you know new company yeah so it's all about for me when i start a company it's all about who yeah you know i have lots of ideas i always have ideas but it's all about who am i going to work with on it and so in this case i had a friend uh dave wurtz who's at google at the time yeah and uh he and i had been brainstorming about like something things in crypto we'd known each other for you know 15 years i'd always wanted to work with him he's like a super smart guy and so yeah we brainstorming stuff and then he was like we came with this idea for fractal you know because i was really into the gaming entities idea and then uh he we pulled in you know two other cofounders my business partner robin chan who's like uh he was a gaming guy as well he had stolen a gaming company to zynga and then mike angel who's a engineer and uh like an amazing engineer and basically just said hey let's build it mike built the whole thing in a month and then we launched it you know like in january and they're like end of december and so you know move really quickly yeah from idea to like first launch was probably five weeks yeah uh moved incredibly quickly and then the goal was just like how'd you get so many people on it though like how did you get so many people on i know we just i did a bunch of i did a bunch of press about like hey we're launching you know twitch cofounders launching this new thing and you know that kind of like got our first seed and then we gave away an nft drop for for people um yeah and the ft drop has done like millions of dollars of secondary transactions since we launched it so like people are you know they're into it they're yeah yeah one last selfish question you are me or you're in this face uh you're you're in the position of clever programmer you are okay you're a business owner of a community and you have community of all these developers and now you're building this web 3. what is a good way forward to think if if i want to personally i want to build something amazing i'm not so much like it needs to be this massive thing i just want to build something amazing and look for big opportunities to chase so i'm in the process of me just learning um and i feel like there's a lot of knowledge that i'm missing so you know if you were in my position would you be thinking about launching something on the web 3 space um or i'm not sure but like how would you make a decision on what to do next or how to grow a big company from here yeah i mean i'd be thinking about the web3 space for sure because i think that's where most innovation is and then i'd be like okay what assets do i have and like where can i find like how can i invest those assets in something that's really high value right yeah and so that could look like you have your community right you have a community of programmers right presumably some of these programs are really good right that's that's like a scarce asset so then how can you and you have a channel like to market something so you know maybe i would be thinking about like there's probably a bunch of different ways you could do it like one is like create some sort of community down like where your community is participating in in like investing in projects and things like that um yeah another thing would be like you could figure out how to use your community to like help build help you build a pro product write a project um and if you don't have any ideas for projects i wonder if you could like you know there's all these projects they're giving out like token grants for you know work like and so maybe you could like find the projects that you really are into that you think are going to be successful and then you could just like become part of those projects you know by providing developer resources to build stuff god knows just like my 30second response off the top of my head i love it this is great um justin this has been awesome thank you so much i know that we had the time slot until uh this time so i want to respect your time any last words or anything you want to uh share yeah like there's probably a lot of people out there who are skeptical of web3 right that's that's a very common thing on the internet you know i i would say like don't let skepticism close your mind off right like it's better like it doesn't cost it doesn't hurt you to learn right like kazi said like just get out there and start learning something and then make your own opinion right but like if you're just you know there's a lot of people in the gaming ecosystem it's like always like oh nfts are bad for the environment or they're like toxic or they're scams or whatever it's like well you know that's like an opinion that's like a meme opinion that's not like an opinion that's informed by like you learning anything yeah so um it never hurts to learn and i think coming from a place of like curiosity is always better for you so i guess that's my psa one and number two is like obviously you should come work at fractal and uh hopefully i'll see you guys soon amazing justin thank you so much uh guys if you're interested in working with justin i mean you're not gonna go wrong this is gonna be [ __ ] amazing opportunity of a lifetime so um fill out the application below we'll put something there for you guys below uh hopefully it'll just be a simple air table fill it out and then we'll put you in touch with justin i guess what's the process justin like who do they i don't know i'll i'll um i'll link you with my recruit we just hired our first recruiter so we'll uh we'll set up like we'll have a form or email or something yeah set up and we'll put down there cool awesome um got it and do you want to touch base on what they would be doing like what type of work could they expect we have like every you know we're building apis right now i think that's pretty fun for powering how you know web3 gaming will work yeah um so i think there's a lot of api engineering and sdk you know kind of it's more of an sdk in some ways but anyways uh we're doing that yeah there's like front end work for building like a marketplace there's back and work for building marketplace and there's like actually like all the smart contracts on you know there'd be solidity and um and rust and and so you know there's a lot of opportunity got it and there's basically opportunity to do anything also i need like ux and ui people so like there's like literally it's like kind of anything any part of it there's awesome opportunity what level experience uh is is uh you know more appropriate let's say for this like couple of years yeah probably a couple couple years plus right so like looking for people who are like maybe at the end of being a junior developer all the way through you know very experienced got it awesome all right justin thanks so much brother i appreciate you uh this was awesome and uh uh hopefully we'll see you again next time okay all right see you later all right last thing tell them to subscribe to this channel because i think they'll listen to you they might not listen to me yeah you know what to do smash subscribe bang that like button and then go check out my
