engagement on this challenge is incredible so I just want to take the time to thank you for doing that and I think I'm blocking the screen so let me actually remove myself so you can see the 476 comments insane and we have about five hundred and twenty eight people live right now what the hell let me hide myself again cool alright Alicia says I'm interested in learning data science and AI and want to learn how to make money on the internet or at least be literal in computer science okay we have Andy and he says I want to build my own IT company so fall says to make a nice impact on society Samarra says I want to work from any place on the planet and create a positive impact on my kids I work hard every time Mattel says looking to make a career change from SEO to web developer Jake says I'm here to dive into coding and get my freelance career started gingka to empower myself as a woman with limitations still want to prove myself that I can code and create amazing opportunities for myself my family and encourage the go Tech education in my country so guys I want you to start thinking about it what's your reason for coding all right start dropping in the comments right now why are you coding why are you be trying to become a developer what's your reason because if you don't have a strong reason I can promise you this right now you're not gonna go very far encoding and the reason is because things get really difficult encoding really fast and if you don't have something that keeps pushing you forward or you're not excited about something you're not gonna go down much forward so you guys are saying you wanna as access I want to actually be my own boss and I want to travel so I love that that's amazing Kiska in the house dope hey JavaScript success coaches amazing to have you guys T awesome Samuel says nowadays with this horrific situation I had to spread apart from my family in order to study although my parents are in a really bad condition so being able to follow my dream about passions helping out my family while also enjoying it all I couldn't ask for more okay I see you guys talking about your wanna make money some people want to change careers some of you guys are doing it because you think Tech is cool I see that dope you want to be a freelancer Nakula mandir okay awesome let's keep it moving y'all alright so here's how you guys can tag and share your posts so just you can tag any one of us if you want to tag nas or clever kasi which is me or jacob just tag us this is how you guys can actually communicate with us and then we'll actually share your message forward to other people and we're pretty much sharing every single one of you guys so if right now you guys are watching this just whip out your phone if you want to and record instagram story and then you can tag me at clever cause ii or nas or whoever you want sonny up there or all four of us and we will like repost your stories because we want to show you guys I'm gonna share your story and document your journey from actually day one because we want you to be able to look back and go man today was the day I got started and look at how far I've come right now so last five day JavaScript challenge was incredible and it was epic we had guys we had over a hundred and thirteen thousand comments in that challenge we did it in April it was the first time we have ever done something like this and it was just mindblowing the results we got and we had over 6,000 Watchers on our live stream isn't that crazy guys like have you ever seen one hundred thirteen thousand comments unlike Facebook comments in in a five day challenge to pretty much anywhere like I don't know to me that's a little crazy of course if you go to like some famous person like Kanye West or whatever right you'll see like hundred thousand comments on one post but for us was a really big deal especially for coding and JavaScript like come on so that was that was exciting and very humbling so last time in the projects right we built a really incredible projects and we just want to share some of them with you guys so like for example we built a store locator in our last project for Google Maps and we had people like 5,000 people submit their own projects so I wanted you to start seeing for yourself like what are you gonna be doing this project what kind of things are you gonna build and could this be you during this challenge like building these incredible apps right here's Jen and she built a store locator that's amazing vaibhavi made a store locator here's Rehan she made a store locator but she customized and design in her own way and these are just everyday average normal people some of them have some more experience a lot of them are complete beginners in coding so like are you a complete beginner in coding and if you are that's totally okay you're in a fine place you'll learn how to build this right Jonelle like made this really slick app and it looks awesome by the way who here wants to be able to build a project like this let me know would you guys wanna would it be cool if you could build this project during these five days and actually put on your portfolio I think that would be pretty freakin awesome alright and here we got a live demo for you guys of an app built by one of our students Vaughn Tong and I hope that this demo works so I'll try to show you guys this demo cool click it can we click it oh yeah here we go we got the link boom so here's the demo right check this out absolutely beautiful app so of Anton what he did is he took the Google Maps app and customized it into his own thing so I want you to start thinking about how would you customize it could you customize it to coronavirus app he took the Google Maps app and turn it into coronavirus app and you guys could actually go to this app and view it for yourself as well so here you can actually click anywhere so let's say I click Algeria and take a look at this right right when I click Algeria I can see the cases in Algeria I can see how many people have recovered I can see the number of debts I can click whose biggest on and I can find out the number of cases how many recovered all of that right I can click on Pakistan Nepal Poland doesn't matter I can click on all of these I can even search up a country like this USA boom click it and then it'll take us to USA right here and pop it up pretty freakin cool right who thinks this app is cool I think this app is super freaking cool and take a look at this where it says at the bottom true news on CCP virus so this app even integrated true news so when you click it it actually shows you some like different awesome resources for coronavirus that are happening right now you could take a look and be informed ok I think it's brilliant what you can do with coding and the possibilities are really limitless and honestly how I think about coding so I'm gonna get out of here how I think about coding is it's kind of like you know how this if Rajini you only have what three wishes you can make but coding I feel like you learn how to make unlimited wishes to the genie like literally the world is yours whatever you can think and dream you can create and then people can use it so I feel like it's just such a good outlet for yourself and then you can bring so much value to the world and solve problems I hope you find that cool too isn't that cool alright let's keep going let's keep it moving guys we're gonna have to keep going through this fast alright we're getting lots of comments I love it we're getting lots of reactions keep it going guys I'm loving the hearts of coming in it's just hyping me up to keep delivering better and better for you so here's a live javascript student experiences from last challenge ok so here are some of the students Jenn Mar says my future looks so bright to be able to do freelancing Jessica gross she says I'm ready to take on the world ok David atella says I already started to build my own website after day 4 of the live training ok Deana says I want to become a successful frontend developer to provide for my daughter alright let's go over here Carl says this was a transformative experience and so really why we're showing you guys this is like the next few days could really be defining moments of your life so if you're willing to be committed to this we are willing to match you 100% by providing with an amazing experience and giving you all the tools and projects that you need to succeed in becoming a developer you want to help you shortcut that path to getting your dream job does that make sense so let's go over here cool I hope that's that this is cool for you guys so you can see like what you're gonna be getting over the next few days throughout this challenge now I want to share a story with you from one of our students actually Dina over here so let me go ahead right there watch the winner reactions so here is Dina okay she lost her job due to kovin nineteen and here's her story she lost her job she's a mother who wants to be able to learn coding so she can actually help provide for her daughter and she joined the fiveday JavaScript developer challenge last month now here's what happened I want to share this with you guys this is what I'm really really excited about so here's her results four weeks since joining this fiveday JavaScript challenge check this out Deena came third in the last fiveday developer challenge which means that she got the profit with JavaScript course for free okay she led a talk in women in tech conference because she now had the skill set from joining this fiveday JavaScript developer challenge that urine she came first a week after and she won a coding hackathon literally after taking this five day challenge let me turn this off hopefully the beeps are now gone for you guys I said some somebody said that this was be strong and guys here's the most beautiful part of this all she landed her first job as a JavaScript developer three days ago so I don't know about you guys but like to me this means the world like what would it mean for you if you could you know if you are somebody like her or you want to be somebody like her who comes in and joins the challenge and then literally like a month later four weeks later you have a job and now you have a career and now you have a way to provide for your family members or whoever else what does not be inspiring for you guys what does not be powerful like I'm loving it guys keep the love coming yeah so this was absolutely brilliant I was so proud of her we were so excited so I just really wanted to share that with you guys all right let's keep it going Jose who joined our program you know he had lost his job because of kovat 19 and now he wants to become a JavaScript developer so he can have new sources of income I'm glad you guys love that part I said I you know I wanted to share that with you guys and just really yeah I don't know it was just it's just awesome thank you guys for a long me too actually sure that with you so Jose here right he joined our program profit with JavaScript because he saw an ad but he says like look I was working and I ended up losing my job who here by the way has lost their jobs because I covet 19 if you have just drop it in the comments below I would love to see it I mean I wouldn't love to see it but I would love to know what's going on actually and then maybe how we can help you right because if we can help you that just gives us more purpose and more that we want to do for you so has they actually lost his job due to coronavirus coming up you know on March 20th he says I was one of the 13 people that were let go due to the impact that the virus had and it costs words the company and he goes I'm currently working on becoming a better developer so that I can get a job within the industry and do coaching slash freelance work on the side this entire experience has shown me that having one source of income is a bad idea looking to turn this entire negative into a positive all right I see a lot of you guys a lost opportunity to get a job because of Cove 819 some of you just told me right now you lost an internship because of this Louie just says I lost my job Jessica told me she lost her job somebody said my life is harsh because of this yeah a lot of people are losing Leonardo said I lost my job aslam says I lost my job lost my job yeah so that's actually this is insane right so what would it mean for you to have this news like powerful tool like JavaScript or be able to learn a new skill set that then can give you more opportunity because guys reality is like coding is not going anywhere and everything is run by software for example think about posts mates and zoom and all of this right zoom has only gone up in use and now they need like a bajillion developers to be able to keep up with that right so you could see it as a really really bad thing or you could see it as like a powerful thing maybe you were like you know and I want to know this as well oh like that this happen to you where you were maybe kind of on the fence about becoming a developer for a while but kind of like coronavirus happening kind of set in the reality and now it's like actually one of your biggest driving forces you kind of want to get there faster do any of you guys feel like that but by any chance cuz I feel like for a person like me it gives me a kick and ask actually go and do more so honestly this could be actually a more powerful thing for you all right and here's the clever programmer team guys that we're putting this together for you okay so I just want to mention these guys because I'm not doing this all by myself as you can see I'm not alone I have Naz right here with me at all times okay I'm never alone just kidding Naz is right over here that's just a picture we got Jacob over here he's in the club with I don't know like this is is not a club you want to go to Jacob we got Sonny we got Junie Aaron Rachael Isabel Frankie this is the team that really is behind the scenes every single day putting this together for you guys right so please I just want you guys to take some time and just thank the team for putting it together I love these guys and appreciate them so much and honestly just lucky to be able to work with all of them they're just freakin amazing so thank you guys for putting this together all right let's keep it moving now I want to share somebody with you guys and this is Greg who's part of our profit JavaScript course I'm gonna share with you like how he landed a paying client even during this kovat 19 craziness inside our profit javascript course so here's Greg look at that beautiful family now why I've got two kids and this I love this dog I think it's an Akita just loved that so cool and Greg is just like you okay if you're here right now I want to tell you why Greg is just like you Greg shows up to the live training calls okay so for example these are in our profit JavaScript course we have these weekly training calls right and here is me with a lot less facial hair because the current coronavirus my freaking you guys can see what it did to my hair and my beard it's just insane how to control but back in the days pre coronavirus look like this and here is Greg right he's right there and Shaun says so motivational awesome right and he puts in the freaking work he's always there all the time and here's more about him even when our JavaScript instructor Naz you guys who you guys have met is running his epic live JavaScript training calls would like now we don't just have 25 plus people we have like over a hundred plus people on a live call we have so many people live at the upgrade our resume membership because we couldn't actually have more people greg is in there so here you go here's NAS okay and here's Greg look at that Greg is always there paying attention and working hard so we love Greg at clever programmer I hope you guys love Greg too and here's the thing about Greg Gregg he doesn't make excuses he shows up for his family he puts in the hard work to learn the technical coding skills he comes in with a beginner's mind to learn every day and as a result Gregg gets results who wants to be like Gregg I'm gonna raise my hand right now I want to be like Gregg all right let's get back to it fancy stuff I learned how to do fancy stuff you guys Ismaili okay cool it's all good by the time these guys get there I'll be so far ahead so now you guys might be asking like hey who are you Kazi besides the fact that you have a nice mustache and a nice head of hair very healthy who really are you and why should we pay attention that's a great question like honestly that's a phenomenal question baby we should just play that video right now that'd be funny all right so here's me just a humble guy from Pakistan not really that humble unfortunately I'm becoming more humble I'm learning how to become more humble yep and you know I started the channel I started on this journey of coding and I sucked my biggest motivation was my mom and being able to help her and get her surgery and that was like my driving force for why I wanted to learn coding and why I wanted to actually like make an income with coding and freelance and be my own boss and everything because I want to be able to spend time with my family take care of my family and then also I most importantly be able to provide financially for my family and for myself and so I started my youtube channel few years later boom it's it grew from zero nothing to over six hundred thousand almost six hundred thousand subscribers which is absolutely crazy I mean I'm just one guy and there are six hundred like I can't believe it every time I look I'm oh whoa what's going on so thank you guys for that at 21 I figured out how to make a hundred four thousand dollars a year as a freelance developer and I remember my professor came up to me and my college professor was like he came up to me and he was like hey you know can you help me with my career and he started helping me asking me for advice on tips for career questions and when my professor started asking you for career advice that's the moment I knew I had to kind of leave college because I was in college and I figured out how to freelance on the side and then grow my income really really fast over a period of one year and then I taught you know hundreds of thousands of students online oh my god Jean says I remember your 300k party on YouTube that is amazing that was so awesome it was a while ago yeah but it was just crazy thank you guys Abdullah says you're the best I appreciate you guys John Kaase has a positive attitude in life yep I love you too brother so what's what does it say here I can't even frickin read it okay hold on let my let it go away will I be able to read it ever oh yeah okay became a millionaire at 25 from learning these tools and things and applying them and yeah so let's move forward now who's ready to put in their 100% and play to win okay if you're here to put in your 2 percent or 3 percent may not be a good place to be at because everybody had clever programmer I mean we're at fun and games but when it gets time to put in the work we put in massive amounts of work like insane and so if you want to be a part of this community I want to ask you that question like are you actually ready to put in the work if you care about changing your life are you ready to do that because if you're not ready to do that then it doesn't matter how much motivational stuff you watch how good you feel how funny my jokes are it doesn't matter we're not gonna get very far so if you're ready to play to win drop that in the comments below and let me know and let's keep this show on the road now we'll go deep into building your personal roadmap for making $100,000 a year as a JavaScript developer on day 5 of our live training now quick question who would be excited about that would you be excited about building a road matter that's personalized to you that helps you make $100,000 a year I hope you are but for now let's figure out why you want to become a JavaScript developer sounds good guys cool let's keep it going now comment below what are three things more important to you than money let me know that right now why are you trying to learn coding what are things that are more important to you than money because if that's the only important thing guess what now gonna get very far awesome everybody's saying Miriam is saying I'm in Florence's I'm in Vignesh Abhishek Rishi Aaron yes let's go Karl says I'm in a meet says I'm excited beautiful guys I love hearing that I love hearing that so people are saying family freedom family cool what else happiness peace and contentment ok respect discipline freedom comfort time ok I love that so yeah I this is the this is awesome that those things are important to you guys right like family's important to you it sounds like freedom is important to you guys being happy job security some of you guys are saying some of you guys are saying being able to travel that's important cool now let's move on to another thing so make sure you guys got that down right for yourself the three things that are important for you okay make sure you got them down okay now let's move on to the next part so now I want you to comment below and let me know what can making money as a JavaScript developer help you achieve in your life so if you could make an extra $500 a month from JavaScript or maybe you could make $1,000 a month from JavaScript or 3,000 or 5,000 or 10,000 doesn't matter but just talk to me about what can that help you achieve in your life could it help you achieve financial freedom could it help you support your family and now you can pay their bills what specific because the more specific we can get the more likely we are to be able to achieve our goals right or get closer to them and would you be able to have more time to spend with your loved ones would it allow you to do that Jeremias saying a support my family want to travel flexibility family music helping people financial security love that Isak opportunity freedom create new solutions for problems dope okay now let's figure out now what we're gonna do okay this is an important part and we're gonna figure this out together right now guys so we got this part now we have why you're trying to learn to code what are the three most important things to you now we're getting to what you would do with the money that you make as a JavaScript developer and I'm just gonna take a quick pause here to say like you might think this is not important and you might think oh this is actually like random stuff and how does this have what does this have to do with JavaScript here's the thing once you have your Y set and strongly you can be coding for the next 12 months 24 months five years ten years it doesn't matter but what's gonna get you through those five years is what we talked about today what we talked about right now if you don't have this I just see people quitting again and again and again and again and you know we end up being the same that same person who like codes for three months and is stuck in tutorial purgatory and isn't in code Kadim II and free code camp and team treehouse and Udacity and Coursera and edex and all of this stuff and then boom they just find themselves confused and then they quit coding the difference between that person who quits and the person who will keep going is what we're doing right now so this is why we're doing this okay hope that makes sense now what we want to do is let's figure out your income goals okay so let's figure out engine goals how much income do you want to make per month now don't let me put thoughts into your mind right like for example I can be like oh my god you want to make ten thousand hundred thousand a month doesn't matter what I think what's important to you what will give you the lifestyle that you're looking for so come up with a number that's specific and good to you something that's you want to think optimistic but you're not thinking I'm gonna make a billion dollars this year or $1,000,000 something that you know in the next 12 months you could see yourself doing and it's a goal that you could actually start to strive for and see it as a reality so like from coding if you were to make an extra thousand dollars a month Slyke is that what you want your goal to be do you want it to be an extra $5,000 a month or $10,000 a month like what is it for you that makes you happy some realistic numbers I've seen some people they're like okay if I make 2,400 ollars a month I'm happy like it could pay for my rent my car my dis dad and the other thing and I'm good so what does that look like for you people are saying 3,500 a month 500 a month six thousand and one Joseph says three thousand a month awesome says 10k gene says four K for him says five Hugo says $13,000 a month Sakura says ten thousand okay cool so now what I want you to do Zachary says 87,000 and something number eighty seven thousand dollars a year okay so now these numbers that you guys have gone please make sure that you have a notebook or something next see that you could write this down and or maybe your phone anything where you can actually take these notes and write so you got your three most important things that are important to you than money you got your what you would do with the money you make and now you got how much money you want to make once we have those goals precisely set in guys will be able to do reverse engineering from that so on the left fifth day this information is gonna be vital for you because when we started develop that roadmap for you it has to be personalized and the only way it can get personalized is from what we're gonna do today so have these notes take them down and even tag me in them okay take a screenshot and tag me at clever Kazi okay CLE ve are clever QA Z icon Z and tag me on Instagram and I'll repost you and I'd love to love to see what you're up to now we're gonna move on to the next thing okay everybody cool with this okay I'm gonna move on now boom Xavier says I got notion for note keeping nice I love notion but sometimes it starts to break when you have a lot of text sent which is weird Danielle says now we're talking beautiful now I have a question for you guys do you want to freelance or fulltime so this part is up to you okay which one do you want more so I'll give you guys different scenarios okay neither is bad like my whole life I kind of was like freelance or you suck I don't really think that's true anymore it really depends on your personality type right so for those of you who value security more probably full time is gonna be better for you and for those of you who really care about being your own boss and all that freelance but just remember freelance there's inherently a higher amount of risk because you're the one who has to get clients okay but the benefits are you get to be your own boss you get to have multiple clients they're not just dependent on one fulltime on the other hand now you can you're you know you're maybe looking to land a dream job at a Fang company like Netflix Google or whatnot okay so I'm seeing a lot of freelance I'm seeing a lot of fulltime it almost seems like it's going both ways maybe I should start a poll hmm let me actually do that right now give me one second guys let's see if I can get fancy with this without breaking anything cuz that would suck so let's see I hope I don't break anything really really hope really really hope I don't break anything stream health yeah I don't think I'm gonna make a poll I just have I just have a feeling something's gonna break and it's gonna suck and the live stream is gonna end and I would rather not take that risk let's keep going guys alright so um overall the sense that I've gone is you guys are in the middle of both all right you guys want to do both that's totally fine okay I'll just tell you personally for me I wanted to do freelancing but don't let that restrict you okay both are good areas it just depends on your personality type cool so now make sure you have this written down somewhere too because we're really creating a custom profile for you right now and what your future looks like now let's talk about like why javascript right so what's so crazy about javascript why should you learn it why does it matter now javascript is a super popular language right so popularity is absolutely insane so we're gonna get just a little bit into that so here's javascript and boom you can build all kinds of things so on Stack Overflow it got number one right on all respondents it's the most popular technology now you can build web apps like Facebook you can build Android apps like the Tesla app with JavaScript or you can build server side apps like Netflix is that pretty cool what do you guys think that awesome you would want to make something like Facebook Tesla app or Netflix I think so I think that'd be pretty dope now let's talk about job opportunities and salary with JavaScript okay so what does that really look like so JavaScript developers salaries my experience in the US now don't let the u.s. part scare you guys away guys because I know a lot of you are not in the US and that's okay just remember that you can work remotely from your own country in u.s. or some kind of Western market like Germany or some other country right like there you're much more likely to get paid a higher amount like for example if you're somebody who's living in a living in Philippines or Macedonia or India or whatnot just know that in your own country might not get paid that much but if you figure out a way to get into the US market and work remotely which is not that hard these salaries are available potentially for every single one of you guys okay so just be aware of that and here the salaries so in 2020 the salary for somebody with even less than one year of experience is actually look at this freaking $75,000 guys a year isn't that cool seventyfive thousand dollars a year with less than one year of experience of course it doesn't mean you can just go in there and suck you have to work hard during that one year or less but if you get a job this is actually very possible for you here of JavaScript jobs that are available right now on indeed.com about 45,000 jobs and this is the salary range so if you actually look at it seventyfive thousand plus ninety five thousand plus so the jobs are all there for you okay this is not the matter of whether it exists or not it's just a matter of you sticking with it and improving your skill set all right and if you want to freelance here are 8,000 jobs that are available right this second on up work you can go on up work and actually start pulling jobs from there okay and in our courses we teach you actually like in this five day challenge we actually pulled a Google Maps job that's worth five thousand seven hundred ollars from up work and we're gonna build it live together so I hope you think that's pretty freakin amazing alright so this is what I was talking about earlier US Canada Germany United Kingdom you guys can get in these markets ok JavaScript as a JavaScript developer and yes in USA you might be looking to make on average the most amount of money per month about six thousand a month whereas Canada and Germany you're looking at about four thousand a month and United Kingdom 3000 so just keep in mind the world is really really massive and it doesn't matter what country you're in even your own country in relative terms will pay you really good for being a developer but if you can get into these markets doesn't matter what country you're from then you're looking to make a really good amount of money okay all right now you might be like that's all great Kazi but what about after this kovat nineteen coronavirus thing so I hope Deena's story gave you some insight but let's go a little bit deeper into this okay like you guys saw Deena landed a job in the middle of Kovac 19 you guys saw you guys remember Greg when I showed you guys Greg just a little bit ago like Greg landed clients in the middle of this so it's possible but here's something I was reading recently which was published on March 22nd and here a hundred developer jobs and companies still hiring during this Cove in nineteen cool so Lego is actually looking for JavaScript developers of all levels even beginner so here's Lego right Natalie and she's put she posted and she's like we were team in London and we're hiring permanent JavaScript engineers for all levels cool is your sure easier sure a sure there you go Thanks yeah there we go we got it guys we got this this is what happens guys when you're when you're from Pakistan and you come to America and you know like I'm just real talk here right like let's go here you go from Pakistan and you English not your first language there's some funny stuff that happens what makes my W's and these my my w.zahn my V's so I'll mix them up sometimes like we for when data instead of v4 but whatever guys that's just a sidebar let's uh let's get back into the training whoops which camera do I have put the wrong camera on hold on guys we gotta fix this how do we fix this there we go totally fixed people say yeah alright so azure is looking for entry totally relatable that's funny so here we go man says nice girl thank you so much I appreciate it okay so we're looking to hire for a number of different roles blah blah blah and they're like hey we're looking for professionals to entry level across dev and p.m. okay it's an incredibly exciting space so this is just to show you guys that possibilities and it exists Disney is looking for a JavaScript developer so they're actually looking for a JavaScript developer of all experiences at Disney convertkit which is a software that I used to send you guys emails all the time okay they're looking for JavaScript developers right now okay so now the question maybe you're still asking is hey what can you really do with JavaScript so I've shown you guys you can build web apps you can build mobile apps you can build server apps like Netflix web apps like Facebook like Tesla I've shown you guys like kovat 19 apps and the Google Maps projects or students have built but like here's a beatbox app rights on the left hand side you have a total waterfront we're not gonna look at the live demo of this but I'm just gonna show you guys and on the left hand side you got the wireframe and this was like when we were starting the app and on the right hand side we have a finished version of the app okay and a if you want to learn how to build a beatbox app just remember we build it in our profit with JavaScript course which will actually be announcing and launching next week so I hope you guys are excited about this profit JavaScript course but this is of course if you want to take your knowledge to a deeper level okay but for now if you guys are in the ciao you guys don't need the course you guys can just follow along for now alright so we build this entire thing out you can see that now here's one another thing you could do with JavaScript so here's a Twitter wireframe on the left hand side and on the right hand side here's a Twitter mockup okay wouldn't that be cool who would think that would be really cool if you could go from this thing on the left hand side to a fully working app of Twitter on the right hand side like this but that kind of like blow your mind you'll be like oh my god you could do it just with JavaScript oh my god mom look at this I'm so proud of myself this will be crazy right here so here's a Twitter clone and again if you want to learn how to build this we build it in a JavaScript course then you can go like module by module and learn every technical detail and then be able to put it together put it on your resume and be super fancy and you know get hired and then here's a Google Maps wireframe okay so who's excited about building a Google Maps app we're gonna be building this in this challenge freaking live guys so on the left hand side we have a store locator right and on the right hand side check this out we got the Google Maps app so boom you go from wireframe to on the right hand side the final version cool Leslie says it's so cool shams Joe a new awesome loving this guy's I love your guys's energy all right let's keep going I don't know why one put one person put angry face on it's just throwing me off it's like one person out of all of these people is angry at me but you know I hope the rest of you guys are liking this that's really missing letting yeah I gotta like play some songs anyways let's keep going guys alright so hope hopefully most of you guys are liking this besides that one person who's angry and maybe we can win them over to it by the end of this alright Google Maps project so this is a Google Maps project that you guys will build and it will be live and you guys will have hosted it online and people can type the freakin thing and use your app like it will be crazy like you'll be able to share with anybody you'll be able to play around with it you'll have it on your portfolio it's awesome okay and just want to say to you guys you know I get you guys are hyped and pumped just remember it might be difficult when you're working on this and you'll be like this doesn't feel like a beginner project oh my god well here's the thing for now just follow along build it it will make sense later as you go and specially once you have build it but what we want to do with you guys and give you guys an amazing experience right where you can build something that's real and realworld so even if you're a beginner and you feel like man I'm falling behind just work to catch up even if you have to copy paste code to put stuff together just get it working cuz in my experience the best way to learn coding is just to get in there and get your hands dirty okay just play with it have fun honestly I just think that's how you get good you don't get good by just like constantly learning theory forever you get good in my opinion by getting in there practicing breaking things it's kind of the equivalent of like if I want to teach you soccer and I just kept giving you lessons on a chalkboard instead of like getting you to kick a soccer ball right so what we're trying to do here is just getting you to kick a soccer ball get used to it and then you can learn the technical details a lot later cool all right so just have that mentally prepared in your mind so when you feel like giving up you're like no no I remember cause he told me don't give up right now just work through this you guys with me so far you promise you won't quit on me right Drive this challenge we work really hard to put this together for you we really want you to complete it and have it on your portfolio okay so please stick with us and keep going love your face alright let's get back to it all right I'm loving your guys's energy by the way alright so we're gonna build as Google Maps project it's worth fifty seven hundred dollars on up work and you'll be building this on day two day three and day four of the live JavaScript developer challenge who's excited about this alan says I promise jim says yes curtis says i cross my heart beautiful love that all right let's go so we got the store locator this is what you guys are gonna build it memory guys this is a real project not a dummy project not a baby project it's a real project that's worth fifty seven hundred from up work that we brought down and now you get to build it cool so kinda as realworld as it gets okay so we try to make it exciting and realworld combined the two boom you get clever programmer another thing I want to share with you guys alright I know that we're going we're covering so much but are you guys excited you guys want me to cover more value bomb stuff even though it might hurt your head but like I just have so much stuff prepared guys I just want to keep going I just want to give you guys I just want to give as much as possible so if that's cool with you guys I'm gonna keep going then alright you guys are saying go love it alright so the modern JavaScript developer pyramid of wealth so what is this this is something that actually my girlfriend actually helped me turn into a diagram because this was in my head for a really long time but I couldn't ever like get it into a diagram so now what we have done is I kind of shared this with her and we were trying to whiteboard it on that whiteboard over the big whiteboard right behind me and I was like ah my head hurts how do I do this and then finally she like started drawing like she's like oh like a pyramid right and then building it out and finally she built and I'm like this is it this is everything that I've been trying to explain for the last like three or four years and now it's just in one page and this is quite possible and the most valuable things for a developer to have like as a developer if I could get hands on the thing that I'm about to show you right now I would literally have it printed on my freaking wall and on my phone screen and I'll just look at this every single day because it literally gives you the step by step of how you want to get to where you want to get to and how you can increase your income as well okay so some numbers I'm gonna share with you in here they're like a little high so it might be confusing to you might be like oh my god these numbers look too high they're like not believable but I just want you to think relatively I just put them there to simplify math and just explain how this works okay now I took this to making ten fifteen thousand dollars a month myself you could take this to any level you want you want to take this to making one thousand a month you can do that you want to take this time making 10k a month you could do that okay with enough hard work of course so let's get into this so number one thing that you want to do is of course you want to learn alright that's nonnegotiable so step one of the pyramid right here is learn the technical coding skills to become a modern JavaScript developer okay no my girlfriend is actually a professional boxer she's not a developer but she's really really good visually and understands how things work so it's helpful for me to speak to her cuz she's not so like into coding so then if she says that an idea makes sense then it's like okay if it makes sense that somebody who's not in the coding world then oh my god it would make so much sense to like majority of the people that look at it right so it's really about taking an idea and simplifying it as much as humanly possible cool all right so step one learn alright this is the first step that you guys are going to be doing then step two here's what I recommend for you guys okay so if you are a so this is what I recommend coach teach coding to other people okay and the required skill level for this is beginner and actually the time to build a stream of income of up to three thousand dollars a month right here it will take you about one to three months so even if you're a complete beginner right now if you actually spend one to two months just diving in hardcore and learning JavaScript and coding and building projects and even following this you guys can actually start going and getting clients where you're teaching them coding this is the crazy thing that we saw in the despite a challenge that we did last month we had the students going like start implementing the strategy or they started learning coding and then started going getting clients and this started getting people who were just like one step behind them so this might seem like a really intimidating thing how can I teach coding how can I teach this why would somebody pay me you have to be one step ahead of that person most people the truth is don't even know how to run one line of JavaScript code and like run it they don't even know you can run it in a browser so if you can be one step ahead of them you can actually charge them and teach them does that make sense to you guys think of it like remember in math class when you might have been younger and like the teacher was explaining something to you and you were just like man I'm so confused this makes no sense and then instead you went to like a friend of yours and that friend taught you that same concept but it's so much easier and you understand you know like thank God well is it because your friend is better than your teacher no right it's because your friend just explains to you in a better way because it's more relatable but the teacher is way more advanced than your friend so what I'm saying is you just have to be your friend to teach somebody else you don't have to be at the level of the teacher hopefully that makes sense cool so you guys can actually do this and be learning coding while making money at the same time this was one of the biggest secrets that I found when I was doing I was growing my career and whatever you teach and another benefit for teaching right how many times does this happen to you guys where you teach a concept to somebody else and when you teach it to them you become better at it you guys know what I'm talking about like literally your skill set improves so freaking much because you were teaching somebody else and things start to make sense so that's kind of how I look at this where you teach other people you become good and then you start to make money in the first one to three months hopefully this makes sense to you guys okay and you could be making $3,000 a month as early as one your first one to two months of coding okay this is like a little bit controversial advice where people all my god that's impossible you can never do this oh we have tons of students that are doing this at clever programmer like so many students I did this when I started and I promise you you'll be able to do this as well you just have to make sure you complete step one really well alright then what I recommend step three for you right so step one you can be a beginner and be able to actually build a strain of income some of you getting this is making sense okay awesome love it here's step three for you okay the this is where I recommend you guys freelance so instead of just going straight from learning coding and trying to get a job which is really really hard what I recommend is then you coach and you build a stream of income and then you go freelance as step three so freelance means work for clients independently the required skill level is intermediate so you don't actually have to be like a super Pro you could actually be intermediate skill level and do freelancing and the time to build this stream of income is actually four to twelve months and what I say is like your goal should be to hit five thousand dollars a month from freelancing okay who would be excited to make five thousand dollars a month from freelancing with JavaScript would you be mind blown by that oh my god that'd be so cool but here's a really cool part so because it's a pyramid it like stacks on top of each other you're making you're really making three thousand dollars a month from coaching on top of which you're making five thousand dollars a month from freelancing if you don't let go of any of your coaching clients meaning what does that mean you're looking to make how much per month if you execute this really really well and put in the work you're looking to make about eight grand a month from this strategy alone okay just really insane amount of execution is required on your end but it's a very very possible path cool a lot of tacos and then step four is what I recommend is step four you really start looking for a fulltime job if you want to for me there was never any step for oh just step two and three and I just scale this up to like making over a hundred grand a year just these two steps okay even just with coaching you can come pretty close to making six figures they're a bunch of people who are just teaching coding and they're making too close to six figures okay the tons of online platforms likewise ant take lessons people per hour Facebook groups you can go to and get clients from Instagram groups that are about coding beginner coding you can get clients from ton of stuff will get really deep into it on the last day I won't get too deep into it now but just highlevel so last step is job okay this is where you work fulltime as a developer the required skill level I say for this is advanced and the time to build this stream of income you're really looking at 12 to 24 months so one to two years of timeline alright but instead of just trying to go for a job and doing nothing else I recommend you coach then on top of that you build another stream of income freelance now you have two streams of income on top of that you can get a job okay so now you have essentially three streams of income if you want it but if you want to give up coaching and freelancing once you get a job you could do that too okay and with job you're looking to make seven thousand dollars a month or more if you're working fulltime as a JavaScript developer okay average developer salary about six to seven grand a month you know at least in the United States all right so if you execute this perfectly and you do all of the steps and you stack and you're just working overtime and doing all of this your income potential is $15,000 a month which again I know it sounds really really crazy and insane but it's definitely very very possible or you could just be like hey I don't want to do all of this I can just like you can get rid of the freelancing and you can get rid of the coaching and you can just focus on the job does that make sense or you can just focus on freelancing and this is where your personal goal comes in like do you need to make 15 grand a month probably not maybe you just need to make $2,400 a month maybe you just need to make thousand dollars extra per month right so really depends up to you okay does this make sense to you guys I'm about to move on okay if you do all four steps yet Trey you will have no life but it could be pretty worth it so now if you guys want to take a photo of this now would be the time and I will move on from this in five four three two one all right moving on cool now there are seven most important Abbot's to get you there okay so you're really looking at like you want to develop things like fun hard work and I'm gonna now I'm gonna start going rapidfire guys and I'm gonna just speed it up a lot just because I want to be sensitive of your guys it's time and and then maybe we can even get into Q&A s at the end of it okay so fun is important if you're not having fun you're really not gonna go far with coding or it's gonna be really really difficult I see some people just brutally working their way through it and they always look miserable it's like do you not want to be happy like don't code if it's not gonna make you happy right ultimately you should be doing something that doesn't feel like work so for me coding literally always felt like playing a video game and then I'm just like what's wrong with people are paying me to play a video game like I would pay our coding is so fun I want to pay people to be able to work for them but if you do it the right way people will pay you okay so make sure fun is there for you all right hard work is of course really really important being patient is important teamwork communication and some things I want to highlight is always you want to be learning and taking initiative okay always always be learning like as a developer you're learning never ends and you should actually love learning that's one of your best skills here's one student from our profit JavaScript community Carl he put it really really well he said so mindset is key okay and he goes hey Jackson just dive in so Jackson was somebody who like needed help and was struggling with something so cause like hey Jackson just dive in ask for help and review the material until you internalize it in addition to the pwj program I registered for the JavaScript challenge I'm a newbie myself but do not let fear become a block this is about your goals and your future keep the target in sight and do not allow mundane disruptions and distractions cannot read it to pull you off target stay focused be persistent don't quit and you will materializer in ten objective you can feel like quitting and that's okay just don't quit and one more thing stay away from negative people enjoy the journey with people who are likeminded welcome to your new tribe so I thought this was really powerful and I want to share that with you guys because I feel like mindset is just such a freaking important key to the kingdom and this is something that you guys kind of have to have it internalized and I hope just brought you value as well okay I'm gonna move on from this now now we'll be helping you build your tech skills live in the training tomorrow to kickstart your career now guys I want to ask you who is excited who is excited about this are you guys excited about building your tech skills live in the training tomorrow to kickstart your career your JavaScript she's excited you're live JavaScript skills cool you'll be building this freaking project tomorrow it will start being on your resume and your portfolio starting tomorrow okay this will be yours will give you will show it to you will give you the code to it literally you'll see every single step of it I hope you guys are excited boom we're starting to get people we're excited I'm excited kamaal says I'm excited for Navi prett um Ceaser T Joseph so many exclamation marks love it Aya's excited abdullah Kiska Sabir awesome so now do you guys want to see who will be training you live tomorrow do you guys wanna see who's gonna be your instructor all right let's see it let's see who's gonna be your instructor alright this is gonna be your JavaScript instructor now you've met him his name is NAS should I do you guys have met him his name is NAS he's worked oh yeah hold on let me do this again ya should have practiced before this right now this guy has had the privilege to work at interview with big companies like Google he's interview with Squarespace Twitter Khan Academy and Palantir now let me ask you don't you want to work with somebody who has experience interviewing with the biggest tech companies on the freakin planet and then that guy comes and shows you how to code not only is he handsome but he has the freaking skills don't you want to learn from that type of person not some boring freaking instructor that puts you to freaking sleep all the goddamn time and doesn't care about coding well that's what you're gonna get tomorrow all right so if you don't set up your alarm and you don't do that right now for tomorrow 12 p.m. Pacific I mean that's on you that's on you like I mean how do we do this this is showing me nice that's on you my friend so what I will tell you right now is go ahead just on your phones little sidebar right set an alarm for 12 p.m. Pacific tomorrow for analysis training when I say Pacific that's California time what's California time Los Angeles time PST okay a lot of people get confused about this stuff baby so I can take a picture with this thing too so do that you're gonna thank me later okay do not you don't want to miss that training that trainings just gonna freakin blow your mind all right let's get back into this thing same time as today guys same time as today all right so man this is so now I want to just kind of I'm gonna start skimming through some of this stuff right so now after one to two months of solid training and building up your technical JavaScript skills guys now you're gonna be ready to develop a new stream of income okay so you remember this learn step then the next step is coaching so we're gonna help you with the learn step even in this live training okay and after one to two months for you personally what your plan will look like is now you're ready to actually start making an income with coding okay so pillar number one of your income streams I remember it it was coaching freelancing and then getting a fulltime job right hopefully you guys remember that so step one coaching to beginners so here we have some Stu in our courses that are landing these clients okay subdue is one of our students and he closed the student for $850 for 12 calls that comes out to be about $71 an hour so wouldn't that be cool for you if you learned some JavaScript skills for one months and then you went and you got another client that you could teach JavaScript coding to because it's a valuable skill set that people want to learn and people specially now because the Cova 19 everybody wants to learn coding okay it's a valuable skill set and you could charge them 70 dollars an hour and if you couldn't even charge them 70 what if you could just charge them 50 what if you get just charged in thirty five or twenty five or $15 an hour wouldn't that be freaking amazing but how amazing would this be all right Michael lecompt who's one of our students he landed a client for $40 an hour okay he was like super pumped about that and were pumped for him he he landed multiple clients actually just in one week okay Greg and remember guys we showed you Greg earlier Greg landed a client during this and here's what Greg did right he learned the technical coding skills something that you might want to do at this point then he used online platforms to land clients who were beginners in JavaScript in his first month he actually landed a client yeah you can you guys can record this if you guys want somehow now in our program profit with JavaScript we go into extreme detail on helping you build up your technical coding skills and teaching you how to land clients and jobs so who's excited who would be excited if you got this training from me nas directly where we not only give you the tech skills but literally showed you how to land clients and guided you through that process would you be excited would that be something that's actually valuable for you and bring value to your life so if that's something that would be valuable to you I just want you to keep it in your mind that you know take as much value from this challenge as you possibly and humanly can but in a week when we launch the course you might want to look into and look for our profit JavaScript course okay because like if you want to go really deep we can go really deep later cool so let's keep going with this all right your second pillar of income is gonna be freelancing as a JavaScript developer okay and remember freelancing is a huge freaking economy all right there's a three point seven trillion dollar global gig economy and it's only growing every single year okay it's one point two eight trillion just in the US alone so you can grab a piece of that economy it's tiny it's a drop in the ocean so don't think like oh my god there's too much competition I can never become a developer that's false it's just all drops in the ocean okay so don't let that like thing come in your mind cool Radian says I can I still purchase profit javascript yeah if you want to jump in right now you're welcome to jump in and join the course that's totally fine too or if you just want to like focus on the challenge for now you can do that as well it's up to you all right and here's our student nazar who landed a hundred and ten thousand dollar contract with javascript so this was pretty freakin crazy but I remember on the left hand side you guys can see this one day on slack this guy messages me and he's like holy cow he's like I just got a contract for one hundred and ten thousand dollars this is all thanks to you Kazi but i'll use javascript and 90% of the code armorlike it blew my mind I saw his blew my mind so you can see at the bottom I'm like yo NAS look what the like that is amazing so freelancing right is a different ballgame so you had coaching you can make income from it freelancing is all over the place but it's possible if you're somebody who's skilled and you put in the work you can actually land a pretty insane contract okay but again I'm just showing you guys I'm just sharing this with you guys to see what is possible and what is available so you're maybe more inspired and motivated to code because you know it's not like you're gonna just make a minimumwage job you get to do something that's fun you get to make an impact in the world and you get to have freedom all right and then the last but not least the last step is you know of course you're trying to get a job and so that's your third pillar you know that's your third step to get a job it's a coaching freelancing job did you guys find this valuable so far was this exciting for you guys did this either inspire you or excite you or something do something I hope it did alright and now I hope that this gave you guys a stepbystep action plan and now here's the thing tomorrow this is what you'll be learning and building you guys you're gonna be learning how to build this Google Maps project okay you'll be learning technologies like JavaScript jQuery how to use the Google Maps API and things like that okay so make sure you take either a photo of this or write this down in your notes whatever you need to do so you're mentally prepared for tomorrow now guys this is the crazy thing is I am excited for you guys a lot of you guys are staying this was valuable and your palm and you loved it and you enjoyed it but here's a freaking awesome thing guys we haven't even started yet tomorrow is really where it's like day two is where you get into it okay so you want to come in with your best and highest energy tomorrow get good sleep set an alarm clock tell everybody to not disturb you because this is a pivotal moment in your life you guys remember I'm going to show you Dina a little bit earlier she joined this challenge and she focused and she put in the work and boom now she has clients now she got a job gotten insane results and we have so many students like that like yep eqing and we have Michael and Greg landing results and it has changed their life so for you this could be like that tomorrow so please just come in with your full heart and energy alright now here's your homework guys here's your homework for today cool nozzles in the comments you're gonna you're gonna need to download the portfolio and don't worry guys this homework will be delivered to deliver to you through email and messenger as well I also want you to take a screenshot of it right now once I finish laying this out for you so you're gonna need to download this portfolio okay this is the portfolio we're gonna give you for free so literally guys how exciting is this like on your first day you're getting a full portfolio okay watch the video because in the video we show you how to cuss my portfolio so you can change the image change the text to your name and make it your own okay so then later when you build a Google Maps app you can actually put it on this portfolio and it's ready to go okay and this portfolio is like tested with companies and it's like job ready that's higher ready you don't have to like get another portfolio ever again we'll show you how to run this portfolio locally on your computer we're gonna show you how to update you're gonna need to update your profile in this portfolio you're gonna need to update your experience over here you're gonna need to update your description you're gonna need a screenshot your portfolio and then you're gonna need to upload it as a face a comment to a Facebook post to upload your homework you're gonna just come to the comment section and then upload a picture of the portfolio does this make sense guys okay and you can do this literally you know as a picture to this post or another post that we post up all right here's another thing you must do okay download Visual Studio code so make that a dude down you're going to download Visual Studio code and have it ready because this is what's gonna help set you up for success when it's time okay so there you guys go how was this guys was this exciting or what you guys enjoy it I hope you guys got a lot of value out of this oh man Dan we got lots of reactions I don't even know how many comments you know we don't know how many comments we got guys I just we have lots of reactions and all of that okay guys so at this point what I want to do is provide as much value to you as possible and just rapidfire stuff so in the meantime you guys are preparing for the homework and getting ready for tomorrow what I want to do is like let's just go back and forth and ask me your toughest questions ask me whatever you need to and I'm gonna start popping it up on the screen and answering it for you guys okay so like let's just jump in the more value like it's just oneonone right now just you and me okay so if I see your question it's good I pop it up boom I can answer it it's flying literally flying I can't even catch it like the comments are flying Wow well nearly 2k what does that mean somebody's had to get all comments somebody said 10,000 comments wow that's a lot Pankaj yaoi says do we need to install something else except weak hold on guys I'm gonna need to drink ginger beer you know hold on dance right now wait wait I think now we can dance all right cool sorry guys was dancing and drinking ginger beer and lost a lot of the questions my bad okay Logan says Rafa Kazi how much can I add to this portfolio can I had bootstrap 4 to it and style it to my liking Logan first of all what's up my friend thank you for being here appreciate you brother now absolutely you can hold on let me let me make it so it never goes away the comment because I like it so yes you can take the portfolio that we're gonna give you and you can customize it to your own liking you can use materialized CSS you can use bootstrap you can use whatever you want customize it however you want we're just gonna give you a portfolio we're gonna show you how to change it up and then if you want to get frisky with it go ahead and do that okay Ravi says is it going to be pure JavaScript or are recovering libraries and frameworks Oh Ravi great question mostly it's gonna be pure JavaScript there might be a little bit of jQuery but mostly we're gonna try to keep it as pure JavaScript as possible because pure JavaScript applies to all frameworks and everything so hopefully that answers your question mohamad asks when are you going to start a challenge for Python like this I imagine at some pool we got 869 viewers live yo what's up guys how's it going it's awesome so we're good not yeah well I'm thinking we're gonna do a Python challenge like this sometime soon you know probably a month or two months from now Amma says is it ok with bracket that I Oh code editor yeah if you're comfortable with it like if you have some other code editor of your choice and you're super comfortable that's okay just make sure that sometimes in vs code if we're going through and you get confused with the code editor or something along those lines then you're kind of on your own if you're using a different code editor but if you're more experienced it doesn't matter you can use whatever you want but if you're more of a beginner I recommend just like modeling the exact setup we're recommending for you like actually having Visual Studio code and all of the setup so you can just follow along without any problems Zach says how much free rein do we have updating the portfolio can I go crazy with CSS and personalization absolutely go crazy with it we're always looking to see like when it comes to like who's gonna win in the challenge and all of that write it for us and just depends your participation level how high is your participation are you like consistently commenting and engaging with the community are you making working on the projects that are awesome so if you're customizing and spending extra time into it personalizing and making it awesome will probably pick your project over a lot of other people's because we're seeing how much heart you're putting into it right because we go through everybody's projects and we take a look at it so yeah the more you do the better nice okay Wow lots of messages coming in guys Clary says Larry says funny I just finished a Paredes bharata's ginger beer nice this is a no this is boon de Burgh but it's delicious it's really really good a nice day asks is the course for all ages absolutely it is show beat says how do you tackle the feeling that I'm not capable enough for a certain task what's weird about that is like you just overcome it somehow meaning like sometimes you get help okay and be open to that so I'm really like I'm like I'll try as hard as I can and I'll keep working on it for a long time and then I'll try to get help if I can because there's somebody who knows the answer to it or somebody who knows how to figure it out get good at finding those people whether it looks like there it come in the shape of as friends or family members or maybe they come in the form of like you hiring somebody from code mentor that I owe paying them $70 an hour and like learning from them how to overcome the problem or the challenge okay Xavier says are one of the api's we're gonna learn REST API or graph QL in this one I I don't think you're gonna learn graph QL maybe some REST API I don't think there's a but it's just general API work with like um you know Google Maps API so you're gonna learn how to play around Google Maps API quite a bit so that's what you're gonna get to learn in this okay definitely no graph QL in this one Clayton says how realistic is it to complete your training and get a sixfigure salary I'll tell you this like what's realistic is what we see works really well for people is they do a lot outside of just our training whoa somebody's yeah going crazy in the comments so for example what that means is you might join the program go through the entire training and then you like learn the fundamentals and you get started and you're making your first 500 or 1500 or like three thousand dollars a month and then you use that momentum over like the next 12 months 24 months and then you're realistically looking at a you know high income whether it's from freelancing or a job and you're looking at like a sixfigure salary but it's a long arduous process it's not so simple like you'll join the training in like four months later you're coming out making a hundred thousand dollars it doesn't work like that you will need to spend a tremendous amount of hours and putting in just brutal amount of work there's like no shortcut for that so the way that I scale to making a hundred thousand dollars in my first year was because I just worked like incredibly hard like meaning I was putting in 18 hours a day into coding so in three months I was able to start scaling my income from five to ten thousand dollars a month from coding because my three to four months where somebody's like two years of coding just because not because I was a smart just because I spent that much time that like you might spend in two years I figured out how to spend it in three months does that make sense so it really depends on you if you are a psychopath like me and you just go allin and you do nothing else and that's what you do for 1015 hours a day you can be on that route and four or five months you know and like you're working really hard on your technical skills you're working really hard on the outreach of getting clients or jobs and lining up interviews yes you can get there but if you don't do that which my guess is most people most 90 percent of the people like average person never does that they're like oh it's the minimum number of hours do I need to spend into coding those are the people that don't really make it that far because they're just trying to spend five hours a week they're like yeah that's a good time five hours a week that's good well then they're looking to get the results in two years or three years but if you can try to maximize as much time as possible now I know a lot of people are busy a lot of you guys have jobs or you know you guys have families so you can't do 15 hours a day of coding but what's the max you can do how much max focus can you put in if you can do that you can make the result happen a lot sooner oh I'm sorry guys the tap is annoying why is the tap why can people hear the tap I'm so confused about that um sorry about that guys now it should be gone apologize just learning the software you know Zachary says besides bootstrap do you have any other frameworks you recommend so frontend I recommend materialise quite a bit I love it so you can try giving materialise it's made by Google you can give that a try can I do my project with vanilla J s alone yes you can whatever you can do with Jake where you can do with vanilla J's because at the end of the day it's just JavaScript so yeah oh yeah there's a we have a developer who teaches react to in our course profit JavaScript or sunny he's awesome and he loves react maybe after the challenge is over if you guys want we could build more projects and more apps in this group you know we will take a poll from you guys and ask you what kind of stuff you guys want to build and then we'll build it right here that'll be freaking really really fun there's so many questions coming in you guys I'm sorry I'm just having trouble keeping up with it like it's really difficult okay so Yuri asked so this is a little like different question but I think I kind of want to answer it so Yuri says I want to become a millionaire before 25 I'm currently 17 can I yes yes that's the short answer for it but how it's like for me what helped was getting really good at coding and then scaling my income really really fast right so like I figured out how to get really good at coding just cuz I loved it and everything got crazy good at it really fast by just putting in lots of hours and if you guys have any background on me I failed in like almost every math class I had a terrible GPA in my college and all of that like a 2.8 below a 2.0 I got like a 1.9 GPA I don't have a degree from college as a college dropout what other good qualities do I have let's see I give good hugs my girlfriend says that's good yeah so basically like any technical stuff or anything like that like math or whatever like I sucked at it so just so you guys know I didn't give you context like I'm not some math genius or anything like that I just put I just put in a lot of time into it so I want to just bring it to that like a lot of putting in a lot of time is gonna be the thing that helps you get there faster and once you can scale up your income then if you want to go and you want to make a million dollars a year or more that's gonna happen not from a job but then you're doing the thing that's above it so for example you starting your own SAS company so like you become such a good developer and then you learn marketing and then use like launch a software as a service company so think like you guys know about calendly literally all they do is a calendar app literally just a calendar freaking app they make 30 million dollars a year it's just a calendar still can't get over that convertkit okay if I showed you guys convertkit so let me actually go up here and look up convertkit bear metrics and cool so here we go convertkit and you can actually see they have made all their finances publicly available so you guys can actually go to convertkit bear metros comm this is a company that provides email it's a software okay that just lets you send email so a lot of people all at once okay just email guys and this company now does what 1.8 million dollars per month you do 1.8 million dollars per month so what is that 1 million times 12 to 22 million dollars a year so yes it's very possible keep your mind open keep keep going just think oh I want to make like 10 thousand or a hundred thousand you can make a lot more than a hundred thousand dollars a year like once you learn how to make a hundred thousand dollars a year it's actually like not that much hey Pascale do you want to stop asking the same question over and over again because we're gonna remove you baby somebody just so we can keep the quality high because it seems like some people are spamming the chat and so we're just gonna remove them but yeah guys this is an email software what it allows you to do send emails you don't have to be a brilliant coder to build something like this because you can on the on your backend you could use something like send grid okay send grid literally allows you to create a app that lets other people send emails so you can you send grid to build your app so like for all we know they could just be using send grid and now they've just found a way to sell this experience to other users and make it amazing I use their service convertkit service and it's a lot so keep your brain forward and be thinking about like what other things you can do right so for somebody who's asking me how can you become a millionaire before 25 by taking it at a level where you can provide this to a lot of people at once meaning like oftentimes your yourself into a business right you're offering the service to many many people cool okay so there you go gene says thanks buddy I'm and cool too gene says John Warren thanks buddy I'm an old telecom engineer out of software for 18 years looking to upgrade my skill stay in touch well awesome gene welcome you're in the right place and we'll help you upgrade your tech skills and be able to sum and support you every step of the way so thank you for being here t says any techniques on how to win proposals on up work my proposals have been rejected sell severally to a point I gave up with freelance work here's a hack ultimate hack T what I recommend is actually do this okay so get loom get loom video okay get this software and what this allows you to do is actually make videos and send them out okay so I would highly recommend you actually get something like this and instead of sending written proposals like you write something to them but send a link to the video and just be like hey I made a video for you and then your video looks something like this hey what's up I'm team you needed an ecommerce app built as I saw in your portfolio and guess what I can actually help you build it here are a few ecommerce apps I've built then like screencast and show them some of your own ecommerce app so you're working on or maybe you've built and then send that in okay short one two minute video personally made for that person and you can do it extremely fast and then watch what happens literally every single person is gonna bringing you on and getting you and asking you to be on interview with them okay so that's gonna be super super powerful cool thank you guys [Laughter] aziz it's funny because on our team we have one developer jacob who loves view and then we have one developer sunny who loves react but I'm team react cuz of sunny you know Jacob he builds these apps that don't look that good so yeah yeah the he has good back in but he's too much of a software developer you know he just focuses too much on that so the apps don't look good but uh that's why I'm team react Jas well maybe we should have like a versus you know there's about like Jacob versus sunny and then they're like live code Julius do we just post a homework on the Facebook group yes you will upload your homework as a comment to our existing Facebook posts you know you will just upload it Abdulla says you putting in a lot of information hell yeah you know that's how we do it lots of value people are literally recorded each word how I loved it yep Zakaria says how's the Google Maps project valued at 5700 so on up work somebody had the exact specs that we are currently gonna build into this project but there was a job posting that said we need a developer to build a Google Maps project and it should be able to connect with api's and it should be a store locator that I shouldn't be able to locate stores within like a CERN's if code so we took all those specs we broke it down step by step we had Naz actually do the entire freelancing project once he did that project we then we were like okay now let's turn it into a video like well then we actually went through and practiced and and like made it step by step so we could teach anybody didn't build this 5700 our project and that's what we're actually gonna be bringing for you tomorrow and helping you build so it's a real project that somebody's out there paying almost six grand for and we're breaking it down I'm gonna step by step help you build it so now you have the skill set to then be able to get a job from freaking up work you know if you want it to so for the homework guys you're gonna get the homework it's gonna come as a messenger is gonna come in your email it's also gonna be posted in the Facebook group and we have a section in units so you can go to units and your homework is gonna be there okay and we'll try to put it there so let me see if I can show you guys how that works so on this lefthand side you guys are gonna see units click that and then inside of units you guys are gonna see stuff right now we don't have it we're gonna add in the homework in units here okay so anything that's below here that says old challenge this is all for old challenge okay so ignore those units guys don't look at these units you're gonna we're gonna put in Newton units for you guys that are gonna be for the homework for this challenge so it's gonna be here step by step for you guys and then you can just go and like download the homework and do the homework so you either will be able to find your information you're looking for from units or just from the group is gonna be posted at the top okay so you're gonna find out in multiple ways I wouldn't worry about it too much we'll take care of you guys on that okay so did it it it it uh okay Daniel Daniel says guys you will truly love what this challenge will bring you beautiful people will learn so much and if you want to go even further I would join profit JavaScript because it's the best course if you want to learn more about JavaScript I'm in the program and it's one of the best decisions ever now I'm an eighteen year old student and now I'm a JavaScript success coach for the program helping others become amazing developers trust everyone in the program is amazing and you guys will love it Danielle thank you so much really appreciate you and Danielle just like he's awesome just such good energy and good vibes and yeah he's in our program and yeah he's he's just kicking ass he's awesome thank you for that Jess Yousef we will all learn together okay guys so Julia says thank you so much for answering my question of course you got it Jelena says what is the deadline for the homework so deadline for the homework is really you know we have a five day challenge as long as you get it all done in the five days you're good to go if you miss the five days and you're outside of that then when we are announcing the winner we you will like we're not going able to announce you okay so just make sure you're within that five day window and I would say try to keep up with the homework on a daily basis and keep submitting it because otherwise I might start to get a lot for you guys do we need html5 and css3 background you guys don't but if you want to go online and like learn some html5 or css3 even from our clever programmer channel you can go ahead and enjoy that and like learn it and yeah I mean it'll give you some more insight into the challenge like if you guys want to do any extra stuff around HTML CSS and before the challenge you could do that and it just gives you more like insight into what we're gonna be doing together and maybe you will feel less lost okay so that's fine you can do that Simon Simon Says I missed information from the beginning how can we see it again so this live stream is gonna be there for you guys available the entire time so you can go at any time later and get access to it okay this is gonna be the day one javascript training and it's gonna be a post and yeah you can go ahead and then get access to it later nirav says clever programmer is one of the best team in this world I join profit JavaScript and profitable programmer nice awesome so he joined our JavaScript course and our Python course nice I love to code more and more hours of coding daily is really fun with these instructors yep so yeah guys like you guys see how much fun we're making this challenge that's how literally every day and every week looks like inside of our courses were really literally working with you you know for months on end so like we continue the party so if you guys want to take it further and you want to join our course like jump in and then we're just gonna keep going and every week in profit JavaScript course like you get weekly calls with Nas get weekly where you're doing javascript you're getting weekly calls with sunny what you're doing react and building projects every single week you guys are getting beginners for now we're just launch a live classes every single week for beginners so beginners get to live classes every single week so they're literally we are like four live classes every single week and really the goal is to be able to provide more value than any coding bootcamp and for a fraction of the price you know whereas coding boot camps for like ten thousand dollars this program is a fraction of that price but it's like a premium program that really help serve you and take you all the way to being able to get a job so thank you for sharing that in a row really appreciate you most of us says damn the session was lit yeah you know that's how we do it I always try to keep it lit so thank you for that okay so thank you so a lot of guests keep asking like how are you gonna choose the winners so how we're gonna choose the winners guys is based on your participation your energy along with your effort and the projects that you're doing okay so we take a look at kind of all the things and then the last day so like for example what that looks like is how much are you customizing your portfolio or your app how much time are you putting into building your project then are you present on these live streams are we seeing on these live streams and we know you in the community a clever programmer because if we don't are you helping other people in the community because we go through the comments and we see who's helping who write and we literally look at this for hours and hours every single day so if you're helping other members of the community if you're bringing in positive energy and leading that goes even beyond your skill set so if you're a beginner like for example last time Jessica won and kiss go on and do on all of them are actually beginners and coding like beginner to maybe intermediate right and they won first place second place in third place so it's not so much about skill level you guys like for example say you're the most amazing developer in here but then you don't communicate with anybody else there's no way we're gonna pick you as a winner okay if you're not actually bringing in good energy and inspiring other people you're not gonna win just letting you guys know that so we're a lot about that so bring good energy put in work every day participate you know show your face you know on the comments on the live streams help people build a project put in the work and then on the last day we want to get your experience so like we have everybody send us a video on the last day of what your fiveday experience of this challenge it was like so there you can share your story with us and everything so that matters too and that helps us decide like who we're gonna pick as you know one of the winners how long do we have to finish the project once we're done making it you will have these five days to be able to put it together community and then finish the project okay yep Amanat says don't worry guys the link for the portfolio Docs will be posted once this live is over so just keep that in mind okay Milton says I love that Milton is like recording the entire screen so I can watch later you don't have to do that this is already being recorded so you'll be able to see it later who's n F Joseph says cause ease the N F of software development is that some kind of like reference to hiphop artists what is fully what is it okay yeah there you go hey let's go ID f us off for development alright let's get out of here can I switch my nice dope yes we're gonna this is gonna be uploaded how did you get started Hugh glass how did you get started serverside development I got started because that's kind of what the next step was for me and I needed it for my freelancing job so I started learning Django I started learning serverside development and you know I needed to know like how do I create a login where people can go and login how can I store information and people can retrieve it then I had these problems of like I don't want everybody do you be able to see everybody's contents and then we needed permissions and authentication and that's when I started learning it so it's really like by doing and one step at a time and yeah that's that's kind of one thing that helped me get started really really fast ashle asks is this being recorded absolutely what are the ways Michael says what are the ways we can use this app so you guys saw some people turn into covert 19 some people turn into store locator you guys can get creative with this and turn it and really anything that you want the creativity really depends on you you could even take what you learn from you turn it's a whole different app okay like within clever programmer within clever programmer what one of our team's did is they like build the app for JavaScript success coaches and then then like put the JavaScript success coaches on the map and you can like see where everybody lives so you know if you have family members in different areas you could put where all your family members live okay or you could put like we're all of certain something is right people can go see like the eight wonders of the world you can put them on the Google Maps on your project people should be able to go see it so get creative with it Abdullah says Naz dumansky is the best yes I actually I mean I kind of agree you know now fully agree he's probably so bad right now like he can't talk back yeah I love to make knowledge man yeah you can't talk back right now you know so I can see what I wrong Naz I'm the best bro we love nonce he gets so worked up over this stuff I love it Josh says I am really excited on this free training challenge I want to improve my skills since the company I belong to is looking for people that can create automation using Java hope I can make it and land that opportunity thanks in advance of course whatever you learn from this even if you're using a different language like Java because I just want to I just want you guys to understand JavaScript right there is different than Java okay two different language is completely different but if you learn the fundamentals of this language and you get good at it you can apply it to Java look right away and pick it up not a problem at all okay if you get good at one programming language which means you get good at programming it self and problemsolving and thinking you can translate it so fast to any other language nice Miriam says this is so cool awesome Miriam I'm glad you like it Abhishek says this homework is exciting I'm glad Kamala says thank you you make stuff easier for us you got it all right I'm gonna skip down and see what's happening oh man lots of lots of stuff is coming in ray says thanks for the insightful marketing tip on approaching clients increasing chances of landing interviews for freelancing gigs yes absolutely guys use video it's the most powerful freaking tool on the planet like loom allows you to make a video it turns it into a link and you can just go hey I've made a video for you everybody wants to see that and then you personalize it for that person so you go you want to build Google Maps types of apps or you go whatever they're looking for right maybe they're looking for I don't know like somebody who can build a CRM for them so like customer relationship management system right so you're like hey I saw your job posting you want to build a customer relationship management system that's awesome so let me show you in the screen share and be like let me show you a few CRM that I've built or that I'm working on and then show them some stuff from your side and then bring the camera back and should be like you know if you just want to talk and get on a 5minute call I would absolutely love that make the commitment really low for them so the person who's looking to hire you they're like I'll get on a 500 10minute call with them that's it the number one most important step is to get that interview and develop that skill of getting the interview him a sheep him Oishi me says the pyramid is awesome thank you so much our opie principals a good thing to keep in mind and debt diving into javascript not really I mean to help you but it's not like super super important for you to know but yeah some ideas it's good Papapa Papapa Verghese Matthew says the courses that you have on YouTube are just awesome html5 CSS JavaScript and Python thank you so much so yeah guys if you want to get prepare more for this training you can actually go on YouTube and you're just hungry you want to do more well let me give you more we literally have an 8 hour free JavaScript course on YouTube so go and take advantage of that alright so like go on YouTube and type in well JavaScript course clever programmer or JavaScript course probably just itself and this is gonna come up so like you can watch this of course after an ad comes on so this right what's up Sather system audio i can actually turn it on so anyways here's the course and literally in this course like we go through and it's a eight hour long course and you go through and you bill like every freaking app and you will learn a lot of skills along the way so if you want to take advantage of it go ahead and you can do this on the side and again don't overwhelm yourself like you don't have to you don't have to do this and do everything else but if you're just hungry and you want more go ahead and do that and then when you come to the challenge you'll just be more prepared but again not necessary at all even if you're a complete beginner you can just follow the challenge without having to do anything else Mohamed says will be only coding on JavaScript and five day challenge yeah html5 CSS and JavaScript HTML CSS JavaScript but yes programming language only one okay just scrolling through what kind of Wow I am hungry you guys I love that thank you so much dong dong just said where did it go I lost it I'm losing all everybody's stuff it's moving too fast stop commenting damn it Sean says dis is awesome I like that this guy's coding this guy knows what he's talking about he's a coder boom coding right there can I follow it my finger oh that's a little confusing cuz that yeah you guys won't get it but I gotta like move it to the left but then I got to move my finger to the right so it's a little weird but uh but hopefully it's fun fun for you guys to look at em on says clever programmer is a better instructor than my teacher thank you that makes me happy but does your teacher have has a nice mustache like me okay gilina says you can combine any frontend and backend language together yes okay let's see people are loving it somebody else just coded it up most of us says this is awesome nice these this guy knows some JavaScript you know looks and tactically correct kareem says how do you protect your eyes from the long hours on screen quasi so how do I protect my eyes from long hours on screen I don't I just look at it and you just do it you'll be fine don't worry my eyes are only getting better getting stronger and I can't find those like things people were writing ah that there you go that's pretty awesome Sangeeta says I just finished your HTML CSS tutorial on YouTube I didn't know anything aka I didn't know the ABCD of CSS which I know what that really means people from our country say ABCD of something means like nothing so she didn't know anything of CSS until yesterday and she says I learned lots of amazing stuff in a real time application perspective through this video thanks a lot cause you for compiling such amazing content I feel that your channel is still underrated damn Wow we got we're up to 600 k subs and you feel under it's underrated thank you so much I really appreciate that she says kudos to Aaron as well I had followed his tutorials in Python and enjoyed learning from him I should say your channel is my most amazing discovery in 2020 so far holy crap that's awesome thank you so much Sangeeta I really really appreciate it and guys yes we work so hard like 2019 we worked ourselves into the ground building like all that stuff and then YouTube would give us no views like ever but I'm so glad you guys are able to find that content and stuff now so yeah you guys just take advantage of it there's so much material it's the treasure trove like just go and enjoy sit back consume get some popcorn and have fun chicken po y a chicken popcorn Joseph says let's see hey I appreciate all your content man I just have a question do you recommend when we learn a new concept should we practice it for hours and hours until we understand it but not actually memorize it with flashcards like will we memorize it as we begin doing it honestly I think that so I'll give you guys some background I went to a religious school and at that religious school for 4 years I had to like memorize a book like book of Quran ok literally for four years and I memorized the entire thing and I don't understand Arabic but I can recite it and like kinda remember it but like so I understand memorization really really well probably better than most people on the planet just because for four years I did nothing but purely memorize so what I learned from that experience is few years later now I don't actually remember anything at all and what I learned is memorization is actually not a byproduct of repetition though I think repetition can help for sure like making it kind of subconscious but I think it's mostly a byproduct of deep understanding once you have really deep understanding of something you can actually like reverseengineer and play that thing out on what happened why it happened for example you know if you have a girlfriend or you're in a relationship one thing you'll notice with women they're amazing at is remembering anything that happened like literally something happened like few weeks ago and my girlfriend will remember everything like step by step how it made her feel like the emotion she was going to she's like I felt like this and does what happened I'm like and I'm like I can't remember that at all it's because she has a really good system for connecting association with emotions and she's like deeply energy it's not as she sat there and look repeated that to herself forever just right just like that'd be crazy right but like just understood it same thing for chess I'm top 1% in the world in chess I don't play it as much anymore but I used to play it competitively and I got really really good at it I love it I still play it all the time so if any of you guys want a challenge you know I'll be fun but in chess one thing that happens is if you take me to a I played probably two months ago I can actually play the entire game out even though I haven't looked at it at all and play out the entire thing because I so deeply understand why each move was made what I was experiencing and feeling through the each move so long story short Joseph when it comes to coding and what I will tell you is it's a matter of deep understanding so if you actually work on your coding projects and you understand them deeply inside and out you will never have to worry about memorizing anything again the only time you really need to worry about memorizing is like when you haven't like fundamentally understood that concept and so I wouldn't focus so much on like drill and kill I would just focus more on like building things and enjoying them along the way okay Kevin says I have to rest now be prepared for tomorrow it's 400 a.m. here in Jakarta awesome awesome awesome so Yuri says once I become really good at programming I would love to work with your dream goals yep get really good at it hit us up and let's develop a sass together you know like we'll actually launch it to the market that's something I'm actually interested in doing like if somebody seriously learns coding and you go allin and you're really like you're get good and you have a solid idea that you can actually launch the market and it's good we like it a clever programmer like we're actually willing we want to go so far with all of our students we want to like finding our new sass company and become partners with you so that's something really far down the road but we would be willing to go that far with you because I think that's really really cool you know it's an opportunity for you like you're launching and you're solving a problem in the world and it's the opportunity for us as a business and just like you're our student and if we can like help boost you even if it means like we're putting 10 grand a month to boost your product like we would do that because we understand marketing really well and maybe you build something that solves a problem and if that can be your driving force then great like literally we can just help one person go farther that's incredible so if we can do that for you to be awesome Joseph says oh yeah flexbox was something that opened my eyes yeah flexbox is really really fun it's awesome yeah Sunny's showed it to me well known I knew about flexbox but like he showed me flexbox froggy which is a pretty awesome resource okay going through Simon Simon says I want to take this course to see if I'm ready for a boot camp special specifically thankful I actually was in thankful coding boot camp and it's a decent coding boot camp it's about $500 a month I think and now they've changed their system and I don't know how they are now but I took it two years ago like not two years ago probably like four years ago three four years
