hey guys what's up welcome back so we did number of things challenge hopefully you took a little bit of a sneak peek ahead and tried to do the abbreviated challenge which is what we're going to do today if not no worries we're going to go right through this and this is Kazi from clever programmer calm I'm saying it in the wrong order but it doesn't matter anymore because you guys know me so this one is definitely doable for you if you have done all other challenges right like up until now we've done lower case upper case which case aardvark reverse slicing gerund Oxford number of things challenge if you've gotten to this point you should definitely be able to do this take some time out read the problem and try to do this yourself if you're on my website you can code right below this video if you're on youtube click in the description so you can go to my website and you can see this problem and try to solve it yourself now in this one I'm going to you know we're going to start stepping it up a little bit okay I'm not going to feed you guys everything I'm going to make it a little bit more challenging for you so the problem here I want you to read how the problem is stated because usually what I do is I distill the problem into very simple easily digestible steps and then I just speak it and I give you examples that makes sense but usually you don't have me right there with you right when you're coding you're generally looking at either like a textbook if you're in school or college or if you're working you're just looking at a prompt of what somebody who hired you wants you to do or if you're just solving a coding challenge online I mean same thing you're looking at a prompt of what it wants you to do so it's good habit to get used to that and understand how these problems are laid out and be able to actually understand what each of these problems mean by yourself okay because understanding is the problem completely is actually 50% or more of the challenge believe it or not I mean it sounds really simple and duh but trust me there have been times where I've coded for like three hours and I realize that the solution would have just taken me ten minutes if I spent like one hour really understanding the problem because I was turns out I was solving for the wrong thing so with that in mind let's jump into it it says make a function abbreviate er that given a string returns the string if the string is less than five characters so basically it returns a string if the string is less than five characters otherwise return the first four characters of the string followed by a period take a second think about what that means hopefully you've pause the video and taking a second to understand the problem maybe even try to code it up but we're going to go through it right now so basically if I gave you anything less than five characters then you just give me back that thing so if I give you something else two letters you just give me you just give me that thing back with the two letters right so if I said yo should you just get me back yo it's already kind of abbreviated it's pretty short but something like aardvark just limit it to its first four characters followed by a period so that's all you have to do and here they've given us some examples on line five you can see if I call the abbreviated function on trinket it just goes trend period done and if I give it something that has a less than five characters which this does it has four characters here it just goes argh okay so let's code that up and there's a function called Len which actually helps you calculate the length of this so Len of you know let's say hello it's going to tell you five okay now one ring is an Arg five characters maybe maybe the prompt is slightly incorrect now that I'm reading it I think what it should say is less than or equal to five characters or less than six characters because otherwise it should say Arg followed by a period if I'm wrong comment below I would love to hear what you have to say about this but yeah so we're going to go with less than six characters because that's how this example is laid out or let's just follow this prompt and keep it streamlined so I will say string is less than five characters then what I want you to do is return that string from zero so basically from where it starts all the way up to the fifth character so that's zero one two three four okay remember in programming you start from the 0th index so it's total as five and when you say five here it goes up to but not including so it doesn't go zero one two three four five it stops at four okay so that's how this range and in the index function works if you didn't know that go back to the slicing reverse slicing challenge and I think explained that there as well okay so I get the first four characters and then all I have to do oh I'm sorry if it's like this just return the string whoops return string otherwise in the else case we do what I was trying to do earlier else we go from zero to five and then we just follow that up by a period and I think I should be good let's give it a try no I think this okay okay there we go oh yeah because they want the first four characters okay my bad so you can see that if you give me trinket I give you back Trin followed by a period just like it says here and if you give me Arg Arg I just give you back Arg followed by a period okay so really straightforward there's not much to this you know not much to this one at all hmm I'm wondering what this has a period here let's run that again hmm if it's less than Oh less than five characters length less than oh yeah yeah Len of string there we go yeah okay there all right yeah other things didn't even make sense I was comparing like a string to like a less than statement it kept giving me false and then so just went to the line 15 but okay so this one makes sense and we're getting back the right results okay so you saw how I went through it I kind of you know took the actual problem broke down what the language was saying into something that was really humanly understandable and something simple and then from there I proceeded to actually try to start coding the solution up and then even when now is happening you know I opened up my command line a little bit to try a few things interactively that I wasn't sure about I hope you that you're getting that pattern and then I started coding this thing up right and then there were a few mistakes that happened and that's okay so hopefully you guys followed along up to this point you got this challenge done again comments below if you guys got this I would love to check it out and so what everybody else it really helps everybody else learn in the clever programmer commune or even if you're outside of the community in the first video you're watching it helps everybody learn and whatever code you write is bringing value to everybody else okay so I don't care if it's wrong just put it below we would all love to see it and it'll give us a chance to learn okay that's it guys for this video if you want to try out the next challenge which is called US states challenge dictionary challenges and it's on our of Python shrinky do so you can go and try it out but until next time this is it guys I love you guys so much and as always I'll see you in the next video
