today my topic i'm going to be speaking about the top ui ux design trends in 2020 so let's jump right into it all right guys so i'm going to be dissecting pretty much the top tech websites and their uis trying to show exactly what they're doing to make you either buy purchase their product or just stay in their websites because they all have different functionalities to it and it's going to be very very interesting so right off the bat we're going to jump into you know if you guys really do enjoy this content if you guys like the design type of content that we're going to be dropping in the next weeks the next live streams and everything make sure to smash that like button because it's going to help out really a lot a lot a lot with the youtube algorithm and it's going to help it spread to a lot of different people so if you're a web developer if you're a web designer if you work in front end or anything related to that i think you're gonna get massive massive value off of this video so really do like that that freaking thumbs up button and also check out one of our courses and our free one hour training that we show you how to become a javascript developer and we show you these super kickass designs that you can implement in your apps and that will get you first of all paid second about hired third of all just getting to make projects that are really useful for people people really want are going to want to use them so let's jump right into it so off the bat i added a gif right here which is i think super awesome because it shows a little bit of animation right now animation is super super hip super super in instead of design and the thing about this is that you see it as just like maybe things moving around in the screen which is dope it really is but at the same time you see 3d design inside of it and at the same time you see very humanistic like type of movement inside so it's subtle yet it actually applies with a lot of different design trends that are going on right now in this year so right now we're going to be dissecting the 7up website right so 7up website actually was i was recommended to it by one of our viewers which i think was pretty freaking dope and awesome and right now we have about 250 concurrent viewers that's awesome if you guys like this type of content make sure to share it with your friends let everybody learn let everybody you know hop in this train of design and ui ux so let's get it out there for us many people so what i want to do is check out the 7up website which i think is one of the best websites that i've seen in modern times at least in 2020 so let's actually click on it let's go cool so this is the 7up website right off the bat what we can do and see from this and dissect from this actually is the fact that it's super human like so one of the big top trends designs of these websites and really let me sew a video plate so it makes it very accessible for you to go into the videos and all of these things let me actually mute this right here here you go so the cool thing about it is that it makes it super humanlike right so it shows a glass of 7up it shows how images move around all of this it shows a glass you know from the top to the bottom it's kind of like if you were looking at it in a perspective of a human right so it's super super dope in that sense big images like i said are super in right now in 2020 design wise specifically and also if as you can see here there's a human hand literally pouring a seven up over a drink man you never really drink seven up in this type of presentation you drink seven up in a freaking normal type of glass you know these guys are dropping it in a cocktail so they're already hitting up you know people that want to get refreshed by the drink people that want to make cocktails from the drink they're showing how to make cooking recipes for the drink and also literally seeing how to maybe make popsicles off of it and that is dope just because of the fact that you can use it so many different ways so already in this design you can see that it's super humanistic it shows images that you would see in real life you know scenarios scenarios that you would see in real life so all of these are different let me let me show you right now examples it's different examples that you can see pretty much so diving deeper into it you know 7up i think it's a great website to follow if you do want to follow what is very in what is very hip in designs right now only you know even the user experience of it is just amazing man this is so minimalistic this is so hip obviously these guys these guys are trying to hit you know younger markets you know if you're 65 years old you might not think this is actually that cool you know it's it's kind of even retro in a way which it's hitting that classical type of you know brand look that these guys have been going on have had going on in like the last maybe 10 20 years but also making it very hip and also very you know i think i think very interactive at the same time so you know diving a little bit deeper into this that was the seven up website i love it the big images like i said are very very in right now in 2020 it's one of the biggest things that you can do and this is one example that i'm going to share with you guys showing you how actually important it is to add photos in your app and website designs so specifically right here you can let me actually get my pointer here so you can see the eye tracking test so these are heat maps so wherever there is a little bit more red in the in the actual picture you can see where people are clicking the most where people are interacting with the most within that app within that website there's an image here and people are going you know around the text you can see the green that's that means people are clicking on around that type of area but specifically they're clicking on their face so even having an image that pretty much a girl that's pointing down like that just a girl that's pointing down like that you know gives a little bit of direction on how to move inside of that app and that's a big big thing that you're gonna have to implement in your design moving forward in 2020 and beyond it's you know all about the intuitiveness of how you move around a specific app or a website that's why big companies like tesla big companies like even rolex are killing it in their marketing in their web design because of that fact because they make it very easy for the user to use their specific websites man and so this is literally a real live example of that so moving forward there's another example that i want to show you guys there's so many different designs so many different designs depending on the branding that you have the branding is kind of gonna dictate the design of your website so you know depending on what product you sell what type of website you have whether that's maybe an online course website an ecommerce website maybe just an informational website that is gonna dictate what type of design you're gonna have in your website one that i like very much is gonna be the mecca website and the mecca website is cool because going back to this inside is it's an actual festival it's a huge festival in australia and look at it look so it's loading it shows a little 3d cube inside of it that's super hip man and guess what these guys are trying to target really young audiences and what we can see here is that what the man these guys are actually you know look at this like i'm hovering over you see pixel pixelated or or actual you know maybe static type pictures on top of the hovering effects man that is so dope so to me they kind of this kind of reminds me of the 90s style it's kind of like video gamey it's kind of like retro in a way i think it's so cool like if you guys if you want to target the 90s you know the 90s kids everybody that was earned that was born between 1990 maybe 1999 or whatever maybe even 1985 these kids are gonna recognize this type of design because that's how it used to look websites used to look like this but at the same time it's like if you're looking at this you know that these guys are kind of advanced but they want to give that look so green with purple kind of is a very fresh type of look it doesn't go hand in hand with a lot of designs just because it's kind of like opposite like but at the same time you can see a lot of movement within this website so you got a big block a big picture here like i was mentioning big pictures big videos are very very in right now in design so all of this is part of that so you know you go over this it shows you how to maybe even download info everything that they offer in that page so you know going back to the actual presentation here i feel like it does depend a lot what your website is gonna be based on so you're gonna wanna pay attention to what type of branding you wanna make and all of those things are gonna be super important in dictating the type of website and the type of look that you're gonna get so going back into this i feel like a big big example of right now in the industry that you can see is going to be the tesla website and we might even build it with react just because it's so good tesla man their sales have increased like freaking crazy and the only way pretty much to buy a tesla is through this website so you guys have to know that it's getting results because at the end of the day let me put my keys here actually guys at the end of the day man design is awesome but if your design is not bringing any results then it doesn't even matter you know it's not about how things look it's how it's how things perform so the tesla website has shown to perform very very well we're going to go into it right now man apparently this was the let me see so uh cool there was the the freaking seven up link popping up but we're gonna pop out the tesla website really quick for you guys so we got it right here very very very popular look at this so it's very interactive as you guys can see like i'm talking about big images are super in right now a lot of times these images even move so animations subtle animations specifically is what's going to pop a lot in your website so scrolling down a little bit you can see how it even just scrolls up or down to what specific model you're looking at so the model x right you're seeing it not only are you seeing the car but you're seeing it you know interact in its own environment so this is where model x car would probably be the most successful you know in the road next to the mountains and stuff maybe the model 3 would be cooler in the cities you're trying to you know this is more of a trip type of car so you're doing long form trips in it so they show it inside of the you know maybe the mountains maybe long roads like that model 3 is more like a citylike car so they're showing a picture of it in the city and even model s like i said it's it's more of a kind of like a highspeed type of car they're showing it where there's not many cars around and all of that is shown right here and let us see even man these guys are even showing you how the tesla would look inside of your house so all of these things are super genius man and it has a lot to do with the type of product that you're selling like i just said so you're going to want to sell a car you're going to want to sell and show mockups of how it would look in your house these are all the accessories that come with that but going back to you know the actual presentation itself tesla is a great great example of this because it's grown so much over the last years and people are loving it and like i said we're going to be creating it in the next few weeks for you guys using react using other type of technologies like that that are more web development based but right now we're going over design so let's dive a little bit deeper into all of this i feel like a good website for this too is gonna be rolex so rolex as you guys know has been uh it's it's it's withstand the test of thai man rolex is a brand that is amazing it's iconic it's cultural in so many cultures whether that's the european culture the american culture it's a symbol of success a symbol of you know having money having the money to spend on specific things and i'm telling you guys big big pictures and big videos are popping up a lot right now in design so these guys are essentially an ecommerce website and what are they doing they're showing their clocks or their watches in big big images because why i mean these are high highend type of watches so let's click on it actually so you want to see these watches kind of having you know your design has to follow the feel of the watches so these watches specifically are you know grand they're they're big they're they're expansive so the design has to kind of follow that and off the bat as you go into the website you can see here there's a big big video to just welcome you inside of the website so it says out of the blue one of september so apparently they're making a launch with one of their new watches right here they have a huge video to show it and specifically you know they're showing big no i never really see ecommerce sites that have images that are this big and like i said it's to show how grand these products are you click on one of those products you see a huge you know demo video going on and it's amazing it looks beautiful it shows you a little bit of a demo here in 3d of that actual watch and shows you the different colors of the watch so it's a huge full fullon experience of every watch that you want to buy and that's not easy man like people had to actually think about this it looks amazing like if you're gonna walk if you're gonna wanna buy a watch that's pretty much three thousand five thousand ten thousand bucks you're gonna want to see a little bit of commitment from the guys that are pretty much building that brand you know what i mean so you know going deeper into all of this this is the rolex website that's a great example that you guys can follow if you guys are doing ecommerce if you guys are doing you know highticket ecommerce all those things are great for that and now guys like you know this girl right here this blonde girl right here she's super excited to dive into designs i feel like you know i'm ready for it i want to show you guys everything that is in who's ready who's down for learning designs right now drop it in the comments below guys and smash that like button right now we're about to hit the 300 mark of likes right now in this video so i'm feeling kind of you know fun feeling kind of goofy there's so much things going on we're gonna dive deep into new designs of 2020 and one of the biggest trends that i see in design right now in 2020 is gonna be without a doubt neomorphism hands down hands down to neomorphism why it sounds like a very very hard work uh word uh it's funny i'm saying here amanath he's saying yo frankie tesla and rolex must sponsor this life long a man i would love a rolex watch right now that would be amazing man it would just add so much to the whole experience but definitely so many people are giving love let us see people are saying no i mean the two he uses to write on top of the slides the tool that i use to to right on top of this lights is either screen brush or just a presentation tool in google slides so guys you can use that if you guys want that's dope blow the horn hey let's go man neomorphism i think is a great great type of style in 2020 and what is neomorphism specifically man it's kind of a weird word it's kind of a very you know a hard word i guess new means like literally new like something that is new brand new morphism means you know morphing means forming into something so forming into something new pretty much is the etymology of that word and what is it exactly right so how does neomorphism relate to skelemorphism the cool thing about neomorphism let me actually give my presentation tool right here neomorphism came from skeuomorphism and what the frick is that man as nasa would say so one of the most interesting things about neomorphism is that it draws from both skeuomorphism and other massively popular styles so to be completely you know i want to be kind of clear with you guys because these seem like really big ports but in reality they're pretty simple to understand and skeuomorphism pretty much is you know the fact that you're getting real world objects and putting them into design so you know making buttons seem 3d kind of like if you had a calculator and you know you're seeing the objects look a little bit 3d they have a little bit of shade that would make it more of the skeomorphism type of you know vibe if you're looking to make things a little bit more kind of like the real world but at the same time making the minimalistic and digital that's more of neomorphism so it's in between making them very flat and making them very you know real world alike so neomorphism is pretty much that it's in between skeuomorphism and flat design and so yep here here they go so skelmorphism and other massively popular designs such as flat design yes both of those are opposite to each other and neomorphism falls somewhere in between that's exactly what i just said and so one of the cool things about this is like okay so what does neomorphism look like in ui design and what can it do for your products we've got the full run through for you on this new trend so we're gonna dive deep into that what is neomorphism because there's so much text there's so much type of content going on to being thrown around love it love you guys people are saying docker bunny nice hello hello facebook awesome and apple website is awesome yep that's a great website with huge images with a little bit of neomorphism and we're going to explain how that is maybe i can actually visit it on this specific light so neomorphism was born from skeuomorphism and went on to create a new entire ux style designers from all over the world have seen catchy neomorphic designs on dribble and behance and now it's a trend on its own so those are great resources to actually look into i'm gonna hit on them a little bit later in the actual presentation but for now if you guys you know want to drop off because of whatever reason you got to take care of your dog or whatever that's going to be that's going to be a good excuse for you so neomorphism going specifically into it what is it let's break it down skeuomorphism is what i said before is a very 3d design so it's pretty much representing the real world but in design so if you can see this you know look at how they're adding the shades it goes from purple to e min even almost white and they're just showing that so that you can see the dimension of the buttons right and it's cool in in my opinion dude like it looks kind of old it looks kind of like early 2000s and even 90s i kind of like it but not really like i even like the flat design a little bit more i feel like this the flat design looks pretty freaking modern and you know neomorphism like i mean sorry skeuomorphism looks all really really old flat design is hip it's nice it's light you can pretty much see everything it doesn't have any shadows whatsoever so it might not even be that hard to design to be honest with you i haven't had experience with any flat design but at the same time i don't see any like i said shadows any dimension to it so it must be easier and so the cool thing about neomorphism is that there's so many videos right now actually so many people talking about it it might actually be one of the biggest trends in 2020 in design of ui and ux and even just web design all in all so that's what's cool about it so neomorphism if you can see this pretty much it's a combination between these two so it has the 3d aspects of it as you can see around this button you can see the shadow of it so it makes it seem like it's a real live button that you're clicking and this is pretty much a calculator example of it right here you don't see any type of dimension any type of shadow to it it seems like you're just clicking on something digital but right here it's like oh damn i got a real calculator in my hand right now neomorphism like i said is going to be in between flat design and between skeomorphism and it the the way that it works is that it doesn't give so much contrast around the actual experience of using that ui ux design and here you can see a lot of contrast right there's purple there's white a lot of different contrast that makes up the dimension of things right here you can see white and gray there's not that much contrast in between of that so that's why it's beautiful this uh this is another example of neomorphism right here so as you can see this specific you know display picture it's a flower or whatever it is it looks like it's popped up so just giving it the quality of it being something you know you can see the shadows here so it means that it's actually you know it's it's it's type of representing something in the real world it's like if there was a circle or window or something like that has the shadow right here makes it look really clean there's also a little white outline around this design right now then there's like gray right here so it gives it a lot of dimension but the cool thing about this is that whenever you do click on every button it just turns a little bit grayer or it turns blue and that specific you know low type of contrast it's what is going to make your design pop a lot so we're going from gray to blue that's what's going to actually you know kind of force you or kind of just show you around the whole design so let's move right ahead another big big thing right now let me just take a drink a little sip of this coffee it's gonna be dark mode everybody if you're a developer you know drop in the comments below if you guys really love the dark mode and specific text editors like visual studio code or maybe even eclipse maybe even you know jet beams jet brains all of these type of ides and text editors adam all of those so dark mode is dope not only because it looks really cool it actually has a lot of results tied behind it and what i want to show you guys i like this picture a lot just because it actually is uh it's an example of neomorphism and it's an example of dark mode because why guys can you guys tell me why this is an example of neomorphism drop in the comments below yep be a little bit engaged guys let's keep the energy up right now we are at 375 likes oh my god let's reach 400 likes guys come on thank you guys so much for being here we're almost at 400 concurrent viewers damn i love that type of engagement guys thank you so much vs code somebody's saying a huge pandey and voice low op so my voice is kind of low let's actually talk a little bit higher for you guys so dark mode is awesome just because i think it looks more appealing to the eye to be honest with you so i'll be like me personally i'll be a little bit more engaged with an interface that is kind of black instead of something that is really white because white kind of hurts my eyes and if you guys can see here my my iphone i'm going to show it to you guys it's the black and the dark mode iphone type of you know vibe i didn't want to use the white version one specifically if you're talking technically it just is going to save a lot of your battery life you know showing black pixels versus showing white pixels is just gonna save a little bit of your life oh man we got a two dollar donation by jason francis thank you so much man he says very informative good job team thank you so much brother we really really appreciate that i love it so dark mode is awesome because of what i said it does save a little bit of battery at the same time this design right here shows the neomorphic design of you know being popped up so this looks like an actual type of maybe even like a meter something like that this shows like it's separate from this like if it was put on top of it and then this circle makes it seem as as if it was clicked you know so all of these things add to the actual like humanlike functionalities of design so i went into the rolex website but going into this specific presentation here this is another example of dark mode like i showed you guys right now this is how my iphone is so iphone recognizes this specifically so they let you go into you know whether that's the dark mode or the just the light mode the white mode that most that literally is the default mode but i think in the future probably dark mode is going to be the default you know so it's it's a very interesting thing man it's it's been picked up throughout the years people are loving it people are digging it some people cannot even use their text editor if it's not in dark mode man we just crossed the 400 like mark in this video guys let's freaking go smash this like button if you guys are enjoying this content if you guys want to learn more about design ui ux web development and all of these things thank you guys so much it really feeds us to going forward with everything and man i'm having a blast here some people are asking where is sunny sunny's gonna be live next week he's going to be showing you guys how to build great projects with the mern stack so it's going to be a full stack development project using the burn stack and going to be creating projects such as whatsapp such as i'm not even sure amazon i believe in all of these things so they're gonna be great but going back into this like i mentioned before you know visual studio code in dark mode is awesome guys i cannot use it in just a regular white mode especially if you're using windows windows a lot of times uses just the white mode the normal default mode to me it's so hard to engage in a in a text editor if i'm using this dark mode is awesome most developers do like it and why is dark mode awesome like does it just look awesome or is there actual real benefits to it well let me share that with you guys in the next slide the cool thing about dark mode is that not only does it look better in my opinion it's also it's shown to have so much more results guys this is insane i saw this picture in my mind was blown like actually drop a mindblown emoji on the chat below if you guys are liking this so this is an eye tracking test and these pretty much if you see the green you see the red all around is a heat map and what that means is that it shows the actual the user's path inside of this app right so it shows the interactivity that the user has had within the app so everything that turns a little bit more red means that the user has clicked on that way more than something that is just green so green is just like casual casual type of like you know pointing on those things but red is like where most of the users actually hit so man beautiful somebody says 361 people watching 448 likes that's a love bro thank you guys i appreciate that let's reach the 500 sorry the 500 like mark and also just hit the 10 mark maybe in chat donations guys thank you so much i'm going to show you guys how to implement all of these design trends into your own designs this year so that you can get paid so that you can get jobs so that your designs and your portfolio actually goes to the next level because ultimately that's what we want we want to see results we want to make this knowledge practical so as i was saying you can see here that the white ui wow people are kind of hitting everywhere man so if you see this people are hitting the red the green you know things all around all around that means people are not engaging in one specific area that much right so they're hitting all around here all around here they don't know where to click but in the black and the dark ui design people are actually hitting here a lot because it's red here a lot because it's red red you can see red red red red red and they're kind of playing with these other things that are more yellow yellow is obviously more warmer than green so that means people are hitting the yellow spots more than the green so using statistics using actual diagrams using actual information people are actually better directed using dark mode than using white mode and this is a prime example of this you can develop an ad or i'm sorry an app probably use dark design in that sense dark ui apparently shows so much many more results so let's keep going on another big trend this year that i pretty much freaking love man is using illustrations in ui and ux so it's funny because you know we're moving more towards the digital era we're moving more towards the clean type of vibe clean type of modern designs but at the end of the day 2019 actually was the day was the year where people were going a little bit deeper into oh wow give me some of that you know new type of digital design that is very clean very minimalistic now what's going on in 2020 is the fact that people are going back to the roots pretty much people are using illustrations a lot people are using humanlike design a lot people are using photos a lot so even i mean even i've seen you know people do graffiti typography or maybe even just handwriting typography instead of builds instead of designs and people are digging it so much we're seeing so many results from that this is another example of illustration being used in ui and ux so these illustrations you can do in different ways i would suggest using just adobe illustrator i think it's a dope dope tool i loved it man once i knew adobe illustrator i kind of didn't want to go back to photoshop just because it's it's so interesting like so intuitive in the way that like you would interact it's like kind of like a i don't know do you guys have ever used windows paint but windows paint was so fun for me when i was a young child the thing about it about adobe illustrator is that it's pretty much windows paint on steroids so you can pretty much do a lot of things with it and i bet you guys most or a lot of the designs that you see are done with that specific tool so adobe illustrator is going to be one cool thing about it another great great trend going on right now in ui and ux is gonna be the onboarding experience that you give your users and why do i say that just because man if you're actually creating svg grabbing the eyes people are saying so svg is a type of file and i think it's it's a very it's one of the best files that you can get in your designs in my opinion because you can stretch them out as far as you want or stretch them down as far as you want and they'll always keep that you know very clean quality nonpixelated quality to them so what about adobe xd so adobe xd is dope for prototyping i'm going to go over other prototyping tools later in the video and we're going to touch on that so people like nero k are saying love dark mode storyboard which software he is using so i'm pretty much using i'm literally just using you know google slides to show you guys everything that i'm doing right now what else is going on right here is that tracking for desktop or mobile so that dragon specifically was for desktop and that's the dark mode tracking that i was talking about so diving deep into the onboarding experience guys if you guys are making a new app you kind of have to give directions on how to use that app not only give directions but i like this specific diagram or picture because people are using a lot of things inside of this so what do i mean by that they're using illustration guys to show you how to use this app you know let's make apps a little bit more human this year it's not all about being digital it's not all about being clean and minimalistic it's about giving that human functionality to it that's what's going to get people to use your app a little bit more so they're using illustrations they're using right here you know reference experiences of how it's loading and all of these things so show you guys show other people that are using your app how to use your app and this is an example that i really really love duolingo is one of the biggest language apps in the world right now so let's go into this website let's see how these guys are handling their marketing their you know user experience user interface the cool thing about them is that i see off the bat you can see these guys are using illustration so you're trying to make it so that you know the most amount of people use your app so what is going to make it so that most amount of people use your app maybe you're going to want to use illustrations because at the same time you're going to be hitting kids you're going to be hitting teenagers you're going to be hitting adults with very friendly animations so we dive deep into this and oh my god we're 300 concurrent viewers thank you guys so much for sticking around here we're also almost at 500 likes on this video we're at 487 specifically thank you guys so much it's it's crazy man but going deep into duolingo you guys can see here that man illustrations are king right now so you can choose here whatever language you want and besides that these guys are actually showing you how to you know how to be on board in their specific app right so they're teaching you how to use it so teaching you that it has personalized learning it has it re it receives immediate grading it stays it keeps you you know motivated with results they give you trophies they show you improvements oh man we're at 500 likes guys let's go love it thank you so much for the love man we're gonna learn a lot during this presentation right now i hope you guys actually take it into practice actually put all of these things into your portfolio into your apps that you're building and i'm going to be showing you how we've implemented all of these things into our own builds in the last builds we've made with sunny with qazi so let's keep the love going let's keep the energy up guys like i said this is kind of their onboarding experience if you would look at it on the app it would look a little bit different but it still gives directions and it keeps everything very illustrative so like i said it hits a lot of different demographics not only young people but also old people it makes it very very friendly so let's go back to the actual presentation guys like i said this was a great example that i want to show you but there's other ones right so the onboarding experience like i said this is another example right here people are using illustrations like freaking crazy man so illustrations this is what i'm going to say neomorphism illustrations big pictures all of those things specifically with more variable type of fonts what do i mean by that i'll go deeper into that in the other part of the presentation but i feel like those things right now are the biggest things in design right now and the fact is that not only does it look good it brings results people would not use them if you don't bring results let's say let's talk about the meditation app headspace so headspace their whole marketing is pretty much done on what is it let's let's actually see if we can pull it up here so headspace is going to be interesting because it just sold as a million as a sorry billion dollar company guys billion dollar company these guys what are they using for their for their marketing for their presentation you can see here there's a lot of illustration around human photography so like i said big photos are in right now illustrations are in right now you know it shows you it gives you a little bit of direction of what you're gonna do with that app it shows you how the app looks it looks very friendly these are all animations here all the animations here it's kind of like the dark mode they're hitting the dark mode too so everybody kind of knows all of these things they're applying it to their builds so what are you guys doing if you're not applying to that so that's just one example that i really really like so going deeper into our builds how we've applied all of these things inside of our our own design is guys i want to say sunny is a freaking killer like he has been implementing this this is literally if you guys go to this url you can see our netflix clone which we built a few live streams back this is not the real netflix this is what we created as our solution to clone the netflix you know website right now so i'm gonna make it a little bit smaller for you guys the cool thing about this is that you know you you're going over this so one of the biggest things in design right now in 2020 is going to be subtle animations and the cool thing about solo animations is the fact that it pretty much directs the way that you move around this app right so going into you know all of these type of films it shows me that my cursor is being responsive to the film that i'm being on top of so it's actually you know blowing it up a little bit it's making it a little bit bigger it makes it seem as if like the app and i were connected somehow so if i want to click on it so i guess right now we don't have the functionality on but normally if we do click on it it would show the trailers let me see so it's going to show this trailer not everything has trailers but apparently this one does so i'm going to hit it it becomes very interactive and then it shows that so that's one of the ways that we implemented these subtle designs that are so in they're so they're freaking hot right now they're so hip in 2020 ui ux designs another way that we implemented all of this is with the hulu website so i actually want to go into it let me see if we actually have so apparently we don't have the the the url but i'll drop it here so it's going to be it's going to be this specifically and this is the website that we built and we built it about two days ago i was live with sunny and this channel specifically if you guys want to learn how to build a hulu app go a few days back and check out this specific live stream but even in this hulu clones sunny made a clone from hulu and as you can see as i'm hovering over it let's make it a little bit smaller so you guys can actually see more more videos or movies in the actual the website so if you go on top of it you can see that the like the date of publishing and then the type of movie or series it is it's gonna show here so you know like i said before hovering over specific things making it like have subtle animation it's going to direct your user onto how to use your specific app man so if i hover over it's going to show me that it has 78 likes it was released at this time and it's a movie so it's telling you you know it's it's actually being connected with the way that you interact with that app and that's why subtle animations are so important this year in 2020 so that was the hulu app that was a netflix app now we're gonna go into another big big trend in ui ux design in freaking 2020 we're at 400 or sorry 538 likes in this video guys let's freaking go love it thank you guys so much we're gonna hit 600 in a few seconds so what do you guys want to learn you know we're trying to dissect the biggest companies out there in the world for you guys so you guys can learn take practical knowledge from it and practically put them into your portfolio and get results like getting a job like creating beautiful websites that everybody can use and interactive websites that people are gonna enjoy using so let's go right into it so another cool thing is that gradients are super in right now so i'm giving you guys an example right now of face up sorry facebook i mean facebook does on instagram but at the same time you know in instagram right here you can see how it's using a gradient so it goes from here let me get my pointer tool so it goes from here to this to this so i remember at the beginning i didn't really like how instagram looked but at the same time i kind of grow into it man it looks really dope you know adding gradients to it adds a lot of dimension adds a lot of personality to your specific builds to your specific um design you know it makes it look very very classy somebody asked would you be teaching us neomorphism yeah my man i'll go deeper into it in other videos some people say what can i do after react.js so after react.js you can actually use react.js to use these specific tools that i'm talking about like i showed you guys we're using you know subtle animations in the the hulu clone in the netflix zone we're also using gradient type of tools in the hulu clone so if you see the background of the hulu clone that i just showed it has a gradient to it because it shows a lot of dimension it shows a lot of it's kind of like a very modern vibe and we are at 550 likes on this video guys let's freaking go let's grow this to 600 likes thank you guys so much i really appreciate this let's make the best design that we can make so that people can actually use our websites so this is another example of gradients spotify one of the biggest brands in music in the world right now shout out to you guys because you guys just bought joe rogan's podcast for about a hundred million dollars damn that's a little bit of money man that's beautiful thankfully joe rogan you know accepted that freaking that deal man because that's a lot of money so one of the biggest websites in music right now in this moment are using gradients huge amounts of gradients because why it makes it look clean it makes it look like there's depth it makes it look like it's so professional it's not just plain color i'm not saying plain color looks bad i'm just saying that gradients look really really good and everybody's using them so this is another example of a ui ux of a specific type of you know statistic tool and this is how they use gradients as you can see here things are a little bit lighter and things go boom a little bit darker to show the actual you know the the focusing of things how things grow so as you can see here it's purple and it's turning blue this is the gradient in itself also you know you can see the bars turning into gradients so it's a great way to show data you know you don't always have to have data being so plain and simple just you know maybe showing green to red you can show green to yellow to orange to red and when you do that type of gradient it's going to show so much more specific you know so much more specific progress and growth from it i see people see people here say uh devin gray actually what's up devon we talked on the phone man you remember me so joe rogan got paid and now there's no money left to pay joe biden and his podcast that's funny kind of political let's not jump into that but i love joe rogan and i wanted to mention it because spotify is killer and the cool thing about gradients is like i said it's being used all over the world so this is a website called radiant and i added it here because i love the way that this gradient look specifically and obviously guys you guys are not going to be able to mix weird colors if they just don't go together obviously you know you're going to make a gradient off of things that look good so off of the bat you know white turns to blue turns to purple turns to red turns to pink and that's just kind of natural but if you're trying to make you know brown turns to blue turns to orange turns to red it just really doesn't go you kind of have to follow color theory and i'll be i'm going to be touching about that in the next few slides but these are pretty much just examples of the gradients itself so like i said before guys you know it's not all about using gradients it's also about making your design looks cool so what i liked about this picture is that if you're looking to make you know mobile websites right now in this moment the cool thing about it is that you know first off these are complementary colors right color theory is super important if you guys don't know that stick to the end so that i can explain that to you because if you learn that if you learn color theory man you're gonna become a pro developer you're gonna learn how developers sorry designers think specifically and that's gonna bring you to the next level then you're gonna be like yo that's insane that's not how that color goes with this color whoa let's go getting a great donation by conscious code and he's donating 200 indian rupees thank you so much my brother and he is saying is that web development let me actually pull this specific let me pull it up right here guys so yup conscious code is saying um let's pull it up right here give me one second guys so boom it's taking me a second but you guys are gonna see and it's gonna be worth that so conscious code is saying is that let me pull it up so you guys can see it a little bit bigger is that web development is going to be automated by ai and there will be no jobs in this field and the field of ai machine learning will boom compared to web dev so my man airing went into a little bit more into you know ctp3 i believe gtp3 i believe it's called and there's ways for you know right now specific intelligence artificial intelligence or or actual programs to pretty much write code for you the thing about you know moving into the future is that you know robots are gonna have to kind of you know kind of catch up to this thing man we are still very much more advanced it's gonna take a few years for robots to just literally take over you know web development in general at the same time man design and trends and interactivity is always moving forward very very fast so you know robots are gonna have to catch up to that we're gonna have to program robots to learn these new techniques so man just just forget about all of that bro just grow your skills right now you know ultimately grow your skills make them very sellable skills high income skills that developers that companies can use and you'll never face the fact that you like you might have to look for other jobs if your skills are good enough then you'll be good bro don't worry about the robots don't worry about the ai and machine learning taking over your jobs if anything make sure that you learn those type of you know techniques and technologies so that you can apply them whether that's to your web development your apps or even just you know the work that you're doing in that specific moment but moving forward guys let's go into it so augmented reality is going to be a huge huge huge part of ui ux design in 2020 and why do i say that you know damn guys we're almost about to hit the 600 like mark in this video that's gonna be insane thank you guys so so much we're gonna be having a lot of fun talking about all of these different topics there's so much to talk about so much you know spice that i want to sprinkle into it augmented reality is dope just because of a few things i think it's very very practical i was i remember guys i was in i was in charlottesville virginia and i was in my cousin's uh company and their company was willowtree apps will treat applications and they're one of the biggest they're the one of the biggest big boys playing in the app development world in the east coast of the us so they're based out of virginia a lot of people don't know but virginia is a huge a huge hub for technology and why is that because they paid developers so much around 100k plus but the living expenses in virginia are just so low there's nothing compared to the to to california i live in california i'm in l.a right now beverly hills with kazi and all the team right now and that's amazing it's a blessing but at the same time sometimes i wish that the living expenses was not as high as somewhere as virginia and i was looking at specifically what is it called the microsoft the the helmet the the ar helmet augmented reality helmet i forgot what it's called guys but at the same time what was cool about it is that augmented reality adds a lot of depth to the specific you know reality of your vision that you're looking at now so if i'm looking at this computer so in front of me there's a computer in front of me right here and you guys can't see it but it's a laptop but let's say maybe this monitor because you guys can see it so the cool thing about this is that if i have something related to augmented reality whether that's an app or an actual helmet i could be able to place things on top of this maybe on top of the screen because it it responds to dimension and the cool thing about augmented reality is that we've seen it let's let's read a little bit about this specifically but we've seen huge companies use it it's not it's not oculus devin gray is saying i think it's called man let's let's actually let's actually research it guys let's take some time to research this so it's microsoft um ar helmet it's called hololens that's what it's called so it's called hololens so i was there i was using the hololens man was that mindblowing guys the cool thing about that is that i could literally reach to you know literally i could just reach my hand like this and the helmet would kind of pick up my fingers and whenever i would snap snap a menu would appear and i could actually choose what to do with that specific you know floating object whatever augmented reality object that was inside of my view so let's say just to give you guys a perspective about this let's say i'm here in this in this screen right now and i want to put a little bit maybe a world maybe a ballerina on top of this which those were specific graphics that i was looking at if i want to put a world on top of this i would just go like so i would literally snap my fingers like this and i could see a menu pop off out of here and keep in mind that i'm that i'm wearing a freaking helmet that has lenses to it and if i look over here i can see the little world you know floating around or maybe the ballerina flowing around but the way that i would do it is i would snap my fingers and i would choose it in the menu so it gives depth to the actual reality and how are companies using this so let's read a little bit about this in the last years we have seen a lot of progress excitement and improvement of augmented reality ar the world's leading tech companies are investing millions into ar development so we should expect to expand and grow this this technology in 2020. even apple has introduced their own augmented reality toolkit called ar arkit ar kids to help designers and developers build ar based products dope apple not losing time anytime soon i love it man guys we are at 620 likes on this video that is insane wow thank you guys so much it would be mind blowing to me that we can reach the 1000 likes in this video it's insane so i actually came up with this title this morning i kind of just woke up and i was like damn my alarms didn't go off like holy i'm late to this but i'm so so passionate about design just because i've seen so much effect on it so much type of so much influence that i've brought into other people's lives with design and you know apps in general are used just because of the design of them like ultimately you know the functionalities of an app is going to be what's more important than that specific ad but if you do know design then that's just going to take that functionality of that app to another level so if you team up if you're a designer like a web like a web designer with a web developer or maybe you know an app designer with a app developer something related to that map you guys can make a killer killer team so augmented reality is huge let's look into this so ikea is using augmented reality ikea as you guys know is one of the biggest if not the biggest furniture brand in the whole world these guys are i believe they're from denmark uh they're from eastern europe for sure but the cool thing about them is that they're bringing this minimalistic design and also you know using more economic materials to build furniture and that's why they're so so big the cool thing about them is that in their website let me actually put up pull up my pointer here in their website they're showing you guys how a specific sofa would look in your space so this is the space that the person has in that house and they're using ar they're literally using ar to show you how that couch will look in your house so if you add ar to your design it's just gonna take it to the next next level that's insane and so zara i know zara is literally the third or the fourth biggest company in the world right now just because i didn't know this guys did you guys know this drop it in the comments below if you knew this but textile companies companies that have to do with clothes so textile companies the owner of sarah is like the fourth or the fifth or the sixth it's one of the it's like literally one of the top 10 most richest persons in the world because not only does he and he's a spanish dude he's from spain not only does he own zara but he owns so many other textile companies so clothes are sold a lot in the world apparently and these guys wanted to use augmented reality to show you how clothes would fit on you so i don't have a specific demo of that but you know this is forbes making a freaking article about this it's a huge man i'm telling you you know you add ar to these specific selling websites and it's gonna man it the sales are just gonna go through the roof it's insane so zara like i said one of the biggest companies in the world for textiles and oh my god we just got another donation from enough aurora thank you so much brother he's donating 20 indian rupees i love it thank you so much man drop a question guys if you guys are doing some donations i would love to answer those also let's check out what's going on in the chat right now so devin gray again he says they were one of the first companies i remember that use they are i think he's talking about ikea yep ikea is super proactive in everything that is going on in technology right now so multilingual programmer says i read that future websites will use blockchain yep a lot of websites will move into blockchain not only websites but other technologies such as music and another thing oh man somebody said microsoft hololens yep that is true bro everybody was saying hololens hololens lux mikani also said hololens yeah poland is awesome guys i never knew how cool it was until i used it moving forward guys augmented reality is though because other big companies like cocacola are using them right now so let's say you know b2c which is business to consumer type of um type of businesses are really really big right now specifically we are a b2c type of business you know we are a business that sells two consumers which are people that want to become developers like you guys you know we help consumers or just normal people become developers and how do we do that you know if you guys are enjoying this content we do have the link in the description below sorry about that to become a a specific javascript developer and you guys can kill it with your javascript skills with your web development skills with this course specifically and we teach you how to become a full stack javascript developer learning react learning technology such as es6 such as javascript in general but little javascript all of these things and we have a free training down below in the comments below sorry in the description below if you guys are interested in that but you know these guys cocacola are using b2b type of technology so they're selling business to business so they're selling to other businesses and actually showing them how a specific you know cocacola machine would look in their business so let's say this is a grocery market you put your phone right here and you can see how that specific machine would look in your store so they're using ar to sell business to business that is insane guys love it i love it so much so we're gonna dive a little bit deeper into the design process right so this image is a little bit small i couldn't make it bigger for you guys but let's kind of dive into it i feel like you know some people want to have a clear view on how to create these type of designs because we've thrown a lot of information out there so you know in the beginning what i would advise man in whatever field that you guys are in empathizing is a really really smart and a huge skill that it's very hard to learn so being empathetic learning how people are feeling in the moment even gary v talks about this a lot you know empathy is great if you're a salesperson if you're into marketing if you're into web development if you're into app development if you're into just computer science in general so the cool thing about this is that you have to empathize in the beginning of your journey of the design journey so what do i mean by that so in empathizing what you're gonna do is you're actually gonna feel and think how your user is feeling and thinking because if you can't have that then you're gonna make an app that nobody wants to use you know ultimately apps are dictated and their design is dictated on how people will interact with them so you if you make it like let's say an app was really based off of this so you know apple really does have a thing that says you know we'll make the ability for each user to do whatever they want in just three clicks right so they've said something very similar to that if i want to check my messages or my notifications i don't have to do like eight clicks to get to there i don't have to go to a folder to open it up to go to another folder to go into my messages to then click on my messages and then read it nope i just go into my home screen i click on messages and i can see my messages it's literally like three clicks so you're gonna have to think about you know how users interact with your app or website and the way that you do that is by empathizing so you think about the whole user interactive journey right and after that what you do is you actually define define it so it's like okay so i want to make this the most efficient way for you to use this app what am i going to do i'm going to be empathetical and how my users are are using my app now let's define what that means so now what that means is that for you to go into messages you're not gonna have to do five clicks you're gonna have to do three clicks because i'm gonna put the app in the home store that is one of the ways that you can define things then after that you're defining them and then after that you become you start playing with ideas right so it's like okay so i'm putting my apps in the actual home screen so what does that mean you know i'm actually not gonna make it so that they have it very hard and we're almost at 650 likes guys let's go 646 likes that is amazing thank you guys so so much i appreciate this and we're going to be diving deeper into this stay tuned so you guys can learn color theory because i feel like that is going to connect all the knowledge of all of these design tools that i'm talking about so after you define how users are going to want to use your app then you're going to want to have ideas of it so yes i can put my icons in the home screen yes i can just maybe show not that many menus so that people can access my app so ideas is once you have that defined you can start you know prototyping ideas for that and then the cool thing is after the ideas boom you prototype like i just said so prototyping is cool because you know there it it really shows you ways that you can build the app before building the app so let me actually take a drink of this and then after that i'll just answer a little bit of you guys comments because i see that you guys are dropping a lot a lot of love let's go yup so some people are saying zagar thiagi he says they don't teach these things in college you have to learn on your own that is very very true man they don't even teach it in companies sometimes man you learning out of experience other people not using your apps other people using your apps that's how you're kind of going to learn all of these things so going into prototyping man prototyping is awesome just because ah man i personally love prototyping because before building the actual app you can just design it you can just design the whole user experience of the app what does that mean you pretty much add you know how you're gonna use like how many clicks it's gonna take you to do any specific function where you know your picture is showing and whoa we just got another donation by deepak let's go deepak thank you so much man yesterday you helped us pass the 200 mark man i really really appreciate that and he's donating 150 indian rupees so love it man he's saying nice content informative love it thank you so much deepak so prototyping i'm going to talk about a few tools is pretty much you brainstorming the design that you're going to do for that and then after that obviously like any good software developer will tell you after the code after the build you're going to want to have to test obviously test even if you know you're a college student i feel like you know testing your code is one of the most important things that you can do i was even telling sonny that yesterday i'm like bro one of the the things that i like the most about your development is that you implement right off the bat what the first thing you do is test and i see that that saves you so much time and you have to implement that into your regimen into your coding resume so moving forward into this one of the biggest biggest biggest things that i can actually recommend you guys to do is check out figma.com if you guys are you know designing any web app any application the cool thing about figma is that one of like first of all it looks professional af like holy it looks amazing the cool thing about it is that it has drag and drop functionalities to it so that's beautiful all in its own so look right here you can it literally tells you the dimension of pixels between the xaxis and the yaxis so if you guys are a little bit nerdy in that you know you can pretty much show the template that you're building stuff in and it's going to tell you the specific sizes of specific windows the cool thing about thing man that i love the most the most that that's just actually why i wanted to share with you guys is the fact that let me actually write it here people are saying ligma thick my bruh figma so let's write that in the comments below you guys are seeing that come up so figma is awesome because if you do drag and drop drop functionalities on your app it's going to show you the css code it's going to show you the html code that you're going to want to use for your build so you know after building them as drag and drop functionalities you can actually get the css code in that html code like i said in even a little bit of that javascript code depending on what specific animation or movement you do on that app so all those things are part of figma i think it's a great great way to implement new things into ui and ux figma.com guys check it out so another cool thing right here that i see is pc.js website so on my other video the top seven javascript libraries we talked about pixie js and pxjs is an awesome library for javascript right now the cool thing about it is that huge companies such as disney are using it literally disney disney is one of the biggest entertainment companies in the world and if they're using pixie js then you have no reason why not to use pixie js if you're doing anything animation like the cool thing about pcjs is that it uses 3d graphics and also two 2d graphics to take it to the next level there's also cool libraries like 3d 3 3js that actually you know brings three 3d specific designs to the next level but going into this these were designed by goodpoint digital company and it's awesome they're using javascript like i said so one of the biggest biggest things that i wanted to share with you about this specific you know pc.js website is the fact that for you to learn the most guys it's really not about the skill set that you have it's really not about you know how you're gonna implement all of this it's not about you know where you wanna go in your career it's not about anything of that guys at the end of the day results results dictate everything results dictate design results dictate the way that you're gonna you know make a website because if you're not selling anything with really nice design then you're not going to want to use that design if you have an ecommerce website so my recommendation for you guys is if you're starting off with becoming a frontend developer a ui developer a ux developer what you're going to want to do is copy top designers you don't want to start from scratch you don't want to think like oh yeah this looks good but then have no reference experience of why it looks good you're going to want to copy top designers in the world right now that are showing their things such as sony xperia or literally this day or literally all of these huge companies that are using these technologies and i always say this it's not about how good you are but it's about what type of design or style you have because your style is gonna dictate the design so if you have a very outdated style it's gonna dictate your design if you have a modern style it's gonna dictate your design if you have a very interactive modern minimalistic style it's gonna dictate your design learn from the top designers in the world right now so we're gonna go into this a lot of the things that people you know wanna break things into is gonna be the layout which is pretty much the ui placement spacing the padding the grids of the specific build the navigation which pretty much is the placement and the size of the navigation bar whether that's on the top and the bottom in the middle that typography is super duper important in terms of branding in terms of design all this because it gives the feel of the whole brand the whole website that you want to do so font sizes the line height and then sarah for sans serif which is pretty much very basic typography is based on helvetica most of the the the fonts are really based on helvetica if you if you guys want to research that that's dope it was mindblowing to me so icons are dope we go over a huge libraries that people love right now which are pretty much you know material ui bootstrap and all of these because you know you're going to want to save time and people have already gathered those resources for you so use icons that are very in right now very very modern very minimalistic add them to your own design and another thing is going to be background as you can see you can see gradient or photo used so like i mentioned before gradient is super in right now in design so make sure to not only use plain colors use gradients because they look so so well put together and also if you're using a background you might want to think about adding a big photo in there because it just adds so much more of that humanlike you know humanlike specific you know functionality to it as well as also it adds a lot of a little bit of more of of character to it i feel it's kind of crazy i love it guys so we are at 700 sorry 672 likes whoa that's insane man if we reach 700 i would pretty much piss my pants that's insane i never expected this so i'm just you know getting my coffee right now i'm like yo just you know researching a bit trying to help you guys out with everything it's insane thank you guys so much for getting a lot of value from this i don't want you guys to just listen to all of this i want you guys to actually implement it because at the end of the day so many developers so many people have gotten jobs off of our videos off of actually implementing these practicalities that we talk about every single day so make sure you do that and let's not just stay stagnant so now i want to touch on color theory and let me just take a sip of this i'll dive into that deeply because i'm super passionate about color theory and if you guys learn this specifically then you're going to be able to learn so many other things whether that's with design ux ui or fun and development so let's dive right into it after the sip of coffee so what's cool about color theory guys is some people think most of the people that i talk to whether they're frontend developers whether they're web developers or web designers most people don't know the psychology of color so we're humans right and humans have like you cannot ignore the psychological aspects of humans ever because whether that's with code you know sometimes in code it's really hard for you to be you know engaging the code whether that's because you're feeling bored whether that's because you don't have any community or likeminded individuals behind you everything has to do with how you process everything psychologically and color is a thing that you do process psychologically just like anything else and let's say let's let's actually give examples to this right so most of the big companies that you see right now in the world are actually think about their logo so facebook logo what color is it it's blue right think about twitter logo what color is it it's blue right think about i don't know what other color what other logo is blue so many colors like so many logos are blue it's insane but the cool thing about blue logos is the fact that blue is pretty much a synonymous psychological trigger for confidence for secure most importantly trust so i think in my opinion trust is the most important um aspect of the blue color loyo cleanliness progress powerful calm masculine success responsible authoritative blue is an example of all of this and it's literally like guys like literally it's not random facebook didn't want to be blue because it's random nope these guys know color psychology so whenever you're doing web development web design fun and design think about the psychology of the colors that's going to take you to the next level how people respond to your specific apps another one would be red so red is synonymous for excitement for youthful active leader passion powerful radical excited bold energy confident hot energy youthful pioneering and urgency the most important one right here in my opinion would be urgency so all of these pretty much are synonymous for urgency so everything that is read just like if you think about in the real world red means blood pretty much if you see blood it's like holy that's urgent we have to take care of that right now let's go you know we're pretty much we're pretty much animals you know we're pretty much part of nature and we have triggers that you know did develop because of color so all of these are part of that purple has to do with elegance has to do with royalty it has to do with you know romantic mystical experience all of that that is why a lot of royal type of colors are gonna be purple you know if kings used to use purple it's a very hard color to get and at the same time it just gives so much more functionality to whatever you're building and devin gray says facebook twitter bluehost jira bitbucket basically all of atlassan so all of these companies do use blue you know that's what i'm trying to say and zoom uses uses blue true color uses blue skype uses blue google dual uses blue devon gray is saying microsoft uses blue guys it's no it's really no um coincidence these guys know these things so color theory if you want to take your next level if you want to go to the next level in design specifically so like i said guys you know the psychology aspects of this is going to be insane and one of the biggest and hardest part about programming is being able to program alone to build things alone and not with the team which is very much retracted from real reality in most of programming you're going to have to work with a team and in my opinion if you really want to up your skills want to be part of a huge huge huge community of 1500 active developers on the daily make sure to check out the link in the description below guys we have a free one hour training that teaches you guys how to become a profitable javascript developer learn all the skills from basic javascript to full stack javascript to even react all of these tools that pretty much you need to get a job and i'm not saying this out of my ass so many people have gotten jobs out of this specific training this specific program and guys you know we're pretty much tribal individuals let's go into creating communities creating people you know creating circles where people are engaged and we can learn from them and work together so let's go back to all of this make sure to check out that link in the description below go to our free onehour training to become a javascript developer going back into brand color psychology like i said before blue is trust dependable green is more of a peaceful type of healthy vibe the orange is optimistic yet it's also kind of like warning like it grabs your attention and then you know salmon type of color is more of a friendly type of uh a little bit feminine type of color but also you know feminine but neutral and then pink slash red is kind of more exciting it's kind of more grabs your attention more like urgent type of thing purple is more like creative kind of like royal kind of like you know visualization type of thing and gray which is a very very neutral is a very calm color so all of these things are part of the color psychology chart and you should pay attention to it also color theory a lot of people don't talk about this specifically but there's primary there's secondary and there's tertiary colors if you're designing anything guys you guys have to pay attention to this specifically so let me see what's going on in the comments right now guys we've been live for one hour and 15 minutes which is pretty freaking awesome i love to share this knowledge with you guys some people are saying can you tell me how to use 3js officially to make movie like website intros man i'll show you an example right now josh is actually saying that and bro i actually didn't want to go through websites that use 3js because they're so dope they're so in like holy crap these guys make it an experience 3js is not only design it's also an experience and in my opinion that's where design is going to go in the future so that's a pretty cool comment right there some people like cigar are saying although i have been working on it since two years but still i feel you can never learn the whole thing so logically i'm still learning but technically it took me one and a half month to start working on it so cigar what are you talking about specifically bro let us know are you talking about web development web design what specifically so that's pretty cool so hemant says can someone review this i'm purchasing this and we'll work on that i don't want to be a developer but instead my view is work as an entrepreneur brother and we're talking about profit with javascript go into the description below check out that training maybe buy the course if you're interested and you see any benefit in joining to that because at the end of the day we base a lot of our designs into you know our builds we build a lot of a lot of our projects with these specific designs just because we know it is what is in right now in the industry because that's the things that are actually going to get you results so you want to base your builds out of results you just don't want your code to look and be functional you want it to be actually beautiful for people to use you want to give users a real experience that's why user experience in user interface people are paid so well even you know above the six figure mark because you would never use facebook if if if the you know what i mean like you would never use facebook or instagram if the actual design of it was sucky you would never use it the functionalities are great but the way that it kills it is that it takes a lot of psychological remarks and references into its design and that's what takes it to the next level that's what makes it addictive for people to start using they think about all of these things guys it's not just random so going into the color wheel like i was talking about so all of these things let me bust out my little presentation tool so primary is gonna be it's funny because people don't know this a lot of people don't know this there's only three primary colors all of the colors in the world are based out of these three colors i'm not you there's three colors okay there's five colors let's say that three primary colors which is red blue and yellow and you can do myriad thousands millions in combinations of these three colors but the two other colors i want to hit on right now is going to be black and white so the primary colors in my opinion are going to be red blue yellow black and white because if you do a mixture of black and white then you get gray but those are the main colors in the world and we're at 697 lines baby let's go you know design is a beautiful things guys it's it's it's if you do end up you know putting this into your work into your builds it's gonna take your bills to the next level we're about to reach the 700 like mark so make sure to like that video smash that like button share with other people like you other of your design friends whether that's a maybe a web designer a web developer maybe a graphic designer maybe a frontend developer all of these guys can take so much value off of this and if you guys can bounce ideas off of each other then that's gonna take you to the next level and we just crossed the 700 like mark guys let's freaking go love it we're at seven dollars and seventy cents in chat revenue i cannot be more grateful with you guys than right now in this moment but going back into color theory man what's cool about color theory i'll teach you guys a little bit about it i mean i can't go so much so deep into it because it's going to take it can literally take me hours to explain to you guys and i can show you you know different types of people that used to like picasso like jackson pollock and and huge great painters and designers in the world that stood the time of the test of time are using color theory so let's say okay let's say i'm i'm right now you know mixing red with yellow what color would that give me so i'm mixing two primary colors so if i mix a primary with the primary i'm gonna get a secondary color which would be orange guys if you mix two primary colors then you're gonna get a secondary color right and that's that's dope a lot of people don't know that but if you join like let's say i'm mixing yellow which is a primary and blue which is a primary i'm gonna get green guys that's what's cool about it so two primary colors make a secondary color and the way that you make tertiary colors is for example i'm gonna be i'm gonna be doing a primary with the secondary right so if you do a primary with a secondary let's say red i'm doing red i'm mixing red with violet then i'm going to get a tertiary color which is red violet so secondary colors are made by mixing two primary colors the three primary colors literally right now in the world are just red blue and yellow all colors are based out of those colors so you mix red with yellow which both of them are primary colors then you're going to get orange which is the secondary color but let's say you want to mix a primary color which is red and a secondary color which is orange so you're going to get you know primary mixed with secondary color is gonna give you a tertiary color and i don't remember specifically but i learned this in one of my art classes the fact that if you mix i think more than four colors or more than three colors all in one it's always gonna give you brown that was mindblowing to me i was like what the it like it's always gonna give you brown and i tested it and it is true if you mix more then i think that's why there's not more than the tertiary tier of colors because if you mix more than this you're just going to get brown everything turns to brown everything turns to you know at the end of the day so this is kind of how this works and let me just tell you guys if you guys are doing design you guys are one and gonna you're gonna want to use the complementary colors so i don't think it has it on this chart let me see if i have it in the other chart no i don't have it but right now like let's say for example yellow so the color wheel how it works is that normally colors are based and put here because in the opposite part of it then you can see the freaking opposite so for example yellow the opposite of yellow is going to be violet or purple that's why these are put together the opposite of blue is going to be orange that's why these are particular the opposite of red is going to be green that's where these are put together same with here so yellow green the opposite of this is going to be red violet so if you guys are doing designs if you guys are looking at color palettes always have color theory in mind take some time to learn about it because that's what's gonna dictate your design that's what gonna that's what's gonna make it look and go to the next level now when you guys see colors in design you guys are going to be able to actually be like oh like these guys are using you know these are called complementary colors so the opposite colors are are called complementary like oh no wonder easter is made of yellow and purple no wonder christmas is made out of red and green you know no wonder everybody that is going crazy on actual color grading and just you know what's it called yeah literally color grading in movies is blue and orange everybody's going crazy with blue and orange which is teal and orange pretty much so color theory is super duper important if you don't know anything about it man this just adds so much context in your life so really learn about it and two of the things that i want to actually mention here is now that i went over all of this and hopefully you guys could take a lot of benefit a lot of actual you know value from all of this is i want to drop a little bit of resources for you guys for you guys to actually use one of the biggest resources that i've been able to use myself is going to be dribble.com and that's dribble with three b's the cool thing about this is that dribble actually shows you you know huge examples of people that have you use the designs that are really right now hip really right now you know busting the industry people are using them so much and you can base yourself get inspiration out of all of these so this is an example of an illustration this is an example of illustration in an app this is an example of you know making it a little bit more humanistic as well as illustration this is also like we talked about this looks like a freaking like a card that would look like neomorphism and there's not a there's not that much contrast so all of these things are put together so that you can kind of pretty much you know have direction on how to move through that app so dribble is gonna be a great great resource for you to use this specifically now going back to the presentation guys um dribble is awesome three b's don't forget that i was writing dribble with two b's damn that's i was like what the like it was not working then somebody in the comments below dropped like hey dude it's with three b's and i'm like oh man thank you so much but people get confused with that so another one of the biggest design websites right now that you can take as a resource is going to be elements.envato.com or envato.com you know this website is dope not only because it shows you just like dribble it it gives you great examples of what is very much in in the industry right now so it gives you an example of a social media booster kits of you know a website of a farmer like how you can show your freaking produce like just specifically how to you know move around the city which is a specific you know example of color how you can brand your own website as logo all of these things envato is a great great resource that i've known for years and years to come but at the same time man envato is really cool not only because it's it's very important for you but you're if you're an actual designer but also it's a great way to have a designer community in your life so you can post your designer profile in envato and actually comment on other people's builds on their posts giving props for him all that and ultimately you know teach him that like yo this is maybe not this may not be the best design your colors here was kind of off bro those were not complementary colors use three tertiary colors and it kind of looks brown to me so it doesn't look that good you know so all of those things are going to be able to you know you're going to be able to use them at the end of this presentation so like i said guys don't just take the theory of it make it practical put it in your builds put it in your apps put it in your websites that's what's going to take you to the next level that's what's going to take you to actually get a job with these things so like i said before ui ux designers get paid very very well we're going to check out the actual how much they get paid here in the us at the end of this another great example of where you can actually get um you know resources for web development app development web web app development is going to be pinterest some people think that pinterest is just for girls some people think that pinterest is just to pretty much decorate your house and all of this but no brother pinterest is awesome for recipes no i'm kidding but pinterest is awesome because it really does show you different examples of design the thing that i like about intro pinterest is that for example one of the biggest things in my opinion is that it shows you very modern design whether that's app design web design or just you know design in general whether that's typography or just color and everything in between all of that and the cool thing about pinterest is the fact that you can pretty much just type in app design or you can type in web design or you can type in graphic design anything of that sort and you're gonna see how modern they are most of these designs most of the minimalist style of design comes from eastern europe you know that's where helvetica came to helvetica is the most minimalist and modern um font that most fonts are based out of there's actually a cool film that you can check out if you check out on youtube right now history of helvetica you're going to see this film i don't remember what it's called i believe it's just called helvetica and it shows you how all of the fonts in the world right now the modern fonts are built out of helvetica and yep it was built and made in the i think 1960s in eastern europe so a lot of that minimalist design that you guys see whether that's in furniture like ikea or design like in the web development designs that we're seeing now or the fun designs that we're seeing now are based out of eastern europe and a lot of eastern european design is made and shown in pinterest and that's something that i freaking love that's one of the best you know resources that i can share with you guys and so that pretty much brings us to a wrap and here i you know i'm showing a gift right now people are saying uh this is amazing wow when the upload react.js scratch course bro people are asking about the reaction is course from scratch guys it's going to come in the next week but i do want to share with you guys that all of these skills all of these things that you can practically put into your portfolio into your projects are gonna make it so much more beautiful they're gonna make it so much more powerful people are gonna use it they're gonna stick with it they're actually gonna you know you're actually gonna see results from it so a lot of people make apps that are just functional but at the same time they don't look good and if you have this ability to make it interactive to make it so that people get addicted to your ad man i cannot share with you how many results you're gonna get in that but let's touch a little bit about what people are dropping in the comments right now the castile says i know some logo with yellow and black it looks awesome so yellow and black is actually a great great combination brother i know dan walker and instagram drops very fire content so make sure to like dan walker too you know this guy is most of his design does go around yellow and black it's a great great um you know a design pattern it doesn't all have to follow the color wheel but the color wheel is going to show you exactly you know what colors you can blend together and what colors look good too so yellow and purple looks awesome but yellow and black looks amazing because of the the contrast of that design at the same time i know for a fact that if you're using yellow and you're using white font it's not going to look good it's actually kind of like a principle in design that you're not supposed to use yellow font on white background or white background in yellow font because it's very hard for the eye to see so all of these things are just like you know little details that people sometimes don't know so abdullah says what's up abdullah love it man i saw that you got an affiliate sale some days ago congrats to you brother appreciate that and he says ui ux holds a specific place in the popularity of the website let's say and of course you would like to pick colors which are appealing to the users or which are lighter on the eye that is true my man a lot of new you know modern websites are using colors that are very very easy for the eyes so they use purple they use gray they use white not so much black maybe black to pop up the colors that you're using but subtle colors that don't show that much contrast and that's going back into the actual neomorphistic design that i was talking about you guys so some people are saying this is dope the next level level the next level of knowledge garuf says is human computer interaction course is important to boost our ux portfolio human computer interaction course so i think human computer interaction is what a lot of colleges are using or to call you know the fact that design has a lot to do with the human psychology and it's dope and i mean i don't know much about it but i know for a fact that if you base your design on human psychology how people are gonna interact with your app it's just gonna it's just gonna make it that much more appealing that much more addictive that much more easy to use so all of those things are amazing and ricardo bermudez says frankie saludos is the colombia beautiful man mucho gusto my friend ricardo como estas amigo aqui nomas compartendo poco del disenos super important super important to learn design so guys i think that is going to be a wrap for you guys and i mean hopefully you guys can get a lot of content a lot of value from this and something resha says i'm colorblind and good in front end but always gets confused in color that's funny man like become being actually colorblind and being a ux designer that's awesome one of my cousins he's actually uh he right now he's a full stack javascript developer he's amazing in front and the guy is colorblind bro like he's an amazing artist and at the same time he's color blind so i don't think that's gonna hold you back from your career from actually applying all of these tools i really really appreciate this so yep that's a wrap guys thank you so much hopefully you guys can apply all of this if you guys see this as useful then go over to our description below check out our free one hour training to show you how to become a full stack javascript developer from basics of javascript to advanced javascript vanilla javascript es6 data visualization chrome extensions to even building full stack builds with react and we're going to be adding those in the next few weeks as

it thank you guys so much this was a blast for me make sure to drop in the comments below if you guys enjoyed this type of teaching these type of knowledge because i'm i'm super duper into design guys i love it so much ever since i got a graphic design course in college my life literally changed and i could just apply it anywhere whenever i would look at billboards whenever i would look at apps whenever i would look at websites i'd be like hmm that design is a little bit off i think it's interesting how they're not using you know just complementary colors or just colors and color wheel and like holy like i can actually dissect designs and styles now just because of this so design is a beautiful thing that you can add to your builds and i think it'll take you to the next level if you follow all of this thank you guys so much love it and love you guys too we are at 736 likes if we can reach 750 likes by the end of this video i would be so pumped so honored thank you guys so much
