day one of building an AI SAS to 10K a month meet the team here's my cofounder Nas and here's me there's about 6 AI apps that we could be doing and we need to figure out which one is the most doable out of these ones then we realized the biggest problem is actually distribution who the is going to promote our software we started focusing on the creators instead and we're like let's actually build something for podcasters first so at this point we decided to meet AR because we were like we need help who's AR he's 19 years old makes $200,000 a month and has two sasses one is music Ai and one is cray. and the biggest lesson he taught us fin a cre like ol abdull and build a product for him second thing I was like yo re GPT only allows you to do 3.5 fine tuning but he taught me if I use Vector databases you can actually find tune GPT 4 which blew our minds so if you want to be on this journey with us headit follow for day two
