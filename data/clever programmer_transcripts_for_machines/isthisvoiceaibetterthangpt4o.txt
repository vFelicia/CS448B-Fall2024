I found this new voice Ai and it blows gp4 out of the water I can express more than 70 emotions and speaking Styles like Whispering or impersonate a pirate a hor I can even speak with a very French accent just like my inventors looking forward to interacting with you so you know about the US yes okay so who's the president right now the President Bush I mean even so far it sounds so damn realistic but let's keep going I heard he he met the president of France recently yes I heard that too what's his name again his name is Tre rock yeah dude that's so good like how it speaks just so tiny bits and it just says the right information like how you would be if you were talking to somebody on the phone yeah that's correct okay so so you know lot do do you have a a computer I have a computer I have a cell phone okay what the little hesitation and the way he speaking I have a computer I have a cell phone what kind of computer and cell phone is that the cell phone is a mola okay and and the computer Jay why why are you rocking on Motorola homie get a real phone get an iPhone it's the only phone that matters my computer is a Dell is a Dell okay and what ispt what what kind of uh what kind of operating system do you have on your computer Windows 2000 Windows 2000 oh brilliant damn the corporate Enterprises you know giving you those old ass computers locking you down okay nice I feel like I I yeah go go for it I have a plug in modem wow you're super well equipped J that's impressive okay that was crazy how he was about to speak and then he heard the AI speaking and then he goes uh go ahead that was crazy I got to watch that one more time that was absolutely freaking mind blowing go for it okay nice I feel like I yeah go go for it I have a plugin modem wow you're super well equipped Jay dude that is crazy that is coming so close to being able to have such good authentic realtime conversations I mean there's a couple of other AI tools I know of like there's another one called play AI their voice model is so damn good too and you guys could try this one as well but you could pick whichever AI you want hey I'm Judy the voice of play hi Judy how are you doing hey Cindy I'm doing great thanks for asking how about you um hold on let's so I'm going to end this conversation and what I will do actually is um we'll Shuffle and we'll talk to somebody else so let's talk to Steve Jobs Here good morning what's on your mind hey Steve I'm making a YouTube video for my audience for my channel clever programmer that sounds exciting what aspect of your YouTube video are you focusing on today um I just was wondering if maybe you have a message for my audience you know they're developers and they want to have a better career in in the field so what kind of um advice would you have for them developers aiming for a successful career should focus on Innovation and Relentless pursuit of Excellence damn that is awesome Steve keep going Steve my bad no worries I'm here to inspire hold on one second one second Steve so um so Steve I'm demoing to them something really cool so I'm G to I'm going to end the conversation with Steve but you guys saw how every time I inter interrupt him he actually is listening to my Interruption he gets interrupted and then he comes back so these models already exist you can play with them and if I wanted to share this recording I could share this recording with you guys as well you guys would be actually able to go and hear this recording maybe I could put that in the YouTube uh link for the video and then it has a developer API as well so you guys can actually create your own um voice Bots with this and then you can bring in your own llm into this as well which is fantastic so you can maybe connect it with Sonet uh gbt 40 for sure so that's just an example of how this works but let's keep going with this keynote that's impressive okay thank thank you very much Jay I I feel like I I learned a lot about you it was it was brilliant talking to you what did the most that was absolutely fantastic I can express more than 70 emotions and speaking Styles like Whispering or maybe I could sing a song I can sound terrif fight or impersonate a pirate to so it can represent so many different emotions and the voice intonations that it has are so great I wonder if models or llms like gp4 would eventually end up buying tools like these you know I think it's called kuta a um AI or caute AI I wonder if GPT would end up you know Claude would end up buying these and then actually using these models as um you know Texas speech engines within their own models uh continue watching the video by the AI grid and see how Moshi did for him so he actually went and had a chat with Moshi so let's listen to his chat yes I did hear you I'm sorry if I interrupted I'll try to be more considerate in the future what is your base model my base model is a large scale multimodal AI that was very quick response 0.2 milliseconds if you actually see the lat see here a model developed by qai can you tell me anything more about that model I'm happy to share more information about Q's model sure please go ahead Q's model is designed to process and analyze a wide it is so damn fast that is like you guys hear that right like how almost instantly it just starts responding to anything that he's asking so I would be very excited to try this model out the only other model that I've played with for voices is VY Ai and I did do a bunch of stuff with this one um but this one is pretty fast too I don't know if it's going to be I don't think it's as fast as Moshi but this is pretty good let's give it a try but welcome to VY I'm an assistant that you can talk to like a person hey how's it going you a to hear me are you able to hear me loud and clear I'm all ears hey so I'm doing a YouTube video hey so I'm doing a YouTube video for my audience like do you have any messages or words of inspiration for them absolutely um how about this don't be afraid to take the leap because the view from the top is always worth it keep pushing forward and remember that every great journey begins with a single step how's that for some insiration awesome that is awesome can you tell me a little bit uh that is awesome but my audience is a developer audience so maybe tell them something specific about that and they're to Tech as well ah got it for all the developers out there here's a little nugget of wisdom embrace the bugs because they're just hidden features waiting to be discovered and remember the best code is the one that works but the really great code is the one that makes you smile coding keep creating and keep making magic happen in the digital world damn that's actually pretty good um best code is the one works but the really good code is the one that smiles so thank you for that I appreciate it I'm going to take off now you're welcome good luck with your YouTube video and feel free to swing by vappy anytime if you need more so really good right overall so there's a bunch of really good voice models vapy playi they have apis as well I wonder how much better Moshi is going to be I mean the latency is just so low I would be really excited to use it unfortunately when I Tred to go to their website it says that uh we're not able to use it right now but if one of you guys you know who are watching the video have used it or able to use it definitely let me know I'd be very curious to see the type of results you guys get with it so that's exciting and I'll keep sharing more news on anything AI related that I find with you guys peace hope you enjoyed the video smash the like button
