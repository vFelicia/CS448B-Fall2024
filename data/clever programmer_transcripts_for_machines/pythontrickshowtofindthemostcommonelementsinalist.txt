hey you how are you doing this is Kazi from clever programmer calm I'm so excited to have you here today we're starting a new series called Python hacks I haven't come up with a name yet okay we're gonna come up with the name later that's how I like to do things also it's been a minute so I wanted to give you some good old coding tutorial value all right and I'm gonna be using this website called repple dot I t2 codon and the reason is that you don't actually have to have Python installed and you can you can choose to follow me here or in your local Python you're gonna be learning how to find the most common elements in a Python list let's jump right into it so first we're gonna start with a little obfuscated example and then we're gonna move on to kind of more of a realworld example so let's say I gave you this list over here it has Apple show up twice it has ginger show up about four times if I ask you to create an array or a list with tuples in it in descending order of what item is found how many times so for example it should look like this you should have a list and it should have these pairs and it should say Apple is two times and then because ginger shows up more times than Apple it should actually have it here with that alright so in descending order and it should show all of these if I asked you to write code like that why don't you go ahead pause the video and give that challenge to try and then once you're done unpause I'm gonna give you the shortcut way of doing this here's what we're gonna do we're gonna go from collections boom import counter now this is a little cool stuff that the advanced cool kids of Python are doing nowadays and I don't know why it's green but we're just gonna ignore that so we're importing counter and then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna say counter thingy and I'm gonna take my groceries and I'm gonna turn it into a counter object alright I'm gonna go to the end of this guy and we're gonna do it like that so that now the green thing went away because we're using what we have imported and now what I'll say is I'll just say print counter thingy dot most common and I'm just gonna do that and when I print it boom look at that so it's saying it's telling me exactly what I wanted to know in descending order it's a list of tuples or pairs and it goes okay ginger for x banana three times apple two times how freakin cool is that now let's take it a step further what if we only wanted to find the top one thing so we're gonna do pretty much the same thing except for most common we're gonna pass it and say one so now notice notice that it's only showing me that one item whichever one is the most common what if there were two most common items well it would just pick and on at random okay if there was a tie now let's have a little bit of a realworld case scenario here right what it what would I want what is another thing we want to use this most frequent thing for to find the most frequent items why would we want to do such a thing how about if you want to create a word counter and you want to count how many times after each word occurs on the page okay so you want to be able to look at the word the how many times does showed up how many times another word showed up right so how would you do that well let's go through it okay so we have I'm gonna go and copy this guy sentence from my notes and I'm we're gonna paste it right over here cool so now I have this big sentence over here and I want to be able to just loops go through this and print out how many times essentially create a list of tuples or a list of pairs and it should be in descending order telling me which word is showing up how many times alright let's get to it so first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say sentence dot split so what that should do is split it by spaces and some other stuff like comma periods and question marks and it should give me back so it's gonna be a threestep process okay first we're gonna turn it into a list of words then we're going to turn it into a counter counter object okay and then kind of like third we're gonna show the most frequent words all right so this is me doing step one over here so sentence I split let's go to the end this is another cool trick that if you didn't know it I'm not uncommon this out and here you can see that we're essentially getting back a list of words which is what we wanted now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna feed this to my encounter object alright so what I'll say over here is I'll say counter okay and I'm gonna call it words like that okay and let's just print it out and we'll say most common so now that's basically step three and when I run it right you can see that it's giving me back a list of tuples in descending order and it's going okay it showed up seven times I showed up four times how three to two so on and so forth and everything that showed up only once now what if you wanted to go ahead and actually turn it into a dictionary like a regular dictionary so basically you want you want to say hey is is the key and then seven is the value I is the key and four is the value well that's also really really easy all you need to do is just call dick or dictionary on that same thing okay and then we're just gonna print it and I'm gonna comment this out and that's it we got the dictionary so that was just a little tip on how to use counter how to find the most frequent and common elements in a Python list that's it for this video thank you so much for watching and if you want access to this file I have linked it in the description of this YouTube video so just go ahead and click that save it all the notes are yours you can play around with this exact file and learn at your own pace that's it thank you so much for watching this is Kazi I love your face and as always I'll see you in the next video
