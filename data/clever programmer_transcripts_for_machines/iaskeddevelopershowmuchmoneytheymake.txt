how much money do you make as a developer um I mean yeah I make a round I would say my first job my salary was the day me and my friend are at graphql Summit asking these developers how much money they make and wait till you get the end because the numbers get crazy yo what's up bro oh bro Postman every developer on her Channel knows about Postman so what would be a one piece of advice for somebody who's looking to get their first job yeah I don't have a degree I'm from Oklahoma City so there's not a whole lot of tech there so what I really did is I really contributed to a lot of Open Source projects I didn't actually apply for my Postman job they reached out to me so um so how much money do you make as a developer um I make six figures and that does the se1 so that's like entry levels software engineer and have great benefits so we're here with Ben if you're comfortable Shang how much do you make as developer now oh I'll give you a range boys I'm not gonna give you at all uh 100 to 110. so I got an internship actually in college I should say that that's a major key you get at least like a threemonth internship that'll negate any sort of experience because then like you've gone through the process at that point you know you've gone through the software development life cycle once you've done that most jobs are like all right you're good to go my name is Camille I'm 24. I'm a frontend software engineer I work at Peloton in New York City my first job was with Peloton yeah wow amazing and how did you go about getting your first job I applied to probably 200 companies thank you and maybe like 10 people will be like hey never forget that people want to refer you because they get referral bonuses you don't want to know how much did you make on your first developer job uh so my first job my salary was 110. I had a 15K signing bonus and My Equity was about Equity as well um wow that's awesome well Peloton stock it used to be worth a lot more we've had an amazing time meeting people one piece of advice if you thought 125 000 is a lot then you'll be surprised to see what some of these developers are getting paid at the biggest companies the thing is developers are often shy about their salaries how much money do you make as a software engineer uh I will not reveal that I'm not comfortable sharing that I don't want to answer that no I can't do that sorry no worries will we find people willing to share yo that is awesome nice to meet you Mark what's it like working at Netflix ooh I mean it's great it's fun it's a big company but you get a lot of freedom I've talked to people and they're like hey even over sometimes a senior developer they'd prefer somebody who's Maybe Junior and but is like really hungry but they don't have the craziest amount of experience is it possible they could work at a company like Netflix I mean anything is possible I think it depends like keep focusing on your skills skills are really truly what matters trying to show your skills through other means because clearly you don't have like experience so understanding what you use so we often use like Frameworks and libraries actually reading a lot of code digging into those libraries I think is super important so if you're comfortable sharing how much do you make as a software developer I don't think I'm comfortable sharing got it well thank you so much Mark I appreciate it now that was unfortunate but these next developers are earning multiple six figures I'm here with Dalvin so my advice for somebody who wants to get into tech for the first time would be start trying to learn on YouTube you don't have to go to a boot camp or pay money if you don't want to start creating projects that you're interested in doing stuff that you like if I'm into sneakers I'm gonna try to make the Nike app again and put it on my portfolio and resume are you willing to say how much you make right now yeah so currently I make 146. damn that is amazing it's basically fake it till you make it yeah that's like my best advice so I'm here with Trent I guess tell us about yourself like what do you do sure I'm a full stack engineer at Glassdoor I've been doing this for about seven years now and I actually in college I was a premed major and switched to this last minute wow and it turned out to be a pretty good decision I never would have thought I would be here at a Tech conference and here I am if you want to share like how much you made at your first CS job sure I made uh it was 70 grand 70 grand in Chicago in Chicago and then how about now dude we don't give a range of like how much energy I think I make 180 Grand now after six seven years elevations yeah that's amazing yeah which is nothing for you know California electric car the cost of living the cost of living in California I'm here with Alex guys so I'm a DJ right I needed to make an app to help me organize my music I didn't know how to cook anything but the thing that I learned through that process was that I didn't hate it because one thing that I see a lot of newcomers come in like they see the price tag and then they get a month into the job and they realize I don't really like coding so much join the community try building something figure out that process for yourself and if you like it then you should be good to go how much money do you make as a software developer 2013 I started 40 Grand after a year there and they bumped me 75. by the end of 2018 it was lead devs for 130 and then I'm in that like range like 200 initial that is amazing man I would say so I've hired a lot of Junior devs if you're like totally fresh you're probably looking in the 60 70 range which I think is still really good these days if you thought 200 000 was a lot these next two developers are paid crazy all right so I'm here with Anthony tell us about yourself went to college for computer science ended up dropping out and just going selflearning Route anyone can get into this career path it's not like for intelligent people I've seen people who have worked their whole lives in like the surface industry go into like a boot camp or go into like a selflearning path and come out making two to three times the amount of money that they were and being two to three times happier in their role it's for everyone but I I ended up getting a job as a junior web developer and then from there just improving my skills and I made 17 an hour it was like 30 000 a year amazing and if you don't mind sharing like a range of how much do you make now yeah I make around 250 000 a year yeah this next developer is among the highest paid developers on Earth and this is how we got here what's up guys I'm here with Matthew tell us a little bit about yourself I am a developer at Credit Karma I have been for the past fourish years since like 2018. right we have a lot of developers when they look at the job posting it says like hey we need like one year to five years of experience all right so like how would you be your advice for that even if it doesn't um if I don't have the years of experience if I don't meet every single qualification I would say go for it um like the worst that can happen is they say no awesome okay and when you got your first job as a developer how much did you make right out of college I was working at a company called axture and I was offered 80k a year here I switched because I realized that I wasn't growing the way I needed to I wasn't learning new technologies yeah I also do believe that the quickest way to like get raises and salaries to keep looking keep switching so yeah I found Credit Karma I think through a referral which I would say is very important like those online applications are those are like such a numbers game that I think you're way better off seeing if you can even just like find someone on LinkedIn and like ask them to just look at your resume I think that's going to get you way further this is all amazing advice now how much do you make as developer now um now I would say so I'm a senior software engineer now at Credit Karma the total comp I think adjusted for like the growth in stock would be um over 400 000 annually amazing dude let's go yeah let's go if you thought that was awesome and you thought man I want to learn software development I want to make money with coding well guess what me and my team are helping students do just
