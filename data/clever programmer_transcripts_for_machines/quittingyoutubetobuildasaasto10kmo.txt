so we are working on building a SAS and when I say we I don't mean we as in some big corporate company it's actually just me and Nas and so if you guys have been following our YouTube channel clubber programmer you've seen Nas on my channel quite a lot of times and we decided hey look we've been doing YouTube and it's a lot of fun and we want to continue doing it we've been teaching people how to code build apps it's a lot of fun we want to continue doing it makes a big impact in the world but the thing that really excites us and really drives us is actually building software we want to build a SASS and we want to make that sass work and have it make money and bring a difference in the world and the way that I could give you this analogy is the same as fighters fighters want to be Fighters yeah maybe they want to coach at some point maybe yeah they want to have students maybe they want to you know share the lessons that they've learned and they do enjoy that but you've seen that happen right coaches Fighters will eventually turn into coaches and they kind of get a little fat then they'll coach other Fighters and then they kind of live vicariously through these other Fighters and Nas and I kept seeing that happen where we had these students and a bunch of our students are building these apps and some of them are starting these startups and companies that are making a lot of money and crushing it and and part of us is like man we want to be in the ring you know we want to be in the ring and we want to be fighting we don't just want to be outside and coaching and it also makes us a better Coach because would you rather have a coach that hasn't fought in years as a fighter or would you have would you rather have a coach that's still fighting and then also coaches you and so in from my perspective I'm thinking even for our students a clever programmer it's better if we're actually building us off for ourselves trying to take it to Market trying to have it make money in the market gets proven by the market and then we use that to then go and teach right and we come and share all of those lessons and knowledge with you and what that basically also means is our relationship might change a little bit because up until now it's been student and teacher but I think what would be really cool is if it becomes a relationship like peers where we're we are just sharing our lessons and our journey with you and not like a teacher not like a mentor but just somebody who's doing it right now live that's why we moved to San Francisco that's why we we're setting up this brand new place that we're in I don't even have my camera set up so I'm just shooting this on an iPhone but we have this epic place here and um we want to basically build the software out of this and you know a lot of a lot of stuff has happened in our lives personally and we just kind of found a great moment to be like you know let's leave Nas was in Michigan I was in LA but it's been a dream of mine to build a software it's been a dream of his to build a software and this just felt like the right time our leases were ending and so we're like hey let's go to San Francisco let's be in the Silicon Valley be around the people that are building this every single day and let's set a goal to make $10,000 a month with a software and let's try to do that in 30 days and let's see if we can actually make that happen it might take us longer than 30 days but what we want to do is document that journey and share that Journey with you every single day so on our Instagram our goal is to make one real every day and publish it and share our daily Journey there and then on this YouTube channel we also want to share that Journey with you uh and if you're on my email newsletter we're going to share that Journey with you through the email newsletter as well and so you'll see us fail you'll see us learn and you can laugh at us you can laugh with us whatever you want but the main thing you'll get out of it is lessons hard learned and hardearned lessons and we will share all of those shamelessly and if we fail every single day for 10 days or 100 days or 365 days you will see it all of it our goal is to not hide it our goal is to share it all because it's one thing to be successful at doing YouTube and teaching and also being a good software developer but it's a completely different thing to be a startup founder build a SAS and make that SAS work so I'm excited I hope you join us on this journey to to us building a sass to 10K a month and beyond our first goal is 10K a month and I hope you enjoy it so meantime like share subscribe do all of that stuff you crazy kids now let come say hi hey let's go bro let's go we're hyped I'll see you in the next video
