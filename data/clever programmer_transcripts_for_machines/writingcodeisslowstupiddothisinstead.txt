i know you're sitting there watching my face right now i also know you sit there and write code and i think writing code is slow and stupid so what should you do instead um it's just the truth of the matter okay if you are sitting there by hand writing code which pretty soon gpt 3 is going to be doing for you just kidding i mean that's going to take a while you're taking a ton of time and it's just making you slower and the result that you yourself are trying to get and the reason is that you're putting the how before you're putting the what all right so let me actually explain that all right let's remove that here real quick you're putting the how versus what so when you start coding before you even know what you're trying to code what is the main thing that you're trying to do you're just kind of coding away and that's getting you stuck into these areas where you're trying to build an app or you're trying to build something and it's just going like we instead of making forward progress right this is what it should look like point a point b but you sometimes look like who broke the code and like wrote a lot of code right this happens to us sometimes software developers happens to me too right almost to the b line but then we start going backwards all right so what do you need to do to make sure that you just go straight from point a to point b now it's never going to be that smooth first of all but even with that said what are some things that you can try to make it maybe a little bit smoother what what are the things you can do so here's what you can do focus on not before before i just give you the answer and what it is that you need to do right i want you to understand what happens when you do this when you're constantly like moving around and circling around and not making forward progress you're killing your confidence okay this is where a lot of times developer will develop something called imposter syndrome where you're like hey i am stuck i don't think i'm good enough and developers feel that even at jobs and mostly it's because they're not making forward progress they're kind of just stuck in this weird loop where it's it's repetitive and not a lot of progress is happening this is where you need to think like a software developer all right and what does that mean think like a software developer oh because you think like a software developer such a big term i'm just gonna throw this at me and have me figure it out no that's what i'm here for i'm gonna help you with this okay but help me with something hit that blue button hit that thumbs up button so that button turns blue because it'll really help this video go out and um again subscribe to the channel if you haven't already this is where we focus on full stack development and react and many other things okay so do that and let's continue with this so what does it mean to think like a software developer well what that basically means is you need to actually think and do a lot of thinking so one thing i recommend before you start chopping it up and start writing code i need you to sit there and actually write out and plan out whiteboard things okay and all that means is you can even take a piece of napkin and draw out things on there as you're trying to solve your problem or figure out a solution i want you to also write down right in plain english what you're trying to achieve because you'll realize there's a lot of crap that you don't need when sometimes you get bogged down by writing code you're just going to be coding your coding coding and coding it and then realize you're heading in the wrong direction the entire time you're setting yourself up for failure and so by making sure that you're writing pseudo code right one of the things i want you to look up is pseudocode learn how to properly write pseudo code learn how to take your ideas and turn them into words okay plain and in your language whatever your language is right but turn your ideas into words write it in english what you're trying to achieve if you're trying to make a game like rock paper scissors or tictactoe or if you're trying to make an application make sure you know what it does okay when i hit the withdraw button it should help me take the money out but if the user hasn't put in an amount like 45 dollars then it should not withdraw anything as a matter of fact the withdrawal button should be disabled and unclickable okay so withdraw button should be disabled unless the user inputs and amount this is just an example but in your code you can write these comments next to your code so when you're starting out before you become this big bad wolf this amazing developer in the start start off by writing out what it is that you're trying to accomplish it's going to chunk things and make them much simpler a lot of the problem happens for new beginner developers is where you try to chunk up everything all into one so you think of this entire application as one thing you think of even like login functionality as one thing whereas login functionality even is not just one thing you need the name field you need the email field right you might need the password field so you just have to work on putting those okay so if the user can put in data well what do i need to do next i need to be able to not only input the user should not be able to only input data but i need to be able to actually retrieve this ah how do i retrieve this so this is step one okay got it input data retrieving is part two okay how do i retrieve this okay once they actually hit submit i can do oh i can do e target dot value or something and that should get me the either the name or the email or the password once they they pop it in okay great once i get that what do i need to do so before you even start doing all of this start writing it out so step one for example need to user needs to be able to input data right then we need to be able to retrieve the data then we need to be able to check that data against our database all right you can if you're a beginner you can even whip up with a dummy database right right check if user exists if exists then you know share sensitive information or take them to a sensitive page if doesn't exist well then what i want you to do is say not authorized okay or whoa there whatever the case may be okay so once you write it out like that and you write out your user stories or what your flow looks like boom you're in business now the coding part is really just translating this from english into code and when you translate it into code the most powerful genie in the world which is like a computer understands what you're saying so first you take it from english which is the language you and i understand for humans we want this powerful the most powerful genie on the planet to understand our language so we speak to it in javascript or we speak to it in python or c plus plus or c sharp or whatever java it doesn't matter but we switch it into programming language that the computer can understand that's that's effectively all you're trying to do okay which is why this pseudo code is so important and conceptual understanding of what you're trying to do is so important it will save you so much trouble and avoid you going down the wrong path and especially when you're a beginner you will end up going down a lot of wrong paths not realize that spend hours and hours hours and realize wait that's not a feature i needed in the first place why am even trying to do this oh huh weird so this will also keep you on track of what you're doing okay instead of because sometimes if you don't have this how you'll code is maybe you'll start working on inputting and you'll only complete the name fields and not the email and password field then maybe you'll start working on the logic of if the user exists and then you'll start working and you're like oh yeah if the user exists and the other thing i need to do is what if they don't exist then you'll work on this and they'll be like oh then oh i also need to be able to retrieve the data and you'll do this and it's just like messy and all over the place and then you'll realize oh i didn't put an email or password oh i set up my database wrong because that also doesn't ask for email or password oh gosh so you're gonna go down this whole crazy path whereas if you do it in a normal way then just boom boom boom boom you just go down all these right and you just finish all of them and this is what i said in my yesterday's video if you watched it and i said hey going slow is going fast in the word of a world of software development okay so this is where this is going to help you and when you write things down in english before you start writing your code you focus on the what you're trying to do you also focus on the why you're trying to do it which these two are more important what you're trying to do why you're trying to do it okay and then lastly we focus on the how okay the problem that happens is when you think of it all at once you think of it like what how why and you try to do all of this at once so your little human brain okay so what i'm gonna do is we're just gonna say that's your like brain okay and then this is the you human i don't know why your brain is like way bigger than you but that's just what it is so i don't care deal with it okay so that's you and that's your brain and your brain is going crazy it's like what it's just going from like what to how to why to how to what the how to how why how to what what to how why and it's just constantly going through that cycle in like this endless loop and you're not making forward progress by the time your day gets done you're just done with these two steps and your brain is hurting so what you actually need to do is go let's just do one thing at a time and let's separate it out so now i imagine you could either be that person with all of those things running through your head or you could be this other person let's go right here and you just have the what okay let's just go what that's the first thing that's in your head just one thing at a time what am i trying to do hmm cool this is what i'm trying to do got it okay why is this important okay um that's why it's important okay i know why i'm trying to do this i also know what i'm trying to do and then now the last part how how equals coding okay do you see that coding is 33 of your job okay that's the how how is 33 why is 33 percent and you're what is 33 all right so really coding is this part your how is the coding part so let's just write code right there okay that's the only time you worry about writing code so only one third of your job as a software developer or even less is actually writing code i would argue even a lot less okay that's the part you do at the end which is the how part and then you sit down most people are coding 90 of the time they're like not even thinking just start writing gibberish code and then you run into these problems and you run into these errors and you get frustrated and you feel like you're not making progress well it's not really your fault it's the fault of you not knowing the right way to think through and problem solve it's the fault of you not having a clear idea of what you need to do to succeed it's the fault of you not setting yourself up for success okay and or and you not knowing how to do that and you not being educated from youtube tutorials or udemy tutorials or boot camps or wherever or you know college so you need to know all of these things and you need to understand that coding is not the most important part of my job coding is something i do coding is something i love to do it's a lot of fun but i need to have my what and the house straight or my what in the whys why and the what straight and the how is the coding part that's what i do at the end that's the detail implementation okay those are the implementation details of it being a reality of you turning it into an actual thing all right so that's pretty important for you to be aware of for you to understand and once you understand that here's what starts to happen okay so let's write down the what the why and the how this is twothirds of your job all right that means this is 66 or more of your job so if you work on this something weird happens on surface i don't see anything improving okay so let's say that that's the surface this is the tip of the iceberg okay this is the code or the application of yours that i see okay this is what you've produced now this is the thinking behind it okay and this is the why behind it and this is really what makes a great software a great software developer this is where senior developers are okay when you see their code or you see their app they're like that's pretty cool but 90 60 to 90 of the main things are happening underneath which is when they're thinking of the what and the why it's not necessarily how many lines of code that they're writing okay so you as somebody who's maybe beginning and getting better in your journey understand that that's where you get the biggest results and what that looks like is you will get these hockey stick results if you get your what and why and you're thinking clear if you get your thinking clear you become a killer in software development instead of other people who are like worried about syntax and new things in the framework and like new oh i just learned this new library and oh wow yeah this library is so cool it lets me do this one thing a lot easier okay great maybe you're but you are working on something that's deeper that's better that's more thought out and that sometimes you don't really see it right away right but this is where you get this hockey stick growth and that's the growth i want you to have i don't want this to happen to you where you plateau because somebody's just learning new frameworks new languages what happens like theoretically if they just learned every single language and every single thing their growth has like plateaued forever but if you're learning how to solve problems if you're learning how to actually bring value to the market if you're learning your your growth is crazy whereas these people they have good early growth and then distorted plateau in my opinion as software developers i know developers that have been developing for like 10 years and my skill set is better than them i know developers have been developing for 15 years and i can run circles around them and it's only because i feel like i got my fundamentals right and i got my principles right and i have my thinking right and my what i focus so much on the what and the why i'm like not religious to code at all i don't give a about writing code i love code but practically speaking if the solution already exists online i will find it and i will use that why so i don't have to write code why so i don't have to maintain code why so i only use my brain on the novel problems not on trivial problems that's where you're hindering your growth i'm focused on the what and the why why am i doing this i'm doing this for a customer i'm doing this for a client okay well if i'm doing this for a client then i want them to have an amazing app well if i'm about to make an app that's helpful for them do i do my job right yes i do whether i code it or if a code some solution exists online like a library or a framework or a repo that i could use and build on top of an open source project do does the client care does the company care they probably don't they just want to make sure hey as long as it's legal you're not stealing or plagiarizing code you're good right and they just care about the end result they don't want to pay me like for three months of my time to build them this same app from scratch they'll pay way more and then they'll also have to pay to for me to maintain it and when it messes up they're also dependent on me whereas with the open source way maybe i just built something up they got it up and running in a few days they're able to use it i'm much more valuable as a developer and no they won't replace me they will give me more and more work because they're like hey you're doing a great job what and the why people just get so caught up in the how they're like oh i got this project like i'm gonna use node.js for this and i'm gonna do this and i'm gonna use headwind ui and then i'm gonna use tailwind css and i'm gonna use aws to scale it horizontally and vertically and then i'm gonna use this cloud computing and then i'm gonna do this devops thing and oh man you should look at my github actions that i have for this workflow and yeah i definitely cannot forget travis ci and i have all the testing in place like i have the unit testing in place this is gonna be an awesome yo did you realize that a solution already exists and you just wasted two months of your time do you not care about your time energy effort you just want to sit there write code make a fun pretty stack cool i'm there to help the client and the customer so what happens i get them the results faster i get paid way more you get paid way less so i want you to be the person that gets paid more i want you to be the person that's much more valuable think like a software developer software developers are always thinking about the what and the why not the how it's your boy kazi if you enjoyed this video smash the like button as always i love your beautiful face last but not least i want to say something if you've been following my channel if you've been on this thing and you're like hey this is great content i'm actually learning so much this is all awesome stuff it's great if you are serious about actually landing a job and mastering full stack development we just launched full stack mastery coding bootcamp we launched it a couple of months ago students are getting incredible results and i shared this yesterday with you guys as well but just in case you missed it we have within a span of two to three months of just launching this program and it's a six to eight month long program we already have three students that have fulltime jobs and they're not even done with the program and we have a student dave we have on who just went from postmates to getting a fulltime job a 70 000 year job we have um dave who just got a sixfigure job which is absolutely incredible and then of course our goal is to help five thousand dollars five thousand developers get jobs this year whether it's through our boot camp or youtube both are exciting okay so what we want to do in this boot camp our goal is hey how can we take people and how can we take you and make sure that you learn the what and the why and not just the how how do you become a good software developer not just a programmer okay how do you learn how to think where you're getting set up your foundation is so strong that you're looking at this growth not the other plateau which in the start feels exciting that's what happens at other boot camps right you go to these other boot camps they're like yeah you're learning apis this week week two you're learning back end week three you're learning front end week four you have your first ecommerce app built week six five you're gonna have your restaurant app built and all that's happening you're getting excited excited excited excited excited excited and then you go to the real world and just your basics are you go to the interview they like kick you out and laugh you out of the room even when you get the job you get fired after four months because they just realize and found out that you're not a good software developer you'd rather go slow in the start so then you have disk growth and that's built on strong foundations and our full stack mastery boot camp that's what we focus on a massively strong foundation so we're going to be mastering data structures and algorithms okay the first two to three months are going to be the hardest of any boot camp or any program you've ever been to okay but we're gonna be there and make sure that you do well and succeed in this okay and then in our program the next things we focus on is of course we work with you on um we'll work with you on frontend development so this includes javascript react.js all of that we will work with html css right we'll work with you on backend development skills okay so that includes things like firebase which is a realtime database mongodb you know nosql database postgres you'll learn all of this stuff because this is still needed so mysql database is still one of the most popular ones so you'll learn those as well and then of course at the end we will be focusing on helping you find a fulltime job okay that's the last phase where after you've built these massive projects you move into being focused on getting fulltime jobs and that's where we're gonna work with you until you land a job okay so in my opinion with all the other boot camps i've seen with all the other programs we've seen this is by far the best program out there in the world and the reason why i can say that with confidence is even i know from our youtube platform right just all the content we have out there for you to enjoy and we will continually keep putting out so whether you join us or not you're going to be getting massive value for free forever even that content has helped countless of people get jobs i recently got off a call with one of the people and he was like yo i was homeless and now i got a 60 000 year job as a software developer that's freaking awesome that's what excites me and fuels me and the team every single day and if our content on youtube can bring this much value or our program profit with javascript this is that but then on a whole another level because it's a six to eight month online boot camp it is completely immersive all right so eight month no and this is not like some other like weird scammy or shitty like no offense to other boot camps but how are you planning to teach people in three months how are you planning to turn somebody into a software developer in 12 weeks can one of you boot camp people please come on this platform and have a conversation with me about it because i don't understand the only way that that's happening that these other boot camps are getting most other people's jobs is most of the times in the 12week type of boot camp what's happening is that you're taking a good software developer already taking them through the program and they're getting a job it's like how harvard takes students was harvard the thing that turned the student into a success or was that student have to be a pretty successful person intelligent person capable person with so many tons of resources beforehand that they're even able to get into harvard right chicken or the egg so with most other boot camps it's not complete beginners we take a lot of pride because we are working with complete beginners all the way to advanced people and helping them get jobs get results and get their skills up and master full stack development okay so completely online immersive program so you're gonna be mastering all of this stuff okay and then of course what i've told you already which is a fulltime job we help you find a fulltime job and some of the things that we do to do that is make sure that you have mock interviews as well as that you have access to amazing job opportunities okay so if these things excite you if this interests you what we're doing right now is we're doing a basically a 30 to 45 minute strategy call and in this call what our goal is either me or one of my team members that clever programmer is gonna hop on a call with you and we're going to give you massive value okay our goal is to give you essentially a full road map to become a full stack developer on this call and what we want to help you do is decide if this boot camp is right for you or not if it's not we're going to point you in a direction of something else that's valuable for you or we're going to be like hey just enjoy our free content on youtube if it is then we're gonna show you how you can actually enroll in this boot camp okay keep in mind that this boot camp we have uh we're gonna open up for a little bit and then we're gonna shut down the doors as soon as our july cohort is booked because june cohort if you missed out you missed out it got booked out and it's done so we've shut that down but for our july cohort you're still able to join okay and that's the reason why i'm even sharing this with you so you have an opportunity as a member of our youtube channel to be able to know hey what's coming up okay so i'm just keeping it real with you letting you know what type of opportunity exists and one day we would even want to do something like this in person because i think it would be so freaking cool and so much fun okay so this call is going to be massively valuable for you we're going to give you a ton of value what i want you to do is click the link below and it will take you to a page where you can apply for this boot camp make sure you answer all the questions in as much detail as possible and if it seems like you're a good fit because most applications unfortunately we deny just because we cannot take the volume of people that apply we deny 80 of the people so if you get declined i apologize ahead of time but maybe it's just not the right fit at this time but if you get through then you are able to book a call and jump on a call and um you know you will speak with one of our team members so make sure click the link below go and apply the call is absolutely free and if it makes sense for you to join the boot camp then of course it's going to be an investment but our goal is to help you change your life change your career and become a software developer take your passion in coding and turn it into something you get paid to do that's it i love your beautiful face this is qazi and i'll see you in the next video
