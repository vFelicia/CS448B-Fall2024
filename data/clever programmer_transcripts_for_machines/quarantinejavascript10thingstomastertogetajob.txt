going guys many of you guys know who i am as the react coding guy on youtube so let's go just jump in quasi awesome so guys today we're going to be talking about the top 10 skills that you guys are going to need to master to land a job as a javascript developer so if you are ready let's jump right into it boom so hopefully let's just get started guys um you guys saw a bunch of our tests before we go live you know we like to just make sure we're prepped up but guys let's just jump straight into the content so quarantine javascript if you guys master these 10 skills that we're going to show you today and truly master them this can practically guarantee that you actually get a job as a developer sonny what are your thoughts on this 100 like the skills that we're going to go through today guys like if you guys master these skills right and you practice them and you put in the time and effort we can promise you that these skills are going to actually get you from becoming like you can be a beginner at this point but work your way through this list and you will guaranteed land a job as a javascript developer whether it be a freelance or a permanent position you can be sure that if you've got these skills on your list you're gonna land something beautiful awesome so guys that's what it is now we are really excited to share all of this with you guys if you guys can do us a favor right before we jump in is if you are pumped about this content please just go make sure to smash that like button and why is that important why is that helpful for us sonny what was that why is it helpful why is that helpful because guys like if you smash the like button then more people are going to see this video so if you're finding value from it then imagine how many other people can get value from it so smashing that like button is going to send the youtube algorithm some crazy fire and then it's gonna get this video out to more and more people so that more of you guys can love the stuff and we can actually start producing more of it because we know you guys love it that's it right we don't even want a dollar from you all we want is if you can just smash that button the beautiful thing yeah it just really helps us you know we spend hours and hours preparing this content and so we just want more and more developers to be able to get value out of it especially during a time like this the crazy time that we're going through right now guys with that said i mean i see a lot of you guys are pumped we got nas here aaron is here you know a bunch of people who are excited to be here and thank you guys we appreciate you but we're gonna just make sure we give you the most value for your time and we're gonna jump straight into the content so here are the top 10 skills and we're going to start to list some of them out so the skills javascript developers actually need to know today guys and this is not only relevant for 2019 but this is also relevant for 2020 right sunny exactly this is fresh guys like this is what we're gonna run through right now is applicable today so today it takes effect yeah yep um awesome so give me one second over here yep so guys if you guys are excited drop some comments let us know if you guys are enjoying these live sessions um while we get prepped for today's live talk um awesome you guys so we just got a awesome setup frankie over here is hooking me up with the mouse which is really helpful because i just want to make sure you guys get the best experience so guys all of these skills we're going to be talking about in today's video okay we're going to talk about why react is so important for all of you guys to actually pick up we're going to talk about why you know node.js we're going to talk about git redux typescript aws or it's basically the thing that we like to use instead of that which is firebase rest apis and many many more things this is just to give you an overview of what we're going to be talking about and this is literally being pulled from job listing so this is currently what people are looking for exactly exactly so some of what are some of these things we're going to be talking about sunny yeah so let's run through a quick list guys so the number one thing if you guys have been watching these videos you know right now react is on fire guys so the number one skill that we're going to be talking about is why you should know react what are the benefits of it and why it's going to guarantee you landing some kind of job inside this space so react.js is number one on our list and we will be covering a bunch around that so if you're excited drop some fire for that number two yeah number two is redux guys so we've actually used the react context api in some of the builds i think we used it inside of the amazon build that's the one we used it for um so the react context api is very similar to redux guys but redux is pretty much what you're going to be using inside of a professional working environment and it's essentially a data layer for your react app so we're going to talk about why you need to know that and the sort of perks and benefits of that and number three kazi what we got there we're going to be talking about git you guys and git is version control it is so important the time machine for developers so we're going to be going a little bit deeper into git it's going to be really valuable also on the chat side guys the nightbot chat moderator that i got is a little bit aggressive so i apologize because some of you guys are just genuinely excited and it's going to give you warnings so please don't be turned off by that i appreciate you here i'm gonna like make it a little less sensitive in the future but git is extremely valuable skill as a developer i think if you're a developer you kind of have to know this there's like very few developers i know that have jobs that don't have the skill of git all right what else we got sunny so we have firebase so this is actually a personal favorite of mine so when karsi showed that graph earlier we had aws inside that list firebase is actually something which isn't really spoken about as much as it should be but guys don't be fooled firebase is something which is going to be on a fire soon enough and there's not enough quality tutorials out there right now so all of the tutorials that we show really do take advantage of them because i wish i wish i wish i wish that there was more of those available especially when i was learning firebase and kazi like you've used firebase what do you think about firebase firebase is absolutely ridiculous one of the most powerful things you guys like you know what uh if i can actually pull that up right over here and like open up some of this stuff like guys we built an amazon clone a few days ago and this is all you know a bunch of this is we're actually using firebase for this and even hosting this we're using firebase uh yeah and so for a lot of the things that we built over the last few weeks even like the messenger facebook messenger clone that we built for you guys that's also using this messenger clone over here is also using firebase you guys and so pretty much everything you can build you can do it with this and it's yeah we're gonna again we're gonna go deeper into that but this is just the kind of road map for you guys what we're gonna be talking about today the next one on the list is node.js guys so all of us have been like sort of practicing and messing around with react react is the front sort of uh front end so like sort of clientside javascript that we call it and now you've got like back end code right so previously like in other languages you you would have used like java python in the back end but right now what you can actually do is you can actually use javascript across your front end and your back end and what we call this sort of back inside of javascript is node.js so that's why you're going to need to know that and you can also see you must like many of you guys if you've heard of the man stack i see a lot of people going crazy about the mern stack right now you're going to need to know node.js if you're interested in learning that yes exactly and another thing guys something that we're doing interactively this time we've never done before if you guys actually want to follow us live uh we actually gave you guys access to um all of these slides so you guys can actually see what slides we're on right now and follow along if you want to do that or if you just maybe want access to all the materials and the resources so you can look at it later in the description below is the link to the live slides click that and it'll just open up you don't have to register you don't have to give us your email none of that just click it and all the slides will be available to you and you will be able to see sunny and i in real time talking about these slides and changing it so go ahead and um check the link in description to to to click that and follow along exactly and that these are all the slides that you guys are seeing on the screen and it will be in real time sort of updating as we go through it yep awesome so did we touch on command line sunny we didn't uh the command line is actually one of your favorite areas quasi oh man go ahead i love the command line command line guys i mean it's super super important for developers to learn like it'll speed up and juice up your workflow and i think it's important for all developers to know how this works so whether it's like you trying to deploy your app online through firebase or heroku you're going to need to know command line whether you want to use git version control github all of that you're going to need to learn the command line how your pathing works and all your files and folders and structure works uh no running and skipping around this you might try to kind of run around it with like using a gui or something but all of those are bandaids this is something you're going to have to learn exactly exactly it's definitely one of those skills it could be very scary in the beginning guys but uh it's worth learning cool so rest apis are going to be something important we're going to go deep into that in this video we're going to talk about flexbox and how flexbox kind of allows you to like if i can show you guys our netflix clone that we built over here you guys can see how we used flexbox to make all of this stuff beautiful right and you guys can even check out this app but this is basically how we use flexbox so flexbox is super important we're going to dive deep into that and then you know talk to us a little bit about this last one or the ninth one here sonny uh yeah so the ninth one is graphql so this is actually quite a hot um sort of a hot query language right now guys what this does is essentially it sits in front of your api so it actually goes alongside with that rest api's number seven point and basically what it's going to be doing is it's an open source data query language and it basically guys allows the front end so all of your phones the websites that you guys are coding it allows it to ask in a very simple and easy way for data from your back end so it gets rid of all the sort of complexity that we used to face as frontend developers um by introducing graphql in between the sort of frontend and backend so we're going to go into that in a bit of depth and show you why a lot of companies are actually going crazy about graphql right now yeah it's absolutely insanity uh and then 10 ssr server side rendering so sunny speak to us on this a little bit as well as why you decided to put this in this list yeah so server side rendering is something that was relatively newly introduced to me about two three years ago and what it basically essentially allows you to do guys is when a web page loads typically we're used to it loading all on the client side right so as soon as you go on the web page it loads on the client side but without realizing a lot of websites are doing something called serverside rendering and what happens is all of the page is actually loaded on a server before it's sent to you so all of the heavy lifting is done on side on a server outside on for example a google server if you're using firebase or an amazon server if using aws and when it delivers it to you it's so much faster right yeah so especially when you're using something like react which is known as a single page app which is basically a little bundled app it basically all the hard work is done in on an offsite server and then once it gets delivered to you the speed the time to actually be able to interact with the web page is so so fast when you do server side rendering um but there is some things to consider here um but it's definitely something which is being used in a lot of jobs right now it's massive yeah yep now guys we're gonna go on to the first most important skill which is actually we think react so one of the most important skills to learn for javascript is react and kind of let's start talking about this so sunny why don't you start off with this yeah so for many of you guys who are new to react essentially we have three fundamentals in web development we have html css and javascript right once you know these three things you're going to run into situations where you pretty much are going to have to do the same things over and over again but the guys over at facebook thought let's do this smarter let's do this faster let's introduce a better way of doing this right so they built a library called react now react is massive is hugely popular it uses something called the virtual dom so many of us who have dived dove into web development before know about the dom right and the dom is basically where all of the elements on the web page live right react uses something called the virtual dom so it basically creates a clone of the the dom and it basically just this is the really clever part about react it just rerenders what needs to be rerendered on the screen right so imagine you have a list and you add to that list it's only going to rerender because what it does it checks its virtual dom it checks what you've added to that to that list and then it does a little comparison and then it basically gets everything um rendered in a really clean and and easy way right yep so which is why like if i actually write a comment over here hey this is an awesome post or something like that right and i post it and i hit enter what happens is it doesn't refresh any other comments on this page it doesn't refresh any of the other posts i have made on instagram if i hit enter literally it only just refreshes that page also or that comment now another cool thing that happened is the page never refreshed so like i've never had this moment where like the whole page refreshes all real time so if i type in another comment and hit enter you can see yeah only that thing loads and then sends it and boom done nothing else changed this is why instagram is such a phenomenal user experience and why billions of people download and use instagram and use facebook because it's using it's just an amazing experience for the user it'd be really frustrating if on your phone every single time you commented or something things refreshed very awful experience react can actually help you with those types of things and um all of the apps that we're showing you guys we actually built them using react yep and just to point out if we go back to that netflix app so there's a really important thing inside of react guys and that's reusable components so what you can actually do in react is you can write one component and reuse it several times by passing in different properties and we call that props in react right yeah so in this case you've got like a carousel that causes sort of hovering over right each one of those things is actually just one piece of code we just reused that code several times and we passed in different properties yeah and then you get this really nice code base which is reusable it's easy to maintain and it's going to allow you to actually grow and scale at a much faster rate which is why a lot of companies use it a lot of companies use it and it's similar to kind of like the jinja templating engine in django and python and if you guys have experience with shopify you guys know that language called liquid right um do you know about liquid sunny yeah i think we actually use liquid inside of uh i've used it inside of shopify and uh where we host the course at the moment yeah and so like liquid has that like a little templating type of thing so when i'm using react it kind of reminds me of that where i'm building these components and i get to reuse like with that snippet of code that's how i like to kind of think about it yeah that's a nice way of playing it but it's much more powerful than that guys because because of the virtual dom concept if you have different components so for example let's say we have this component here right so what's cool about a react app is let's say the header loads and let's say this banner loads but let's say these haven't loaded yet because it has to pull all this data dynamically what's cool about a react app is the app will actually start running even without this stuff being loaded there it'll start running with all of this because this is a different component so it won't wait for it to run and then as you're scrolling down boom this is being loaded on the fly in real time which is why you get that slick fast experience exactly so it actually has something called lazy loading outs out of the box which is what cars you mentioned so it will only load the components it needs to load in a really really efficient way and there's many techniques in getting this working correctly um with a lot of the new sort of react stuff so functional components all of the sort of react hooks this becomes quite a simple thing to actually get working and up and running yep so that's and then you know here's an another example of how we use this so let's go over here if we can open this up so you guys can see this product is just a component and this product card right over here and we just kept reusing this component in all of these different things that we built for you guys in this amazon by the way it's the amazon clone this is not the actual amazon website guys so what we built in the tutorial a few days ago yeah awesome so this is the power of this virtual dom that comes with react react is also very seo friendly and reusable components as what sunny was really highlighting and then i'm sure the debugging and testing and data flow is easier i don't know if you want to speak more to these points i want to kind of like touch on a little on the cons right now yeah uh one thing to mention before we touch on the cons so it is a really really nice to debug guys so a lot of us who have done web development before do know about the sort of pain and the suffering that we have when you can't figure out a bug react has a number of tools so they have a react profiler they have a react debugger there's a bunch of things that you can actually use as chrome extensions and that's going to make life so much easier for you when you're actually debugging and checking things out so you can see cars is pulling out right now you have a profiler and you have a components tab inside of a chrome and what that's going to do is actually breaks down and shows you all of the different components and also it even shows you the state and the props of that component at that given time so it's a really really nice way how to like you can d uh yeah dive deeply into sort of the component tree and see what's actually going on with your app nice i love that amazing really really nice cool so yeah all right any any other points you want to touch on here yeah i think actually i i gotta admit this this is a really nice visual but guys don't be scared by where it says jsx as a barrier jsx is actually something which is i wouldn't actually consider it a con i'd say it's really a power up of actual normal web development because it's kind of it merges html and javascript together and it gives you this really nice functionality where you can actually have dynamic javascript running inside of your html so i wouldn't actually take it as a con i would actually look at that as something which is actually a benefit of using react yeah i would see it as a benefit too like yeah it's gonna maybe like in this first second you might be confused right you're like oh my god class i i'd have to say class name like you know there might be like one or two things that are different but once you pick it up you're like oh my god this is so nice to be able to write actual code uh kind of like how you know when when i'm doing django i like being able to actually write django code right inside of my app and then when i was just using html css i'm like why can't i do that so like that alone made me want to go back to starting using django but that's super nice being able to do that in one place yeah exactly let's touch base on percentage of users who actually love the framework and use it again so here are a bunch of different frameworks we have here sunny so like why are the react users they're like mostly coming back to use this versus you know say backbone or you know angular so the reason why um is because react is so react is different to a lot of these different um sort of frameworks you can call them because react's actually not a framework guys it's a library and that means it's very lightweight so the entry into actually using react is so easy guys it's really light to pick up on rep because you don't need to learn everything at once whereas if you look at something like angular you need it's a framework you have to do everything according to how angular is built right in order to get an angular angular app right up and running it's actually quite a sort of intimidating process especially if you're new to it but if you're in react what you can actually do is um we actually got some slides um that i post over on instagram where you can actually just shows you how simple it is to actually get a react up and running react up and running so if we go ahead and look at this guys this is how you would get a react app up and running you literally run one command so here you can see it says mpx create react app you literally see the internet and then you just do npm start and that's it guys your app's up and running and it sets everything up for you and then after that you just need to pick up and choose and and learn what you need to learn at that point so it's very very that sort of entry into react is so nice it's really nice to code in it's really fun to go in it's actually the funnest one and i've coded in a bunch of these guys and check out the companies that are actually using react guys so that's actually huge uh that's this is a nice slide so like why react because many companies use it right and the job opportunities and the payoffs of salaries are really high so uber airbnb udemy khan academy twitter facebook netflix instagram all of these are actually using it so i think that's another thing that tells i think if i don't know much about programming it's helpful for me to know what companies are using it and it gives me insight into what my jobs potentially could look like right like a frontend developer um that works at netflix is actually making three hundred and six thousand dollars a year i don't know if you knew that yeah that's insane i didn't actually know that yeah literally i i looked up their salary and uh average frontend developer in on netflix that's actually their yearly salary damn and i think it's netflix they actually have a lot of their work as remote right now a lot of these companies have a lot of remote developers with them so that's that's even more insane that they're getting paid that here's a good question somebody asked just a little bit ago like hey is this for i can't find it right now but they asked is this for beginners oh yeah there we go so it's react also something that beginners can use very good question guys and i actually have a slide for that so in order to get started with react all you need to know guys is a basic understanding of html css and javascript right so you just need a basic understanding of those three things so yes it is for beginners and the one thing i would say is don't be afraid of react guys honestly it's one of those things where i always hear a lot of people saying oh i think i need to learn know a bit more about web development before i dive in i would honestly say flip it on its head and just go for it give it a go if you've done a little bit of web development before honestly just go ahead and give it a go you just need a basic understanding of html css and javascript and the reason why we have javascript es6 here is because a lot of the new features in react which make it so fun to code in are written using es6 es6 or features like arrow functions and stuff like that so uh the the bottom requirements are very simple installing node.js is literally clicking and click and play like it's very easy and you just need an internet connection that's it just start like honestly it's a beginner friendly thing you can go ahead and get started very easily that's right so just get started with that now let's move on to something so this i think i touch base on already i don't need to go too much into it but like here's tesla using react reddit and all these big companies so let's move forward now now i guess let's get into i think we kind of did a good job with how much we went into detail about react and why people should be using it i think let's now start diving into git and why people should be using git so let's go down here so sunny you want to talk about this yeah so we have three main things here guys and i've just broken it down for a beginner to understand very easily number one it's a time machine right and what i mean by that guys you push some code in there and then you have this sort of time machine of backups right so you if something goes wrong and let's say everything you you you can like you add features at this time like in this timeline you just add different features so let's say in the beginning cause he just built the login feature then he built the sort of um the post post feature but like what you would do is you would actually add in your features at different points and then what would happen is you would oh okay so imagine we had instagram right now right you would have a you would commit to so you would commit your different features to this timeline so for example we would have the ability to post on instagram we'd have the ability to comment on instagram and every time you push that code you basically create like a checkpoint right and if anything goes wrong guys you can actually go ahead and rewind to that checkpoint so this is really important because when you have a lot of money being put behind apps and you've got a lot of like customers that are using your apps you need very fast and robust ways of rolling back code um to make sure that if anything goes wrong you can put out that fire and rewind back in time so the first thing is it's a time machine uh the second thing is it's something called a code repo so a code repository and this basically just means it holds your code and it holds it and it gives you a bunch of features so it allows you to basically have things like branches it allows you to be able to work on the same code base no matter how many developers you have in a team right so that touches on the third point it's how a team of coders work together so amanov said a really nice thing you can say git is a doctor strange in the development world i like that nice um so guys yeah git is gonna be is what allows a team of coders to work together because imagine you had me and you had kazi working on a feature right two different features and let's say i went ahead and built the comments feature and qazi went ahead and built the posting a picture feature on instagram let's say our code clashes right let's say it clashes at some point git is again allows you to sort of resolve those clashes and move forward and then make another checkpoint right but without using git how do you do that you see how you have this sort of problem you can't do that oh that's a great another great thing right oh wow we got super chat thank you for that so me really really appreciate that um another great thing about react guys or sorry another great thing about git is what exactly to sunny's point what i will add on to that is if you're doing collaboration let's say sunny and i wanted to build two different features okay so sunny wanted to build the ability to comment and i wanted to build the ability to post so at the same time we can to be working on separate features sunny can actually be working on this comment feature and i can actually be working on the post feature qazi right here yeah right and then essentially what we could do is once our like he completes his comment functionality i complete my post functionality we could actually merge that into one place like to the master branch or whatever you want to call it and now we have both of those features in the main app the app that the public world and everybody's using exactly and guys notice how we would be working on separate features but we both would get access to the login features right so because we're essentially like carrying on from the same point in the timeline so we you it allows us to both work on features at the same time and then come back together and push the code forward so really really powerful thing which which every every single job that you enter will need you to know they will need you to know how to use get yeah very highly skill guys definitely all right let's move to the next one so let's talk a bit about redux now guys with redux you know uh it's this is a really important skill and in if you guys didn't go and build this clone that we built with amazon we're actually using redux here or a basically a form of redux we're using something called context api and what sunny said is like hey if you want to learn about redux that would be step one like use learn context apis but here's what it allows you to do right at the top right can you guys see where it says basket i mean it's probably it's a little bit hard for you guys to see so i'll move that here but like you guys can see where it says basket now if i go and click add to basket boom you can see in real time it just added that and i can hit this add to basket now i can actually go to the basket and you can see it's actually keeping track of the state currently both of these products are added in real time now if i remove them they get changed without the page being refreshed guys and look the subtotal changed as well now if i remove this boom everything changed dynamically no page was refreshed and it's all extremely fast so it's something that allows you to manage state state and for react developers and javascript developers and if you want to do anything with ecommerce this is an extremely important skill to learn and highly highly paid and so you know that's a little bit of demonstration of redux but sunny why don't you go ahead and like tell us about about it more yeah so that's a really good example of if you guys want to try that out we have a live stream which covers all of that so you can go and build that but redux essentially guys it just it sits alongside react right and it basically imagine you have a beautiful react app it's just like the data layer right that's how i like to always sort of break it down it's a data layer and that data layer allows you to do the things like we saw right it allows you to add like things like uh items to a basket it allows you to keep track of who's signed into your app it allows you to do a bunch of things like that right now the one thing that i really want to emphasize here is that redux or the react context api or whatever you decide to learn they follow the same pattern right they follow the same pattern and that is essentially what that what we have on the right here so we have this diagram which shows um so let's imagine the view that kazi showed you was that of the amazon clone that is the view so you see that on the bottom on the right we have the view right and then we basically have these three things we have actions reducers and stores right stores is just where the data sits actions is how we sort of um so let's say we click the add to basket uh add to basketball on the page okay so what is view so when you say view what is view so this right now this entire web page is the view let's imagine that this entire web page is the view right now when i uh cause he goes ahead and this is the this is when we say view guys like this is the side that the user gets to see this is the visual things that the user can click on your website and see you know but okay go ahead what's next yeah so that exactly so that's going to be the view and now when kazi goes ahead and clicks the add to basket he's going to actually when the minute he clicks that he's going to be pushing or dispatching an action right so imagine like he's got a gun and as soon as he presses that to basket he fires off an action right so it fires off an action and it dispatches an action right and that's the action right so the action here would be something like add to basket so let's actually write that down visually here so this will be the add to basket or add to cart action and this action will carry certain pieces of information so uh attached to it will be the title of the book so in this case it will be a title which will be the i'll just say tls which stands for the lean startup okay yeah and then it would have something like an id it would hide id and then it would have the price as well so the price in this case might be what 1196 right exactly cool yeah and uh keep going yeah so imagine guys you would fire off an action with like this information attached to it right so you would push that off and essentially what we need to do at that point is that something needs to to sort of listen to that action being fired off right so that's where we have reducers right so all a reducer is is it just listens it sits there and it just listens that's the simple way of putting it right so reducer just sit there and listen and basically the reducer if it picks up on that action so let's imagine we've coded up some um some logic that is basically going to go ahead and say if you get an ad to basket action thrown your way then what i want you to do is go ahead and push that item so all of those that tie tool the id the price push that inside of the store inside of your basket for example absolutely there's this like empty basket here and this dispatch once it pulls information like boom it'll send it to this empty basket and it'll store it in there exactly that's what the redu does exactly the reduce is like the middle man it just goes ahead grabs the action and then like sort of says okay this is what i need to do with it and then it puts it in the store in this in whatever way we decide to sort of code that up inside the reducer yeah and then what happens is guys and then it kind of sort of the sort of circle where it all sort of makes sense is if we go ahead and go back to the slides so you can see that was the sort of life cycle of action reducer store right but then you can see the store is what we connect to the view right so the store we connect to the view so that so what happens is then is that if we were then going ahead and changing or sort of adding uh something to the basket because it's attached to the view the view gets rerendered in the special react way right so when i do add to basket few things happen it fires off an event right then the reducer is listening to it so then it actually puts that information in the basket yep and then because it's connected to the view uh then that's why live it actually shows up right there and the basket now says one or you know if i click it multiple times it says whatever it says there are three exactly awesome so guys that pattern essentially the one that we just ran through the what i like to do is i like to sort of show people that i i sort of send people to using the react context api first because it uses that same pattern but it's just very lightweight right it's very easy to actually get started with that and then once you know that pattern then it's very simple to go ahead and implement it with redux redux has a bit more sort of setup behind it but once you sort of get things going it's very nice and it's very it's going to be something which is massively valuable i can't explain to you how valuable redux is going to be for you guys yeah yeah so learn uh the steps that practical steps for you guys to actually learn this guys is learn react context api first and then all the concepts you pick up from there boom you can apply it and if i if we want to make it even more practical literally follow and build the amazon clone that we built on this channel clever programmer where sunny shows you how to build this and then you'll be good to go yeah exactly we just actually got a super donation oh hey oh another one yeah yeah by nissag gandhi wow i'm actually not seeing any new messages come in the last message i see is like i think git versus git lab versus github so i think i'm kind of behind on the i don't know why i don't see the new comments but yeah if you want to shout out the comments that'd be awesome yeah um so guys let's move on to the next thing which is like here are the biggest companies that are by the way thank you for the super donation really appreciate it here are the biggest companies that are using redux guys so um you know airbnb uses redux amazon uses redux netflix ebay spotify facebook twitter google uber so it kind of gives you an insight into why this technology is so uh important because if it wasn't these guys wouldn't be using it exactly and guys if these companies are using it then and like we said earlier netflix is paying up to 300k like 300 000 on a salary guys so if netflix are paying that you can be guaranteed that all of these companies are pretty much paying massive salaries for that and also just to mention i've worked in a bunch of different companies and every single one i've worked in has used redux so just if you don't believe that guys take it from my take it from me that it's literally is something which you massively need um to know yeah yep so that's huge okay so somebody from our facebook said um great what is the difference between basic and pro and i i think what they're talking about actually is the course so let's see if i can actually pull that up uh over here so guys this is our course called profit with javascript and uh in this course we actually show you how to build all of these things and actually make an income with it but uh but the the main difference right now is that between pro and basic is that you'll save 300 that's the main difference as of now so if you got the yearly one you'll save more because it's annual with that said let's just jump straight back into the content because um we want to make sure we give you guys a lot of value nice let's carry on let's move forward yeah guys i love firebase and if you haven't seen a lot of the um sort of tutorials that we've gone through be sure to go check them out because we use firebase so much in those tutorials for pretty much everything we're using firebase all of these projects yeah the reason why they're all hosted guys is actually it's all on firebase so really really nice stuff like and guys so firebase is essentially for those of you guys don't know it is a suite of tools provided by google and it basically allows you that what they did is right they took all of the sort of traditional headaches and they sort of gave us a bunch of tools which solve a lot of issues for us so let's go through some of them so we have the realtime database right so we have the realtime database we have authentication yeah so imagine aws guys but it's very userfriendly aws so me and qazi have used aws kazi how what's the sort of entry level to aws uh you need to be like an i.t master to like just pass through basically like aws is is actually really difficult to pick up it's um you have to kind of go through a lot of hoops and so as a developer you really don't want to be learning uh so much about ip addresses and creating security groups and like is my server in oregon or ohio you just want to make your app and put it online and that's all you really care about right and give access to people firebase takes all of that out so firebase to me is just like the definition of ease and simplicity exactly exactly that and that's the perfect way to put it it's just ease and simplicity guys right so it's going to give us a database and not only just a normal database it's a realtime database so if you guys are wondering what the real time is standing for when we had like the five uh the sort of facebook messenger clone we didn't have to implement anything special to get that realtime functionality so the messages popping in as they came in it was out of the box and it's in it just works out of the box when you use firebase um you have authentication so authentication traditionally is actually quite a headache um it's quite a sort of a pain to sort of get authentication working so with firebase it's literally like two lines of code that you have to add and you already have like a login a sign up and they completely do everything for you even they even have validation and then you have all of these that's the crazy thing guys so i want to kind of emphasize that authentication is a nightmare whether you want to add uh email and password type of authentication and again when we say authentication it's like when you log into instagram that you need authentication to do that right every single website or app you use has authentication setting it up is so hard whether you want to use google authentication or you want to use facebook authentication with firebase it is so simple and yeah i think you showed us how to do that sunny and it was just a few lines of code and authentication is good to go exactly and that's something which we do build in the amazon clone so again really good app to go ahead this is a great question and i think this is the right time to answer it so push asks firebase versus node and actually the answer is guys if you use firebase you can replace node like you actually have no reason to most of the times even use node and it's just so much simpler suddenly you want to uh go on on that and and riff yeah so exactly that so you actually can actually sort of eradicate the need for a back end really if you i would actually say go as far as to using all those all of firebase's tools up until the point where you need only like you actually need some sort of specific backend functionality that firebase doesn't offer then at that point and this is something that me and kazi have done before if you do need node.js what you can go ahead and do is use something called cloud functions so cloud functions it's actually not on this diagram but it's something that is included inside actually one of the one of the most important things yeah cloud yeah that's actually huge yeah so cloud functions um is something where basically imagine like it's so aws have a different version called lambdas and essentially what it is is is you basically it's just literally like imagine a javascript function guys yeah so a simple javascript function um but it's written in node.js so it does that's this is where node.js js comes into it and essentially you can just deploy that one function and it uses a serverless approach and it's able to scale up and um guys whether or not you've got one user or you've got a 500 million users it's going to it's going to scale like you have google servers that are going to scale for you it's going to handle that sort of scale so really important stuff there and i see a lot of people asking a firebase is costly or is firebase free to use it's nice honestly it's free yeah every single build that we've done is completely free so unless you need to do some like sort of additional stuff i think the cloud functions you have to attach a card but it doesn't charge you um so honestly guys it's completely something which is worth learning and yeah you can host everything for free gives you even gives you a really nice url for most of your apps so everything that we showed you guys gives you a good url for that um and it's definitely something worth picking up our netflix clone was called netflix clone something that web app our messenger clone was called messengerclone.web app you know so it's like really really clean urls that you can not like sometimes when you host it with heroku it's like papa 367 29 daddy.com slash like exactly [Laughter] where are you taking me that's my question so yeah it's like server like the power of serverless guys is so sick and the fact that you could use it like i was doing serverless stuff with aws and it was a nightmare to set it up like how i have to like set up my own rest api endpoints and then i got gotta make sure it's in the right server and oh my goodness even when i was setting up my functions sunny i had to be careful like whether i put them in oregon or ohio i'm like why am i having to like put locations for my server like functions like what's next do i have to also like lease an apartment for my functions to live in and keep them there like what how far is this gonna go so with firebase you don't have to worry about any of that yeah you literally have one command line saying firebase deploy and that's it yeah it's that simple yeah somebody asked what's the if there's a paid option like what's the need for the paid option push did for paid option server less functions is one of the reasons why you might need paid uh even on that they're not going to really charge you until the scale is really high so i probably wouldn't worry about paid until you have like millions of visitors hitting your platform per month most of you that's never going to happen so i wouldn't worry about it until then yeah exactly and guys just to touch on this they have so many things which is worth checking out so like even they even have machine learning so i see loads of people asking about hey why don't you go ahead and build something with machine learning guys firebase offers that out of the box i was actually thinking sunny you and i do a tutorial where we do where we use google cloud vision uh google vision and we actually build a um using firebase and react like a uh like face detection app or a edge detection app together nice guys if you guys want to see that let us know in the comments but yeah i'm down for that that would be something which would be fun to build that's definitely go ahead that really excites me because i like frontend stuff but i really like stuff like that it's just it's mindblowing yeah nice and i saw a lot of people actually love the the ai video that we we dropped recently so yeah let's go ahead and build that nice yeah um so hosting guys i think sunny touched on it already that's going to be there any other stuff you want to like touch on from here sunny yeah so like just a few things to just brief over if you are using so guys remember we spoke about react right react is really powerful not just for web apps but you can actually build apps in uh for ios and android using react native right now when you have react native something really really critical right you want to be able to test your apps in so many uh scenarios and so many different variations and this and that now they have something called test lab right test lab's amazing guys so imagine you build an app with react native you deploy it test lab then you basically just upload your app to test lab or i think you just deploy it or whatever you do but you upload it to test lab and then it actually runs it on physical devices so you'll run it on an iphone 11 iphone 10 iphone 9 android um samsung galaxy all of the different variations and it will show you and you can actually put a little robotic script in it so it'll run through the app and test everything it'll give you screenshots of every single page every single um sort of uh like it'll give you screenshots of the app how it looks and that is the most powerful way that you can ever debug an app so honestly that's so so powerful and that's out of the box like i can't stress that enough that's something that they just give you out of the box and alongside crash reporting all this other stuff but i would definitely recommend if you guys are enjoying sort of the firebase stuff that we're covering here definitely go and check it out because they have an endless amount of tools and we've only just touched on some of them but you have notifications so many different things which really do allow you to supercharge your app yeah i think you're muted quasi talking for a while so um david jacobs just came in and he said hey just coming is it okay to make use of firebase and node.js for the same project my gut answer is absolutely it's totally okay but if you most of the times need to use node.js if you get creative you probably won't need to really use node.js you can use serverless cloud functions and do it but sunny uh what are your thoughts yeah so if you are going to go ahead and use cloud functions it will be in node.js anyway yeah so uh so that's sort of a sort of way to think about it if you are going to sort of need node.js then you would be using firebase cloud functions but like carzi said try and use all the tools that they give you before you actually reach that point because what would tend to happen is you might actually end up over engineering when they actually give you a tool which does it all for you in like three lines of code so i'd really make sure you you sort of play with their tools and like the realtime database and stuff before you go ahead and do any of that stuff okay awesome i mean one of the bills like the youtube thumbnail build sonny what we can do is like we can even do more like off like um like something we build live and maybe we might even fail during the live stream but it could be something fun to just build live with everybody you know that could be like a fun building that would be fun actually yeah so we're actually building this uh youtube thumbnail guys where we want to test what the thumbnails look like before we put it out on youtube yeah um so me and kazi came up with an idea to actually go ahead and build this but yeah like if you guys want to see us actually building it from the beginning so not prescripted and everything sort of like the actual things that we face then yeah let us know yep um should we learn dino now sunny just a real quick rapid fire answer dino guys is something which i can you guys can go ahead and look into it's very fresh okay so there's no guarantee that it's going to stick around it's a runtime environment for javascript but guys a whole different video i think we would put for that but go ahead and check it out it's something cool i'm looking into it right now um and i will let you know as we find out oh crap so we didn't actually go into this but uh if we just kept going with the firebase stuff guys like we mentioned the author um auth we mentioned the hosting here are the cloud functions cloud firestore realtime database this is one of the biggest benefits of firebase just the fact that you can have a realtime database with a twoway sync you cannot do that with aws guys i mean they might have the dynamodb which is i think aws has like real time thing i haven't really looked into it but i could not find any other real time and postgres and redshift is just like so slow in terms of being able to check things live in my opinion like firebases this just this functionality realtime database is alone amazing enough to use it and then yeah you get all this awesome stuff here anything you want to touch base on on this or should we move on um pretty much you've covered it mostly uh i would say the one thing that was worth mentioning on that one slide is you see where it says predictions guys so mostly whenever you collect a bunch of analytics it's quite a headache to actually figure out what it's going to do for your app right but they actually apply machine learning to the analytics that you collect and get tell you which users are good which users are like less involved they do a lot of that stuff for you so something worth noticing that that's awesome they even have a machine learning kit which is cool which is what i'm excited to use definitely yeah we'll go ahead and play with that awesome so guys let's jump into nodejs and see what's going on over here so sunny talk to us about node right so node.js guys is pretty much we all know javascript when we sort of hear javascript we think about front end we think about websites we think about sort of the sort of interactivity of a website right but we also use javascript on the server side so it's backend javascript right now here we have a bunch of use cases that we could sort of talk about so we have data streaming so whenever you have sort of like a live stream right now that you guys are watching this probably could be running using node.js right now depending on how they built it right serverside proxying if you do if you're into that big data and analytics but one here that will be very interesting is the rest api so all the way on the right we can see something called rest api and we will be touching on rest api soon but just to let you go let you guys know roughly what a rest api is imagine we had like so for example when we built the netflix clone right we didn't hard code all of that information right we actually went ahead and pulled that from a service and that service was written in node.js right so that service that actually provided all of that stuff yeah we didn't we didn't want to sit there and like literally pull every single piece of information on the movie lucifer and dark desire and dark and all of that stuff it was yeah exactly we're using tmdb which is a service that has all this information and using their api we just pulled it into our app otherwise we'd have to spend like years building just the database of movies exactly exactly so the way to think about node.js because i remember when i was learning javascript i was super confused i was like am i coding in javascript right now or node.js and the truth is guys that now they've sort of progressed to the same level where it's literally like essentially whatever you can do on the front end picture it as you can now do on the back and that's why javascript is a language which everyone needs to learn because you actually before what would happen is you would have one language for the front end and you'd have a totally separate language for the back end but now with javascript you have that the same language consistent on your front end and back in which means that the better you get at javascript the better you become as a full stack developer which is really awesome genius way to put it i love that that's actually really really cool so no need for php i imagine yeah i coded in php guys and i will happily tell you that this replaces that everything it does this replaces it and all this other stuff you guys can actually do with node.js as well so whether it's big data analytics you want to do system monitoring dashboards wireless connectivity you want to build chat bots realtime data web scraping automation all of this stuff you guys are able to do it any other things we should touch on here sonny uh i think we covered a lot of it remember guys when we touched on firebase all of the cloud function stuff that we spoke about is going to be using node.js to add that into it yeah yep awesome so let's go ahead and now move to the next thing so what's going on here so this is actually good because we just literally brought up the cloud functions example so here guys imagine we had a a firebase cloud function right so imagine we sign in as a user right and the good thing with card functions is you can actually sort of imagine that middle cloud function guys is written in node.js right so that middle cloud function is written in node.js so we sign in as a user then we pass like the sort of the user's id their token and some data alongside it right now that cloud function is going to get triggered automatically just to make it like very real like so if i am on my phone right now and i log into like instagram app on my phone right yeah then i'm past the step one that i drew and now i'm like sending that information potentially over to a cloud function and it has my user id so if i'm like my user id is five four four three it's passing that five four four three over the cloud function exactly and let's imagine we had some special cloud function guys which checked for five four four three let's say like it checks it if you if you log in and you are raphaekazi yeah then it's gonna send you to the special raf akazi version of instagram right so let's just imagine we have this imaginary app right so it and it checks all of the users who log in if it's five four four three we're gonna i'm not gonna send you to normal instagram we're gonna send you to the kazegram right we're gonna send you to the kazi version of instagram right um then what you can do is you can basically do whatever you want afterwards but in this case it's saying write a document to the cloud firestore which is basically the realtime database but but just to show you guys it's super sort of versatile in what you can do here right so you can write a cloud function which would get triggered for any use case so we have cloud functions which run daily which do little jobs for us um we do things for example me and carson used to check on a bunch of different metrics every day so instead we built a card function to to actually do that for us here's here's one here's one example of one thing we do right so for example we take um revenue made yesterday okay yep um let me actually put it here revenue made yesterday then we use uh twilio api to send that as a text message to all of our phones now here what we're doing is we're using an api right to actually send the text message and then we're uh using this and now we want this to send a message to us at 5 00 am every single morning right so this actually sends at 5am every morning so you guys some of you might have heard of something like a cron job this is what we refer to as a cron job it's just something that's scheduled i don't know why that name is there but it's like a scheduled think of it like a scheduled function yeah and now that all of this is happening guys and this is actually happening because of cloud function exactly okay and we're literally using firebase and um we are able to this is essentially a cloud function okay and firebase allows us to host this cloud function run it as a cron job and every five a.m it like takes our revenue from yesterday and sends it to us as a text message yeah and that's just an example and guys that one simple fun like uh use case makes our life so much easier every day because it just automated the tasks that we would otherwise have to do and we can send that text message to the entire team yeah otherwise like what we had to do was we had we had a person who we had hired who would literally like look at four or five different sources where we had income coming from and then manually they would have to remember and then they would have to manually text everybody on the team they would make mistakes sometimes the numbers could be wrong um sometimes it wouldn't text everybody um and so this doesn't make any mistakes it's 100 right and it just makes our lives easier by combining five different resources into one exactly exactly awesome so let's move on to the next thing right so now let's talk about command line why is the command line so important sunny yeah so just opening up the command line here guys so i always find that people see our command line that we use and they always ask like what are you using because our command line is different to the one that you're going to see so what i would recommend is everyone actually goes ahead and download something called oh my zsh and it's really really good because it just powers up your command line so imagine it just sort of adds like this very clean ui it gives you a bunch of sort of like power ups and plugins that you can mess around with but the point is guys why do we need to know the command line the command line is pretty much going to be it's going to allow you to do things manipulate things like git so it's going to allow you to push your code to git repos it's going to allow you to start your react app it's going to allow you to do the basic things like create create folders and things like that and guys remember like a lot of you guys might be thinking at this point yeah but i can just right click and i can open and i can click new folder right but how do you do that with npm start like you need the command line to be able to do that right if you want to push code to github yes you could do it in vs code now but before you couldn't do that before so you would actually need and i still use the command line when i push to github yeah um and cause you actually code quite used to code quite a lot with the command line right yeah yeah i mean i code pretty much most of my stuff with command line and there's like really like there's some really crazy stuff you can do with the command line that like you will have trouble doing with anything else like if i can almost like uh demo something let me actually grab i would like to grab some kind of react code or even like take something like this right let's say i copy this um i'm copying this link which you guys can't see this is this link right over here i'm copying it right now if i want to paste it you know normally what you have to do is you like gotta open some uh file you gotta like go inside of it and paste it from my command line i can actually do this and let me actually show you because let me see if i can move this here boom let's go right there and i'll show you something really like kind of fancy that i like to do this is just for demoing purposes but let's go ahead and let's just do i'll just do pb paste and uh here's the demo yt app right and now if i actually find this app that i cr folder that i created on my computer which i want to make sure that i don't share everything with you guys okay let's actually make it a javascript file right every every time you demo this stuff it fails but it's okay because i'm going to just keep going till it works that's it and guys when you're coding this is normal stuff you're going to run into this right so this is just one example of what i did like i copied some piece of thing right and i pasted it in here now this is just a url that i pasted through the command line but like if i have huge chunks of code it allows me to move so freaking fast and here's one thing i want to say about speed okay people often think that when it comes down to speed you either do something slow or you do something fast there are two things here's what i said that's completely wrong you either do things fast or you don't do them at all i'll give you an example imagine you had to edit a video and every single frame that you hit edit on if it took two hours for it to refresh imagine if you were building an app on your on your computer on your local host and let's say you made a change to it and you wanted to see your change imagine if it took one hour to see your change how does my navbar look how does my role that i created look instead of being able to give it to you instantly when you hit refresh that would have a major difference right to your building process and experience and as a matter of fact you would actually not build a lot of features because you can't test it and see it fast so command line what it allows you to do my favorite thing for it is it allows you to move at just a brutally insanely fast speed get freaking good at command line if you get fast at this you can bust out two apps while somebody else is building their first app and it takes them like three weeks so learn it it's gonna be highly highly paid but more importantly your process of development will just be so much more enjoyable so get past the fear of the dark screen and just fall in love with it yeah and it is daunting when you first start guys that we've all been there where we don't even know how to interact with the command line um and it can get very scary in the beginning but just to get just start moving towards it even if you fail what's the worst thing that's going to happen like you just carry on and you learn from that one thing to work with that's worth mentioning guys you're gonna need to know this because things like firebase like for example when you deploy your app to firebase you need to know how to do that with the command line right you need to be able to you need to be able to write firebase deploy inside of the command line in the correct folder to be able to deploy your app so you're going to need to be able to know that stuff even when you're using get it's something where you you just kind of have to learn this at some point yep yep beautiful so let's move on to rest api so rest apis why are what are these things why are they important guys like if i wanted to build a face detection right let me actually show you guys a few days ago we made a video aaron and i and it was on face detection so let me pull it up on my screen here and show it to you guys so boom here it is build a real time face detection this is like probably the best use case of why things like api matters and even though technically we're in this case but it's kind of like an api okay i just want to get the concept across so let's go here where he's demoing the app so check this out right so right now guys it's detecting his face doesn't matter where he's moving and what he's doing so you can see that now this if we had to write this code to make this work sonny how long would it take us to figure out how to do proper face detection all by ourselves write it and run code that does this how long would it take oh dude like you stressed me out just saying it i mean i don't know where we'd begin like this is why we need things like services that have figured out that it's pretty depressing but suddenly you and i in our entire lifetime would never be able to figure out how to do it yeah it would take forever dude it takes so long to figure that out copy pasting stuff or figuring it out or stealing somebody else's research you and i in our lifetime like there are very few people who could figure out this type of stuff and this spent their whole life dedicated to like how face detection works you don't want to like sit there and write this algorithm from scratch you use it so like api in this case we basically used an api to get access to all this code that allows us to do it so guys for us it actually took six lines of code to make this entire app work yeah that's insane that's insane i really want to do that i really want to give that a go in javascript which is why this is this is these are some of the reasons i really like python because like when you can do it in like six lines of code it is kind of nice and like take a look at this there's just one part where everybody started going crazy on the live stream and look aaron pulled up an image that i had sent to him from our live stream and it started detecting the faces on that image oh damn that's from the phone yeah that's clean yeah so this is why guys api is super important here's the ugly image of this these sunny i don't know why you put this image in these are the images that i saw that like made me never want to learn apis yeah do you know why it's because this i know they're they're ugly images but they're just they are like they really explain what an api as well no for somebody who doesn't know apis this is the i the only person i feel like this can help is somebody who knows apis but okay go ahead go ahead explain it explain it so guys all an api is essentially right you have the client so that the actual web page that you're on so that's the left thing that we see the client sends a request so like imagine you click or we went to the netflix page right um so the netflix app is loading on that left screen um and then what it does is it makes a request so in the netflix build we actually communicate it to a server and the server that we sort of reached out to was something called tmdb so it's like imdb it's like the sort of it's a it's a movie record database right yeah and what that ended up doing we sent a request so we sent a get request so it's that top one we actually went ahead and sent a get request and we sent that to their server um and we just basically asked and they basically if you read the documentation they tell you how you can send that request and so forth and basically they responded with some information in the form of json right so it's a json object and basically guys that's what we end up rendering on the screen so basically like like for example here right this was blank and it was like literally imagine this was empty and had no information okay as soon as this page loaded and then boom what it does is it takes this and fires off and goes hey dude i need this information right now because like literally i'm like displaying something that's empty i'm freaking out so it sends that over and then tmdb is like yo relax here's like the information and it goes yeah this movie here is called dark desire pop that in and then boom we're like all right let's pop it into our app i love our aggressive the api you're relaxed the api is just like straight up like gangster nice oh man we gotta have more gifs and uh memes in our next presentation sunny like all this stuff you should actually explain through gifts and memes yeah well yeah we should we should we'll get rid of this for the next one [ __ ] this image i never want to see this image again this image reminds me of like when like i used to see my brother's like college classes back in 2006 and he was learning i'm like oh i knew it was going to start a conversation with quality content guys i'd do that for you you just you just put it so like all the nerdy people on the stream like anybody who's like super nerdy they could just be satisfied and they can't like talk [ __ ] to us you know exactly i saw a few thumbs up when this screen came on oh yeah by the way guys smash that like button if you're enjoying this content so far it really really helps us okay so please please please do that definitely right should we move over to the next slide yes let's move over and like just so let's just a little quick thing before we completely change um just at a high level guys it's like there's a few different things so you know you want to be able to delete information or change information so anytime here's how i think of it anytime you want to get information just think get i need information get get get get get so it's like on instagram post if you want like when i go to instagram.com right here all my get requests in my mind this is a get request is getting the data getting the image showing the image so that's think get and like put it in your brain now when you go and you want to like post something that's going to be post so for example if i go back to instagram anything that requires any type of posting so when i'm posting a comment and i hit enter in my mind i chain that with post post post post post so then when i'm thinking i need to post that's going to be post if i want to go and like change this exact image that's right here that in my mind is just like update so that's put put is update i don't know why could they call it that but put really is like update so yeah boom delete is the most obvious one if i go and delete any of my comments any of my posts that's just gonna be delete so that's how i like to think about it really nice breakdown yeah nice thanks all right guys so let's jump into flexbox sunny take it over yeah so flexbox guys and the the reason why you would want to use flexbox is it allows you to essentially get a fully responsive web design right which means so like look at this illustration right here so you got a bunch of different devices right but imagine that's one website so obviously when you see a lot of websites when you go on your phone it looks slightly different when you go on your desktop right now back in the day this used to be a nightmare to do this like you had to use something like you had to use endless media queries and sort of all this headache to get that to do that or you would actually end up building two different apps so if you look at some really old apps they actually have two completely horrible looking like a horrible mobile app and a really nice desktop one if you for example check this visually like talk about also what you're saying so like yeah guys without flexbox right we won't be able to get this nice functionality here and how easy this was to set up like all these rows are actually built using flexbox uh at the top the nav bar that you guys see that looks really slick when i hover down that is using flexbox um as well but keep going sunny yeah exactly so uh even uh all of the builds that we actually did are actually responsive so if the screens get all responsive yeah if we take this because it's flexbox it's responsive so you guys see how the netflix one like turns into a nice like mobile version flexbox exactly and guys yeah so it's definitely going to be a skill and like the the need for it is very clear here right you if you want to support mobile devices tablets etc you need to know flexbox which is why most people use um or they require you to know about flexbox yep uh i love what this guy says he goes can you guys start teaching graphql instead of rest i have worked on it's really cool so one thing i want to actually say to that is um can we sunny i think we need to start doing live streams where we're doing live builds live builds that actually also live for us so like yeah one great use case for graphql honestly is i want to actually build uh like something with facebook ads you know yeah and you and i were talking about doing stuff with facebook ads so we can actually create a dummy test account for facebook ads just so the user token and stuff like that we can share it with everybody on the screen and we can actually use graphql there because facebook uses graphql and then we can actually run ads build ads and the videos would be really cool it'd be like hey how we built our own bot and like it's spent five thousand dollars this month you know and like oh that'll be fun yeah that'd be nice yeah and and yeah like guys it's really nice by the way when you guys drop those comments in because it lets us know what you guys are interested in learning or like what you guys want to do and then me and kazi can go ahead and like jump on a live stream and actually go and build it which is like like you said it's going to be fresh for us like i i've used graphql in the past but am i am i a professional am i a pro at it no like i'm pretty fairly new to it like in some sense so we can go ahead and do and learn that together and i think that'll be a really really useful for for everyone to to see yep awesome um yep so basically it's uh yeah i think um just one thing i i do want to mention okin lily um asks can you explain put versus patch so yeah i mean uh the basic basic version i can give you of put versus patch is just like put is for updating so if i want to update my caption if i want to update my youtube video that already exists i'm going to use put if i want to oh wait wait wait that's actually a good good good one so sunny actually can you explain the difference between put versus patch because i thought he was asking put versus um let's say delete or something like that so just give us a little put versus patch so as far as i'm aware so perk guys is what you're going to probably be using most of the time right so it's going to be like when you change like the um actual sort of you're going to be changing the actual sort of uh sort of document or whatever sort of like item that you're changing inside of your in your inside of your api rest api but patch is when you actually want to change uh make changes to the part of the resource at a given location right so what you're actually doing is you're making a change to the resource and you're changing its properties so there is a there's a slight difference there um to be honest with you i actually end up using most of the time i don't i haven't actually ran into personally i haven't run into a case where i've used patch much yeah i actually find in most tutorials they tell you um but if we have a little check here i can see unlike patch applies a partial update to the resource so it's going to apply a partial update as opposed to put which applies like an entire update to your resource yeah but um guys keep it simple just probably use put unless you're working with other developers on your team and they have specific reasons for where you use put or patch the most important thing is you guys stay consistent here with your team that's going to be the the really key difference here um awesome okay all right nice i saw some questions where we were talking about flexbox and some people are saying what about css grid yeah we should actually do something with grid too i think that would be great yeah awesome so this grid guide is really good for responsive design as well yeah yep so let's move forward with this guys so flexbox froggy is a great resource for you guys to go and use to learn flexbox it's a playful way to in an interactive way you'll pick up flexbox i think it's honestly the best way to do it yeah i learned music now yeah yeah that's how sunny learn and uh so yeah i would say use the one thing though is like don't just use this and then like don't also code ever uh use it and then kind of like try to build something using what you learned from here but this is a good action step for you guys to go and use it's a website called flexbox froggie and just by playing you will learn so much more than you will learn through like sometimes even tutorials exactly and guys i can't stress enough like how quickly i learned flexbox when i use this which is why we show everyone who is interested in flexbox flexbox foggy because it's really going to it's it's the first tutorial i can truly say i did it once and i just got it like i understood flexbox after that um so if even if you're like you think you're good at flexbox i'll go ahead and give this game a try and i'm sure it'll make you a bit better than you thought you were in the beginning before you gave it a try one thing that komal said which i think like we can we can um help fix a little bit he said put is adding a new movie all properties to that new card um patch updates properties in an existing card so how i would see it is like i would probably when i'm adding a new movie i would probably see it as a post i would do post if i'm adding a new movie so just be careful of this um a trap guys put probably use only for updating existing things and then use post for adding a new movie yeah but let's let's avoid that rabbit hole for now and let's jump straight into graph q l so sunny want to touch base on this yeah so this is a really nice diagram here which actually explains it quite well so we spoke a lot about like frontend backend so when we talk about frontend we're talking about the client we're talking about backend we're talking the server so the client is the top half of this diagram and the client is basically like the netflix clone or like the amazon clone like it's the front end it's what the user sees right so in this case we either have it we either have the web or like you could be from coming from an ios or android device so here you can see you have like a website or or an app so a website or an ios and android app right now what what what makes graphql so powerful is that basically you can have um let's say we have a graphql client so in this case you can see in the middle where it's using something called apollo here right so apollo is a very popular graphql client and what it basically does is you can basically plug so a bunch of different services into that graphql client right so imagine we had a bunch of different rest apis a bunch of different micro services a bunch of like and the database all go into that graphql api and then basically you code up that that graphql api in a certain way and it basically allows the front end so the web or those apps to ask for the data it needs in a really really simple way so kazi if we can go over to graphql the website they actually have some really nice visuals on there which explain this really nice and i think that will actually help a lot of people out so it's a query language for your api it's basically the really nice way to put this and if we scroll a little bit down here you can actually see it says ask for what you need get exactly that so you can see here guys you pretty much just pass in so let's say you need the uh the hero of from a film and you need their name and height right you pretty much just type that in so you see we need the hero we need the name and height and then it goes and scans your whole basically backend so like your rest apis the databases microservices and it will go ahead and grab that for you whoa now obviously there's some setup to get this working but it's very powerful once you once you get this set up and working in the way that you need it and it means that you can also basically if we scroll a little bit down so this is another that is so clean how they visually show like how from the actual app or whatever you can just do that and then look how it gives you that data back that's such a nice visual really nice right like from many different services it can just like from one request pull in so much information um and also guys it's it's type friendly so if you've ever used something called typescript um or like if you're coming from a javascript graph apis are actually organized in terms of types fields and not end points what yeah insane that's insane so no so you're not basically doing the base url and all that crap here like how in apis you gotta use a base url and then you gotta use like slash you know hero like you know what i mean yeah so here you don't you pretty much just me you have this one beautiful request which is on the left you can see it's just saying hero and you all you do is specify the fields that you want so literally you say i want the name inside of the friends this is actually like way like i actually want to use graphql actually now way more than um yeah it's insane dude and now what you can actually do is i've seen people hook firebase's database up to graphql or i think they did it using they've done it in a very clever way but you basically get firebase with graphql which is insane um yeah so you can do that and also graphql gives you a very nice sort of um developer tool experience so here you can actually sort of you get this sort of uh playground sort of experience um once you've got it up and running and you can just test it by basically you can run like these queries against your own database and stuff like that and it and it goes ahead and pulls that information in for you so you can see if it's working see if anything's broken it's so powerful guys like is this is a real need for this and a lot of big companies are using it um and yeah it's really really something that you you recommend you do learn if you go down to the bottom cause it actually shows you who's using graphql right now evolve your api without versions dude what is this thing i want to use it yeah it's crazy right like you can actually evolve it and it won't damage the existing queries it just sort of upgrades them to sort of add the information and wait hold on so damn that is awesome wait it can create your api from just the code itself like if i just gave it code and it had functions and all that because it seems like i'm not even doing anything to to do that and it's creating the api or am i wrong on that um it depends so you're i think you basically provide something called a schema in graphql um where you basically map oh i think i'm not actually entirely sure it might have changed since the last time i used that but they all i know is that they have a very clever way of doing this so i think it'll be something really really good that we can go ahead and sort of play with uh soon okay but you can see here guys facebook github pinterest intuit coursera shopify all of them are using graphql and also every company i've worked in also has used graphql so it's something which is definitely um highly used and very powerful that's amazing i love this yeah yeah i'm glad we shared the website awesome yeah really really nice so learn learn that skill guys that's number nine okay learn this skill and then a number 10 we have is server side rendering so why is this an important skill to learn sunny why server side rendering yeah so server side rendering is is a technique right it's a technique for rendering clientside apps right so so when we talk about whenever you hear serverside rendering it's a technique for rendering something called singlepage apps so can you can you can can um so for me what helps for me is like are any of our apps that we have up right now using server side rendering or no no no no but if we we can demonstrate it with it so let's go ahead and go to this one right now so let's go to our netflix app and this will hit refresh yep yeah so let's do a refresh so you can see guys when it popped in you see everything sort of popped in and then there was loading and there was a bunch of stuff which happened right so let's do it again yeah yeah so kazi's got quite a fast internet connection over on his side right now so it's quite it's going to be quite hard to tell right yeah but what actually is happening right now is the website loads right and then it's going ahead and making all of these additional requests to go ahead and get information right it's going ahead and making an additional request to go and get like the the film that we see there cursed dark desire right here yeah star wars yeah it goes ahead and makes all those different quests right but what you can actually go ahead and do is use something like next js which is a serverside rendering um is one of the most popular tools that you use when you're serverside rendering and basically what it does is when you make the request to even go on to the netflix clone website it pings a server where next.js is running right it will ping a server when xjs is running and it basically will go ahead and do all of this rendering so all of the loading and stuff like that on that server which is going to be extremely fast right because that server is going to be like highly maintained in a very fast environment et cetera and then it will do everything and and you can even do things like caching it so imagine like it does the really expensive calculations once to load up a really heavy website and then it just basically every react app the way to think of it is what what you're seeing right here is just one bundle right the entire thing is called a single page app so even if you have different pages to a website it's just one bundle right but that bundle when you don't have serverside rendering takes a long time to load even though it looks pretty quick it does take a long time to load and what that affects is how quickly you can actually start using the web page so we call that time to interact yeah and when you're building production websites that time to interact is so important guys right so you want to get the time to interact down because imagine you're you've gone to amazon and for example it was just loading it was loading and you're sitting on amazon right yeah and like you you could literally lose customers at that point because they nobody likes to wait on a loading screen right but if you do serverside rendering all of the heavy lifting is done elsewhere and it will literally just like as soon as you hit amazon it will literally just ping you the amazon sort of bundle which they've already done on their site or they've already sort of loaded it up it will send it to you and it's super fast right so it's really really fast let me go ahead and see let's go ahead and show something called next js and let me see if their website's actually um quite handy so yeah if you go ahead and open up the next js website so nextgs is something which is really powerful i've used it um in a company called tesco which is like the walmart in america and they use it over there wow and the reason why yeah they use it then it's like you can see here guys it's the react framework so it's a react framework firstly so again we're touching base on react it's good for static websites it's good for seo so seo this is huge i completely messed it i missed this guys so when you have google web scrapers right google the way it sort of crawls the internet is that it basically goes ahead and it basically like with these web scrapers record it goes in and it clicks on links and it basically checks what the contents of that link is right now when you have a react page we see it load in front of us but when like a web scraper opens it and loads it it doesn't actually show everything right but if they if we do implement server side rendering when the web scraper opens it they get the entire bundle right so they get all of the text all of the images everything whereas if a web scraper goes on it and it's a client and it's not it doesn't use serverside rendering they don't get all the text straight away it has to load and basically that damages your search ranking in google which means that you don't come to the top of your google searches basically this will like boost up your seo by a lot if you're using something like next.js exactly exactly that's awesome yeah that's awesome it will really boost it they do things like uh so if you scroll a little bit down there's something called automatic code splitting which is huge so imagine so code splitting is essentially where you only are going to import um what you need so imagine we're on like the homepage right it's only going to show you it's only going to sort of like pull in the information which is on the home page so and it does this ingenious ways right it does it in really clever ways so imagine we've got a bunch of modules inside of an app so we have like 100 modules if the home page only uses three of those modules then it's actually going to only load three modules oh wow that is changing that's crazy right that's really crazy and it splits out and i don't know how they do that like it's really genius how they they built that but um that's called code splitting and that's something which is really powerful and you can see here when cars you click more you've got all of that stuff which there's a bunch of other stuff um and they sas is included which is like this this sort of advanced css technique um dynamic routing so you can see there we've got roots supported so if you had forward slash blog forward slash like a random idea you could that's supported out of the box typescript is supported out of the box um so there's a lot of things which are used it has got a little bit of a learning curve when you when you start going into um server side development but scroll down qazi and this is where you see the demand for it look at that all of these websites are using server side rendering like these are huge websites guys like twitch docker hulu scale github netflix like or coinbase like there's a lot of cryptocurrencies i can see here like these losses i spend a lot of money on finance fame i use binance twitch damn i did not know twitch was using this wait really really yeah so starbucks uber yeah docker wow so this is yeah this is powerful so this is um i mean i even want to pick this up because i'm new to their whole react world but i want to pick up how to use next in our apps and just make them lightning fast yeah exactly wow oh nice they actually have a showcase at the bottom oh that's cool yeah oh take time but it's going yeah tick tock i saw that that's amazing right yeah wow but guys this is essentially going to allow you to have lightning fast websites um there are some things which need to be like considered when you're learning how to do serverside rendering but if you guys are interested in that then let us know and we can go ahead and like like as you said it will be interesting for us to both learn this a bit more and get more ingredients involved in this by the way guys but it was this is this exciting for you guys like is this actually valuable please let us know in the comments like where you guys mind at after finding out about all of this information like the top 10 things that we covered right we talked about server side rendering we talked about graphql we talked about flexbox we talked about rest apis why that's important talk about command line node.js why you guys need it we talked about firebase and how this is so valuable for your backend and hosting and all of that we talked about the redus technology we talked about git why you need to use it and of course we talked about react so was this valuable to you guys drop it in the comments below and just let us know that this gave you value or maybe what was your number one biggest insight so we want to hear from you do it now exactly and guys if you did find value in this remember like smash the thumbs up button because if you found value in it then it's going to help other people find the video and also see the value that you got from this video so definitely smash it if you if you enjoyed this and you found this was something new even if you learned something new guys smash the thumbs up button yeah do that uh ian asks can you use node.js for server side rendering what do we think sunny um yeah so i would say the way to think of this remember node.js is backend um so yes yeah yeah the answer to your question is yes right awesome yes because yeah it's empty yes awesome david jacobs i love that he says i've learned a lot from this today i learned more than i ever expected that is beautiful that is exactly the caliber that we're trying to go for guys and we're just gonna be keep this coming every day every day nonstop and we're gonna keep producing at this caliber for you guys but again your participation is what really engages us and gets us to want to do this every day so thanks for that and we're just going to keep rapid firing through this uh one of the facebook uh one of our people on facebook say yeah you need serverside rendering was new to me so so this was so valuable thank you amazing nice that is great um somebody asks what about the course do i learn it all there so sunny what would you say right so yeah guys a lot of the things we spoke about today we actually cover this so guys remember it there's the whole web development space is so dynamic right so we actually go ahead and cover this inside the course inside of the coaching course so the coaching course we have four weekly live coaching goals inside of the course and inside of this coaching course we pretty much cover what's trending what's new what's going on in in this web development world and we build that stuff in real time with you guys yep so i go through um i do that i hold a bunch and unlike unlike youtube you guys literally get to speak to sunny like you will actually get to talk to sunny live and ask these questions so right now even though it might feel like there's this like barrier between us like on the zoom calls you guys will be actually speaking with us as we help you every single week build these massive projects and then once you guys go ahead and build projects or you complete your homework you will get personalized video feedback from javascript success coaches myself and the rest of the team and we actually go in and give you some personal video feedback on on the breakdown of your code what went well what could be you can create all of the things like that yeah let's prove it to you guys right so this is where a lot of you guys submit projects to us so look at that we have tons of projects right and people are submitting us to all their projects like what they're building right so if i keep showing you guys these apps that students are building and sending it to us then you know whether somebody lafan just built a netflix clone following what we did uh z sean is building his portfolio and he's sharing it with us right so we have all these and then somebody built the covet tracker following like one of our apps and so here's one thing i want to show you guys so take a look at this pretty cool it's super fancy works fast now if we go over on the right hand side you guys look at this we're actually providing everybody with a personalized video feedback so here's tatiana providing one of the video feedbacks for one of the students and if i skim through this look she's going through she's talking about what she thinks about this project how this app can be improved um and then also giving him feedback on what he needs to do next to improve so guys let me ask you what would it do for you what would it mean for you if you were submitting your projects and you were getting personalized video feedbacks from us giving you insights on exactly where to improve i mean that alone can literally land you a job because you would improve so damn fast i mean where else sunny can people get video feedbacks on their code where else can that happen like i mean like guys the way i like to put this is basically how many of you guys have gone to like stack overflow and been just like shot yourself in the footwear you ask a question and the only thing we've all been there right we've all been there we go to stack overlook we ask a question and we just feel very stupid afterwards because like nobody helps us or that we don't get answered to that question but here guys you get personalized video feedback for every question for every assignment if you want to jump on a coaching call you have a zoom call where you can literally shout out as many questions as you want and we can go through it as a massive team we can go through and discuss your questions everything is heard and listened to and it's addressed onetoone which is is something which you're just not going to get anywhere else no so this is why guys if you're serious about like you're having a career as a developer and the fact that like yes we give you the nonstop training and the handholding and the community yes we give you the training modules one of the most important things is we teach us actually how to make an income with this right guys so like for example let's just if i go to upwork right now and i go into jobs and we type in react js right something like this like you guys can see that jobs start to come up instantly looking for a react node developer one to three months and we're and they look look at this they're even like there's amazon right we actually show you how to build amazon look they're talking about redux here we teach you redux all of these things that we've actually shown you and today we even talked about aws rest serverless all of these things are actually their jobs people are looking and applying for these jobs and hiring people for all of this stuff right this second so our thing is we don't just want to teach you and give you knowledge that's useless i mean knowledge plus four dollars can almost get you a starbucks our main thing here is the fact that we take your coding skills and then show you literally how to get those jobs on upwork on freelancer.com or even how to get actual fulltime jobs yeah exactly and guys just this isn't actually just something we say like i love every single time i get a message from one of our students where they land a client or they land a job and the amount i've gotten so like it's actually become like a normal thing now like the amount of times that we i have a student reach out saying hey i'm in the final round of an interview and then i'll send me a message saying hey i got the job or like hey i landed a client and the other day i had somebody in sri lanka who actually made an entire month's salary in one week's worth of work which was insane that really is if he made the entire month's salary in one week he's actually moving on the timeline of his entire lifespan he's moving 4x as fast so what that actually means guys is he and in four years from what he's learning from the course he's gonna achieve the same results that he would have achieved in 16 years right like that's how you should think about time in the long time span of things this is a power of like when you learn something or you have a mentor or whatever like on our live streams we even have steve uh or stephen he comes and he drops tons of value imagine if you're actually learning from him directly the people under steve's mentorship are moving at a timeline their timeline of learning is shrinking so what those people would have come to learn on their own in seven six years under steve to learn it in one year massive massive value right because look you can get your money back money is replenishable but time time is not replenishable time just goes away and then never uh comes back so if you guys are interested you got value out of this what i'd highly recommend is click the link in the description below and check out our course profit with javascript as a matter of fact you should just go and do that right now if you're on here and jump in the course we would love to see you inside and we'll provide you with just tons of value so at this point click that link and jump inside of the course yeah yeah right now guys and one thing i want to add to that right guys this is something i can't stress enough the the literally the point in my development career where i really noticed i excelled was when i had good mentors around me right now finding a good mentor is actually really quite a difficult thing especially when you're nuked to coding right but in profit javascript you don't just get one mentor you get me you get cars you get nars you get jacob you get the entire success coach team you get everyone inside of that inside of the course and they will everyone is your mentor at that point so like literally you can there is like there is a recipe for just nothing but success in the inside of the course like in terms of you can literally reach out and guys there's no like hierarchy here in terms of like if you need to message me and say hey sonny i need help on my assignment or hey son you need help with my homework just send me one message and we can jump on a call that's it we'll jump on and we'll actually help you sophie asks i want to know does age matter i'm 27 and looking for my first react job really good question do you know how young my first student was and they uh they were 12 years old right 12 years old a reaction 12. all right 12 years old landed his own school as his client so age does not matter there is no you can't be too young you can't be too old he made some good money from that job as well like guys market doesn't mark the market doesn't care about your age it doesn't care if you're 80 it doesn't care if you're 15 or 12 the market only cares that you can bring value to the world so eight your age nobody cares about they only want to hire on the skills and the value you can bring but keep going sonny no exactly exactly that yeah so honestly like age guys at this point does not matter and you really really don't have to um to freak out about the sort of age like if you if you have a sort of any doubts just think to yourself scrap it to the side and just start my main advice is whatever age just start you're never too old that's it never too old uh thank you guys for coming on somic says i just saw a video of your master class and he goes that was just great thank you guys for coming on we really appreciate your guys's energy participation questions um just the care that you guys bring we really really appreciate you guys thank you guys so much at this point if you're here and you're curious guys jump in the program profit with javascript we love your beautiful face sonny is there anything else you want to say no i can't stress it enough guys like we want to speak to you guys and we want to get in conversations with you guys which is why we love it when you guys tag us in your instagram stories um but like we said check out the link in the description go and check out prophet javascript worth mentioning guys like literally there is nothing to lose like you have a 30day moneyback guarantee so on the 29th day 59th minute if you still feel like oh this isn't really for me you can go ahead and just go ahead and get your money back like when when there's that guarantee behind it i just think you have 29 days of free training like literally 29 days of free training 29 days to make your mind up as to whether or not it's good enough but do not just miss out on it because i'm telling you this could be this is this is going to be the decision that changes your life yep and i love what james said he says the market does not care about your age he's just like what matters is he can bring value to the world wow exactly exactly reyes i think this is a great question he asks he says i would like to know if um i can learn react.js and i can get the job where i am living in houston yep so yeah honestly guys this is the beautiful thing about being a javascript developer and react in particular like you can work from anywhere guys and you can land clients anywhere so if you're based in asia if you're based in let's just say in like you could be based in india you could be based in like america you could be based in london you can get clients anywhere else in the world like you could land a uk client you could land a u.s client you can land jobs um with any of these guys and you could yes so to answer your question if you're based in houston then you can get any job in any part of the world and this is actually something which leads on to um something called a nomad lifestyle it actually opens the door for something which a lot of people do where they
