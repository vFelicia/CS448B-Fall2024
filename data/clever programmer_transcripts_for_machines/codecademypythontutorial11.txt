hey guys what is up this is kazy from clever program.com and you're watching code academy part 11 okay so without any further Ado let's get started also see what I did there I was referencing 11 from the movie or the show stranger things that sucks if you don't if you didn't get it because I was wondering about how I'm going to solve this problem of counting past more than 10 fingers and that was a solution that came to my head I thought it was pretty witty if you liked it comment on it all right a day at the supermarket we're at 84% so let's keep going okay stocking out now you need to compute Bill function to take the stock inventory and something okay not going to read that too much read reading make the bill function changes to your compute function Bill hold on actually let's read it function to take the stock SL inventory of a particular item into account when Computing the cost ultimately If an item isn't in stock then it shouldn't be included in the total you can't buy or sell what you don't have totally makes sense make the following changes to your compute Bill function let's do that while you Loop through each item of food only add the price of the item to Total if the item stock count is greater than zero so I'm going to say for item in food and I'm going to say if uh let's create a variable here called price or sorry um we don't have to actually create a variable we can just say if stock of that item is greater than zero then this part happens so I hit tab to indent that you can also just do this simply backspace all the way up to the colon hit enter and it will do that for you don't forget your colons after every for Loop definition and if statement you have a colon all right because that's kind of like defines the things that you're indenting under that and that becomes a block of that code right so if this function you don't indent anything underneath it now it's not um the total is actually not part of the def it's actually going to give you an error in this case so you want to make sure that it's indented so you're saying these pieces of code they go together there's it's a block of code okay so if the item stock uh is greater than zero that's the only time we actually increment the cost of total by the prices the price of the item that totally makes sense because you can't sell well you don't have so right it would not make sense if we went to Apple which had a stock of zero but you went up and looked up the prices and incremented the prices of total by two right that would not make much sense so that's why you want to have this check here and that way if you get apple right you get um apple right here this part evaluates to zerbo and that therefore this part right here does not turn into apple and evaluate to prices of Apple which is two um and you get back two and then this turns into two right so that checks that if statement that we wrote that uh creates a check that stops that from happening if the item is in stock and after you add the price to the total subtract one from the item stock count now think about it if we're trying to compute the bill and our customer or let's say that uh you own a restaurant right and I come to your restaurant and your a restaurant has tremendously extravagant foods such as a banana apple orange and pear so let's say you sell me one of those things so you Go sir for your entree we have two bananas and for your appetizer whatever or your um dessert we have two oranges well after you compute the cost of the bill you wouldn't still have six bananas left you would now have four bananas left and you wouldn't have 32 oranges left you gave me two oranges so now you have 32 minus 2 so you have 30 oranges left so you have to take that into account so so in this case on line 22 when we increment the price we should also what's the opposite of increment decrement we should decrement the stock so we should decrement the quantity of that food in our stock dictionary does that make sense okay if it doesn't we work we we'll do it right now so what we're going to do is I'm going to say um that items value right what what are we decrementing we're decrementing the value of those items right so if we have banana we're going to decrement its value well to change the value we need to access it using the dictionaries key so here I'm going to use the dictionary stock and then I'm going to use the key item to access this six and I'm going to say Min equal 1 which is the same as saying is equal to stock of item minus one got it and let's just go through an example CU examples are awesome and something that professors and uh professors and teachers of such courses love not to give they're like theoretically understand all of this in your head but it's not as easy to understand it all in your head and I bet you that they didn't either they had trouble with it but for some reason they take pride in the theor the theoretic of all of this right the conceptualization of all of this so we should stay away from that work on tangible examples so you can get this okay so let me give you a basic tangible example here let's take that shopping list the same list right but I'm going to actually take that exact list so it's easy for you to to see what's going on I'm going to pretend like I'm calling the compute Bill function here I'm going to pass in that particular dictionary or I'm sorry the list banana orange Apple so let's go here that list is going to get passed to food now we come to total and what's going to happen is for item in food well food is just that list that we passed in and for item it's going to be banana the first time it's going to say if the stock of the banana right this is going to be replaced by banana this part is going to evaluate to what what is this part going to evaluate to it's really good to run through your code tangibly with actual examples so you can follow and see how the algorithm is actually working stock of banana is going to give you the value six right so dictionary stock key banana this is going to give you six is 6 greater than zero yes it is this part goes boom it evaluates to true we get to line 22 now our total is incremented by the price of that item so this turns into banana because remember We're looping through and item was banana so everywhere we see item it's now Banana right now on line 22 prices of banana evaluates to what four right if we look in our PR PR dictionary now total is incremented by four total is at four um stock of banana is decremented by one so what that effectively means is now in our stock we have 6 1 which is five five bananas left okay then the loop happens again this time it's orange right this time it's orange and it goes hey if stock of the item is greater than zero so our item is orange and stock of orange is actually 32 this statement is 32 is greater than zero this is true so what happens here this is incremented by the price of the item right so what's the price of an orange this part gets evaluated to the price of the orange which is 1.5 so now we have 5 .5 up here and this part also gets Orange right here this part is evaluated to um stock of orange again 32 32 minus um one so stock of items value should now be set to 31 so it goes all the way up to stocks and set this to 31 and uh it goes on one one more time but as you can see I'm not going to go through the code of what happens but you can effectively see that once it gets to Apple it realizes that the stock of that item which is Apple is zero this part gets evaluated to 0 is greater than zero this turns into false well I actually did end up going through the code and the lines 22 and 20 3 do not execute because if condition is false and ultimately also the for Loop goes back it goes back to the for Loop it realizes that was the last one so the for Loop ends it comes to the last line return total which in our case is 5.5 that's the answer we should get now we have ran through it in our head which is what we should always do but now what we're going to do is run through it in our reel.it and we're going to print out what it does oh I didn't Define what stocks and prices this so it's going to go crazy it's going to be like what are you talking about I have no idea you're a crazy person get away from me okay you saw we got 5.5 right that's what I had written down so yeah run through the algorithms in your head first and then once your head is exploding and you're like oh my muscles are being flexed of my brain that means that you're learning that means that you're actually improving that's the only time you're improving a lot of the times in conceptual things like programming when your brain muscles are stretching and they're kind of hurting and they you know it's almost like they're growing you're growing new muscles so that's it for stalking out hold on stock doesn't look quite right make sure the um call Bill make sure to not call compute Bill since it changes oh okay so I'm calling the function here and I should not be calling it okay so we are done a man we got some kind of achievement but I skipped it so hooray we got some achievement and if you're watching the video maybe you can pause it at that exact frame and see what the achievement was and let me know in the comments I have no idea what it was and I'm sad that I missed it okay we're almost done with the day at the supermarket let's check it out save and submit congratulations we have finished that course a day at the supermarket we have earned a new badge let's go back to the course page we're done with 42% of it that's really good news as you can see Rock papers and scissors and this this is really funny because somebody in the comments right fail bug um he's our very loyal fan fail buug asked what project I should work on and just instinctively with what we' have done I told him right at the top of my head work on rock paper scissors and that tells you how good of a teacher I am because that's exactly what they're asking you right Rock papers and scissors I don't like to brag but hey I'm gonna take credit when it's due so even you know these people with millions of users and all these professional curriculum developers even them they're like yep rock paper scissors is the next step so sure if you want to pay go ahead and click upgrade now and try it but what I would recommend honestly is you can start working on it in reel.it which is a really simple way to do it or you can download some kind of python installer which which I'll cover in videos once code academy series is over so you can do it right there and then you can paste it in the comments and I'll help you out if you get stuck okay so next part is a pretty big part where student becomes a teacher I'm going to keep that as its own separate video probably which is why you can see that unit 6 is an entity in itself this is going to be amazing part because you get to learn how classes work this is the part where things you can do some really powerful stuff I mean already with what you know you can do pretty much anything you can do a lot of powerful things already but after this section you learn even more powerful things okay this section will teach you I mean after this you can even make uh start making uh you know I'm not saying you can make the best graphics in the world that's a skill in its own but the logic behind games like Street Fighter and fighting games so you can use text based fighting for now um and you can create games where when somebody attacks other guy their health gets depleted or you can loot items and then it increments your level of gold in your inventory and you can buy things and when you buy things it decrements the amount of gold that you're currently carrying so there are a lot of things that you can start to do um even in um up up until what you did so far and especially when we get to unit 6 that's it for now a lot of talking from me I'm sorry about that um please subscribe to the channel it really helps out again we have broken past 100 subscribers which is great but our goal is to keep going up so we can help more people out in the community who are looking for programming help and generally just something fun that's not boring that you know you dread when you watch those programming videos so trying to spread the word like the video if you liked it if you need any help please comment below and I or somebody else who is really nice will help you out and thank you for watching I'll see you in code academy part 12 okay take care
