tools for developers that will advance you in your programming uh and freelance web developer carrier and will help you become so much more productive by using these tools so let's actually jump straight into uh today's presentation uh this is going to be a quick presentation on these five tools for those of you who are just joining we will be talking about five awesome tools uh for developers you are probably not using yet and actually what to get right now as you are watching this video to boost you in web development and make you so much more uh productive when you're working with clients and these are actually from experience uh mine and the team's experience so we uh we we really want just one to help you uh with these tools okay with that done um actually let's everybody drop in the comment section where you're coming in from and if you're excited about today's build uh only five awesome tools for developers which can help you become a better and a more efficient developer right so with that done let's jump straight into it awesome i see portugal france and bangladesh in the house nice guys everybody just drop in where you are calling him from okay uh let's actually get started with the first one i really hope i don't have to uh introduce you this guy uh this is we as code um probably you already know this one but we are here for uh tools that will help you so i'm going to show you a couple of awesome extensions you might need need to download and i will move my face a bit a little so that you can see it better so the first one is it's called es7 react redux graphql and react native snippets so this is a productivity tool uh which can give you the ability to create react redux graphql and react native snippets in just a uh with just a couple uh of bottom pressings so let's actually test it out how it uh looks so i've set up a vs code a test test.js file nothing fancy here uh i'm just going to show you how to get this thing uh going so uh inside of extensions you can just go ahead and type in es7 and the first one will be the uh the extension that you want to download under here you can already see that there are several um snippets that you can just go ahead and type in and will help you so for example if you uh want to import something uh you can go ahead and type in imn and you can just go ahead and import it all right let's actually see how it works in action so i can go ahead and type in rafce which will pop a an arrow function react uh component to my screen with a with an exporting uh feature right so but if i go ahead and type rfc that will give you a different kind of react function but notice that uh i could actually say that react uh ra so react arrow function component export you can literally say the words that are with uh that is that the abbreviation stands for and you will know what will be appearing on your screen right so super easy and super awesome tool to use and you can see that this is an arrow function so it gives you so much more productivity okay let's actually leave this and and go back and check out our next um extension okay next up live share you probably have seen a lot of times that uh when we are building something uh with sunny we are using something called the live share so liveshare literally gives me the ability to uh use sony's macbook and and write code on that one using mine right so i can go ahead and with this little button i can start a collaboration session and after signing in with either microsoft or github i can just share a link and i can go ahead and collaborate with anybody this is a super um good extension to use because you can go ahead and um you can go ahead and do pair programming right and pair programming is the most um the most advanced thing to do if you want to learn programming fast right all right let's actually see our next extension next one is going to be uh bracket pair colorizer looks like this uh you cannot miss it out actually and this is more like for um more like to help you when when you're debugging so if i go ahead and let's say i delete this uh bracket over uh this closing bracket over there uh and i can just do it like this it already starts freaking out uh down here uh i already see that there is one problem and it says right there that there is a curly brace which is missing right so normally i all these brackets would look like the same the color would be the exact same and i can just go ahead and start debugging by okay i know uh this is these two uh are yellow i have those uh this yellow i don't see the pair so i can just chuck it right in and the problem is already solved now this was a super easy example but if you're going with a big um with bigger project this will help you a lot trust me just go ahead uh type in bracket pair colorizer and this is the one that you want to download it will make your life so much more easier especially when you're debugging right all right um let's go and see what do we have what what's the next one this will be live server now live server is actually this button i hope you can see it down there nope because my head because my face is right there i will move it away so that little button that go live button and that will allow you um to do hot reloading when you're uh coding with a normal html file right so it's uh so normally with the html css and javascript file setup you don't have the hot reloading feature which actually react has but you can add this feature to your project with that little um extension okay okay i think my i think uh we have just dropped off okay uh we are back i see a lot of people are already watching it nice okay uh sorry for the uh connection issue we will wait a little bit for everybody to join back here um i'm sorry for the inconvenience so um there's another app for windows like screen brush yes there is uh you can just go ahead and uh and type in you can just go ahead and search up uh screen brush equivalent on the windows and it will literally give you a lot of uh a lot of options to choose from okay yes i will be sharing the terminal extension i am using it's a great question we will be talking about that because terminal is a very important tool okay let's jump back to our uh presentation so we were talking about uh git lens right so it's gets uh supercharged this is the one you want to download uh this gives you this ability in here uh in vs code it actually shows me that i've made some changes uh over there in tesla js file i can literally go ahead and compare it uh to other commits that i would have already made i actually can go ahead and show you how it looks like so i can type git add dot and and change something here maybe actually not like this i can add the span in here and this should uh update very quickly and very very soon so i will be able to show you and yeah there we go so it actually shows that since so my first commit which is basically initializing my file there was nothing but then this thing happened and i added this thing now i can go ahead and do another commit so get a dot and i think it should be showing now okay for some reason it's freaking out um let's actually go for our next uh next extension that i want to show you and i think this is going to be the last one yes uh so auto whoops uh wrong annotation tool auto close tag auto close tag will help you with html attacks and xml attacks right so you don't have to worry about all the headache uh of typing in the closing tag as well as the opening tag so i can uh zoom in a little so i can so as you can see there is a span tag in there and i don't know i could just type in hello clever programmers nice and if i want to go ahead and change up the html tag around it i can do it super easily so notice that uh even my other the closing tag is changing with the opening tag right let's actually see it again i will be underlining it uh so that you can see it better uh no it's moving away but i could like type strong in here not string and and it still changes and it also gives you the ability to just type in one uh tag and it will literally go ahead and close it for you super awesome uh tool to use and i could just recommend downloading it okay that's all for uh vs code uh extensions let's go for other uh not that much development related however very useful and very useful tools for you next up is figma figma is a completely free design tool that we uh clever programmer use and we teach how to use it you can go ahead and register on figma.com if you don't want to go if you don't want to download the application however it actually has an application and i can just go ahead and literally uh change like uh change the text up here epic store locator and that will give me the ability to see my whole web app or in one piece uh it also gives you the ability uh to modify and and literally like add so much stuff and and just design the whole web page as you please and you can also go ahead and copy and paste these uh details into your css file all right um let's go ahead and let's see what our next tool is oh my zsh now you could ask what is this but i actually remember there was a comment before asking what is the terminal extension or the terminal tool that i'm using so i'm rocking with the basic prebuilt terminal of my macbook but i am using all my zsh and you can go ahead and download it from the ohmyz dot sh uh website with a single croco and notice that uh it has plugins for node.js uh even spotify uses it uh and and and it's very widely used uh it has a large community behind it um and it actually gives you the ability to see everything at a glance so i'm in my whatsapp backend project i can see that there is a get version control initialized and i am currently on the master branch right and it also shows you that app.js is an actual file however this is a folder as well as node modules right so these are actually just a couple of things plus it actually looks cool and if you're uh coding in a cafe everyone will be like whoa that's such and such an awesome tool everyone will be like oh are you a hacker or something so you can literally go ahead and use it um it will make using terminal so much easier so i can just highly recommend going ahead and downloading it and later on you can deep dive into how to use it all right next up guys who knows what is this drop it in the comments who knows what what's what what can be seen on the screen right drop it in the comments um we actually used it uh in a couple of our builds on here in youtube uh i just want yeah material ui that is right so we are oh yeah this is not the one i wanted to highlight uh yeah material ui uh great answer that's the one uh over here makes frontend and full stack development so much easier by literally giving you full react components uh and you can just go ahead and worstcase scenario uh you can just put them into a different component and then import it uh into your project if you don't don't uh if you're not able to make it work because these um these codes are written in react js and you can actually go ahead and try out these uh buttons and gives you everything that you will need throughout your development okay um let's go back and the last two that i highly recommend you using what do you think that is this is you can go ahead drop it in the comment section this is more like a project management tool i help you with that much but just go ahead drop it in the comments if you know what this tool is so this is actually it no it's not resolved um okay we're back live i think once again yeah okay uh i had another uh connection issue okay so this is asana this is one of the most advanced um project management tool ever and you can act when you are working with a client you can go ahead and uh invite them into the workspace that you're in so i could just go ahead and uh i don't know uh ask qazi uh if qazi was my client i could literally invite him into this project and he would be able to see how am i doing with my project so i could literally add um subtasks and all those kind of stuff and it actually and i could do this it moves everything nice and smoothly you can add deadlines you can add literally go ahead and add priority i personally am using asana with my uh clients and we actually do use it inside of team cp and yes asana is free however there is uh there are paid options for asana but the free version will be completely enough for you when you're working with clients right okay yes it is like trello um and yeah let's actually carry on and wow guys if you actually um found this video valuable uh let's go ahead and smash the like button like literally go ahead and and press it and like destroy it so we can get this video out to everybody and we can help 5 000 people to get a job as a developer in uh 2020 right let's show that 2020 is actually a good year okay
