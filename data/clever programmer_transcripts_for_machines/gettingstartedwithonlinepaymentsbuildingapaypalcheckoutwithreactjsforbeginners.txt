everybody how are you guys doing what's up let's start dropping it in the comment section how is everybody doing where are you guys coming in from how are you doing on this beautiful day okay let's see what we got here what's up finn how you doing all right okay we got excellent connection that is amazing yo what's up croatia how you doing pakistan in the house that's amazing hello hello what's up kevin from dc can you increase the volume a little bit of course i can how about this now i think what's up england the sound is low okay how about what's up albania how you doing peru how is everybody doing guys uh can you please confirm that my mic is not now good whoa what's up sweeter switzerland chicago what's up all right hey canada what's good all right that's amazing so today what we are going to be what's up sweden today what we are going to be building is a super simple very short something uh this is basically just a paypal checkout uh some of those you know the buttons let me show you let me show you actually uh where are those buttons all right here we go alrighty oh my goodness all right so as you can see this is the project that we are going to be building and actually next week we are going to be building on top of this one because you guys are requesting so many stuff so just like all the other times the link is down below in the description drop down in the airtable link whatever you want me to build next for you on this youtube channel so this is something that you guys asked for and this is the paypal checkout introducing so and next week we are actually going to be building a full grocery store online as one of you guys requested it so we are actually delivering on that all right amazing and welcome you guys how is it going south korea in the house uh yo india angola what's up guys how is it going all right so we have 120 people live right now that is amazing so uh we are going to get started in just a second okay hey what's up nick hill how are you doing yes that looks it's just a check out all right so by the way guys get ready because we have some big big builds coming up next uh one of them tomorrow nas and i are going to go live on here on youtube and we are going to what's up unity dev of course i can say your name uh so we are going to be delivering big projects these are not actually going to be like we are actually going to be delivering projects in multiple parts because they are so big and so heavy so yeah let's get into it all right uh fubu mtb says the air table doesn't work let me check that that would be bonkers that would that would be a problem uh okay let me see let me see for me it does work i mean it seems like it it works yes it does work it is only one question uh nope this is not firebase this is literally a few lines of code guys this is the simple easiest way that you can get started and checking out people and charging people's card the reason i actually built this one is that many of you asked what's the easiest way to get started with an ecommerce app and one of them being is being okay with importing multiple stuff into your application stacking them on top of that and then doing something amazing now payment is actually something that that is a very big deal in the customer's eye you know they want to uh they want to have their money in a safe place right so you don't want to just put out your credit card number wherever so that way um that way you i always want to use some sort of thirdparty something uh some of them some stores usually use stripe uh some people actually uh are you are your sign in the works nope it does it does no what guys this does work what are you say hey it does work let me show you let me show you all right so new tab pasting the link from the description all right let's see let's see no it does open guys this is it this is how it should look like see like this is the simplest form that you will ever see whatever you want just pop it in there like say yo yo david i want to build an ecommerce store submit that's it that's all hey colombia latin america latin america that's that was all my spanish all right anyways let's get started with today's build uh john that's amazing all right so guys it is in a public mode guys this should be working this is the simplest one question form you will ever see in your life so yeah all right so this is the simplest paypal app that you will ever see this is nothing crazy you can literally pay with your uh credit card and it will just pop you onto a new website you will just go ahead fill in whatever details you might have and then just go back and then and that's it like once you hit continue it actually it doesn't charge anything because it's uh in in sandbox mode you can see it up here uh but once you change the credentials to live mode it will actually start charging people so that's why i'm saying that this is super simple so let's get started let's start building this and by the way guys if you're interested in this and if you're enjoying these lives and if you think you will get value out of it make sure to go ahead smash that like button down below for that youtube algorithm because it actually helps you become a better developer okay might not but 5 am in south korea but i wait for the class sleep doesn't matter that's what's up that's what i'm talking about all right so with that said uh i'm just gonna go ahead and go back in here i'll have it this open on this side close this window because i don't need this and guys by the way start dropping questions down below in the comments because the uh i'm gonna be answering a few of those while the create react app script is running so let's get to let's go ahead and i'm just gonna go ahead and type in uh npx create react app space dot and let's wait a little so guys right now it is your chance to get your question answered make sure to drop it in the comment section down below i wanna see all of them what's up how are you guys doing at work but couldn't miss it okay so let's wait a little for that react app to create itself what's up when is the next build it is going to be tomorrow okay volume is too too low once again what dude come on should be good now you know what i just put this up a little like a proper full fledge build yes we are actually going to be delivering big projects like big big project like and we are going to be delivering them in multiple parts just so you guys can understand it better and have uh more time to pro process it okay we'll go through the basic uh this is the bay most basic checkout you will ever see paypal has made it super super easy uh to implement their checkout and by the way guys if you've done the amazon clone you can pretty much go ahead and put it in there okay um do you think mirn is the best thing to learn if i want to become a full stack developer um i would say if you want to be a full stack web developer yes mirn is a pretty solid choice volume is too high now guys come on okay it's clipping now geez okay how about how about now it shouldn't be clipping now everything stays in the i mean it's yeah it's it shouldn't be clipping yeah uh so yes mirn is a pretty solid choice just because of the fact that it is super popular plus mongodb is a great choice anyways what's up greece anastasios from greece uh so yeah and and marine is a pretty solid choice because it uses react mongodb node.js express.js so 100 i can just um approve that so go for it but stick with it and also learn firebase on the side because it just uh helps you a ton with time management and all that stuff okay sound is better what is the best programming language for the backend development uh i would option one say node.js option b say python but kazi would say option one python so yes uh and am i using an m1 mac not yet but it's actually in the process uh is it like instacart honestly i don't know instacart um from the name i just don't trust them with my money so yeah why not my sequel instead of mongodb in mir i mean you can go with my sequel as well i just prefer the nosql world okay all right with that said let's jump straight into it let's build that uh paypal because my react app is now up and running so with that said i'm just gonna open up a vs code on the wrong screen and move this terminal away we're not going to need it anymore i mean actually yes we do so uh guys let me open up a quick virtualization of this react app so i'm just going to say yarn start and hopefully it will open up on this side of the window and we are actually going to be getting started right now so make sure you have your react app open and ready and you are ready to build this with me right now so guys actually just just so you know to get the biggest roi of this training is highly highly advised that you go ahead and uh build this with me and code along okay so and it might not make sense at the very first time but make sure to watch it once again and by the way it is amazing to see that we almost have 150 people live that's super amazing i'm super thankful for that and with that said let's get started what's up ronnie how's it going all right so going back to my vs code i'm just going to zoom in a little so you guys can see it better what's uh what i'm doing and maybe even do this so there's a little more space for that and i'm just going to get started with my uh usual um cleanup process i think so basically everything from app.css goes away i'm not going to have any kind of test files so app.test.js is actually now gone which takes quite some time for some reason uh logo svg can go as well setup test.js can go as well we are not going to use any of those index.css i'm just going to on the top add a star basically tag all those uh basically tag everything inside of the index.js file and add a margin of zero onto it so basically everything is going to be stretched out all the way till the very side of the screen now going into app.js uh inside of header everything is going away uh this is just the basic react app that we had before and right now we should see this clean white nothing if it makes sense all right so with that said let's take a look at how can we have all these buttons over here so for that we're just gonna go ahead and google a little bit so we will be going ahead and search up google not google jesus paypal check out api okay super simple super easy okay and you just kind of want to go to some sort of developer.paypal.com and and then basically just let's see what they have uh does this use react paypal gs no it doesn't uh i'm not using any sort of thirdparty uh npm package in this one i'm just using plain react and all that okay all right let's take a look at what we have here so we have this get started uh i just want to go into the paypal developer and log in to my dashboard now guys because i already have a paypal account i can just quickly log in if you do not have one make sure to right now is the time for you to sign up for paypal this is a free service by the way it's made by elon musk so if he tweets about it and you have some sort of shares in paypal it will just go stonks and so yeah how can i undo the styled component uh if you've installed the node module you can basically go into package.json remove that line and then uh delete all the node modules and then just do a npm install or yarn install now wha i hope you guys are now ready and inside of paypal developer dashboard so now what i'm going to do is just click this uh just click this create app it's basically you can just add a new application into it this will go ahead and generate you some sort of keys and all that kind of stuff so i'm just gonna name it uh i don't know check out live training looks good uh you wanna select merchant and whatever sort of sandbox business account that you have is going to be good so you don't have to worry about any of those if you don't have it just make sure to create one and you will be good to go all right so let's go ahead and create the app it will spin around for a little jesus sorry the page you are looking for is not found okay guys i'll make sure uh i have a new air table or some sort of form after the live so stick around for like five to ten minutes i will create a new form maybe in google forms or something more uh reliable and you guys can just drop whatever you have there okay what's up hamza okay all right so guys this is basically like once you create the application this is uh what you will see uh this is pretty much just a sandbox account like uh yeah you will have the sandbox account here the email address you always want to go with sandbox because that way will not actually charge your cards now you want to save this client id and then you want to go ahead and have the client secret somewhere secret so with that said what we are going to be doing now is go once again once again go into paypal check out api we're just going to go ahead and search it up on google and what you want now to have is i think this one the payments api so that's basically what we are going to be using and by the way if you are not okay with googling stuff on uh when you are working as a developer that's a problem you always should be uh going ahead and checking out whatever is available online okay so all right let's see what we have here and what do we got what do we got okay so this is basically standard payments what's up daniel thank you where so much i highly highly appreciate this super chat you're an amazing person and we really appreciate uh that you're here and dropping these donations uh yes it actually can be this simple the reason i am doing this live and showing you guys that this is this simple and anybody can do it and you can pretty much just build this thing and put it into your ecommerce app probably there is a little bit more of an authorization of all that kind of stuff but everything is written down here and if you follow it just like we will do it today then you can go ahead and build yourself an ecommerce app and yes i am using a mac all right so once you're here on the standard payments with single page applications that's the one that you're actually looking for then you can pretty much go ahead and have all these things imported now because paypal uses cdn uh we will be going ahead and importing it this way okay so when i go ahead and grab this first one okay so uh there is actually two way that you can go ahead and check out somebody on your store one is if you render the button immediately and the other one is if you have it as if it uh the render like after the user user takes action or the page changes okay how long does this course take it's going to be less than an hour uh we are probably going to be wrapping it up in half an hour or something like that all right it's super simple that's the reason all right so uh first so you want to go ahead and grab this line of code uh and then just go ahead and oh my god i misclicked so once you have that cdn code this one here you want to go into public folder index.html and then just somewhere in between those metas you want to drop that okay so once you have that you see that your sandbox client id is actually missing okay this thing you will need to replace it with your stuff that you just like the application that you just registered so let's go back in here and this is the thing that you want to go ahead and copy copy there okay that's what i want to do what's up mark yeah i like turtles i like turtles too amazing thank you so much really appreciate it what's up morocco what are what am i making uh i'm showing you guys once a heck once again this is the application that i'm making it's a super simple way that you can go ahead and build a paypal checkout and you can just pretty much use whichever link and it is functional um so you can just yeah i i could i could sign in with my own paypal and then use that to pay the amount but instead uh i can even go ahead and pay with debit or credit card and the good thing it is not embedded in your site which actually creates trust between you and your client okay all right and once i'm done with that i just fill everything out hit continue and that's it so that's what we are building today now uh you want to grab this client id over here and then replace this boom just like that and once you're done with that you're pretty much cool with the index.html file you don't need to worry about that uh at all and i hope the zoom is good actually let me let me zoom in a little more so basically that is this is the reason why we are not actually going to be importing any sort of party npm package because we get it done with the cdn all right going back to the documentation if you actually start scrolling down the first one is going to be a react now you can pretty much go ahead and grab all of these things now you might be thinking that you don't need to import react from react yes you do because the paypal button down here is actually directly going to be using that all right so once you have this three lines of code bank then you're pretty much good to go for uh for this okay so far rook says there is some sort of lag which is not good okay let me see let me see okay let's let's see what's up and how is the stream doing all right we should be good shouldn't be shouldn't be messing up let me actually pause this i am some synchronization going on in the background but okay now we should be good to go and all right now we should be good to go let me see how is it uh doing okay uh guys once again i will take care of the form don't worry about that hey thank you so much daniel uh all right okay we should be good let's see let's see how how is the stream doing um okay there should be no more lag anymore uh we are actually live and even youtube says that the stream is good and all right okay i don't have a paypal account uh i'm from pakistan i don't have paypal account um can you actually register if it's not available in your region that is completely okay we actually have a few different options i'm not going to cover those today but i am actually going to uh go over all of them in for in future videos so we have strive we have square and we have paypal this is the three of the uh of those checkout services that i actually trust with my money and i would actually trust uh as a customer so we all we are gonna go ahead and use all of that okay all right going back which one do i use i'll i go uh actually yesterday i published a video uh with my vs code extensions and it's there so make sure to check it out yeah all right so next up what we are going to be doing is you see that all of these is uh all of these are wrote in classbased components now on this channel we pretty much just work with functional components so we are not going to worry about that at all but uh we can go ahead and grab this piece which is actually going to be the paypal button okay so if we put it in here uh it might go ahead and freak out right now because uh we just don't have a lot of things defined just yet but let's remove this and by the way this is actually a super valuable skill that you can uh turn a classbased component into a functional one so this is something that companies are paying for a ton so you can just put it on your resume basically you just go ahead and delete the um this words all right which is awesome and now what we are going to be doing is uh you see that we have this create order and create an unapproved uh files okay um what do you what do i think about patreon clone we can do that drop it in the air table down below so we have these two functions which are at this moment not defined at all but we are just going to go ahead and uh step by step copy paste them and turn them into functionals okay so we have the on approve and that looks almost good but since this is once again classbased components we have to transform them into functional ones so we're just gonna type in const right before them and we have this equal sign over here and the arrow right there so guys again let me see so guys once again uh what we are doing here is step number one creating a paypal application and step number two transforming the classbased components into functional ones so you have more things that you can put on your portfolio all right let me see all the chat what's going on and the live stream health looks good all right amazing and next up okay i see university classes are preventing you from doing these awesome projects don't worry about that this video will stay on this channel forever you can come back and watch it later what do i think pop on the website come please uh i don't know about that okay and next up we have the create order function over here which is yeah i can just go ahead and paste that here as well and again this is going to freak out because this is class based once again not an arrow function and now we uh syntactically we are good okay so at this point in time we should have a functional working uh functional working something however this is still freaking out because paypal is not defined which is on the line five okay so this is the thing that it is freaking out about uh let me see and the reason is that we are trying to use a let me show let me let me explain what's happening here so we are trying to use a package that is not being imported on this screen on the component right so when we say import paypal from paypal or react from react or something like that or like i don't know button from material ui that means that we actually installed that certain package to the whole application and we are importing it to the component however because we are right now importing it as a cdn so inside of the index.html file that means we will need to add in one more word which is called window so that way it is not going to worry about uh how the so it is not going to worry about uh the what do you say uh component instead it is going to wait until everything is going to be rendered and then use the cdn that imported it all right so let's take a look at how we do that and what we would just say instead of freaking out is just say window space dot and yes i can make a youtube chrome and guys this is pretty much it like we legit have a paypal checkout right now this was this fast and it is right now functional so let's first actually make it look good not this ugly thing so for that what we are going to do is add in a like change it to the bomb naming convention and add a wrapper oh dang i made a typo go down here close the other one and what i what i went ahead and what i did by the way over here is that i have the application uh with the background color of gray and the wrapper uh with uh some sort of light grayish color so basically that's literally what i'm gonna do so i will have app which is going to have a width of a 100 view height uh height jesus 100 view width like that height of 100 view height add a background color of gray and a display of grid now once this is done oh also we actually want to add a place items center so right now everything is centered what's up indonesia how's it going and yes i can make a youtube clone from react.js uh actually drop me a text uh where's my overlays window hold on hold on a sec guys go ahead uh drop a message to me uh what you want me to build next if the air table is not working for you i just dropped my instagram handle on the screen um and yeah with that said let's continue all right and right now uh i'm just gonna add a little bit of style to the wrapper as well so that will have a background color of light gray just like that add a padding of 100 pixels and a border radius of 10 pixels and we pretty much have this nice look so let's go ahead test it out so i'm first going to go ahead and click paypal and see what's happening and by the way i'm just gonna open this up open oops hold on i'm just gonna open up the console down here so i see what's going on what's up germany and right now as you can see i'm logged into paypal so that's amazing and where i can log into paypal so that's amazing and i can go ahead and pay with my debit card or something now this is an important part so uh so you see the paypal guest checkout is on and everything is working perfectly now i want to show you guys a few different things that how you can charge the person a certain amount that you want to go ahead and charge them so basically if you were to implement this to a random oh my god so if you were to implement this specific checkout to your um to your ecommerce application i'm not doing microsoft stuff i'm sorry about that okay maybe i maybe i'll do it so what i will do here is i can like pretty much you can replace this 0.01 yes it is actually going to be available after i i'm going away so the value you can replace it with whatever number you want and that is the amount of cash that you will be charging the person at you can also go down here and explore what uh what else um what else um like what what are the currencies you want to go ahead and charge other people and you can also fill out their form ahead so once you are in this place uh you can pretty much just prefill all the data see you can pretty much prefill all the data in there and so that way they will only have to just uh fill in their credit card numbers and they will be good to go okay now i'm gonna once again uh just so you guys see that what is happening here and yes i will make a stripe checkout clone just like this one uh just for the sake that you can go ahead and pretty much just copy this and then put it in your project we will actually cover all those uh checkout uh platforms uh so you can pretty much go ahead and just console log the data that you will get back okay and on approve okay so unapprove we will see what sort of data are we getting back okay so let's let's test it out again so if i if i were to just go ahead and go with the debit and credit card option the last one i can do this so paypal guest checkout that's cool united states card number uh what i like to use is 40 to 40 like a lot of 42's and something's up oh okay jeez and then just uh all these sorts of numbers i can add in my name yeah street address i don't know 1180 mathers avenue that's good by the way this is a completely fictional address so don't even try to visit me there what's up everybody yes shipping that are the same and then i can just add in some sort of email address that's good don't call me that's not my number and if i go ahead and hit continue it will go ahead load up a little bit and it is actually going to seek seed let's wait for it just for a little let's see so it is right now communicating with the paypal servers and basically just testing out the whole checkout uh functionality and all those data that i put in and right now it's loading so we should be good to go very very soon so guys once again the reason i came live today with this such a small build and such a small uh okay what's up the reason i actually did this live uh with such a short uh in such a short time is that you can pretty much go ahead and uh do the exact same thing okay so again i'm just adding in my number and that's pretty much it guys like literally you can go ahead and build this whole thing in such a short time and then just focus on the user experience on your store so once again this is your chance to ask me any kind of questions that you might have in the chat right now new playlist of all your clone videos in react.js in this channel i want to save this in a playlist okay i can do that okay okay this is going to california yep continue let's see how it's going right now so that was it that was the build for today and we should be good to go so guys drop me any kind of questions that you might have uh yes i will continue these live videos i have a it's a good way to go with react front end and eshop i mean mostly because of the seo i would actually go ahead and learn gatsby that has builtin seo and yeah so gatsby has a builtin seo and is actually for the user it's much uh faster because it uses serverside rendering okay so which one do i use what do you mean oh you mean uh are you i use xcode 12 theme in vs code it's one o'clock all right so with that said guys um that was it for today we built a super simple paypal checkout you can pretty much go ahead and do the exact same thing just follow along the documentation how do you dynamically set the price okay i'm gonna go ahead and uh show you how can you dynamically set the price so uh we are not going to worry about too much the styling but let's say i have an input here and this is going to be a number and we will say on change we will have an unchange over here and now we'll fire off an even it's just like how you would normally set a variable okay uh so and what you want is you want to have a ustate on here up here boom like that and was just say price and the initial state is going to be zero dollars and you want to select this and then remove this and say price this is going to be price i should learn how to type all right and the value of this one is going to be price once again and we will have a set price which is going to be e dot target oh boy which is going to e the target value just like that so right now let's refresh this oh boy there's some sort of typo happening here okay let's remove that all right so once again this is uh for nicos this is how you this is how we set uh the price dynamically once again i'm gonna quickly go over what i've just done in the code so again um i've created a use state over here uh called price and i have the set price the initial value is going to be zero obviously and you want to add an input field or something that you will determine the price based on so if you have an ecommerce store based on how many items are there in the cart the those prices combined are going to be setting the price but in this case because it's a simple build we are just going to be adding it in so input number and we are going to be setting the uh price based on what we type in here so if it's going to be a hundred actually yeah 100 and i'm i were to go ahead and hit debit credit hold on let me let me refresh oh boy yes 100 let me see might have messed up something over here with those numbers oh my god okay i know okay okay it's going to be the uh format so because that remember it was uh waiting for a text i think let's see so if i hit this nope should be value price no value what do you mean oh my god what a dumb mistake come on [Laughter] thanks martin okay massive shout out to martin for spotting that okay let's try that again type in a hundred hit paypal come on yes and i just go ahead pay with the bid or credit card guys once again massive shout out for martin for uh saving the day from this dumb mistake anyways everybody makes mistakes that's that's what we learned here and yeah that's good can't even write my own name avenue california yeah continue and we should be good to go oh yeah yeah whatever you you just fill in the email and you will be good to go so that was that's literally how you uh add in dynamically new file uh new items so guys make sure to be subscribed to the channel because next week i am going to build a full grocery store app as you guys requested it just like today's video um so make sure to stick around on this channel make sure to hit that subscribe button make sure to like this video if you enjoyed watching it and yeah next week we are actually going to be taking this thing and putting it into a full working project which is going to be amazing and yes yeah simon says uh i heard that server side rendering may be helpful in seo yes that is a 100 uh right by the way let me know if you are interested in gatsby content or something like that please show me how to get react what do you mean how to get react what can i do if paypal is banned in my country so at that point what you can do is either go with stripe or square or look up some sort of payment authorization or checkout method and then option a you can figure it out yourself or you can uh drop it in the air table down below and then i'll go ahead and build something with it i'll just put together a tutorial for that purpose and yeah that's it all right thank you so much guys for sticking here on this uh what do you think about flutter i don't think too much about that i've haven't used that at all i would be interested in gets b okay we will deliver against b content then all right interested in the merge okay so basically server side rendering and mourn content yeah stripe square yes we will okay yeah yeah exactly uh try something else and if it if if everything is banned you can still go with the uh normal just type in your whatever credit card you have and then just work with that uh way yes mern okay all right guys make sure to subscribe to the channel make sure to hit that like button and click that notification bell so we are have a ton of big projects coming up which are going to be take taking longer than just one session um once again the grocery store app and we have others coming up so uh it's necessary to learn typescript not at all and yeah so with that said thank you so much for joining this session and make sure once again yeah walmart clone that's good that's good okay all right drop a few more stuff drop a few more stuff i'll stay here for just a little target clone okay okay you guys have amazing ideas will we touch serverless uh firebase is actually serverless so yeah but we can definitely go deeper in that too things were tutorial burn for becoming a marine select developer where should you start you should start uh by just watching this channel we pretty much have a ton of content on burn already and we will have a ton more all right guys that was it for today's video thank you so much for sticking around i hope you guys enjoyed it and you have a working paypal right now which you can pretty much uh throw into any kind of project that you have and at the end of the day what you want to do is stack up a ton of knowledge and then just put them together a mesh up something and do some amazing things with it so with that said thank you so much for joining this session make sure to uh smash that like button down down below
