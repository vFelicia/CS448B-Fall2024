see here from clever programmer calm I know free code camp is absolutely amazing so I had to just decide it to come on here jump on it and just run through it a little bit and based on your guys's feedback maybe we'll continue this series if there is no feedback we won't just as simple as that so let's just jump into it okay this is going over some HTML stuff what is HTML HTML is what lets you see everything that you see on the Internet so the text over here on this side that I'm highlighting is written in HTML on the right hand side it's showing an example of how HTML works and let me just show you so for example you see this hello is wrapped in something called tags and specifically these are actually h1 tags it also stands for header 1 tags now if I remove these tags it'll turn into regular text that you're used to seeing and it's gonna be written very small here on the cell phone very very small but now let's wrap this bad boy in an h1 tag and you'll see that it becomes big now what if I took this thing and did header 6 okay that's header 6 tag and you see it's pretty small so header 6 is the smallest header size and header 1 is the biggest header size okay generally when I'm using header sizes I'll go with header 2 very few times I'll actually use header 1 a lot of times it helps me when I'm writing my blog posts you know I'll put something in header 2 and I'll say something like what programming language should I learn first which is one of my videos if you haven't watched it go watch it because awesome and then right underneath it I'll open a paragraph tag and I'll be like a world what is uh you know and here I'll just kind of write my paragraph so these are also called paragraph tags and when you're writing paragraphs you should put it within these tags that's kind of nice now what's cool about these tags is that you can even have the stuff like this and be writing here but as you can see on the right hand side it all looks like it's kind of on as if you were almost writing it all on one line so you might as well just put the here in this location but because it's wrapped up in P tags it really doesn't matter where it is because this P tag the closing P tag knows if it's location and puts it right there which is kind of nice if you ask me because then stuff can't get messed up really easily you know like you'll take something from word document try to copy paste it somewhere else and you know all that highlighting and all that beautiful stuff that you did gets all screwed up well that does not happen here because it's written in code and when you copy paste this code pretty much anywhere else where this code gets accepted it all works just fine now let me show you an example of HTML where actually you can have it on your own computer and write your own file or actually it'll fire up in the browser and look really sexy for you and it will look super nice and you can actually go ahead play around with it and add some more features and functionality to it so for example let's go and open up some regular text editor okay I have sublime text you don't need sublime text but if you want get sublime text that's cool you know and all the developers and all the cool guys and cool girls use it so I'm gonna just write hello world in here okay and I'm gonna close it with h1 tags I'm gonna save it as hello dot HTML and let's call it CP for a clever programmer and remember to save it as a dot HTML file and I'm actually going to save it um I don't know let's save it in the desktop I have a lot of stuff in the desktop but let's just save it there so here I saved it and it understands its HTML which is why it highlighted the h1 so gorgeously and let's just go over here open a new tab and we're are going to go to desktop hello underscore CPI HTML and you can actually see that file right there right that's pretty cool but what is even cooler than that well let me show you so let me actually put this on the right side of the screen let me put this HTML file on the left side of the screen and let me add thanks to this so let's say I say what is up you know something like that close the P tags save the file go over here refresh and that stuff is there now let's say I want to take an image and add it so let's look up I don't know coding no no not coding for entrepreneurs coding just that's it so I'm gonna look that up and I'm gonna go to images and let's take whatever image we find so let's say we find this image right pretty cool image and we are going to copy the link of that image okay here's the link to that image and then what we're going to do is we're actually going to embed this image well or or make a link of this image and that's pretty easy to do we do H H ref put it in here and then we just close that tag okay close that tag but in between this tag we can put something interesting we can say click here for coding image okay something like that we'll save we'll go back to our website we'll hit refresh and you see the link is here now when you click that link it actually takes you to this coding image how cool is that pretty pretty cool I think so that's how you add you know your your HTML tags or whatever okay and in the next video I'll show you guys some other stuff let me know what you guys think of this video you guys like my face not being in it if you like this more go ahead and give it a little thumbs up so I hide my face more and I give you guys just some juicy juicy information alright let me know what you guys think of this format I just need some feedback and I'll be sure to add some more of this goodness take care I love you guys else and I'll see you in the next
