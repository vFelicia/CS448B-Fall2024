what's up guys this is Kazi here from clever programmer comm today we're doing something very very fascinating first of all we're gonna be talking about the top 5 worst programming languages in 2020 so that's gonna be really exciting when we're talking about all kinds of crazy programming languages from brain fog to whitespace to wall code to Trump scripts to whatever else and we're doing something really fascinating which is that we are in a podcast studio and we have a team of four people today Before we jump right into it I do want to mention that we have a threepart master class if you just put in your email we send it to you right away it's absolutely free it's filled with a lot of value and you're gonna learn a lot about programming so you can go from zero to knowing how to become a sixfigure developer or a freelancer it lays out the path for you so please put in your email for that it's it's gonna be in the description below as well or you can just go to clever programmer comm and sign up for free with that said let's jump right into this podcast so you guys probably know Aaron we got Frankie in the house yo and we go knows hello hello how's it going everybody dumansky yes nas is a special guest here from Detroit Michigan he's a developer he's a django developer he's a badass freelancer and so we're gonna be learning a lot of things and we shouldn't be kicking back relaxing and having a lot of fun so welcome thank you thank you for having me I appreciate it this is awesome a young cat 224 what's up successful freelance for 24 huh well yeah still learning a lot still learning a lot so nas talk to me how you got into freelancing a little bit you know just so people can get a little bit of context like just talk about how you got into freelancing yeah and of what you've accomplished so far with it just a little bit of a recap so people know yeah so something I've been developing for about seven years now right so started back in high school that kind of worked the work that startups work the corporations and for the past for the past like you know two years I've worked at a startup called kind of service calm and yeah and and seven months ago like I decided to quit I decided to quit because I want to try something else and with the chest something different and I wasn't really really excited about where where I was going so and all of a sudden I was like you know what this is something I need to try this is something need to do as I just decided to quit and there we go here we are right now for the past seven months it has been an interesting journey had to learn a lot of things and it was definitely difficult and it still it still really is difficult but but you know it's amazing to have the freedom that you get from something like this and to learn so much because now not only you are as are you a developer but you are kind of a businessperson right your sales guy your your manager right you're thinking about so many different things and itself that that is the interesting part too right yeah you got to do a little bit of everything and especially when you're doing because you said you started working in startups yeah you kind of got to do a little bit of everything in a startup you're wearing lots of different hats I mean just like ask these guys you know Frankie and Aaron I mean how many hats do you guys have to wear working in a working in a startup he wears a lot you get to touch a lot of different um a lot of different topics really like I started off as a video editor and stuff now we do a bunch of I don't know philia marketing things and we all kind of get to know what each other is doing so you know you kind of jump into other fields and stuff and it's cool because you kind of get to know what else you're made of you know not just like like what I see in nas is like this guy's like super into development but I also see him just ease when like I see a lot of developers and a lot of times these guys I don't wanna you know generalize but a lot of times developers are a little bit more lowenergy asked to say and there have a little bit of trouble expressing themselves and I see Naz talking about something like SEO which is not even like completely related to development or at all but he's just [ __ ] passion kinase where you passionate and stuff and it's it's contagious you know and it's a [ __ ] swear on this podcast okay yeah but those qualities I feel are great for like freelancing and stuff and those qualities are also great for small companies you know yeah I think well communication I think one of the things you mentioned communication being able to communicate properly is one of the biggest qualities in itself and a developer how can anybody else right especially as a developer a communication quality being able to communicate between the developers the business people right right that is a very big quality that a lot is underrated right but with it with it you can go very far so far right like communication is very important the octa MIMO communication well I probably the worst communication yeah I communicate about it I mean it's important you have to be on a team like that this is actually the first real like legit team I've been on besides like you know soccer teams and stupid school projects that don't really count like I never actually had that you got a communicating little blow with everybody but even with like communicating with like other people like you guys how many hats you go where I think we all wear every hat like at some point yeah we're all learning everything yeah some of us are better than others but yeah communication is so important like that's why I got on the team in the first place I found you guys just communication right it's important yeah like when it comes to for example for developers to land a job you can't take me you gotta reach out that's one communication and you gotta be able to actually land the contract and then keep the client that requires communication and most people either they can't get a client lack of communication in that place and then they can't keep a client a lot of the times and most of the time that happens because they've either lost the trust or didn't follow up or whatever the case may be yeah and also this is how deals happen we were watching this crazy ass show of recently men who built America [ __ ] awesome show amazing it's such an amazing show and in they're talking about Vanderbilt and Rockefeller who built you know according to today it would he would be worth what two hundred twenty five billion dollars at the time this guy communicated with Vanderbilt and he wasn't scared and he could withstand the pressure and he was in that moment he made the deal this happens a lot of times with developers way where they're afraid to negotiate for what they want yeah they are afraid to withstand the pressure they could be working for a company for like ten twenty years but they're they're pretty afraid to go up to their boss and be like hey can I make like ten dollars more man per hour it's actually it's great thing you mentioned that right because you know being able to kind of stand up for yourself and to communicate that so you know I've worked with different people and and there's a difference between you can have a developer who was just as good as another developer right but if that one developer is able to go out there and is not afraid to kind of put himself out there and you know go to the CEO and ask for my money for example right he will actually be he will actually be able to go much further and someone who's just kind of scared and it's still at the same level like you know still the same level knowledge wise and experience wise the guy who was able to ask and to demand right will be able to go much further much further yeah okay with that let's get into the languages okay so let's let's start with this so this but this was a lot of good stuff that we're talking about we continue to talk about this type of fascinating stuff but let's give people what they really came for all right so top five worst programming languages number five drum bro which one is it you said we're starting with Lou alright that's pretty good yeah I don't even know what it is alright so I just heard it was bet yeah it's a bad language man it's it's a high level programming language mmhmm right Lua is a powerful and fast programming language that is easy to learn use and embed in your application all right good marketing yeah design in 1993 as a language for extending software applications to me demand of customization at the time oh they got cuz they had customizations at the time there that's possible dang focus of approving speed and probability and accessibility the only time I've actually heard about Lua is the only experience I have had with it is running a video game server I don't know if people know this game but it's a really popular game in Europe it's called tibia it's a mmm mmm Oh RPG and these guys are it's like a 2d universe or world or whatever and it's funny because I mean just graphically it's not that hard to recreate the game or whatever but the way that you would change like the values of like items like let's say armor is 15 or 14 or whatever and I hope I'm not like geeking out too much but like you can not everybody who's a program yeah exactly so you would go into the Lua files and I would actually change the scripts on just notepad I would open them up on notepad and change the scripts there change the values from like Armour 15 to 17 and then it would change that inside the game you [ __ ] cheater yeah it was my universe it was my server so people would play under my rules so I would choose what type of you know what type of oh that's awesome yeah and and that's how I actually got to know Lua I didn't even know was a language I thought it was a phone extension by the way guys everybody's a developer here yeah but go ahead but yeah that's that's pretty much what I know about it and I honestly I knew nothing about code I didn't even know it was coding but it's actually pretty easy for beginners to get to read lure and kind of understand it you know yeah it was like 14 at the time oh so you're saying you had your own servers is how you're using force yeah I had my own video game server running on it was a it's called a server list or whatever and people would like just from all over the world would go into the server and I the most the peak people that had the most people that had at one specific time was like ninety people live Wow no wonder is great it's creative for accessibility yeah yeah yeah you know like don't starve together this one is this game that I absolutely love on Steam play it like crazy or used to play like crazy dad I think is also built in Lua but even with that said it has a very stack like it's it's dropping down because now there are other programming languages that people are using you know like for example using Unity game engine and that's what we've got C++ C sharp C sharp C sure it's one of those but that's what people are using and they're not using Lua that much anymore so that's been that's been pretty much on the decline yeah can we look up on Google Trends wait what it's saying about Lua and so while you're doing that I'm actually looking at syntax and it's really interesting because it literally looks like Python it's got you know you got your prints it print hello world you know with the parentheses looks like actually Python 3 so they thought ahead of the curve Python 3 just got the whole print parentheses hello world you know oh yeah and it's got functions and and you know for variable for variable you say you have something like local x equals 1 you got your loops dang this is awesome yeah they got quite a lot if you actually if you go to like transit google.com right and you just if you go there and you can look at it and the growth of Python I mean obviously that's much more cuz that's the number one language especially right now too but when you look at Lua it had this little jump around right around 2009 it had that little spike but then after that it just started declining like crazy and I kid you not that's the time where I was playing with the server seriously I was eighth ninth grade yeah damn me so all that yeah there it is there it is there you go so whoa you can look at the trend line there and then if you if you click on the compare where it's like the plus sign compare right next to Lua yeah and you can type in Python there and then it'll allow you to see Lua compared with the Python and that will give you certain interestingly enough I'm looking at the subregion right you've got Lula being used guess what is the number one region it's being used in or you know uh Lua well Oh Hawaii here's okay but now you really see that Lua you know it maybe have tiny little spike some points but it's pretty much been very low interest throughout like all the way through yeah yeah I'm the thing that's being used much and I mean ever right so they say there's a huge much more demand many more developers that know it then the demand for the jobs so that's why I would put this in top five worst programming languages because I think it's um yeah it's not that great so like probably avoid it if you can yeah yeah if you want to script just use Python that's right I'm still widget I'm still that still amazes me that still it looks pretty good in terms of syntax wise that's still the amazing part to me honestly it looks good syntax well like you know being developed in 1993 is is it functional or is it this obvious is functional because it's not a function no because well because you got your while you got your you got your you got your loops you got your okay its primary okay so Lua it's a lightweight highlevel multiparadigm programming language and it's designed for embedded use and applications I've curious what kind of locations now okay what oh yeah there we go that's another one yeah what did you get stuff can you build with Lua let's take a look at that oh yo you know roblox that we saw at VidCon that those people are talking about roblox game that's to keep you out of code that's based on Loula are you serious yeah pretty sure hold on so I'm looking at I'm looking right now at things that use Lua so video games is one other uses you got Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Apache HTTP server so yeah I'm looking at on Wikipedia other videos you have to be very careful where a spike database that's right oh yeah it's popping up that's awesome yeah awesome to have a TV you've got a Photoshop I was that's surprising right cheat engine Cisco yeah I was like whoa you're crying CryEngine yeah conky system monitoring that yeah I don't know what a lot of this damn small Linux you know Redis database dolphin computer no you know Redis like read Tuesday right yes yeah yeah yeah Redis is an open source database in which Lua can be used okay can be used in there interesting interesting okay so anyways if if you can avoid it avoid it unless there's a very specific use case that you're learning it for and the job you're trying to apply for like you're trying to work for some you know Adobe Photoshop it's very nice and you want so like yeah don't put effort into it unless it's very clear that you're gonna get a return right yeah I think it's using much anymore honestly okay let's move to top four worst horrible programming languages what do we got four top four you know what I want to do a thing let's define what do you mean by worst by worst okay so that's a great thing so when what we're saying worst we were we gave it a lot of thought were thinking should we just put really garbage as a tarek programming languages and while we still plan to do that we wanted to put some programming languages that are just facing a sharp decline that way people can still resonate with it you know so if you're watching this video we want the people to go okay that I know about Lou or I know about this you know of course there's like worse programming languages than Lua like way worse that nobody is actually using but I feel like at certain times you get so esoteric that it's it's not that fun anymore you know so so it's a mixture of programming like declining and then few we're gonna kind of just throw out here for entertainment so people can can be you know yeah I'm crazy cuz there's so there's some really crazy ones out there yeah but that's what I mean by worse so that's what I'm I gotcha I gotcha I gotcha what would you say in terms of in terms that fine yeah yeah that's perfect that's perfect it's a number four worst programming language or Lang dump them down what do you got there no darling I don't know I'm reading the Kapiti right now let me see it is a generalpurpose programming language and running environment oh that's a great explanation okay so this is a concurrent functional programming language um right off the bat one thing they kind of know it's like probably go is gonna be more popular right because go is a concurrent language and I believe go is is it also functional I don't believe so go is not functional yeah yeah too many but like Erlang is the main one we're looking at functional yeah okay so you have so go so if go as functional right and gore general purpose and if go as concurrent and it's super popular then this is probably gonna die off even more but let's look at like what kind of led to its decline Wow Ericsson is that like the company Ericsson you know like Sony Ericsson oh man there's like bunch of stuff that's pretty yeah it is it actually is the company Ericsson what do you mean like Sony Ericsson the ones who developed it yeah okay so few reason why Erlang is really bad right according to I'm reading a blog post by code mentor dot IO and the one of the reasons why they say it's really bad this is this is really nice graphic actually is it possible to put it pull that one up I think you would just type in code mentored i/o and then worst languages to learn and this brings up something pretty interesting mmhmm so they go they talk about the worst programming and just learn 2018 but it's I think this applies for 2019 and most likely for 2022 and they have they've split it between community engagement job market and growth and trends and their community engagement is for Erlang is pretty bad they pretty low their job market for Erlang is actually very low as well so they're not a lot of job opportunities that exists so when it comes to like bad programming languages that you want to avoid you probably want to avoid languages that have lured low demand you know people paying less and then the growth and trend of Erlang is also dying too but what are you guys thoughts on it so I'm looking right now I looked at what companies used Erlang right and I'm gonna name a few so we've got name a few that my name a few that are pretty much known facebook facebook chat back and it still uses it looks like looks like it either uses it or used it I thought that I thought they used you should be PHP man I don't know I mean according I'm looking directly on Ireland org so you know their actual website and looks like pee so it's Facebook backend they've also got watts messaging for smartphones they've got the whatsapp app as well hmm we've got a few ones that one app is written in early according to them which is weird probably features of it yeah holy moly well what's out five best thing is it's used for in the communication systems right you know you know and all these all these programs you know Facebook and whatsapp they're all telecommunications almost it's almost dinner look at that Wow as it was suitable for accommodating huge communication system with high sustainability there's a famous opensource jabber server written in Erlang over systems that do the backend message routing are done in Erlang God you didn't know that dude I am pretty blown away so maybe it's not the worst for programming languages just remove the worst part out okay so yeah there you go awful don't [ __ ] learn this so if you want to get a job at whatsapp learn early how many devs do they need for an app like that I mean actually usually the teams are fairly small right yeah I mean what like whatsapp or Facebook well I mean Facebook you know a lot but like what is what's up wonder Facebook it's not well no Facebook bought whatsapp did they yeah didn't know that yeah what's funny it's one of the workers from Facebook actually founded wet tops it's funny that like Facebook uses Erlang and then this guy in whatsapp uses Arlington yeah and he's like the guy election found face of what's up I think is actually Ukrainian oh he actually didn't work for Facebook he wasn't he actually didn't pass the interview for face yeah yeah yeah yeah I remember that yeah yeah that's true that is true oh my gosh and then yeah and then they how much they end up buying what's up for was it 60 60 billion dollars I forgot 1606 maybe that's it six billion I don't know check it out oh right there yeah well the what's that founders they they set the prices sixteen billion mmmhmm but hey okay they paid twenty one okay so here are a few hypotheses for why this is pretty fascinating this is some article suppose somebody made on Y Combinator hacker news and it's like okay why isn't it popular and the guy says you know they go people say or Lang is being used for whatsapp and then people ask the question right after that they go why isn't it popular anymore that's kind of exactly what we're thinking right now it's like why isn't it popular anymore well they say that don't look at the language itself to get insight into why it's not popular look into the community for why it's not popular right make sense that's one big reason and then they gave like multiple other reasons like for example they don't have a package manager there are no open source packages there's no committees like everything has the open source package github is like a goldmine for JavaScript frameworks or whatever right they don't have open source packages they have no community site there are guns no for loops wait what well you know listen yeah lists for Strings variables don't vary there are no docks or too many docks that are incorrect they're not enough teaching materials so it's just a regular language like a spoken language like what is this no documentation emacs's ID but that's crazy though like I mean if you don't like a potato well that's you know I mean the big part is you're right if you don't have a community around it then that's why it's a dying you know that's a very big part of a dying language the community as well makes anything really popular that's why Python is so big yeah cuz I mean like if it's a if it's a programming language then it can obviously create you can obviously create something with it so like it's not because it's like it's nonfunctional but like yeah energy use and and yeah so exactly so this is very fascinating I think we can learn a lot from just this I think it's just really interesting because a lot it's a lot about adoption of a language it's not just how great it is or how great the features are a lot about the adoption cuz functionalitywise is incredible but some other things that people are hypothesis hypothesizing or like the syntax is weird not only in a paradigm way but the pattern matching to most other programming languages it doesn't match the pattern of how you write most of the programming languages which make looks wack the syntax looks really weird like I can't even there I can't even decipher it like what the heck is this by the way this is hot Thanks yeah syntax go ahead now go ahead you go ahead at your first so the syntax is really odd and it makes it so people can't just jump in the barrier of entry is very very high even for us I'm like I'm looking at I'm like what can I see some I mean looks like a receiving it receives the signal yeah you could just type in like Erlang syntax or something on him and then go to images and maybe something will come up and I feel like it's a very low level low level it's low level programming language okay so yes it's also a little bit low level I guess but I think the adoptability is the main main thing yeah I'm surprised of what's for what's that using it home yeah well like look at the some of the syntax right it's weird it's like word count well well I mean it it is not tearing yeah look I love it's like halfway between like Java bytecode or like assembly and a high level it's like halfway between because there's weird jump statements and stuff yes jump statements one like it says like to go back to the top of a loop you can link loop back up with him let's let's guess let's guess what's going on in there well I mean I guess it just by looking at the function name in one I know what's going on they are doing they're updating word count I don't know dude look you got a table is that like an empty array line 29 looking up a word I don't know what so what okay who is up for learning this language for 24 hours and then we make a video on it do that's interesting people vote on that idea then yeah you should actually choose all five okay choose one of the five and we'll do yeah just one of them front verse five and then the one that gets the most up votes yeah we'll spend 24 hours learning it doesn't be above like 20 or 30 up vote and well maybe this will make the next Facebook but the order what's that I was getting yeah out of void space so as you unconvincingly saw it's a bad language don't learn it unless you want to work for horribly awesome companies like whatsapp yeah yeah no she's actually Facebook again the main thing is the adaptability of it is low which makes it so the future and the trend of it is not as high so of course there's some specialized companies you could work for whatsapp and probably some others but you if you want to look at the longevity of it it's not gonna be that high and because it's the here's here's why you'd rather learn Lua over this is because Luis still probably like most other languages so when you learn it you can still pick up lots of other languages this I feel like will leave you in a place where it doesn't really apply to many other things you only learn this like if you're doing something very specific like don't start with this this is this would correct it's not something yeah because for example if you pick up JavaScript as your first programming language or Python or Java well you could still pick up all the other languages pretty easily but if you pick up like machine code is your first language that's not gonna really translate to any other language but you know the interesting part is like a lot of these languages they're really not used a lot they actually pay a lot of money like in terms of work like work wise because not a lot of people there may be a little demand for them right but there's also very little supply I have I had back in college I had as a friend of mine and he told me about how you know for example think Ford or GM they're looking for COBOL COBOL yeah like COBOL engineers and they were ready to pay like 200k or something just for a COBOL engineer you know right and that's because there aren't a lot of a lot of them good but doesn't say that doesn't you know right I'm not saying like go you need to learn it I'm just this is just an interesting perspective right so it's kind of like how clothes they're in fashion then they go out of fashion and then they're so old that they come back in fashion again yeah I mean if you want to play that gamble that's fine but I feel like most of the times is that it's like a gamble so yeah I imagine there's give me some educates people who will benefit off of it but I feel like majority of the people probably not benefit out of it I'm looking monster 77 Jobs found from early all right let's move to the third today's which one should we go it should we go with trump script yeah let's just stick to letting do the order will be picked earlier all right sweet let's go number two top third worst programming language Trump script alright so this language how do you have to end the script you have to end it with like make America great again right that's how you officially end uh may you know I'm looking at this Christian make Python great yeah make Python great again I think that's how you end every it's written in Python yeah which is awesome it's literally just parttime I use you just have to end the script with that I'm trying to find something on it oh that's so interesting is it just literally Python yeah there you go oh I think let's do the second I think we let's go with the Virg one second one no not that I think there's another one by the verge there let's click on that the Donald Trump programming language is not for dummies or losers love the headline main coding nice tagline okay so there's a part where it goes it goes like for example if you use a word that's been banned the error message will read we're all have to scroll down a little bit there yeah it's like that like whole section with the error message will read Trump doesn't want to hear it or if you use a word that's not common it will say we have a country where it is similar you have to speak there's some more features of Trump scripts so for example no floatingpoint numbers only integers because America thank you yeah so the idea behind not having any floating numbers and only integers is because America never does anything halfway all numbers must be strictly greater than 1 million the small stuff is in constant and there are no important code has to be homegrown and americanmade and in its raw form Trump's crit is not compatible with windows because isn't the guy isn't the type of guy to believe in PC yeah so if you sorry just one more time if we sell just a little bit down you'll have the first working Trump script so save roses are red say violets are blue if lies say if I can beat Hillary says so can you what and then you gotta end it with America's great so this is Trump dot txt Wow this guy even wrote this for us on github Wow now I'm actually gonna go to their Trump probably paid to develop this language you know you know when it came out I was gonna make a video on it right when it came out why didn't it come out by the way they know a few years ago because running it says features error messages are mostly quotes directly taken from Trump himself only the most say only the most popular English words Trump's favorite words and current politician names can be used as variable names the other one is like said if the running computer is from China Donald Trump's curb will not compile are you serious dude somebody went really far with this like it probably checks for IP addresses you know instead of true and false we have the keywords fact and lie won't run in rube mode because America doesn't need your help being great trump is all we need oh my gosh is the only key value pair Trump and Putin interesting I'm curious like why why why people like what inspires people to come up with this kind of stuff you know exactly I mean it's Trump somebody was probably emotional by constructing a wall aka by providing the wall flag so in terminal I think you can pass a flag when you're writing a command in a command line you get past a wall flag if you do that it says Trump's script will refuse to run on machines with Mexican locales man the Mexican developers star probably yes if you if you run like Python example dot py and then before you hit enter you you do hi you passed a wall flag it will it will if it's a Mexican machine yes so what is the point of this language is it like can you actually build stuff with it usually just I'm sure you can yeah you just you just try it as long as you're not on the windows and it makes a call in Mexico or China or China I'll be tough all right well we should move on to the next one I think we're coming up with an hour soon I'm not sure well okay all right we'll probably got to move faster than yeah and it's easy to type with small hands that's another feature I just saw that okay so language let's move on to number two worse programming language whitespace all right so what's crazy about this whitespace programming language if we pull up whitespace syntax I'll pull it up to right space sounds like a horror movie it's it's made up of just whitespace there there's nothing so like it's showing you all that color but that just means that they're highlighting it how it actually looks like it's just blank there's no letters there no words nothing it's nothing yeah it's just tabs and spaces yeah the entire language so if you scroll down a little bit scroll down more more you're gonna see a document that has nothing on it scroll probably yeah that's actually what the language is doing you literally have to highlight what you wrote to see what you wrote correct Wow but even then you can't really see yeah borders weights do you have to count like how much white space like yeah why space tabs and new lines is how you write code in it not trying to be disrespectful or anything but with this work with like blind people or something because it's like are you gonna say black people that would yeah of course would work with blind people all they it would blind people it would work better than jobs with white person because you're clicking a time to them it's no different than Python or something they're already using drill to them they're already feeling it any feedback we can get on this anybody that's playing that it has a little bit of a reference experience with whitespace talk about a head scratcher man like talk about like you know how much oh my gosh trying to write something like this you're gonna be frustrated all the time really hard is if you get a git diff or after you do a git merge with somebody's code and if to update it that would be a nightmare because when you're showing when they're showing the git diff they also have highlight the white spaces it's like oh man this guy just added all this new colors I'm like oh forget it approved yeah when you push it it's like oh man it sounds like a nightmare but one cool thing I just read on the Wikipedia page is um it's pretty much like the opposite of all other programming languages because you know most programming languages it ignores all the white space curve this one ignores any nonwhite space yeah therefore you can actually write programs in a normal program link oh it's white space embedded in Python so this way this would be great for hackers but yeah they can do is they can write look like nonmiddle moon not a little nonmalicious looking code in Python or something it's like printer script but it's actually white yeah using so it only entered the compiler only laser would know would need to know how to run white space right OS X would need to not hurt anybody it's a good program thanks for the in for like the secret code or something right it's like a it's like a little like Morse code as a programming yeah I was like what are they the CIA uses it or something you know I doubt it they're probably not smart enough to use it okay probably because we're a long time let's move on to the number one worst programming language on the planet this will hurt your brain make you cry make you weep it's called what is it called the brain [ __ ] literally yeah that is B are AI n f uck that's correct rain fallin word brain fog programming language I think the intention of the programming language is in the word you know yep and the idea of this programming language to be as esoteric ask complex as um as complicated as possible yep brain fog look at that code that was designed to hurt yeah one of the most frustrating programming languages was built that way on purpose but for a whole idea on yeah so it looks like really painful code that's a great article I think if you scroll down on that one it shows like how some of the code looks 2 by E so lingers is this like a thing it was create a 93 thousand by Swiss physics student named urban Mueller Mueller Mueller hmm I mean it was it was an attempt to create a language with the smallest possible compiler so it was actually like something making the code is hard for humans right but easy as easy as possible for computer like most efficient compiler but it's tearin complete so it actually it can actually write real code and do real stuff can we actually see some syntax that'd be interesting maybe maybe this article does not have syntax right there I imagined it right there oh my gosh so to write hello world this is was how you write it would look like so just listening to this go ahead confused imagine making your Python Django apps with that big so like if it's for anybody who's just listening you would normally write print hello world but in brain [ __ ] you would write like plus plus plus plus bracket greater in the side and period and the crazy stuff what is this so laters another programming language called or rant or Angleton words or anger ten words and it's a spin so brain [ __ ] is a spin off of that language and in that language every character is just the word that's every single word is like that curse how how here's another programming let's call chef which is pretty awesome and everything has to be written like a recipe oh yeah have you seen it yeah yeah I think you went over that yeah everything is run like a recipe and then that's not for oops to like put two tablespoons and then like repeat it yeah everything's related to like cooking looks like a Gordon Ramsay Channel everything yeah but yeah for this language it's just designed to hurt your brain as much as possible and I don't have somebody's ever made programs with this like it's a very low lingual low leg low low level language yeah where you know you're doing with pointers a lot you know you adding your pointer you're in committing porn decreasing your pointer you to check this out okay brain [ __ ] is the ungodly creation of urban Muller whose goal was apparently to create a Turing complete language for which he could write the smallest compiler ever for the Amiga OS 2.0 Amiga ran in Spanish right with a non non cultural people yeah writing compilers sucks you've written a compiler yeah yeah yeah so there you guys have it the top five worst programming languages to learn in 2020 and beyond probably I mean I don't know how far beyond maybe brain [ __ ] the look on the number one most programmers but I am willing to say on record that it won't no probably still be awful and that's it I hope you guys enjoyed the show learn more popular languages like Python or JavaScript or Java or something that's really relevant let us know what programming language was the worst to you so we can create something with it yeah we'll spin we'll spend 24 hours all learning that language and then develop something we'll go to his loft just let's not do brave [ __ ] that like that I feel like that's gonna be a really hard one yeah let's not do that let's do something that'll be like entertaining for them to watch to some script yeah that's better all right guys thank you so much for watching and listening to this subscribe to the channel if you haven't already
