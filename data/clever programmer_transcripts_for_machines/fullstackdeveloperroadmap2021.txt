live what is up youtube what is everybody hope you guys are doing amazing today we are chatting about this out look at what we're talking about we are speaking about the 2021 roadmap to become a full stack developer this is your full stack developer 2021 world map stick around because at the end this roadmap you will get a chance you will you would you have a special surprise for you at the end of this video for you to check out which will actually help you on becoming a full stack developer now granted look at what we have here it is all not only us we also have amazing people like this right here look at this all these amazing people who judge joy everybody say hi to everybody say hi there we go beautiful beautiful beautiful guys nas and i will be jumping out today and we're gonna give you the road map the guidance the stepbystep system yes that you can start to apply literally starting today to become a full stack developer within 2021 yes exactly exactly we'll talk in the video to those of you who are on youtube right now guys i'm sorry right um unfortunately this is only for pwg students uh for the zoom call so so to join that you have to be there but it's okay at least you'll

so okay let's see so here's i'm gonna share my screen right here let me see the screen right there so let me know if you guys see my screen beautiful yes you can as always you guys know always let's go here all right so full stack developer roadmap right let's go and check this out so what are we going to be talking about uh what what are we discussing everybody can see my screen yes or no yes yes yes yes yes thumbs up good good good good good all right all right so pretty simple guys for today all right pretty simple let me go get my pointer there you go all right so make sure number one

we're not liable for it okay don't blame us that's the disclaimer disclaimer we're not liable frankly to destroy decide to destroy for yourself okay all right cool let's go and move on also we're going to be uh doing a q a a live q a with me and daniel at the end of this call so if any questions so make sure you stick around for that and also really quickly today you'll get a chance to check out uh you'll get a chance to actually apply for a boot camp an amazing mooc that we have you know been working on for the past months we currently have our first school starting which is just crazy crazy it's so good um yeah we already have two people who already have have internships as well amazing results already only only for three three months man that's crazy so yeah and we currently are taking people on the wait list for the next cohort so cool all right let's get this party started oh you click the different button well no you you put the green one so let's import this let's simplify the journey of becoming a full stack developer guys okay oh i see people in the youtube chat it's amazing awesome let's simplify the journey to become first developer right the number one thing you need to think about okay is think about kind of the goal right the goal that you need to you know that you that you want right do you want so for example here uh maker okay uh marek what's your goal for example tell me what's your goal my goal is to you know just have more time okay so you want to have more time correct okay okay so that's your goal okay now so if you want to have more time what does it take to have more time tell me uh like i told you before uh it'll be freelancing just or or uh just working remotely having that more time to you know spend with family um understanding the the concept of javascript right really so you do this so your goal your goal is to have more time and with that you're obviously the thing that you do is like work remotely right so you want to work remotely and be a kind of uh as a as a fullstack developer might that be freelancing or might that be the job correct yes sir okay broker multi modelly as a full site developer right now let's talk about exactly right let's talk about the steps you need to do to actually get there so let's talk about steps okay so step one for example step one what does you need to do for step one think about this uh understand everything about javascript understand understand gis okay step two let's think about this practice practice practice practice that's huge right that's the big thing right practice practice practice okay okay let's go ahead and do step three okay here's my step three for you okay this is really important one listen up okay this is called problem solving okay i want you to practice not only that not just practice but you need to get good at problem solving marek okay but that's the most important thing problem solving okay step that's that's what you need to do right and that's because every programmer essentially is a problem solver you solve a complicated problem by writing software correct okay let's say i think about that step four step four i was thinking about this what do you think a step four is could be um clear.project yeah so build your portfolio so build your portfolio correct so build your portfolio correct okay portfolio portfolio right there build your portfolio right here okay right here for step three i'm gonna kind of go back to this and this is this right here is the most important just so you know right here this part csmarak this part right here is the most important okay problem solving if you can get this then you cannot build your portfolio if you cannot be a good problem solver your portfolio only it will look cool that's fine it's fake it's not real it's just tutorials you found that you happened to copy and you didn't really exactly exactly it's like let's say it's like having a i don't know a car that looks cool but drives shitty yeah yeah yeah it's it's like if you were to get the body of a tesla yeah and then you put it over like an old car it doesn't even work so you're like oh look i have this tesla but it doesn't even start right it's not even electric exactly exactly right so that's the most important thing okay okay step four now let's do step five okay step five is what step five what is step five step five i think step five is hmm start finding clients yeah apply apply to jobs or finding clients apply to jobs right slash find clients correct right now apply to remote jobs let's be clear about that remote because right you don't want to look for jobs that necessarily don't fit what you want right remote jobs or or find clients remote clients does that make sense right so we want to be very direct with that comprende comprende is good okay cool but here's my biggest question though marek okay here's my and this is to everybody here literally to everybody here here's my big question to you okay is you said that yes you have to do all these different things right great i have to do all this i have to understand yes i have to practice practice okay i have to be a problem solver and build your portfolio and apply to remote jobs but there's one big [ __ ] question that we need to ask ourselves and that is very simple here's a question wait who do i need to be whoa that's a big question who do i need to be to do all these things that i want to do right who do i need to be to be to be a promise all right who do i need to be to be able to apply for remote jobs and find a foster developer job okay that is the question who do i need to be so who do you need to be marek okay in order in order to become a full stack developer tell me what do you think it is huh bulldog mindset okay mentally strong okay but let's go let's go deeper into this though let's go deeper now what else you have to be a student okay so student but okay now but before that okay that's fine but that's not totally where i'm going at where what else seems like maybe to you know figure out solutions to people's problems um that's not what i'm trying to try and look for here determine determine who said that yeah determined you need to be determined you need to be mad persistent you need to be so [ __ ] persistent that whatever difficulty that comes in front of you you can go through it because here's what's gonna happen at some point marek it's what happens to everybody you have a challenge you have a challenge that's in front of you and it's gonna get [ __ ] hard okay you have a child that's in front of you and you're gonna be like oh [ __ ] i can't do it i can't figure it out and then here's what a lot of people do they quit this is what a lot of people do i had a student recently he is in our coding bootcamp right now which is the buddha we'll be talking about later on he got an internship as a reaction developer but it was hard for him he couldn't it was like really hard for him right it's just his first censorship right he's like nahs it's so hard i know i feel like a quitting i'm like what the [ __ ] did you just say you got an opportunity in front of you and gonna quit because it's hard nothing in the [ __ ] this life is supposed to be easy especially when it's very rewarding things there's a saying that says there's a saying that says nothing nothing worth having comes easy understand truth to that truth to that so this is what i want you to do right is you have to think about who do i need to be i need to be someone wakes up wakes up early in the morning in the morning maybe i'm not sure depending how you work i need to be someone who potentially may be right maybe someone you want to you need to be someone who is i don't know you need to you i want to uh you guys the the what's your call that youtube can't really see because there's a thing right there i need to be someone who maybe it codes every day nonstop codes every day no matter what right this is what we have to ask us about these important questions is who they need to because i can i can talk a big game i can talk a big game of like okay cool well i want to be false a developer i need to learn js i need to be a problem solver but great but unless you put some [ __ ] work and some action actual words behind it that means [ __ ] nothing do you understand oh yeah that's what you what i want you guys to think about okay who do i need to be everybody right now in the zoom call if you are currently on for example if you're currently on youtube write this down a piece of paper who do you need to be who do i need to be who do you need to be daniel i need to be someone that has all these words that's not just put up there but to be able to get to there i also recognize i need to set some goals and get there little by little and that's why we're going back to setting goals because there's two types of goals that are going to get there right was nas just talked about is that is gonna be part of your longterm vision who do i need to be you have that longterm vision of yourself five years from now ten years from now but to get to that point you have to break that down into smaller and shorter goals so that you could start to baby step your way or if you're going to go hard you start to sprint your way to becoming that person exactly as long as there's progress you know it's up to you whether you're going to go fast or slow but as long as the progress so what does a longterm goal look like noz so let's say a longterm goal of course is you we want to be let's say in my in mark's size for example um right his goal is for them for example to become a false developer because he wants to be able to work remotely so he that he can have more time with his family okay so that is one of his longterm goals okay um now or either that our first developer or full stack freelancer either either case works correct right either case right cool now okay so that's your longterm goal okay that could be one year five years maybe six months who knows okay but now okay now what is our shortterm goal well here's our shortterm goal okay we want to for example learn the fundamentals we want to learn javascript and react we want to for example for example let me go ahead and look at this for example you want to go ahead and uh you know build builder build our build your portfolio build build our first our first react.js project react.js project project from a tutorial for example right so maybe you start out number one is you start out for example building a project from your portfolio from like a youtube tutorial or something something like that there's nothing wrong with that it's a way to introduce yourself to it the problem becomes later on is when you're long when your short term goal becomes this project from tutorials all the time this is when it becomes a problem this is something called tutorial health and you can't get out of tutorial hell if you just keep doing more tutorials all the time you need to do the opposite of tutorials if you're trying to get out tutorials exactly so what do you need to do daniel to get out of tutorial hell you need to make sure you understand how to actually write code and solve problems because at that point you can start to build your own software yes so for example let's go let's go just put down some a few things that for example we can learn for example so let's go number one okay so build your build your own project from scratch yeah so here here's you it could be from scratch or you could build on top of a tutorial that you've already built because if you follow tutorial maybe you could follow along and you can add a feature to it you can add something else that you didn't follow anyone's tutorial you yourself you were able to come up with that correct correct so for example let me ask this question marek have you completed any of the modules in uh in pwg right now yes i'm on modules six or seven right now okay six or seven okay so what project have you built so far uh by myself i haven't built any projects for myself i've just been going through this no no no no what project have you built from the tutorial oh uh i'm gonna look it up give me a second i'm guessing for example guess the number game right right or you guessed the number again yeah the guess the number game yeah so let's think about this so you have this one righteous number game right gabe all right have you built the weather app yet or no the weather app yes i built it already let's think about the weather app okay okay weather app okay let's think about okay what additional features can you add by yourself as a way to learn better and faster okay let's think about this okay what additional features can you add anybody having suggestions in the you on youtube if you're on youtube right okay provided some suggestions on youtube if you're here in a zoom what suggestions go ahead and raise your hand and talk what suggestion would you have for marek for example to you know to go ahead and uh what's it called and uh to build new features what do you guys think trey what do you think trey you hear me yeah i can hear you okay um you could add like um centralized like your location um specifically or you could throw in some extra designs like uh your make it look like you want to you know yeah yeah so extra design aspects right right maybe for example i think a google might be for example um like find your location your location based on ip address yeah so for example you might not even have to for example you know ask the person for their location it's just it finds automatically based on your ip address and that's possible in coding right so find your location based on a p address because for example when you go by when you go to weather channel or some other weather like a company they will actually get you the you know the weather based on your iphone that's that's so simple right right anything else for example let's say claudio or anybody else anybody else have any suggestions um sorry i don't even remember the weather no but think about it yourself right just think about where you're for yourself right what kind they need multiple days of water yeah oh yeah yeah i like that so like multiple days of weather correct um also after yeah multiple information here because the weather is also not only sun or rainy but humidity yeah and all of our stuff yeah yeah for sure for sure for sure so you can see yeah so that's what your goal is your goal should be to build on top of the current projects does everybody understand here raise your hand raise your hand yes yes yes yes yes good good good right everybody should be building that you should not just be copying from a tutorial and that's pretty much it so just keep that in mind every single time you're doing tutorial may that be from us may that be from a different course might that be from youtube it don't matter we have a lot of students right now i'm not kidding a lot of students right now who are going through for example just youtube tutorials and you know what they can't [ __ ] build [ __ ] i'm sorry that's the [ __ ] the truth you can't build [ __ ] and you want if you can't build [ __ ] you won't get a job i know i'm like being very pumped up right now but it's like you know there's a reason okay that's the only way that's the only way for me to communicate this kind of stuff for you right now so cool does that make sense for everybody yes or no yes that's our shortterm goal okay okay and again make sure you you write this stuff down guys make sure you write this stuff down okay and and take your time right like that's where nas is here stopping putting you in this position so that you could take your time write this stuff down you really think it through like what are the steps that we have to take the short terms and how they're going to add up to be able to get to that long term goal in the end yes exactly exactly exactly awesome sweet so make a plan okay cool next up let's go ahead and see okay next up so to be able to write it down you could use notion yeah notion use wherever you want whatever you love notes whatever it might be in notes app yeah for example so again write down is very important for example here a neuroscientist here explains that i'm going to remove this stuff right people who very vividly describe or picture their goals are anywhere from 1.2 to 1.4 times more likely to successfully accomplish their goals it's actually really funny i always like i always like picture by myself i always picture like for example us the color programmer team like on stage for example like given a talk presentation on at a conference where we introduce for example like a bootcamp or introduce a program or not just introduce but just like provide value you know or we have speakers i i picture this like every single time i do meditation right i picture myself for example getting a tesla at some point for example right hey guys you see that's what happens when you visualize when you vividly describe that picture in that goal you achieve it now this is a prime example of that next we'll be talking on stage just like how he's talking about right now yeah we will i'm not kidding that's going to happen at the end this year yes it's going to happen right so it's stuff like this like for example next up you have for example these people say that a few fewer than 20 percent of people report reported that they described their goals and reform which is on which it just just which is unfortunate as humans we process visuals 60 times faster than having to imagine things based on a recent study about the 3m company so writing down your goals means that you can visualize visually see them this is an important point because when we see something right it affects how we act wow that's powerful that's pretty cool and that's why people have vision boards as well right yeah people can set up a board where they just put pictures of the things that they want and that visual cue helps them to take the right action yes 100 percent have a 100 and actually visual board is actually really cool something that aaron my friend does he has a visual board literally literally create a visual board guys is really really cool create a visual board a vision board a vision board of everything that you want for example to have in your life for example right and honestly and just make it a screensaver or make it a your full desktop picture now personally i don't do this myself right now but i have my friend aaron who is going through big transformation right now and he has that fully like there right there in front of him on not only for example on you know not not only for example for on his desktop but also like for example on his iphone it's pretty insane yeah so everywhere that he's just constantly there he gets that reminder that visual and he could start to work towards that so that's why it's important guys to be able to write this down so you can visualize it because literally people are able to have more success the more ingrained in their mind it becomes and the more it becomes part of their specific identity for sure for sure awesome okay let's go and keep going that case next slide next slide let's see okay what does it take to become a successful star developer that's a good question so let's talk about the technical skills that you need to know to to get there all right so part one technology to know to become a full stack developer right here guys all right well let me see you know html css right here right uh javascript right here of course very important uh react gs is going to be the the framework of our choice sorry the library of our choice sometimes some people get really really picky about this kind of stuff no gs gonna be a great choice for the back end uh there's also you know you can also do django as well so jingle is another great choice uh as well let's go ahead and keep going uh next we have firebase another great database exactly to play around with mongodb is an amazing database as well to use an express gs that's going to go hand in hand with node.js right here and of course the really important my sequel guys guys guys make sure that if you don't know these take a screenshot right now take a screenshot of this because you're gonna be able to realize and have this even as your vision board these could be the things that you want to master because the first thing will set your goals the next thing is what are the things that you have to master to become a full stack developer this is it i mean you could definitely trade some things in and out but if you do this you can become that full stack developer exactly exactly exactly so cool now guys again i mentioned like my sequel this kind of stuff is really really important uh i still this is something we teach very much in the boot camp we have and of course there's more technologies to us right like you cannot so so forget about everything because we are going to literally start and tell you from scratch the real reality of becoming a full stack developer and what you need to know right because first off we need to be honest with you right yes becoming a full stack developer isn't something that just happened i'm sorry i can't in days or a month or two it takes time no it takes practice it takes persistence it takes everything that nods was talking about earlier yes and it's like a lot of people they will come into this kind of stuff right guys they'll come in and they'll be like okay well you know i want to be a foster developer and i want to be in two months and i want to be a [ __ ] millionaire no like who wants to be a millionaire here huh guys tell me who wants to be a millionaire here raise your hand i mean everybody should raise their hand if they want to but are you thinking but you think you'll be there next month or two um take take some time unless you win the [ __ ] lottery true unless you know some crazy thing happens then yeah probably not a lot of stuff takes a lot of time takes a lot of work guys it takes persistence but most importantly what i want to tell you guys to do is please when you get into coding this is for everybody for you on youtube because i'm so passionate about this right for you that are currently here on zoom you guys please please please listen to this okay don't don't do this just for the money please too many people go into this issue they do it just for the money right they go home they're like oh i wanna i want the money that's all i want no this this [ __ ] is hard and so this will require a different level understanding right different understanding you actually want to do it because okay well because i want to be a developer i want to have this career right because i enjoy this i enjoy this exactly because here at clever programmer we don't make sad rich developers we make happy rich developers and we want you to be happy right so make sure you're doing this for the right reason so everyone here on the zoom call if you're doing it for the right reason i want you to raise your hand just to make sure that everyone here is on everybody you're passionate about that good good good good that's awesome the next step is once you admit you want to do this for the right reasons you have to start to create a time timeline okay exactly right let's let's think about this okay for those of you who has the busiest schedule right now raise your hand who is it who has a busy really busy schedule no put it down there me and others are busy yeah i mean we're very busy but we we still find time it's okay okay who has a very busy schedule tell me anybody okay cool so let's talk someone else for example uh let's take i know rishi you you code as well you code already so it's okay let's see but for example like uh elliot okay elliot okay what time from what time do you work elliot tell me so i i'm signed up mandatory for 40 hours a week it's really a nine to five but like it varies like some days will be nine to five some days are one to nine but i'm obligated to meet 40 hours a week so current job 40 hours a week how much time do you sleep uh i at least get five to six hours okay so five stars per week so that's for example let's say in seven days five to six hours that's what wait you get five to six hours only yo you need to sleep more the [ __ ] man you can save more time i just realized that what go to sleep bro go to [ __ ] sleep man yeah let's say let's say seven hours per week at least seven hours per week okay oh not per week per day per day okay that'd be 50 hours a week that'd be 50 hours a week okay so let's say 50 hours a week okay thanks david what did you say david do not [ __ ] support that david i don't see the chat there five hours is enough no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no that's why david sucks at programming because he only sleeps five hours oh no no no he's great but he could be better if he were to sleep himself let's say it's for the upper okay now how many d how many hours do we have in the weeks in general let's say it's what 24 times what is 24 times 7 100 we have we have in general 168 68 hours per week so you have 50 50 hours so you're currently spending 90 hours 90 hours okay okay how much time you got left let's see once you see minus 90. you still have 78 hours to do all the other [ __ ] that you want to do that's a lot for a week bro now yes some of that yes sunday is new eating yeah eating that let's say okay 10 hours eating let's say 10 hours to go you know the bathroom you know who knows maybe you know to go to the bathroom for 10 hours per week you know who knows right okay but let's say that leaves you off with 50 hours okay [ __ ] unless it leaves you up with 40 hours and and hold up the 40 hours is a pretty real standard because there's people that literally have their fulltime job fulltime and they work 80 to 100 hours a week yes you know yes so obviously yeah it's definitely not like the best situation but if they're able to do that then that means the average human at least has an extra 40 hours a week yeah if they're working 40 hours a week exactly whatever they want to do yeah and you still still yes you know having taking a break is still fine you know taking some time off is still fine there's no problem with that i don't we don't try to push you like you have to work eight hours a week that's not the case here but what i want you guys to do is to find at least at least right at least 30 20 hours per week right now 20 to 30 hours right now 30 hours of work of coding hours per week like can everybody here dedicate at least 2030 hours per week of coding raise your hand raise your hand can you can you no not everybody so you guys can't okay good good good everybody yes right but of course you don't [ __ ] do it why because you're too comfortable no i don't know why honestly sometimes it's a it's just that you have to be more disciplined right this is it goes back to right it goes back to you know who do i need to be right and that goes back to well i just need to be more disciplined that's part one i need more discipline with my time so for example okay let's say that okay elliot when you when you get back from work um i mean for instance just say five o'clock so that's five o'clock so is it true that maybe between six and eight you can always dedicate six and eight or between five to seven or five to eight you can dedicate time for for this for uh for coding yeah there you go so that's already three hours per day right three hours per day times that by that size five that's already 15 hours per day and you give it one more for example you know one more uh one more day that's a saturday that's what you're already doing 20 hours 20 hours 20 hours per day or per week of coding now would you say this will take you a lot faster towards your goal become a developer right if you did that versus for example you know maybe like doing one hour per week or two would you agree plan down right it's pretty simple solution right right selfexplanatory so this is what i want you guys to think about right very be very disciplined about your time use a calendar for example calendly is a really there's a something called calendar five calendar five this is on the app store right here saw calendar five right there such a cool calendar guys it's insane right very very very very very good so check to check that one out okay cool let's move on all right what do we have what does the big picture timeline look like again bringing it back to becoming a full stack developer what are the things that you have to do how can you start to structure everything so that you can make sure you can actually get there within 2021 becoming the full stack developer well yeah yes so the first part we're going to go is the fundamentals this part do not [ __ ] miss this part right here guys this is what nobody does this is why everybody's struggling so much it's because of the fundamentals yeah even other boot camps like we've talked to other students who have been part of other boot camps and they don't even know how to build an application from scratch because they never learned the fundamentals they wouldn't know how to add a feature to anything because what they just went through was they just went through the course they just went through the tutorials and did whatever they were told so we realized that wow this is a huge gap and people's knowledge when they're trying to become a full site developer so we actually prioritize this and put it in the very beginning yes okay month two let's say for example or mother one because we're such cool because we're you know because we're you know we're programmers we start with this we go into like html css so maybe you take a break a little bit from coding and this takes you more into the creative side right which is to be able to develop beautiful websites beautiful applications just understand understand more so like the the view part of it right the view part of not the back end part of it but the view part of it okay in reality html and css they're not necessarily like programming languages they're what market languages or whatever they're called exactly so it'll kind of take your brain off of the programming you could see how to make beautiful websites and then give you that space to kind of go back into it with month two or month three whatever we're we'll keep it this way so month two it's not gonna use anything right there so next time your mouth to learn yes es6 then we have for example after you've kind of mastered a little bit more of javascript maybe you built a project here maybe at this point you built like a project let's say maybe you built a project at this point right okay after that point which which you do for example is you will for example maybe you might learn for example like react.js and this point right here right you might learn react.js and then finally you will go ahead and maybe you might then build a portfolio with your projects right right with the parts that you build so maybe you built the project with reactgs here but the project here that now gives you two projects they have another one here that's with you know with react.js right here that's pretty much it okay and then we for example then you keep doing practice problems so you've been doing fundamentals practice problems then you keep doing it on and on and on again and again and again okay you don't stop that for those of you right now who are just getting into software development okay do not make the mistake of for example don't not doing practice problems not doing algorithms so use things like hacker rank okay use things like lead code right all these different all these different solutions right are going to be a really great way for you to practice and you should be doing at least once one a week yes and guys this isn't like your history class back in high school where you just memorize something for one class you could forget it for the rest of your life these are things that you're just gonna have to revisit time and time again as you become a developer and that's what we're saying just keep practicing it's not like you'll learn it and you're done it's learn it and keep on learning it keep improving and keep practicing it and keep making it better because after that once you've gotten to that point you're going to do the same thing you're just going to keep applying four jobs yeah and now guys i do want to say for those of you who felt like maybe the 20 hours a week wasn't something that is not doable this is the tip for you guys you could still find 30 minutes to one hour day so for those of you who didn't raise your hand when nas asked do you have 20 to 30 hours a week to dedicate to programming my question to you is do you have five to seven hours a week to dedicate to programming yes and also if the answer is still no then you're just not serious about it exactly it's as simple as that guys because anyone can find five times anybody hours in a week i don't care how busy you are you could find five to seven hours a week yes to put into building your dreams yes so guys okay okay i want to kind of go because we're going to go to this really quickly at this point but i want to go over a little bit of fundamental side because i want to give you some really really good value here fundamentals portion here okay these fundamentals okay when i say fundamentals what the [ __ ] are those what are fundamentals let's let's go to this really quickly with me so fundamentals what are the things that need to lower fundamentals here david not david daniel tell me yeah not david daniels better well a fundamental could be something as simple as how do i even do a data structure i was going to go function but you start typing data structure i love that so before i get into data structure like how do i even write a function how do i even create classes and call other classes and do basic stuff when it comes to objectoriented programming right yes writing class creating all that good stuff now from there i think the next fundamentals you want to make sure you understand are just different types of data structures right other than just an array other than just a dictionary or an object in javascript what is a linked list what is a stack what is a queue what's a graph what's a tree what are all these different data structures that you can do right so all those would fall into data structures the reason is they're just different ways of storing data different structures in which you can store data that's why they're called data structures yeah yeah yeah yeah so linked lists cues trees for example all the graphs stacks right stacks okay graphs right stacks okay i'll say graphs right all of these are structures that you need to know and please please please do not wait till the end of your learning uh opportunity of your learning kind of journey to don't wait until the end to when you start interviewing then you start learning cues no that's not a good way you should be starting learning right now like right [ __ ] now when you get off this call everybody right now should start learning all these fundamentals linked lists cues trees because these ones they build what they build something called a problemsolving mind guide guys problem solving mind this is what i like to think about okay a problemsolving mind that's the whole goal that that they teach you okay because like if you understand okay for example right if you can for example here it's just an example here okay i have this for example you know this array of things right well okay let's think about this okay let's think about the if i have okay um let me do this oh no w here so let's think about this let's say i have a um well okay here's how about this you you know how you guys have search or what is this oh this is okay that's an interesting one okay you know you guys have uh search in google right you guys know that everybody can raise your hand if you know search and google yes yes yes everybody raise your hand yeah good right you know when you type in things like for example car it gives a suggestion underneath like for example maybe carpet maybe something else it gives you suggestions like autofill world autofill what is it called autocomplete autocomplete autocomplete everybody know that yes right how the [ __ ] do you think it happens how does that work that work right how does that work well that's a good question right how does the article work on google for example again right well it works because of you know what because of this it works because of something called a tree it's actually called a tri tree try tree try tree this is a data structure a tree structure basically that what it goes ahead is it's very fast at being able to predict exactly exactly what you what suggestions to give to you here yeah because think about it if you were trying to create this autocomplete you can't just put all these different words into yeah into an array yeah and that would be like a huge array that would be very millions of words exactly so a tragedy is just structured in the way that you can actually easily figure out the words that can come after a specific uh prefix that you put so if you put ca then car can show up because of the try tree and i don't want to get get too technical with it but for example a tree tri tree looks a little bit like this for example you have c here a here and there's and there's different words that branch out from here you see there's different words that branch out from here kind of like yeah so this is like really geeky nerdy stuff that we love to get into but it's not worth getting to right now it's just worth knowing yes that you have to master data structures because that's how you're gonna start to solve does everybody does everybody understand this right now yes or no raise your hand yes yes everybody good good good good awesome okay cool cool so sweet cool guys now for those hold on hold on can't talk um so we got that portion okay let's go ahead and move on to the next portion i will go ahead and remove this okay next up so just a little bit of a story kind of about me so it's better to make some progress than probably no products at all of course that makes sense yeah so so let's actually talk about what some of these people are actually looking for right yeah you can see here for example they're looking for things like you know expert html css they're looking for understanding of engineering principles right agile sort of development all these different things communication skills very big problem solving skills look at that right there problem solving skills that's just right there right it shows it right there that's exactly what you need same thing here all right same thing here because if you want those jobs guys i know it might be intimidating when you see this big big list of all these different things but it just comes down to these fundamental things that we've talked about which is the problem solving skills making sure you could actually build a integrated app from the front end to the back end and just having that experience there because you know if you send in that application people sometimes get scared like oh there's too many things and not only that something we want to talk about is the experience now yes the experience they always say here five years but this right here here's what i say to that here's what i said that you're ready for this here's what i say to that i say this whoa all right there we go that's spelled better [Laughter] here's what i said that did that they always say five years and [ __ ] like that but trust me that's not what they necessarily look for they are very because it's number one it's hard to get developers at that specific point right and developers are like like not someone who you need five years to be a pro developer you can have six months you can be one year into it and already be a good developer right depending on how much how much you put into it that's why right here right for at least five years like the five year aspect is not the most important part you will still apply to these specific jobs even so you understand that guys comprende with me sending those applications we're going to send those applications regardless comprende exactly good good thumbs up give me a thumbs up yes thumbs up good awesome so as we mentioned guys it doesn't matter what it says just send it in anyways i mean if you're really not qualified in terms of years they'll just not approve who cares send more applications time and time and time again now let's go ahead and dive in into what are some of the things that you have to learn other than just the technical stuff and that is going to be the soft skills how do you actually behave like a person how do you actually show up how do you connect with them how to become someone that they actually want to hire when they're interviewing you how do you answer their specific questions right because we've actually started to look into what are the things that someone is looking for specifically a company and uh can we actually show this next slide of course because in this next slide we're gonna dive deep into the things that you have to do so guys take a screenshot of this take out notebook i don't know whatever is faster for you probably the screenshot look at this stuff because these are the things that people are actually looking for and nas even has a little bit of more insight as well but here when it just comes to generally hiring they want to see that you're coachable that you're willing to learn they want to see that you're emotionally intelligent you're not just like reactive to everything you could have your emotions under control you'd be stable you could be stable you can empathize with other people you could be a regular human being that's what we'll call emotional intelligence being a regular human being you're motivated to do stuff by yourself i think that's a very huge part right you're proactive don't just wait for [ __ ] to just come to you right you motivate to do it by yourself you take initiative this is a very very important aspect of any job and that and if you for example at a job if you want to go ahead and grow grow quickly meaning you want to be able to get those new opportunities you want to be able to uh potentially write make more money right make more money right you have to be able to right have the motivation to take initiative by yourself to take the question by yourself comprende yes or no one who somebody's playing david commute whoever huh all right i think he got muted okay you got him got him cool thank you david okay cool awesome so let's go ahead and keep going all right so next up so all those okay what soft skills does developer need like i said you know very important develop soft skills okay you need to be again you can that's what's up coachable i need to be someone who most importantly communicative when i say communicative what i mean by that i mean someone who does not hide themselves does not hide their problems if you have an issue that at hand you communicated that to the whole team that is the big goal guys now before you go on to the next slide nas nas is about to drop some real secret sauce here because nas got to talk to a recruiter oh yeah right a google record and and ask the recruiter what are you looking for now as a developer as well because this was more general like what do people want so take out the pen notebook make sure if you haven't been taking notes i don't know what you've been doing this whole time but nas drop that knowledge on what the google recruiter was looking for what are the soft skills that people really need to work on yeah so i talked with the google recruiter i had a conversation with them and look at this check this out on christian make sure hey guys please make sure to meet your mics thank you so i had a conversation with a google recruiter and what they literally told us because again because we had this boot camp right and we were kind of we're talking with them you know about potential you know opportunities there so right so google recruiter google google recruiter right here okay here's they told me they told me three simple things one one they are looking for great problem solvers why does it keep not showing hold on freeze mode oh freeze mode on there we go google recruiter yep recruiter okay right so they talked about for example like i said they talked about things like okay you need to be someone who is a great problem solver you need to be someone who crazy enough actually can do clean code clean code they mentioned that which is really interesting clean code right here clean code and they also mention the fact that they look for people who are actually have great eq they are great to work with because would you agree with me who here wants to work with an [ __ ] try youtube what are you doing right great to work with right and that's what they look for it's it's these three things when they talk and i could mention it to them they look for that really really importantly you know yes exactly guys and again you want to make sure that this is coming from a google recruiter right yes so take that into consideration take that into note because we want to see what are the things are going to make a sixfigure developer specifically right we already talked about a lot of these things but what are these qualities now what are we going to do so think about this resourceful analytical skills knowledgeable in technologies great communicator right team player problem solver screenshot this will move on okay screenshot this right now guys everybody next we have an amazing thing where nas is gonna break down for you how you can reverse engineer becoming that six figure developer yes and nas is gonna break down a specific story that he knows about very well so how i'm how i made 300 000 as a javascript developer personally in in the past three years guys that has been an amazing experience for me um it's been a difficult experience it's been a long journey but we got here now okay here are some examples of just my kind of letters that i got from companies right in terms of like what i got the jobs that i got so things like that let me go ahead and take a look at this you can see here for example this was i was i made nineteen thousand dollars almost twenty thousand dollars as my first job right here uh making twenty ninety per hour so this wasn't too bad this was my first uh developer job at the company called urban science and then after that after this internship they actually offered me a fulltime job for 65k now i did not actually take that job i actually took a job where at a company called service.com and then because they offered me 70k right away right away kind of after college right away right after i learned basically um after i learned you know coding but the crazy part is that i didn't learn coding through college i actually learned coding through a company through a do i have it on here or no oh there i actually learned coding guys because i joined a startup called trandala this is a startup i joined completely for free basically i was working for free for about almost a year and a half with this company you can see me right here right this is me right here oh no oh hold on this is me right here right and this is my friend steve this is robert and this is my friend case the case right now is a full developer currently in mexico the guy i talked about before actually so he's doing great but these guys i work with them together and i'm like listen guys hey i want to go ahead and i want to help you guys out i don't have much experience but there's any way that i can contribute right i would love to contribute i really appreciate this and so crazy enough they gave me like a way for me to they tested me out by giving me a project so they gave me a project to do like they gave me like a you know scraper project project and i had to do it i didn't know how to scrape i didn't know python had anything at all and so but in two days i stayed up till like middle of the night and i actually went ahead and you know create a project with a scraper and then next to you know i'm working with these people and here is where i learned everything between communication right communication between right i had them as mentors right they were such amazing mentors for me it was insane with communication they taught me project management right right they taught me today hey joseph here please make sure to meet yourself thank you they taught me things like you know front development front end coding right front end not front end the front end right all these different things is where i learned development right there right they taught me full stack right so robert right here on the lefthand side he actually is a great guy he knows backing up a very just very please mute yourself thank you for development i learned from them so not only i have great mentors but i just learned a lot from a company and crazy enough look at this oh my god guys come on crazy enough here uh but this is when we launched our application called shandala uh we actually bought tshirts and we look at this we were outside we were actually making uh tshirts outside by hand by ourselves because we could not afford to buy tshirts normally so literally 200 tshirts came and we made like like literally for for the whole day straight it was [ __ ] insane this is the app to be built called trandala kinda looks like tinder but it's centered for clothing so how cool is that by the way it looks that was pretty cool super cool man how does that look guys no this was built without web technology by the way with webtech yeah i want to download it oh it's not live anymore it's bangkok this is a company i worked with stores.com these guys went bankrupt later on that's a whole that's a whole different story don't worry about that just yet yeah but basically you know i i had a job with this service.com at this company and i and i didn't like it you know i wasn't too happy with it but what i'm doing is i end up taking a risk and i end up actually quitting and i was like i'm out peace out and i was so crazy enough to where my boss literally came in to you know came to me and said you know what i i hear let me tell you this he's like he's like this is serious so he's like he's like man i'm gonna tell you this as a as a father i'm telling you this as a as a as a friend as a financial advisor and as an employer your [ __ ] nuts your [ __ ] us your [ __ ] nuts and your [ __ ] nuts that's like four [ __ ] nuts or four or three times i'm gonna tell you man or something right he didn't want me quit and he said that was stupid for quitting because i was making pretty good money there but the issue was not the money the issue was that i just didn't enjoy it that was a big issue right so uh i know quitting in any way it's not i'm doing freelancing and because i quit guys because i quit i am where i am today i took that risk crazy enough i quit at a point in time where that company was actually succeeding yeah that company was actually about to buy out a company called sears and if they bought them out fully i would have been basically a millionaire because i had shares in the company but at that point in time i just said no so how crazy is that to be able to turn down money like that huh but crazy enough they actually didn't get by the house and they went bankrupt so there you go and now now it has a tesla let's go and this is this was after we go ahead we went ahead and uh you know i quit my job didn't like it i started freelancing [ __ ] got a lot more serious i had to get a lot more serious uh you know had to make some nice pictures so there we go so let's talk results right we had for example you know just just like how i did it right we teach other people to do it in the same format right in the same way just from my experience from god's experience and so forth so people like frank who landed their job making 170k uh contract uh you know at sonos we had daniel not daniel devin who got a sixfigure developer job at paypal also making our six figures right we have people like for example rishi he's making 50k misha's actually on here maybe she'll say hi he actually had and he got into a ship as a bigger developer making at least 50k right now and it's crazy right we also have kevin here kelvin kelvin he made his he got into shift from making 52k so it's pretty insane guys well we've been able to transform and bradfield here as well so guys so many so many so many so many success stories it's insane so how how can we take it even further guys that's the question we want to ask right how can we take this event further right well check this out how can i do it the thing is right when we realize this kind of stuff and we realize the issue that there isn't in the developer world there's a huge issue the issue is that a lot of people get into this they have no idea how to connect this that's part one they are lost would you agree with me that you're lost raise your hand if you're if you feel something you're lost you don't know where to get started raise your hand raise your hand raise your hand like if you feel like there's so much out there to learn that you're not sure exactly what to start out with right there we go beautiful right so awesome and we realized that there's not a lot of good resources out there to teach people that right that's another big thing and realize that a lot of people they'll they'll go they'll go to tutorials to go to all these different things but the issue is that they can't code that's the big issue then we also realize that bootcamp these coding bootcamps that are out there in the world right they also can't teach people for [ __ ] either there's no problems people aren't learning and people aren't being taught properly exactly so there's a lot and this is why we've decided because we've been doing this for quite a while we have a different format that we want we want to use we decided to start our own coding bootcamp and this and has been an amazing experience so i kind of want to introduce to you something interesting you might have heard about this if not then check this out because we ourselves have launched a full stack mastery boot camp a couple months ago and that has been a game changer guys this is something that we've been working on for a real long time for developers because we are here to transform we are here to transform people's lives to become developers right in the right way in the right way not in a way where you just make a lot of amazing projects on your portfolio but in a way where you actually learn how to be a coder that's where you actually actually understand to be a coder and we actually have some few students here from from the boot camp who are actually let me see we have ankh for example on his here we have eric martin they're here from the boot camp and they can have tested what the what how that experience has been for them so for example on can you speak for a little bit kind of a little bit about what has your experience been in this bootcamp so far he is part of the first cohort back in january um so let's just speak a little bit about that and we'll see what we got so he's only been here for a little not even two months yet just a month and a half yeah pretty much yeah yeah so how's it been it's been great it's challenging it's fun and i've well i've been through another boot camp but it was nothing like this one this one the instructors actually care that they actually call you out but they mean that they care about what you're learning like i think last week daniel was like helping me through uh stack and then he didn't give up so my own instructor if i didn't get it he'd just move on because that's just taking out his time and then the classes time yeah but for an hour and a half daniel was on my ass about getting the stacks down let's go there yo and then he'll give me like a 20 minute break and then he gets on my ass again so it's sometimes some people take that as like bad but at the same time these two instructors right here like they want you to succeed yeah yeah and if you don't succeed they're going to make sure that the whole class knows so the host class will help you and if you're not in your game we're going gonna be on your ass that's what we're gonna do right so it's not just me and daniel it's me daniel jesse lamb it's david right there's so many so many amazing structures we have in this boot camp and we we what is a different thing do you think we focus on differently than anything anywhere else uh so it's you're focusing on more about algorithms and like data structures where my last boot camp we didn't really focus on that until the end of the bootcamp where we worried about framework yeah and then like something that you don't really need to get into interview because my last bootcamp is basically taught as frameworks but when you go to interview i'm not going to build a website for them they're going to ask me like how can you problem solve this could you do this yeah give me like and talked like there's no communication skills that you can learn at a boot camp it's everyone it's basically everyone for themselves and then if you can learn or not it depends on you but we just got 13k from you and that's it you pay 13k you build some beautiful projects but you can't get a job i cannot i got two interviews because of the name of the university of washington and then they had reference for that but when i was in the interview for one of her expedia they asked me could you make me a recursion function i was like i've never heard of that before but this this yeah this boot camp we learned recursion for like a week and a half yeah two weeks yeah and now on would have been able to write 10 recursive functions in front of her first thing last out baby let's go so you can see right that's the big thing that we have differently here is you know we are very much tied to the results that you get that's that is our main focus my main focus is i want you to [ __ ] know what you're talking about if you don't [ __ ] know what you're talking about i will be on your ass right that's the thing right honestly like for example when he sometimes misses class i'll be like ankh what the [ __ ] are you doing come in here or like when somebody misses class otherwise everybody else will be actually in slack inside will be typing where are you brad where are you where are you come on let's go let's go and so it's like a this amazing community of people helping each other out and they're just there you know that's the cool part about this and i'm pumped because i know that at the end of this i will push on so hard maybe to a point of crying right but he will thank me later and thank us later because he'll get the job and i do have some good news too what tell me i have an interview for internship on monday at gravity pavement all right hold on wait this monday which monday like this monday monday tomorrow tomorrow bro tomorrow hi bro bro do you know that it's gravity payment right for dan price yeah yeah you know that's 70k minimum yeah are you serious yeah i think out there right now ceo he was making millions of dollars a year but instead of taking the millions he split away minimum wage for her salary for each employee is 70k and he only makes 70k just like his employees that's [ __ ] from seattle so i was like i'm gonna work there that's okay i can get coffee or clean floors i'm gonna work there that's fun that's gonna be fun awesome good luck on the interview man okay good luck you're gonna kill it okay awesome awesome man now one final thing on for anyone who is thinking about full stack mastery bootcamp what words you got for them man do it do it i almost quit coding because of my last boot camp i spent three hours with nas in a workshop and he made me like love coding again that's amazing do it don't don't be scared just do it and like and even like for example on he didn't have the money initially to kind of to actually put put down the down payment for him but like frankie in here by the way say hi frankie hi frankie hi frankie yo on your frankie's favorite man he loves you so much here he is yo what's up man i don't know my favorite but you're really cool bro no i'm kidding okay i love you i love you how's it going i'm good good good he he's the one him and he was probably my favorite folk you know favorite instructor wait what nah not nice but frankie gave me like when i first started out with this boot camp i didn't know i was gonna do it i wanted to do it i wanted to learn from these instructors i wanted to be a part of this group but i had 17 in my bank account yeah frankie told me his story of how he started with this team and then i took and then he told me he gives me a week to come at least with a down payment or or anything even 100 200 but then you have to work your ass off yeah at that time i was working amazon flex so he's like you can do it just work six or seven times a shift per week you can probably pay it off yeah so i took i took my pride out the way i never asked to borrow money but i asked my brother and my brother goes when do you need the money by so by the by mid i think it was like thursday or friday i texted frankie it's like i have the down payment and then and after i get my tax return i pay off school deal with it that's [ __ ] amazing dude that's amazing that's the thing you know sometimes we forget that it just takes a risk you know you have to take that risk you have to kind of like take that leap of faith obviously backed up by data right like it's not like you're just taking a leap of faith into something that you're not that you don't expect to get any returns right yeah but at the same time it's that little push and sometimes when you're stuck in patterns of like not taking risk somebody else that's used to that type of pattern has to like push you to like you know that's that's the same reason i pushed on i'm like hey man i don't know if you're saying the truth but i was in a similar situation and if you're real and if you're not lying to me right now reach out to me in a week and then there i feel like i'm gonna you know it's not gonna be easy i'm not saying that this is a magic pill we're gonna push you a lot but if you're real you're gonna put down money because that's the only way that you're gonna take this seriously that's the only way that you're gonna respect this now you're here man now you have an interview tomorrow that's it's amazing gig so that's gold man am i pumped for this guy that's gonna be amazing dude i'm so awesome this is so awesome man on thank you so much for hopping on man so appreciate you so before we go on to more people knows let's tell people what full stack mastery is right because we introduced it we talked to on people are probably excited about it can we pull up the sledge real quick all right while he's figuring out to pull out the slides right you might be wondering so what is full stack mastery what is even the purpose of this so the purpose of uh i got it i gotta get i got i gotta get it i got it okay so the purpose of full stack mastery boot camp is again to help you to become that full stack developer right we talked about the roadmap you've taken notes on the roadmap but here we're going to hold you by the hand and take you step by step so what does that look like so if you want to this is right this is for those people who want to switch to a career developer for example you know maybe for example marek right your goal is to go from truck driving right to become a foster developer this is what this is for right it's exactly there to kind of handhold you from zero to becoming the full star developer right or for you to not to either get a remote job as a developer or to even to freelance if that's something that's your thing right right that's the goal right and the goal for us is to be able to to have you land your dream job as a developer freelance fulltime doesn't matter right that is where we want to go take you to right now here's some epic coaches we have lam right here we have qazi right here we have nas which is me of course uh right there right we have daniel this great guy right here on the right hand side right we also have people like for example let me see right dave racosa he's in the house and jesse of course amazing jessie is i'm not sure if she's here in this in this current call but um she's amazing too and she's coaching you guys so we have cf six teachers guys six teachers to be there to guide you and to handle you the whole time now let's look at this right so how many of you have attended boot camp before raise your hand anybody anybody attend the bootcamp so of course anybody else and martin anybody else that's pretty much just that's fine that's fine so then nick and nick as well so seriously here's the thing and who and i'm not getting the job just yet raise your hand i know like for example i did not right so i did not right and then the same thing with anthony anthony and nick oh [ __ ] but doing anthony guys turn on your cameras i want to see i want you guys are raising your hands but i can't see your faces we want to see your faces so guys you guys are not alone naz go to the next slide and it's cause you see in the slide guys what you'll notice is that there's a lot of people who have gone through boot camps and they just didn't sufficiently learn what they needed to learn so that they can actually get the job so you know similar to like how onset is he went to this boot camp and he wasn't able to learn a job because he didn't learn the right fundamental skills and that's why we're enforcing those and that's why we're emphasizing those right so what is full stack master okay it was pretty much pretty much your thanos okay uh this is for thanos before full state mastery and this is right here so here's what you guys get with foster master you get four cultural goals per week right you get six of the best coaches right here you get things like the best curriculum right the curriculum that's made to to take you to a first developer not just record that's going to how on has on has said that this curriculum will just build nice projects for you no this curriculum will teach you the fundamentals we'll teach you how to become a proper developer right right you get daily homework and challenges you get feedback and reviews right all that is what you get in this bootcamp it's so oneonone it's so personal right on top of that one thing one time one thing we didn't mention is on top of that you also get things like for example right we have twice a week we get things like you know uh calls with students so for example you know just homework calls right home coaching calls right homework coaching calls and this is where you get on with the students and you actually get to get to speak about the homework and you get to do other things so all these things guys are gonna be able to help you improve help you learn we need to learn guide you hand by hand because we also have oneonone coaching oneonone coaching guys i mean if joshua mentioned this last time it's not even oneonone coaching it's like fiveonone coaching because all the coaches will get on your butt to make sure that you're doing what you need to do exactly i don't think josh was here but he mentioned that last time and guidance from the best teachers because that's literally all we have here at cleverprogrammer an access to recruit now so one really cool thing is we're about to partner up with a recruiting network called premiere and these guys will come in they'll teach you how to build your linkedin how do you how to build your resume right and they will teach you and they'll give you

that's the link you want to go to right now yep there go oh got it beautiful beautiful beautiful you all forgot and everybody else okay so here's what you guys go ahead and sign up right now okay apply for this boot camp right now okay let me know who's applying who's applying here who's applying marek is applying anthony is applying olfa is applying actually or elliot is already in it hell yeah yeah you don't have to apply anymore so what we're doing right now is we're collecting students for our march cohort again this is a very exclusive right this is a very exclusive um or is it called but it's a very exclusive exclusive exclusive cohort right where we try to limit people for between 15 to 20 people max and the only reason being is because we want to go ahead and make sure to give you as much time as much attention as possible right attention as possible right that's the whole goal with us right attention as possible right this is what we do right right so guys apply for the korean bootcamp the thai problem is right there raise your hand if you're currently applying anthony are you applying yes or no yes so now let's quickly dive into some of these technical skill sets that they're going to be able to learn right what are the things so while you guys are applying if you are are you guys raising your hands because you have a question are you raising your hand because you're applying i hope it's because they're playing yeah marek are you applying beautiful anthony you're replying yes i'm applying but i also have a question go ahead what's your question anthony well i i will admit i'm i'm having some reservations in terms that well i've been part of the clever programming team since like 2019. yeah yeah and i've been sending out applications like crazy since then i could literally tell you i've sent close to like 100 200 applications but i guess because of my location i keep getting rejected where are you at i'm in nigeria oh i see yes yes yes yes yes so it's kind of very frustrating to kind of want to sign up for another bootcamp when like the last one hasn't really worked out well gosh i got i mean i understand right like i can't i can't what i don't think i can tell you pretty much uh pretty much anthony is you know it all depends on how you're being led right it depends on how you're being led right to get that job right because the other book might not have gotten you what you wanted right but doesn't mean that your next experience is your next potential your next potential uh what's it called opportunities will not get you there right you might be missing something might be missing the fundamentals you might be missing that initial first step because in the day i know you're nigeria but even if you're nigeria you can prove to other people what you can do by having the right skill sets right by having the right fundamentals like if i told you right now anthony can you build me a react gs project from scratch right now buy yourself fully can you do that for me yeah from zero portfolio we react no no i'm not saying that you you you went to a tutorial and you copied it i'm saying if i told you right now i started playing yeah i need follower tutorial i wanted to build out myself i wrote the css myself the responsiveness i read everything myself just to prove to myself that i could do it yeah and because i came from like a net background so i've been writing that for like a while now so i branched into react yeah so there's a lot there's a lot of things that might be working here there's a lot of things might be working here right right we have calvin actually who is for example i'll i'll tell you david here posted calvin is actually from nigeria the guy we just we talked about in a little bit right he's from the jury yet he got internship landed in bank of america right so it's possible it's possible anthony right you just number one have to potentially apply more we have david here applied to 500 companies not 200 500 companies right so you just have to keep trying keep trying keep trying you only need one opportunity you understand that so i don't want you to be down by that number one i want you to be down down around that i want you to more so be excited about that it's like you know what i'm not getting it right maybe it's a problem with your resume for example i don't know for example are you in pwg anthony yeah i've been power pw send me send me send me your send me your resume i'll take a look at it later all right i want to take a look at it okay but you have to apply nah i'll technically i'll i'll take a look at it anyways no matter if you apply or not doesn't matter right i'll take a look at another case no i've already i'm already applying actually that's awesome yeah so i'll take a look at your resume but that might be your your big issue that you're having right guys so that's the thing okay cool so cool awesome let's go keep going so now uh let's see for now okay so also one other thing that again you could say is again the boot camp will also have an amazing retreat where you will actually come in like for example to la we'll have a retreat with all you guys will come in and you guys to get the chat and we'll have a nice conference it'll be amazing right so here's the technical skills that you will get to learn in here front end html css javascript gs backing apis node.js express mongodb postgresql database design everything need to know to become a foster developer but also git wireframe firebase and a lot more most importantly you will learn here that you will learn the fundamentals right that's what you will learn here the mostly right you will learn all those data structures that we talked about right all those data structures that we talked about just with us you will learn the fundamentals right you will learn data structures data structures right you will learn how to become a problem solver we focus for the first two months guys we focus fully on just problem solving just problem solving and that's it right just problem solving and that's pretty much it that way you have a proper foundation of what it means to become a developer and you can solve any problem it's a hand when you go out there and interview for other jobs that's an issue that a lot of companies actually have or a lot of people have is they they get an interview and they can't go through it because you just can't problem solve like would you even that's one of the biggest issues yes or no so just out guys we have one of well yeah and then of course after the full stack mastery you get to be a thanos that looks like a little bit like this guys with all the all the frameworks all the languages with react.js with kid with node.js with javascript and that looks pretty insane how cool does that look guys huh that's pretty intense hey there we go so guys we actually have for example eric who is in the camp so here can you go uh can you go ahead and speak a little about the boot camp and uh how's your experience been so far here yeah definitely i'm sorry i i know this is a silly question what else would be like do we get one of those gauntlets when we don't when we're done because that would be do you want to do you want to even if it was just like plastic like be like oh look what i got from my bootcamp well basically we actually put the full well what you will get though is we'll have shirts for sure but something something like that we'll have shirts for you guys when you guys graduate um so yeah i think it's easier if i just kind of give a little bit of a background on myself so i am in the last semester of an associate's degree for computer programming and development yeah um but all the way up until covid i was you know restaurant worker service industry bartender stuff like that so i have absolutely no experience um in it and as far as school goes they didn't have any real world projects so starting probably about six months ago i started applying for jobs because that's kind of what my school said and i didn't do any like 200 or anything but i applied to probably 40 or 50 all the answers were no no so um i actually about yeah this monday i'll be starting uh week three of an apprenticeship oh let's go and i i actually got it based on um projects that we did in the first couple of weeks with this boot camp i was able to show them like the html and css skills that i had and stuff that we did and they were like wow that's really cool that's actually something that we could use and then i explained to them like the terminology that i was able to learn and the problem solving that i was able to learn that school didn't do was also they were able to realize that i am going to be getting to a point where they can really utilize me yeah so that was that was another key factor as to why they were like yeah we want to get you on board because you'll get based on what you told us you're learning in this boot camp you'll get to a point where we watch you as one of our main developers and i was like sweet and you didn't even finish this this is only two months in man yeah exactly and that's what i'm saying it was based on like school they don't they don't really do projects like they teach you that stuff but it's a lot of theory and there's not like explanations as to why you're doing stuff or why you need to learn things as opposed to you guys make it very understood that you're you're learning this in a real world scenario like you're going to use this for xyz when you get into work and you're learning this because you need to know it for building this or how you can build that and so it was very it's definitely helpful just to like from my end to know why i'm learning something yeah and to feel like okay i'm actually going to use this it's actually going to be valuable to me as opposed to sometimes in school you know somebody says here learn this you're like why what's it going to do for me i don't know what's the point i'm wasting my time and i never feel like i'm wasting any of my time in this that's amazing and another huge part i think um totally totally separate from like the actual code but it's like a it's like almost like a family like once you get into it um kind of like uh like onset and stuff you we do like side um in between the coaching calls we do the homework sessions and it's like i went on a couple of them and it's really cool to have interactions with with people like that and for like almost an hour there was five or six of us we weren't even talking code we were just asking each other like personal information and getting to know each other and that was really cool too to have that kind of tightknit community of a boot camp yeah that's everything that's amazing i'm very happy to see the community and the cool thing is because we're so nitpicky about the people like for those of you who apply just so you guys know we won't pick everyone okay we are very picky about people we're very picky about the energy you bring about how dedicated you are if you're not dedicated i'm sorry we won't pick you right you have to be a dedicated person this is a very exclusive program okay because the other day dedicated people get what dedicated people get results and we are only looking to get results we're only looking to give you results that's where our goal is okay and so if you're not a kid i'm sorry it's not going to happen right but but because of that because we are so such a tightknit community with so much greater energy that creates a community of like where everybody pushes each other to do just their best and to do better right there's always there's not literally not one person who has better energy in there there's not one person who has bad energy everybody is there motivated they want to become developers and they're doing crazy [ __ ] to do it to get there yeah guys so if you are interested in being part of this community right now you're on the zoom call make sure to click the link below because this application will be closing at the end of this call just to make sure that everyone who's

what are you going to be able to fundamentals you'll master the problemsolving skills you master the technical skills you master the communication skills we literally in our coaching calls guys we literally go ahead and we have you speak about your right explain your code every single time that way you match the proper communication skills when you go ahead and go to an interview right okay you master your mindset right a lot of people are stuck with the imposter syndrome mindset we [ __ ] kill that [ __ ] or we try to kill that [ __ ] it doesn't exist it doesn't exist i mean exist still very minimal yeah we try to kill that right we have coaching calls unjust mindset that's the whole goal right awesome when you in your master app clips that's that's a very important part mastering algorithms okay so this is the beautiful community that we have right now look at that everyone engaged eric throwing up the peace signs drinking water at the same time staying hydrated and learning code but this is the amazing community that you're going to be able to be a part of and see you know everyone there is excited to be there clyde nate nate wait is nate not here i think nate is on oh nate is out here let's go nate actually did not want to was not about to join he actually had a conversation with his parents and he was like nah man sorry i can't join i'm like what the [ __ ] did you say take some [ __ ] responsibility nate and he did and now he's in here and now he's gonna kill him and then he's gonna go and then he's going to go to his parents and be like yo guys check this out you told me no but i did it anyways and i [ __ ] got a job so there you go let's get it let's get it awesome cool so this is joshua gianna robin so many amazing people on you can see right here and you can see we're going through code right together right together we are learning through code we are explaining robin here for example is explaining her contrast of what she did and why she did it right again it's all about practicing your communication skills that you need to get so much better at okay so phase one fundamentals okay you get all you get to learn lead code from hackering you get to learn problem solving and algorithms okay phase two front end you'll get to learn things like html css to yes git github literally the roadmap we gave you is mapped out to the exact structure that's give you that roadmap because we realize this is what people need exactly backhand right you'll get to learn things like poster project guitar mongodb postcard sequence especially as and also even for example my sequel that's another big one right so my sequel my sequel that's another thing you mentioned you're going to learn okay next up capstone project really cool what we have guys for you is we're going to have people lined up clients actual real clients or the real ideas but the way i got one one more person yesterday by the way too lined up so now we have one more person as well so we're gonna have clients lined up and teams from our boot camp will pick a client and they will work with them directly for the next month or two and they will learn things like you they will learn things like for example you know you know client management skills right this will be as real world as possible right exactly all right there was a real claim management skills project management and so forth and teammate and team skills as well and team skills [ __ ] you don't get anywhere else exactly so if you want to just go to that next page because that's all the exact same things that we have there so we'll have your client might be me but in this case noz got other clients and you're going to be able to go into teams of people you're going to work on this for some time you're going to meet with your clients you're going to have some guidance from your coaches and as nas mentioned before you're going to start to pick out some of these skills that we talked about which is client management project management even learning how to do scrum use trello or jira just to be able to manage your projects you will have meetings with your client on a regular basis you will have many checkpoints it will be and you of course you'll be guided by us the coaches who know what we're doing because we've done this before right so this is the big difference between so many other boot camps and so many other even like universities right we do this kind of stuff and learn these skills is so important right client management right project management scrum trello jira all those phase five is finally land your dream job let's go this is where you will come in and you will come in and you will be uh premier our our recruiting partner will come in and they will actually go ahead and kind of help you out they will go ahead and show you basically you know your linkedin how to do your linkedin how to probably do your resume how to properly apply right and of course of course they will do mock interviews with you of those things and then finally they will go ahead and finally um and they'll put you into their machine into their kind of what's it called dashboard to the dashboard where you'll go ahead and uh you know apply for the companies with hundreds of companies that they have so it's a pretty cool you're pretty much kind of guaranteed a job right right if you put in the work of course you know right of course you're typing the work but still that's the whole goal guys look at this resume linkedin interview prep mock interviews how to apply kind of building and so much more so what would it be worth to you if you can become that full stack developer if you could be able to switch your career if you can start to work remotely like how if you could be making 70 to 80k yeah per year all these amazing things what would that be worth to you will be worth to you tell me guys who could tell me marek what do you think you're a mute ah i mean it's priceless prices why tell me why um i mean these these skills set you up for life right that's true that's true for life pretty much right because what but give me like a number for example how much do you think would be worth for you like if you can land a 80 000 job how much do you think that'd be worth to you ah say uh 5k 5k so basically it's only 5k for you to be able to land a thousand dollar job it'll be worth the investment okay okay okay okay okay interesting so what if for example how much university costs for example oh man you're talking you tell me how much i pay for my masters right now yeah yeah yeah uh it's two thousand dollars of course okay of course how many cars are you taking i take one at a time okay so how much have you paid so far how much you can going to pay in the end i pay last year i ended up paying a little bit over ten thousand ten thousand okay you paid ten thousand dollars right there and you're about to pay more two thousand more correct uh like another ten another ten so twenty thousand so there you go now is that 20 thousand dollars worse to you potentially potentially but you don't seem so confident from a masters no but for this i would i would pay anything just to get the fundamentals and everything down so you see that's where that's such a big difference is i love them eric right so look at this guys okay right flat iron school all these other boot camps we've researched all these other books in terms of what they do they are in school fifteen thousand dollars hack reactor eighteen thousand dollars app academy five thousand dollars to do that do some [ __ ] with eighteen percent i'm not sure what that exactly that is lando school thirty thousand and at thirty thousand dollars they also have fifteen thousand option as well so there are fifteen thousand dollars and thirty thousand dollars as well okay okay so this is what what they get so let's not think about this okay now college degree on average sixty seven thousand dollars you'll be paying for on average wow that's [ __ ] insane but it's all worth it because of course if you can get a job as a developer right and the end of this making 80k and then it will serve you for the rest of your life right that's it the first year what the first two you get eighty thousand dollars the second year you get ninety thousand dollars third year 100 and so forth and so forth and now it stacks up like not like nothing right this is where the big difference is so this this is where now we commit right we're like okay this is interesting what can we do now for you guys what can we do for our amazing pdwg students right camera phone no camera's still because it's so good yeah right right is becoming a developer worth worth that money right is it worth the 67 or the 20 thousand dollars so far for you mark is it worth that yes yes right just a 20 000 so okay now guys here's the thing so who now here's the deal okay today alfossa mastery cost fifteen thousand dollars for the sixth to seventh month program today right now let me ask this question with all that you get is that it's even just that is that worth it tell me is that worth a marek yeah yeah but here's the thing it gets even better because pwg students the pwp students right you guys have gained our right you guys have our trust right you guys are more dedicated now what we do is we actually knock off from fifteen thousand dollars to actually ten thousand dollars for pwg and profit with python students so only for pwg five plus two is only exclusively for you guys nobody else gets this not on youtube no nobody else you guys get a ten thousand dollar program is that worth it to you marek yes sir yes sir right now here's the thing right remember what you get four coaching costs per week six of the best coaches the best curriculum daily homework and challenges feedback and support so the best coaches the best curriculum four coaching costs per week oneonone coaching right it is [ __ ] insane right you get to learn the fundamentals you get to master your communication skills you get to master your mindset skills you get to master the fundamentals you get to master problem solving is that worth it to you guys yes or no raise your hand raise your hand that's worth it raise your hand there you go beautiful there you go beautiful right so here's the thing but we are not done yet guys we're not done yet what else do they get they also get oneonone coaching guidance from the best teachers they also get access to our recruiting network right and end of the bootcamp retreat how [ __ ] insane is that huh how cool is that raise your hand that's insane that's awesome i would say so i would say so right but here's the thing guys for only those of you who are in the webinar we're not done yet guys we're only those who the webinar because you're like you know what i potentially i want to change my life right raise your hand if you want to change the situation right now raise your hand if you want to change your situation if you get exactly so who else we got off we got for example marek we got nick everybody here right here's what we do guys

has applied here marek anybody else of offa who else replied here olfa now guys anthony and nick good those you might think okay well how do i afford this there's multiple ways you can afford this right you can do installments right you can do what we and but the the biggest thing we have right now for those of you who are in usa here's what we have we have something called financing we can finance it and a lot of our students right now are doing financing where they pay 160 per month 200 per month fully right they do finance they take out a small loan through our through our partner through our through our partner well we're going out but to do that who's interested in financing let me raise your hand marek are you interested in financing for example offa what you want to do with financing all right i just do installments installments well finance i feel like that'll be easy even easier for you well i i mean i could pay in full but i just do an installment to separate the payment okay that's fine that's fine who who here here's interested in financing tell me if you're interested in financing or if you're ready to put if you if you're ready so marac offer if you guys are ready to do installments for example here's we're going to do right here's we're going to do for those of you we will drop down a link this is a 500 down payment that's pretty much it we will drop

sets five spots left right so those of you who are interested so who's going who's going to do the dumping right now tell me marek are you doing it olfa is going to do it and do it beautiful so let's go ahead and do it right now so while you guys are waiting now for those of you who are interested okay let's go ahead martin martin is actually in our boot camp mark can you speak a little about how has it been for you and uh how's booker before you tell me martin well um i initially found clever programmer on youtube and uh i was in a boot camp last year in the uk i also investigated all the other boot camps but this one is just something else um the homework the knowledge of the tutors and just the um togetherness the working together and going back to fundamentals i now feel much better six weeks in i feel i really understand some things which i didn't before in the previous boot camp and uh i can only say you know you might be i was a bit dubious at the beginning but this is just something else that um uh daniel them nars and jesse and everything else you know at the same time i'm a father i'm schooling my sixyearold kid at the same time yeah i live in okay and uh these lessons are sort of at night time and it works but i feel really pleased that i'm actually learning something i can get it done and i would say if you're just feeling a bit hesitant you're missing opportunity go for it thank you martin i appreciate it and like like i remember like you know martin you like like you joined right i feel like how did you like how confident were you before like i know we still have a lot of more months to go right you're gonna be a killer but like how confident were you on a scale one two three how comfortable were you like coding like let's go on one to ten well i thought i knew stuff but you guys showed that you know i'd say about 10 or even less and i think i'm now getting to the 5'6 you know and there's a long way to go but you know you guys you've you're really clever programmer is really good on marketing and you get a thousand emails a week a day you know yeah all you guys that are watching this i'm telling you that these tutors they really know their stuff and it goes goes into more depth and they make you do it and they ask you questions and you have to explain it and if you don't understand it they go through it again and again until you do understand it so yeah that's just what i can say you know i just and it's just it's just something that's really good that i would say if you've got any doubts actually you're missing an opportunity if you don't apply for it i would say thank you wow that that actually means a lot to us thank you because we put it you know again you know we we love this so much me daniel jesse you know we love what we do so much that that and it means to us like when people tell like lamar thousands i was like [ __ ] i want to do even more like we're already doing so much for these for these students we're like [ __ ] what else can we do like you know this just brings me like it [ __ ] makes me emotional because i want this to see we're tied to their results we're tight i'm not tied to the 7 500 i'm not tied to what you put in i'm tied to your results i'm tied to you when the sex is seven months right when you finish this you can tell me nas thank you so much i finally got that first job and i i am happy i'm now able to go ahead and be with my family i'm able to afford more things right i love what i do that to me is what i'm tied to because i know it gets hard i know it's hard sometimes right right my parents were there i'm personally very thinking for my parents that you know where they went through a lot of different hard work my parents came from ukraine literally they literally came from ukraine with with nothing they came here with 500 in the bank account you know my parents they here they my dad [ __ ] he worked 18 hours in the day at a car wash you know my mom cleaned houses for 15 hours a day it's an insane it's an insane process i'll be here frankie here it's insane process but but they took their risk they took the risk they bought they bought plane tickets which cost them 15 like i'm not sure how many thousands of dollars and they came here and i just want to kind of thank them back for making that risk because now our lives are so much better because of that and so it makes me happy to not the fact that people who come into this their lives can be not only their lives can be much better but also their kids lives can be better their families lives can be better and the whole future can be better for them that's how exciting about it the other thing i just wanted to say is for me it's a change of career um i've i've been quite successful in broadcast industry postproduction and this this is a change of career so i didn't have any developing experience before so yeah if any of you are changing career or thinking of something like this this is definitely a way to go awesome awesome thank you thomas nate awesome guys thank you nate and those of you who are just worth who for those who would you recommend them to i mean i

tell me why did you join well i've been like learning code for like what is it like a year before this yeah but just like getting into the fundamentals that ground level of understanding and being able to problem solve on your own accord that that is just so useful as a developer and i think this this boot camp really made that made that happen and i'm very i like i feel like i can own the knowledge like there's a sense of confidence and what you know so and make no mistake this is a boot camp so you have to go through the ropes as well like and these these instructors are really awesome they are a godsend and that's the thing man a lot of people and i don't mean to cut you off but that's the thing a lot of people don't realize that you know you only get paid because you have the skill because you can actually understand the code right and it's what we keep seeing and seeing time and time again that you know we have people in our community that even already have jobs sometimes but they go let's say 10 steps ahead and they're already building projects with you know certain frameworks like react when their fundamentals are not yet you know completely on point you know so we started seeing this pattern a lot a lot a lot and we started giving a lot of importance to that you know helping the students gain confidence within themselves because like you said you're able to actually own the code yourself yeah pretty much that's how it feels yeah and now how do you how do you feel now yeah how do you feel now kind of how come do you feel now kind of after joining after i know we kicked your butt a little bit right but how do you feel now tell me huh i feel like a monster you feel like a monster oh my yeah okay my dad he's also in software and i'm able to
