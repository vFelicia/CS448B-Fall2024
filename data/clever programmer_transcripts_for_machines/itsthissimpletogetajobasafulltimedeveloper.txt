hey guys what's up how's it going this is Kazi I'm here today with Wes Wes how you doing okay so we are actually at VidCon and we just randomly asked this gentleman if he's a developer it turns out he is so I just want to ask him a couple of questions that I hope that will bring you value so welcome thank you for being on here and just a little bit about like what kind of got you into development and what do you actually do well in the Marines in 2000 when I was in the Marines I was just a networking computer stuff like that yeah and I enjoyed it but I was injured in motorcycle accidents and I use a wheelchair wheelchair user yep and in the Marines they gave me a GI Bill and I went to college to further my computer networking career and the college I picked didn't have a networking hat I said well we have development or business like I guess the new development but Devon was just wait year yeah and they said well we have development over there that's perfect yes so I picked it up and I live there that's beautiful and are you like were you working for our company with good development and what language were using started out working for passport health and we use C sharp and BB BB a or whatever yeah but old there's a better use anymore then my new company we use just C sharp or just C sharp a B C sharp in DC shop and I thought we did okay visual studio and that's currently what you're doing yeah okay awesome but now yeah an hour for nationals Nashville Tennessee metro government yeah so if somebody wants to break into the industry you know like as of today and they want to get a job as a fulltime developer yeah like how long should they should it take like what's the best path for that basically should they get a degree how long should they wait before they apply hi I went to college I got a bachelor degree and went from there it's a lot easier to prove yourself if you have a bachelor's degree so look I have a degree and then most companies that are hiring entrylevel they respect the decree they you got it agreed you know what she's talking about but I do know that if you can specialize yourself in one particular thing like you can specialize yourself in like five phone applications yep you can fruit write some applications prove yourself in that field that's all you need you don't need all the other stuff if you can get to the part where you can write useful application to just that and you can prove yourself there that's all you need to do so it can't depends on you on your focus if you're wanting to write after pipeline applications or that's all you do be able to prove yourself in that field or this field or if you don't have a specific then get a degree and status you're as you're okay and so instead of like people kind of doing something just super general which is what people end up doing a lot of the times they hope that piece of paper is going to get them a degree but you say hey get actually something very specific if you're gonna get a degree make it very specific you know because what I yeah it's different for every person some people want to do open applications that's what they want to do they don't want to do Android they don't want to do web development they don't want to do background they just want to do iPhone application so they get very specific in that and they have to find a way to prove themselves that they're that they're efficient in that field yeah and then show that to an employer and look I can bring this to you and go from there or you know start up their own shop and somehow get their own customers okay cool and are you planning to start up something like freelancing or you've always been just interesting I like working for somebody who can tell me what to do I can have a developer I'm not a designer got a problem so I don't have the vision of what they want so working with her and her YouTube channel she's great because she could tell me what she wants and I can do that she wants it to look like this I want it to do that you wanna click this button and go there I can make it yes tell me what you want and I can do it so I like working in the back end I don't like I don't like the stress of the constant fight or finding the next client and getting this product out the next day and that stuff I just like to make stuff happen they could make an actual make work have easier for people without without being the go to die and everything is not from my fault and and you know when they don't know how to use their system or something then being that guy yeah it just adds a lot of additional pressure yeah I guess in that case okay so this is pretty awesome so guys if you want to be if you want to do fulltime one of the things that Wes says is try to actually apply and do something very specific get a niche that will help you actually get a job faster whether it's like you know going for iPhone applications or desktop applications with Python or data analysis or finances but something specific it's probably a little bit better guys that's it this is gonna wrap it up you want to add anything at the end check out meant to be Lindsay be calm yeah Lindsay be calm that's it guys thank you so much you can actually just they do photo needs to be alright guys thank you so much thank you everybody I really appreciate it that's it peace
