what's up boys and girls this is qazi from clever programmer i hope you're excited we're about to start dropping a bunch of content and um i want to talk about something important today which is mental health for developers this has been something that's on my mind for a while it's mental health in general but i want to speak specifically to you guys so you guys can relate to it as well um before we get into this video just do me a favor smash that like button so this video goes out to more people and so we can help more people and more developers in general and with that said let's get right into it mental health is one of those things that is extremely important but often times not talked about enough or oftentimes very stigmatized so when people are suffering with things that are in their head they don't actually know how to deal with it and they also don't know where to go and ask for help and especially if you're in a male dominant dominated community like development or your friends are all males around you and i don't necessarily think just males are like this but generally they're a little bit more insensitive and they your friends won't you know care they'll be like haha like just toughen up you're just being a little [ __ ] and you're like no actually there are things that actually need space and i need time to come out and think about things and get into a different mental state it's one of those things that if your head is not in the right place like for example i'll tell you right like last year in 2019 i'm the type of person that's always happy always smiling always grateful doesn't matter what has happened to me right even when i was young and i went to a religious school between the ages of 9 and 12 years old and i was beat every single day um the school was between 8 am to 10 pm so it was 12 to 14 hours long often times and if i got beat up really bad and i had bruises and i went home and the teachers would beat you up there and if i told my parents i would come back and i would get beaten up even more so it was better to just not tell anybody and i had to go to that for three to four years and so there are a lot of things that happen to me but i feel like maybe i got lucky in the process or whatever happened but my normal became yo if i wake up and i'm not getting beat my like the [ __ ] beat out of me it's a good day i'm happy let's go let's work let's come up with something i see the world as like a playground and i just see that there's so much opportunity and possibilities and if you imagine a cake right there's a giant cake i imagine that the world is not just one giant cake where if you keep taking out the cake runs out i imagine there are like infinite cakes that are out there and i and i imagine that the world shows you how to make as many cakes as you want so there's enough for every single person right if you become successful doesn't mean i can't become successful if i become successful doesn't mean you can't become successful so sometimes people think somebody's success will hurt or hinder theirs and that's also not true so for me to come you know spend that much time and be grateful and i always feel like i'm always happy and in a good state of mind but last year i was in a state of mind where i remember waking up and not wanting to get out of bed i remember i would try to stay in bed as long as i possibly could and i remember that when i would get out i would sit there and think like why am i feeling sad why am i not feeling happy why do i feel like literally like [ __ ] like i don't want to do anything and i remember this is there's just one thing that i would always do to get out of pretty much any state there are a lot of things that i like to do like i love to play table tennis i love to play chess i love to play pool snooker bowling uh soccer you know there's like bunch of things coding like there's a bunch of stuff that i like to do if i sit there and i i normally go through them and i'm like okay you know what even though i don't feel like working today even though i don't feel like doing all these other things today i feel like playing ping pong or i feel like bowling and that centers me and i go okay i can still be happy okay cool let me just go do that and when i do that i come back i'm happy and i'm a completely different state of mind that day what happened was i looked at myself and i remember going through the list of every single thing and there was not a single thing that made me happy or that made me feel okay i looked in the mirror and i kept looking at myself and i remember my face kind of just started getting distorted and i started materials started streaming down and i couldn't control them i just started crying and i kept i actually just kept verbally asking like what is wrong with me why do i feel like this why do i feel unhappy and i just kept and i felt like i was broken and so it was in this really weird mental space that i was in that i just could not get out of and i remember that last year in august one of the worst months of my life where no matter what i would do no matter where i would go my mind went with me every single place and i was trapped inside of it and i couldn't get out of it what i experienced was a really really painful experience it made me begin to get empathy for other people who maybe are suffering from depression maybe who are suffering from mental health disorders who who are like are bipolar who go into states of mind that are completely irrational who suffer from anxiety who know that it's not true what's happening but they just can't help and get out of it they can't just think positively and all of a sudden like things change for them and so when that kind of set in i'm like oh my god this is hell like this is actually hell there's nothing worse than this i'd rather have some kind of physical problem rather than a mental problem because i can't run away from this i don't want to do anything um luckily for me when i actually got i i went to a little retreat i took three days off saturday and sunday friday so i took it's like three days off because normally you know i'll work seven days a week so i took those three days off took the weekend off and i went with my girlfriend and we went to like big bear and we just got a cabin in the woods and uh just kind of disconnected from everything and anything turned off my phone uh told my team hey just please help me i remember getting on a call with rachel i remember handing tasks off to rachel and i did i all i remember was i was on the call and that was the first time i actually was openly vulnerable with a team member because i thought you have to be strong and you have to not show weakness to your team and on that call i remember asking for i'm like i don't know what's wrong with me i'm like i think i just need help i said it i started crying rachel listened to it and rachel is like you know what i think she was pregnant at that time and she still didn't have a uh hallie yet and she was and she just like she's british and she's like so professional and she's so kind all the time and she's she has an amazing heart but i remember that day she was like on the facetime with me and she goes you know what she's in uk and she goes [ __ ] that she's like i'm gonna help you and she's like i'm gonna take care of everything you don't worry about anything i was like wow this is so unbelievable like this is the team these are the people and this means everything so i took those two days off that completely changed everything for me like i got completely recentered realigned everything left my body and out of my body and i came back a different man and i still remember to this day that those three days like put us on a completely different trajectory you know like everything was going down that at that time everything felt like it was going down at least nothing was working or nothing made me feel happy and that turned it around completely and after that like we just had a you know there were lots of still ups and downs but the trajectory overall was upwards and i've been feeling very very happy since then but still today i just thought because today we took another a few days off to kind but instead of a few days off we actually took a vacation but it's like a workation we took we got airbnb so that's where we are right now the team is here daniel is right there uh nas is right there so the team is here and we're hunkering down to shoot content we're making content for profit with javascript there's like amazing react content that you know we [ __ ] up on we didn't deliver on time so now we're just like owning up to it we apologize to you if you're a profit javascript customer that's not right for you but we're owning up to our mistake and we're just gonna commit to it and we're gonna put in the work doesn't matter what it takes we're just gonna do it we're gonna deliver it for you guys is gonna be the best piece of content on react that you guys have seen to date and we're gonna over deliver on that so that's what we're doing right but we're just focusing and working still just a change of scenery and the change of regular environment allowed us and allowed me to destress in a way that i hadn't in a long time and just being here like think about this right it's 9 23 p.m we had so much travel and we already put in a whole day's work and we got here and now i just want to work more like i just have a lot more energy simply because change of scenery change of location environment is different and i'm feeling excited i feel like i have a purpose so these little hacks right they add up you can actually use them if you know that these things work for you you can use them to get yourself out of those places and maybe put yourself in a better mental head space where you can feel happier or you can feel more energized or you can feel more excited or you can feel more elated and just out of that little mud that you were stuck in right it's kind of like a car being stuck in the mud and just can't get out so you can't just keep revving all day you need to do something else you might need to call somebody and have them help you push right aka asking friends or talking to people just even opening up and letting people know around you what you're verbally thinking and what is happening so the one part that i missed left out from that story the real thing that actually changed me in those three days yes distressing location but i was with my girlfriend and i was just like completely open and shared everything and everything that made me feel vulnerable i was like i'm scared about the business dying i'm scared about us not actually having the finances to continue next month i'm deathly scared of having to let any of my team members go that's my biggest fear in life like literally i have that's my like biggest fear above almost anything else um i i tell them and i don't joke about this i'm like if worse comes to worst i will literally go to a mall and dance naked and make a couple of dollars i don't know if that's gonna do it but i will do it just as a gesture or just for fun maybe just because i wanted to do it that is it's that important to me right so i told her like i'm afraid of that i'm afraid of that like frankie and aaron have like put in so much blood work and sweat into building this up with me i can't let them down like i have to actually live up to this and so when i shared all of those fears that were like hidden deep down and were causing so much pain for me it in a really weird way like first it made me feel weak and vulnerable because that's how as males were were brought up or maybe just people in general right not maybe just males but like you could be a female and have that type of like uh upbringing and feel that way so you know i'm like maybe so that made me feel vulnerable and in a weird way it made me feel weak like why am i sharing all these secrets with her and then i started getting on calls with every but in a weird way i kind of felt this like weird sense of relief i felt a little lighter and so i'm like okay if that works why don't i just keep because nothing else was working so i'm like why don't you just keep repeating that so then i called up like frankie and i just told him everything and he was like wow bro like i appreciate you saying that like wow and once i shared all these things with him and how i was even afraid that i might lose him on the team i remember he looked at me i mean oh it was over the phone there but there was another conversation we had too and frankie's recording this right now we had another conversation too we're just sitting down at bourgeois pig but like i'll get to that later but he told me on the call and he was like dude if something happens literally we'll work together for free to bring this back up like i don't care like it's bigger than just paying it's actually family um that was one of those moments that like like you know even right now like it has it has an impact on me and it like gets me emotional and so when i felt that i'm like [ __ ] this i'm getting out of this shitty ass mindset i'm gonna put myself to work and get out of this and actually get back to it another brilliant thing he told me is he said look i don't know there's a lot of things going on just know that we're here no matter what happens and that like grounded me like a [ __ ] the second thing he said is he said look what's another thing that helps you get back on track he's like one thing i've noticed is you when you help people that puts you back because it gets you out of your own [ __ ] and i was like sitting there and i'm like yeah that makes sense and he told me hey why don't you go help your brother and maybe just help him with his like product launch and like help him launch his youtube channel or something and i said okay i'm just gonna do that and he's like how would that make you feel and immediately before i even did that i'm like oh my god like if i have to rise to the occasion for my brother and help him build something i'm gonna show up like a champion i don't care what's been happening before if i have to rise up for frankie and he's willing to rise up for me i'm like i gotta do this if my team is willing to support me everybody around me is gonna support me i'm getting the [ __ ] up and i'm getting out and i'm just putting in the work that pushed me and got me out of that mindset and at that point the main thing that i had to focus on and do was now just work like now you have the momentum shut down the thinking because the thinking is going to keep thinking about the past which is going to make you depressed right i learned this from the book power of now by eckhart tolle and also my friend daniel said this too you start thinking about the past that's going to get you depressed you start thinking too much about the future that gives you anxiety but if i can just now use that momentum and work and shut off my thinking now i'm in a place of bliss and you know what i'm talking about like imagine you're coding for a really long time you're two three four five hours in you hit that flow state or you're editing a video you hit that flow state or you're just working on something which is two three four five hours in you hit that flow state and then time just kind of starts to fly and you kind of lose that sense of oh my god like you're in that flow state you stop caring for me that's what happened and i just started focusing on the work so that got me out of it for you what that means is look if you are feeling that there's things happening for you like you're dealing and you're just not in a place where you can think properly or there's too much negative selftalk or no matter how much action you take you feel like it's just not enough or it's not worth it there are 10 million other people doing the same thing every single day anyways why does it matter and that like lack of motivation and that negative selftalk is just constantly dragging you down what i want to tell you is one there are people there who care for you and there are people there who love you and support you go talk to them okay the real people who are supporting you not just the [ __ ] people that are trying to appease you so your closest circle of friends who are going to tell you the truth they're great people to actually like have a conversation with and let them know how you're feeling right so let i guess i just break down that down as point uh two so number two be very open and vulnerable okay so if there are thoughts that are like your darkest thoughts or they're freaking the [ __ ] out or you're scared that they're gonna judge you those are the things you need to share with the people around you the more you share and let that out that skeleton and that weird thing it's like poison it doesn't have time to grow it's kind of like you just get in there you take it out right as it's about to spread you just take it out if you wait too long it's just gonna like go through your whole body and now your the whole thing is messed up right so start sharing with people what you're thinking about and everything that's bothering you i mean obviously if you can go get a therapist go get a therapist like virtually and i really really mean it and there's nothing wrong with this or stigmatizing right like just do it because it's actually going to help you whether it's with you trying to get a job or you're trying to do something and even just your own work and productivity that might be one of those things because if i just gave you like some tips of productivity it's like putting a bandaid on this right if you have um if there's a deeper problem then i want to address that deeper problem so being vulnerable and honest really really helps because it takes away the power from all those things that are really frightening or scary to you once you say them out loud you're like that actually doesn't sound that bad okay maybe i can just get out of my own way you can listen to yourself or they can point out something that you weren't thinking about number three what i recommend is you can change your environment all right so like even right now we're at this airbnb we just got away from the other environment and i mean it was a great environment but like here we're like more inspired the freaking ceiling is so high and i love it it just makes me feel happy and spacious it makes me feel like i think all these windows i mean they're not that necessary i'm not going to be looking out of that [ __ ] top left triangle window but it's exciting to be in a space where i feel inspired rejuvenated and mentally relaxed so what that means for me is the roi of that is really really crazy because first of all it makes me really happy second of all now i'm making content now i'm de over delivering on the things that i've been meaning to do right and the things that i want to go harder on so that's the the third thing right change your environment number four what i can say is stop the thinking mind and get busy with the actual doing so often times when you are stuck with thinking that's the place that's like really really gets you [ __ ] up okay so please find something to do and just get to work and stop the thinking the more you think when you're in a negative state of mind the worse it just keeps getting it's a downward spiral and there's really like no um way to think your way out of it right it's kind of like if let's say you're really scared of heights well let's say you are now gonna bungee jump the longer you take and let me ask you the longer you take are you gonna get less scared or more scared before you jump that's the problem with negativity it's such a strong downward spiral the more time you sit down with it the worse it gets so the best things you can do actually require you to do which is action so start doing things whether it means like you know for example make three videos that day or code up actual projects that day so you're just caught up in the work i'll [ __ ] love chess i'll just start playing chess that gets me to think about chess i'm like caro khan french defense oh he's playing a sicilian right it gets me to focus and enjoy something or do something that makes that forces you to essentially be really really present right and that's in line with the stopping the thinking mind playing pingpong gets you really focused you can't be like depressed and like be playing pingpong with somebody because you're going to lose the point so you have to actually be focused so things that kind of almost in a way that that are designed in a way that almost force you to be present do those the more you can stop your thinking mind the better it's gonna be for you and number five be grateful so this is something that it's hard to just practice it but really start looking around at what you're missing that is positive or what you do have in life because i know maybe the dialogue in your life right now might be like there's a lot of things that you're missing or you're missing this or you could make more money or you don't have the nice job that you wanted or maybe you don't like the work that you do or you want to switch or you're just stuck in coding and you keep getting frustrated because you're stuck in these projects and you don't really see a way through whatever it is think about what are the actual positive things that are happening because what happens with us is you know and um these are things i'm like picking up from um owen cooks like personal development stuff so i'm gonna mention it here but there's something called the reticular activation activation system and so when that kind of flips for you it it makes everything like in invisible and you don't even see those things that are around you so i'll give you an example right sometimes if so my girlfriend if she is feeling like anxiety or feeling threatened and if she sees a comment let's say she made a post and they got a lot of people there right sometimes she'll look at it and she got 500 000 views on it right 700 000 views on it i'm like oh my god look at this like throughout their post we're getting 100 this is 700 000 it's crazy but somebody made like a really nasty evil comment she can't really focus at that moment in the 700 000 views she can't really focus on the 6000 shares or the 30 000 or 80 000 likes she can't even focus on the positive comments she's like why would this person say this you know like really hurt by it and that's a natural response it happens to me too where i'm like oh my god some so negative you know so and you know when she sees positive like when she's out of that state she then starts focusing on the positive but why i'm telling you this is the good things around you might actually be invisible to you right now like literally it's like oh yeah but that guy is my friend you know like that guy's my buddy so whatever but like this is the thing that sucks in my life no what like if you're gonna focus on that thing and say that thing sucks like for example if i am gonna say that i got that negative comment and i hate that comment i'm so negatively triggered by it well then i need to get actively positively triggered by the good comment right then that's actually fair i should be like yes whoa let's go hey high five everybody like what's up like we got a positive comment like let's go i need to be then positively triggered by that and then i go negatively triggered but how come all the oh yeah that's cool like that person said his gratitude or that person said oh my god learning this changed my life so i need to be triggered by both and be triggered by both so don't just ignore that one friend that you maybe you might be taking for granted right or the family member that you might be taking for granted or what you are doing that you might be taking for granted or maybe the fact that you even have a job or the fact that maybe you even have those like maybe even taking for granted the fact that you can even feel the pain and frustration of being stuck in something that's a beautiful thing because when you get out of it you can help other people get out of it and you can look back and you get that feeling of satisfaction once you get past something so being grateful that you're stuck because you know you're gonna feel that amazing thing afterwards so those are the five steps five things that i think can help you and uh that's it that's what i had on my mind i hope that it helps you or inspires you or gives you some ideas to maybe get out of that space hopefully maybe it inspires you to change your environment or maybe you're already starting to feel grateful and excited and maybe you're starting to look at things in a new way or maybe you're getting that glimmer of hope and maybe you're thinking of reaching out to that one friend to go hang out and actually play ping pong or just go go hang out and be happy or calm or maybe you're thinking about reaching out to somebody and sharing all the things that are holding you back or your fears all right so what i want to do is i absolutely hate that if i just watch something and i don't take action on it like one of my things that i hate the most i also hate when other people do that so i want to love you i call this conditional love but only on one condition take action on this if you watch this video this spoke out to you something stood out to you what i want you to do is comment below on what one action step you're going to take as a result of this video and then i need you to actually take that action step otherwise the point there's no point to this video okay so what i want what i want you to do is comment below like what's the action step you're going to take maybe you're going to reach out to your friend and share everything that's like been holding you back like whatever that secret is that's [ __ ] hard i feel you but maybe you just have to do that maybe you're like hey i'm going to start doing this thing that i wasn't going to do so comment that below or maybe you're like i'm going to change my environment i'm just going to book a ticket and go somewhere else right go from this place to this place or maybe i'm just going to book an airbnb and do it so comment that below because that is exciting if you want you can tag me at cleverkazy on instagram and send me your story and maybe it caused you to do something that'd be so cool i'll reply back to you or maybe you might have a friend you might think they're feeling this way but they're scared to bring it up so go and help them right maybe you're in a negative state or maybe you know somebody who might mean that state so they're scared to come out to you right don't wait for them to bring up the conversation and be scared of it being awkward but get them out of that hell their mental health trust me nobody wants to be there so go and talk to them or share this video with them or share this video with somebody who you think this can help okay so do that for me take some type of action please i would love your beautiful face for it last few things guys we have we've opened up our program profitable shortcut which is our uh program where we help people become developers or go from being a developer to getting a sixfigure or higher job it's our high level program where we really like work closely with you i work really closely with you my entire team works really closely with you nas works closely with you so this has been a thing that's been on top of my mind on top of my team's mind that's why we even made this program profitable shortcuts so we can have developers in there so not only do we work with them like very closely we want to work with them to actually also make sure they're happy i remember actually calling out devon on one of the coaching calls on not being happy actually remember that um i'm too lazy to put in that clip but that was like really awesome and i remember that we worked on it and he actually started becoming happier over time because he realized that was his blind spot and so sometimes you might not realize that so we wanted to give you that community of people around you where you can share all these things because we know this and we give the space for you we have the space for you so you can share all these things we as the coaches can see those signs maybe they're in a blind spot for you but if you're in that spot maybe we can call it out or make it come into your awareness because even just it being you being aware of it helps you actually solve the problem at a big state and like when you're not happy the cost of being unhappy even if you want to get like you know what's the roi and all of that the cost of being unhappy is actually really really high like all those things that you don't do like if you're at your happiest what could you achieve if you're not at your happiest or you're unhappy what's the delta there that's what you're actually losing right so we want to make sure that that doesn't happen you stay happy and you keep getting success in your career so if you're interested definitely click the link below and we make sure that you get absolutely incredible results
