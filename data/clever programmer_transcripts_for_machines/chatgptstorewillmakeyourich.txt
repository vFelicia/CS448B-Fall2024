GPT store just launched this is the same as when Chrome extension if we went back in the day and imagine the Chrome extension store was just about to launch or the WordPress plugin store was just about to launch or the App Store on your iPhone was just about to launch so it's a really big moment in time it's a historical moment that we're actually seeing happen kind kind of in front of us or in a few days it's going to be happening there was an email that open a sent out and I think everybody got this email but it basically goes hey dear GPT Builder we want to let you know that we will be launching the GPT store next week if you're interested in sharing your GPT in the store you'll need to and then they gave instructions for it okay now if you're interested and curious how to make your yours I'll also show you and walk you through that but what's important for you to know is that this is an opportunity for you to learn have fun mostly okay because I'll show you something funny which is how much money do developers make and there's a funny SL sad Reddit I found because we talk a lot about how much money you could make right but there's also another side of the truth which is there are a lot of developers who are not making money so there's a Reddit here it's like hey how much money you earn with your apps somebody commented and then look at these comments right you got people going about a negative, thousand sounds about right negative 1,000 per day or per month in two years and so and this guy got a lot of upvotes so that tells you that there's a lot of people who are failing and not able to make money with coding but this is just the truth with everything in life most people are losers most people will not win most people by definition will be average so there will be a few who will just take it all and so the question is are you one of them or are you one of the others and I hope that if you're watching my channel you're not a loser you're a winner and that's my belief in myself and I hope you believe that in you too because I believe in you all right so let's go back to this okay now let's say you wanted to build your own GPT well here's how you can actually do it there's a simple process so if you actually went to Chad GPT you could build your own bot and uh right now at least in the UI there's an explore button that you could click right and then after you go to the explore button you click create a GPT it's in beta version now but pretty soon it won't be and it could be whatever for example one of the ones I made because I sent out a lot of emails is I made a email crafter and that's just for me and it does makes my email writing easier because it understands how I write emails another bot that I actually recently built is this clever programmer one and I actually use it all the time cuz something I hate about Chad GPT is every single time I try to talk to it youve probably experienced this too it gives you a lot of random explanations it gives you disclaimers you'll be like hey what's 5 + 5 and it will be like I'm not a mathematician or a law but 5 + 5 is equal to 10 and here's a disclaimer do your own research look up on Google because answers in different countries based on if you're Europe or Canada might be different and you're like what the dude like just shut the up give me 10 and so I can just go on my way right that's what you want that's what I want and so I I usually hate regular CH GPT cuz it's so verbos and disclaimer and long sentenc and I just want things like when I ask it how many calories are in you know how many calories do I burned with 500 steps don't need something long just give me something like 1,000 calories something 200 calories something that's direct so what I did is I made my own bot clever programmer and what that does I'm not promoting my own bot by the way so just relax but what this bot does is it is very direct and concise I just taught it hey I want you to just give short direct concise answers and don't drag out keep it simple keep it succinct and keep it to the point just that's it don't give long explanations unless explicitly asked and whenever users ask give them the full code don't hide Snippets of code and that's baked into it at the core level which means now whenever I use chat GPT and I use this bot all my answers are super short and direct so really valuable chatbot that I made in probably 5 minutes and now I can link it to anybody and people can use it right so that way you can make your own Bots as well okay so you make your Bot and then this is what the bot Builder looks like it's pretty simple what's cool is you don't even have to do any complicated stuff like you don't even have to fill out like this form that you see here you don't even have to do any of that you just talk to this bot Builder over here and what you wanted to do you you're like make sentences short and boom it puts it writes a description for you it automatically writes the instructions for you it writes the conversation starts for you it writes the name of the bot for you it even updates the profile picture uh of the bot for you like it even like this is a for example from a clever programmer bot I mean how cool is that it it makes it look so cool and it has the Q cuz ky ky I called it the pzy bot so it took this AI photo where uh it made it look like this nice little queue which is super cool so it does everything for you like creates all the marketing branding material right so how nice of a time is this that to build your own app you just say some stuff you don't have to even write code you don't have to go through the Swift Apple Market and SDK and fight the Chrome extension store just do it in one go okay now what's the benefit of all this why would we even do this well check this out right here's an example of Chrome extensions and I wanted to share this with you guys because I think it's important to kind of get the picture of this like what's the opportunity there for the ones who would take it all here's the opportunity here's an example of eight Chrome extensions with impressive revenue and these are by Indie developers okay so somebody decided to make an app well here are some crazy apps these are ridiculous but grammarly is a Chrome extension by the way they raised $90 million and they are $1 billion valuation Chrome extension gmass okay another Chrome extension these guys are making about $130,000 per month so that's do the math but well over $1 million per year you got another app in the Chrome Store which is closet tools these guys make $442,000 per month and check it out it's an extension that helps users automate posting on the fashion reselling Marketplace Poshmark I mean could you be any more Niche like what the like this is the craziest Niche I've seen and at $30 per month they're making $42,000 per month doesn't it make you ask like what are we doing like why aren't we building more Chrome extensions right and there's so many more CSS scan it helps you scan and modify rules CSS rules on web pages 100,000 Go full page 10,000 per month screen capture app screen capture app that just lets you screen capture a full page 10,000 per month that is 120,000 per year off of a screen capture app point and click web scraper 10K in 2 months right and there's so many more black magic 3K per month this is a little tool for Twitter that helps users with Twitter okay weather extension 2500 per month I mean ridiculous right absolutely ridiculous so this is an example of just with Chrome extensions what's happening now you're looking at Chad GPT which probably would even have more users than almost anything might have more users than actually Chrome and all those people building apps on there uh and and mostly a lot of those people are users so imagine you build something that a lot of these users could use it would be lifechanging for you right it could bring in a lot of revenue for you so my recommendation to you is start learning Chad GPT start learning how to build apps with AI because you can be part of you know the gold shovel fir ship in his videos uh Tong and cheek also talks about the gold shovel right selling the gold shovel and he's like you can make a million per month which is I know he did it in humor but you might not be the person that might make a million per month but you don't you might also not need to be right would you be happy if your app made $3,000 a month or $5,000 a month or $10,000 a month $150,000 a month a lot of people would be very happy and more more importantly than even that just think about the skill that you get out of it think about how it looks on your resume and your portfolio that you're trying to build this and just how fun it is to be a part of something so new that is happening right now here's what I would say Okay explore this learn it because I think the opportunity is huge if you want to be part of my community part of all the people that are learning Ai and CH GPT and building incredible apps and actually even selling these apps that are part of my community in the course profit with the Chad GPT I've put together an incredible free training for you that shows you your AI and CH GPT apps that you could build right now I'll give you three ideas for free of apps you could use right now and I'll show you how you can monetize it in your own life and do that now so if that sounds interesting to you I've put together there a very short 19minute free training for you and if you click the link in the description below just pop in your name your email and there's a live training that I'm going to be doing and so if you join it I'm going to be there giving you the training live that will be super valuable to you okay and I think it has a potential to change your life especially with Chad GPT store coming out in a few days if you watch it now it could give you the lens to look at the world from where you can be one of the people that could be actually extracting value out of this and be one of the people that could be in the 100K you know hopefully the 130k per month category but again even if you're not 10K a month 5K a month all of that is a substantial amount so if that's exciting to you and you want to learn how to build apps chpt click the link below watch that training I love your face and I'll see you in the next video peace
