welcome welcome welcome this is nas and today we are building a startup landing page with javascript html and css it's a starter landing page with over ten thousand dollars and what this means is you will essentially you can essentially charge over 10k for a project like this right this is brought to you by a company called fundamentor you guys can kind of check it out we have the link down below in description if you want to check out and get all the design files from them right amazing company if you want to build amazing projects and get amazing design ideas but here's the project we're going to build right this is a startup company looks like right we are of course we have for example things like the header right here we have things like uh different let me see you know different little sections uh we're gonna be using a lot of advanced css topics like flexbox of course and also we're gonna be talking about well how do you structure your website properly and how do you make sure that it's you know mobile friendly as well right so a lot of things gonna be covered today right if you're a beginner this is a great uh entrance for you and of course you can include this project on your portfolio as well but that's pretty much it let's go ahead and get started my friends like i said all i want to say is welcome welcome welcome to everybody here on youtube uh we are building a startup landing page that looks beautiful all right let's go ahead and get to it i like to play some music in the background while we're coding is everybody okay with that hopefully you guys are okay with that but at this point a few things i want you to do is go ahead and get started first things first let's go ahead and open up a new vs code so you should have vs code open now at this point uh if you don't do that and let's go ahead and do new window file new window great great so file new window there we go then what i'm going to do is i'm going to open up a new project here let's go to projects and i'm going to do a new folder i'm going to call it a landing page landing dash page right here okay landing page beautiful and within this project it's just going to be an empty folder i don't need to do anything with this one um i'm actually just going to open up this folder in a vs code all right so let's do that right now so i'm going to say vs code click open and again try your best to go with me if you can't no problem right just watch for your pleasure and watch for uh you know to learn projects landing page great click open all right it's open right there that's that beautiful so once we have that uh open the first thing i want you to do is right click and do new file and that's called index.html now index.html is usually the html file that will will be represented as the landing page of any project and that's it so we've got that and now at this point all you i want you to do is just hit the right here so this is called an emmet abbreviation and sometimes you can either do like this you know to start your html landing page but i'm going to put the boilerplate i call the boilerplate stuff right away so i don't have to worry about it too much okay so i'm going to say here right here boom look at that it right away puts the html portion for you again all this is just an exclamation point and that's it my friends all right let's rename this title to be a it's called sunnyside sunnyside let's turn this title and honestly that is a good start for us now a few things i want you to do if you are on youtube right we have the images right if you want to download all the images for sunnyside it's you can go ahead and go to for them from a mentor and simply just sign up it's completely free sign up or find a mentor and you will get all the images the link is down below in description but also we have a github a github link for you as well so if you want to check out the github link that also has you know image links in there as well you can go ahead and check that github link down below too as well so if it's make it easier for you so just click on the github link and that is it my friends does that make sense yes or no everybody's still with me everybody still with me give me a thumbs up give me a thumbs up yeah beautiful everybody stay with me all right okay now let's take a look at what do we how do we even get started well we've got our body right so remember this the head is always going to be for the head surgery section which is going to include some styles the css and you know and other things like javascript so this is where we include the javascript brushes inside here okay now for the body however this is where we're going to include html alright or the actual body structure the way i like to structure my projects is like this i like to think about boxes for me it's always about boxes okay i'm gonna go ahead and do this right here okay and if i structure this as a box okay what box do you see here here in this website well boxes if you guys know put that in the chat well the one box i see here is this box okay i see maybe this box and that this box has two boxes which is this one box and this another box right and i see another box in here that might have two boxes which is this one box and this another box okay beautiful and then let's go back now to the to our banner which is this section okay and this section how many boxes did this section have well let's take a look at this okay if i go ahead and hover over this right this whole navigation bar can be a box in itself right so this whole navigation bar can be a box in itself all right beautiful right so that's a box which is amazing then again let's create more boxes i'm doing this because remember in html everything is a box that's why we were doing the way we're doing this all right sign inside the logo is going to be boxing itself the navigation port is gonna be a box and then probably even the button is gonna be unboxing itself as well all right so just want you guys to understand how those come about we're gonna make weird creatives a box as well and the same thing as this era right here and then my friends is it that's a good start so what do we know now from this point on we know the fact that we need to create navigation bar and we know the fact that we need to create in a banner section as well make sense comprende good all right let's go ahead and get started number one on the banner section okay on the banner section let me go and put this aside just because i don't want this aside like it's on the banner section let me go back to here all right so here we go so the first things first that i want you guys to do is well we need to create the actual uh first things first is gonna be the wrapper so we have this body i usually like to wrap my body in a wrapper like some kind of a wrapper to make sure that we have the whole structure it's like kind of like you're wrapping a gift right and we're gonna wrap our body so i'm going to say div and remember div is always going to be you know what html is made up of dave class i'm going to call the wrapper beautiful div class wrapper right here they have class wrapper now nothing's gonna happen here in this wrapper like i said what do we have well uh the first we're going to create is gonna be the banner section which is going to be this section right that's the banner section so let's create that div first so we'll say div right here class is equal to banner right you guys can try to keep up with me as well right that's the first text i'm going to build right after we create the banner section we're going to build the uh the section for the transformer brand so after that i'm going to say div class is equal to um section one let's just say section one right here you see that which is going to be this section so this section one is just simply this section right here all right beautiful after that we're going to build another section we're actually going to build uh necessarily this section i'm going to build actually i'm going to focus more so on building this section because this is the same one as that one so i'm going to focus on building this section right here i'm going to call it div class is equal to section 2. beautiful awesome so we have these sections that are created just to get us started with something okay beautiful inside the banner inside the banner what do we have inside the banner well a few things well one is we have a what the banner is we have this i call it the header okay everybody i'll call it the header okay let's call it the header right here so i'm gonna say div class d of class is equal to header right the class is equal to header beautiful now again this header is going to be again it's this portion the header is going to be just this portion right because we want to take care of that first understand everybody beautiful all right now let's think about what do we need to do inside the header well there's a logo stuff and so forth but i know there's a lot of stuff that we're going to put in here but let's just put logo as a text here for now all right let's put that in let's go back to our innis html and a few ways you can go about actually you know running this application one way is you can do copy so you can do if you do not have live server you can simply just do right click on index.html you do copyright copy path then you can open this path inside here like this again nothing happens here you know there's no reason that they should show anything so far another way and that's uh this is more of a complicated way but it's very important as well is you go to extensions here guys you go to live server live server right type in live server you click on live server you click install and that will install a live server for you right that's the way to host your applications next after you've done that all you have to do is right click and then open with live server just like this right here oh nice and there you go so we have the same you know the same result it's just that you know a live server is an actual server that we're gonna that's gonna be hosted on our application okay beautiful all right nice nice nice next up so next up that we need to work on is going to be the following it is this so we have the logo the header the header this banner right here right if you guys can really figure this out this banner is actually the goal for this banner is to take up the whole vertical height of our page so when we first log in i want to make sure this better is this full page it's looking beautiful i wanna make sure it's a full page so here's what i'm going to do all right i will go ahead and go to and create a new file called style.css boom so let's see it says let me show i have the chat here open so we gail can see here okay so that was css inside that style the css i'm i'm just going to say dot i'm just going to say it like this now this star simply means everything this means we're going to affect everything and i'm going to remove a lot of this dumb margin which i don't like margin zero along with the padding as well zero okay let's remove this margin let's move this padding sweet we got that let's save that next up index.html all right now we need to we've created style to css but of course now we need to import the style.css so i'm going to do link shafts i'm going to say like this link boom but what you can do is if you just type in link you see you're given a few options you can do link css just like this and they will actually auto autocomplete it for you inside the use code very useful and look it even did style the css for me right here because i noticed that the css is right here so it's basically like doing the code by itself here let's go ahead and save that beautiful after that inside the style the c set which is right here i'm gonna do dot banner now what am i gonna do this dot dab banner well one i'm gonna give it a background color here i'll just give it orange for now or let's just say give it a blue okay let's see save that so there we go right we have the banner which is right here let me remove this for now which is right here this banner right here that's blue but i want this whole banner which is this section to be the full with the full height so i'm going to say um height height is equal to 100 vh and 188 stands for guide if you do not know 100 vh stands for 100 vertical height 100 vh so it's the 100 vertical height of the whole browser so if i save this look what happened right there see it just turned the whole browser right the whole browser now is 100 vh which is perfect okay great awesome now of course now our back color is blue but really what we want is not the blue we actually want the background color to be this image you see does everybody see this image everybody yeah everybody see this image beautiful right so it's this image that we want to actually make sure that it's there all right now let's make sure that that happens well the image is actually i'm going to show you where it is if i go to my github thing right which is again linked down below or if you go to fundamentor you can download it from there right away right again if you just go to front and mentor you can just simply just visit the page like this and just do everything from this side but if you're on the github you can do that too so let's go to banner let's copy our link for the banner right and i'm going to do is i'm going to say background background image and i will say url i irl url boom boom boom and i give it put into quotes and here's the background image url all right so save that and let's see what that what happens uh it's not just a bunch of blue okay well praising my reason b is because this whole uh banner is very big so what i want to do in this case is the following i'm going to say say like this i'm going to say background position i'm going to position it in the center boom boom you see now it's position center vertically horizontally right background size i'm going to say backgrounds after that i'm going to say background size is equal to cover save that okay awesome sweet so that's looking pretty pretty good right and then i'm going to say the following right i want this whole image to actually be more so centered horizontally but also um on the vertical side b all the way at the bottom that's kind of how i want to make sure that that that works out so i'm going to say back in position if i go to background position guys and the documentation backup position you will see that the way it works is the following the first uh portion we can say for example see i can do top bottom or i can say like this top right or top bottom so for example i can say center and i can say bottom for the vertical positioning let me go to here so that's pretty much the bottom right top bottom center bottom save that beautiful that's looking pretty pretty good i'm liking the way it's the way it turned out so far all right once we have the banner let's go and now create the actual header logo so the header right inside this header of course what we want to do is we want to one is create the logo so i'm going to say image image class is equal to right um logo and i'm going to give it a source right where's the limit the the source of this image right i'm gonna close this out again if you go back to the github page guys the logo is right here okay the svg logo is right here guys okay beautiful let's go back to our application and i'm going to give it a source right here of this svg alright beautiful nice all right that looks looking pretty good i'm liking the way it is uh that's it okay i'm gonna make sure that you guys can actually hear uh wrapping wrap or wrap right there all right so you guys can see it's wrapping actually the actual text okay beautiful after the image logo let me if i save this where's the image logo it's right there but you see again it's not nicely structured it's just kind of there don't worry about it we're not going to focus on it just yet i want to now create the second the second box which is going to be which one just gonna be the right here right it's gonna be this box which is the menu right here so i want to create now this menu so let's do that so the inside the header because we're still inside the header guys right i'm gonna say div class is equal to what is equal to anybody know what would i say here what do you guys think i will say here what is it what can i say anybody know i can say now i can say menu as well menu okay nice but you can say nav as well inside this nav i'm going to give it a few p text i'm going to say p tag actually by the way i'm just going to give it a span tag span tag all right and i'm going to give it a span take of about and then i'm going to say after that i'm going to say span span off we have a few uh of services right and the last one is going to be what unless it's going to be a span take of projects right projects there you go projects right here guys you see so project is going to be the span tag awesome suite and then the last thing we're going to do is going to be going to create a deal and that's going to be the contact button contact button right there beautiful so i'm going to say contact right here okay give class contact amazing okay and so now we have these let me go ahead and save this and let's see what do what does it look like well it looks pretty shitty okay it looks pretty bad would you guys agree with me on that one yeah it looks pretty bad okay that's okay first distance i want to focus on is the following so you can see that we have this div class menu uh what i want to do is actually make sure that you see how it's kind of it's top to bottom right here i want to make sure to put it under from left to right i want to put all of this on the right hand section which is right here to make that happen i'm going to go to back to my style of css and as i'll do i'm going to say the following i'm going to do that header and i'm going to use something called display flex guys this is something you might have heard before maybe you know i have not before before but display flex is something that's used uh pretty much kind of everywhere ever to make sure it's you know it's you know it's done right but let me see here uh actually i'm gonna do yeah let's do it on the header so i'm gonna say display flex display flex so now you can see that right away header one from left to right okay you see how if want to put display flex this whole thing shifted from here to here right this play flex always shifts it from left to right it's always going to make a direction from left to right okay all right and if you guys want some really good uh flex so i'm gonna say uh flex display flex flex box right here if you guys go to just type in flex box you will see css tricks this is probably the best uh thing for you to launch css flexbox okay nice uh next up i'm gonna say display flex and then after display flex what am i going to do where it's very uh i want to make sure that this actual header is full width so i'm gonna say right inspect i'm on this one and if i inspect them you guys will see something right you see this logo right here and here's my header right currently the width of it is 960 pixels by 36. now question to you what do i need to do to make sure that this kind of about services projects it's all you know kind of like you know spread out as much as possible what do you guys think anybody know anybody know if i go to my flexbox how do i put them to the side look at this if i do just justify content what do you think is the right justified content to use here anybody know is it flex start is it flex end is if space between what do you guys think that's right philip it would actually be space between so if i do like this if i say justify content space between if i save this boom right there see now a sudden this is now on the right hand side basically what this allows us to do is put as much space in between these as possible right here right that's that's pretty much it the next thing we're going to do is i'm going to give the header a height i'm going to say a height or 40 pixels save that okay that makes the sunny side look a little bit bigger as well okay then i'm going to give it a small padding so i'm going to say patty left putting right heading left is going to be for 10 pixels and then padding right temp is as well right so that pushes the logo more to the right hand side just makes it gives a little more space which is what i like okay next thing i want to show you something okay if i go ahead and i want to make sure that right uh this is horizontally aligned or vertically aligned and so is this vertically aligned well i'm gonna say just the kind of space between but i'm also going to say align items center so you can see now the sunny side is aligned center right here and so is this one now how do we know that if i right click on it by inspect element you see the header you see how everything is aligned vertically very nicely there we go that's exactly what we want one to do now next thing is the menu okay we've got that that's so good let's talk about the menu now all right if i go to my menu here where's my menu here there's my menu right here you see let's go to menu here so i'm gonna say that menu my new my new inside the menu i also you see how the reason why this contact is on the bottom is because it's a different div block you see these are all little blocks and this is a different block making it push all the way to the bottom now who knows how to make sure that this is a contact is on the right hand side not at the bottom anybody know i'll look at my flex direction how do i make sure that this is on the right side not not top to bottom what do i do guys that's right i will use display flex so if i simply just say display flex on it boom right there see much much much better by the way it went from left to right just like that let's say guys you see just that it went from left to to right okay beautiful next thing i'm going to give it a small font size i'm going to say font size here font size of 20 pixels let's make it a little bit bigger i'm going to give it a color of white say that nice and then i'm going to do in a way where um i'm gonna give it margin so for every single menu item here i'm gonna give it this a margin so margin those you don't know margin is a space to the righthand side margin space around it so for example if i have a block here okay this is let's say this is a div okay this is a dip anybody know what i use to create spacing inside the div what do i use anybody know that's right i use padding this will be padding now what if i want to create spacing outside the div that's right it will be margin right okay that'll be margin so in my case if i want to for example if i want to push about away from services what would i use what i use anybody know marginal right that's right so what i can do here is i'm going to say that menu i'm going to say span now the way i'm doing is the following i'm saying hey i want you to target the span items inside the dot menu class if you look at it that menu right and the span is inside the menu class right it's like it's like a tree it's almost like a tree structure and you're all you're doing is just targeting the tree structure going down the tree that's it beautiful someone say span and i'll say margin right margin right is going to be uh what is it 30 i'm going to say 30 pixels no not 20 30. 30 pixels yeah that's about good okay we've got that portion that looks amazing let's now now let's focus on the contact button okay this content button looks a little needs to look a little bit different of course um and so we're gonna make that look a little different now for the contact button let's do that if all i have to do for this specific one is is honestly nothing crazy right this contact if you look at it is all this is just a box just a box right here with some curved edges so i'm going to now conte i'm going to focus on the contacts i'm saying dot uh contact like this dot contact and i'm going to give the background color background color of white right i'm going to give it a padding now here's a really cool thing i want to show you something so here's our background color you see it's it's right away it's just you know it covers up the whole text beautiful but if i change up the color to now be black so color is going to change the color of the text boom done right so now we have a black text which is amazing nice okay after that what i want you guys to figure out is the following so if i for example if i um i want to go ahead and add some spacing so in order for me to expand this white color right here right here i need to add spacing on the inside to push the actual button away it's weird i want you guys to really understand this it's like you're pushing for on the inside to make the actual button bigger it's weird you guys wanna you guys it kind of it might take some time to understand but if i say like this padding i'm going to give it a horizontal pedal for so vertical padding first so this is gonna be four pixels and then horizontal is 15 pixels like this so this is a shortcut for the following four pixels is top and bottom padding it's a shortcut 15 pixels is left 15 pixels and then the right 15 pixels guys just so you guys understand okay it's a shortcut for you know for saying individually padding left putting right not necessary for this one beautiful we got that then uh since we have that i'm going to give it a border radius i'm going to say border dash radius that's going to be around 15 pixels boom so look at this now the button looks looking a lot a lot better beautiful all right but i'm not i'm not kind of done yet i want to give a few things one for the actual uh span or the actual header you see how this right here is not aligned vertically this is more at the top this is more at the bottom there's no vertical alignment so to do that anybody know how to use vertical align you know two diffs together anybody know how to do that it's using flex but what kind of element do we use if you look at my effects direction if you want to align something vertically what do we use here we use a line that's right a line out of center that's right so i'm going to go back to my here and i will say here the following i'm gonna say for the menu and i will say align items center now watch watch the the menu boom you see i'll shift it just a little bit just a little bit of shifted not too much but it just will just just a little bit uh another thing i want to do is i want to give uh the actual um header some more padding so i'm going to say instead of tempo i'm going to say 20 pixels pending right it's going to be no not 20 pixels as well just to make a little more spacing i like to give spacing just really important i think okay for the header and then i'm going to say um height is going to be not 40 pixels but it's actually going to be 60 pixels oh 960. there you go much much better right so it's a little bit a little bit more better on the eyes nice okay and that's pretty much it my friends that's pretty pretty much it okay we've got that now i wanna i wanna focus now on this contact button i wanna make it a little more interactive so when i click on it when i hover over it feels like it's a button right to do that i'm gonna say cursor pointer right so right now you see now when i hover over this it feels like a pointer you see there's an actual point there's actual hand making sure that it's a button but i can even make it better i can change the color on the hover so for example if i say like this without contact and i say on the hover of this button i can actually do something to it i can change the color i can choose background color instead of white i can do like antique white just a little a little bit off white so now if i over this you see now it's a little bit less white you see that so more like antiques more like yellowish white and i can even add a transition to it so if i do transition zero point two five seconds and that by the way is like a really good standard for for if you want to do hovers um and then all and then uh traditional all you can say is in out you see now it's a much nicer let's make the even 0.2 seconds boom boom you see it's a much nicer button everybody see that yes or no so you change the color just a little bit better now you guys see the yes yeah that's awesome i'm glad you're keeping up sam that's amazing beautiful so now we have our header guys we've got the header done that's it the header is right there our next session section we're gonna work on is gonna be this we are creative section which is all of this portion right here we are creatives okay so let's focus now on this section to make sure it's a little bit better all right go to my here contact button all right awesome all right to make this one section all we do is i'm going to create another div also inside the um not the header but inside the actual banner so you have the banner right here you see that right we have the header again which maps to the header and underneath the header i'm going to create another div called main div class is equal to main boom done df class main okay okay after that i'm going to do a few things one i'm going to create this text we are creatives for this text i'm going to also use a span a span is a lot of times used to just simply stylize a piece of text that's it so if i do span here and i say we we are creatives boom done spend is done right now i'm going to give this pen a class here is equal to i'm going to say text right because i want to stylize later on and then after that i'm going to use this image this arrow image this kind of image arrow image which kind of looks like a little bit like this image you see that right there so i'm going to say image image i'm going to say class class i'm going to say arrow arrow okay and then it will say source is equal to some kind of a source again if you want to go to the source let's go back to my github page you guys should have the github again link down description page arrow right here so let's go ahead and click command c on this arrow beautiful and paste it in right there oh save that let's go back to our sunny side hey there we go look at this we got i mean it looks horrible but it's okay guys you know let's fix this we are creatives and here's the arrow right everybody see that yes or no everybody's still with me give me a thumbs up yes yes yes yes everybody thumbs up yes yes yes yes everybody's still with me yes or no good awesome now a few things we have we are creating the lefthand side and then this arrow on the right hand side right what do i need to do well it's very simple what do you need to do in order to make sure that it's actually not from left to right now but it's actually from top to bottom now it's going to it's going to change your viewpoint on display flex actually it's alright it's very interesting well the way we do that is actually uses the call something called flex direction so if i go to my stylus css right i'm going to say here dot uh now i heard the menu but we're going to say dot main right boom display flex fine but instead of flex direction row which is what makes it from left to right like this i'm going to say clock column flex direction column right so that oh look at that [Laughter] don't worry guys we'll fix it we'll fix it okay but you see now we are creatives is at the top this arrow which is huge all of a sudden it's just at the bottom all right right so now for this one what do we do well in order to make this a little bit smaller a few things i'm now going to align it um how do i say this i'm going to light it now uh horizontally to do that i will say align items center boom there we go see once i put an alignment to it it right away went back to its normal shape it's as simple as that right beautiful next up after flight line items i'm going to now center her vertically i'm going to say i'm going to say the following which is going to be justify content right now and nothing happened there's a reason why nothing happened okay and i'll explain to you in a second here why but i'm going to do a font size here in a second here so i'm going to say do font size here uh 40 pixels maybe maybe 50 i would say just so this is where is a little bit bigger now if you remember correctly align items was used for vertical alignment from top top to bottom just like content was used for horizontal alignment left to right right but one thing you guys need to understand is that when you flip the direction the flex direction from row to column you flip the meaning of the line items and the meaning of just the content now align items is used for left right direction and the justify content is used for top to bottom alignment so you flip the alignment when you do flex direction column you flicks you flip the column you flip the alignment everybody makes sense beautiful nice now why is it the case that uh this is not a line centered well if i right clicked on this look at this guys look like what do you see we have this main section let me go and make this a little bit bigger so you guys can see this let me see here there we go there we go right if you guys can see it right here right we have this banner that's the whole height we have the header we have the main and the main you see the height of the main is very small it's only basically as much as it can grow but in order for me to fix that here's what i can do i can actually expand this main to be the full page height look check this out guys if i say the following header main if i tell the banner that hey the banner is actually display flex check this out for the banner i will say display flex flex i know it just went to don't worry about it okay display flex but instead of display flags again because display flex makes it from left to right so what do we do we go from top to bottom i'm gonna say flex direction now column oh beautiful you see it went back to normal but this is where the trick is i can now go to my main section and i can say the phone i can say flex grow one check this out remember how when i right click on this you see this how this main section was only 174 pixels high you see when i'm highlighting this this the height is very small well look at this value flash one if i say this boom what just happened what just happened is very cool is this mean grew as much as possible right the main section grew as much as possible so what i did is i have the header which does not grow in height the header has a static height of only 60 pixels right here right here but then with the main section i said here with the main section i want you to grow it as much as possible with flex scroll one so because of that now this is the full height the main such as the full height and now i can use align items and justify content to align them vertically very nicely and horizontally very nicely so right when you guys are doing html css especially with flexbox guys it's all about just taking a bunch of boxes and fitting stuff into the boxes that is it you guys with me give me a thumbs up yes thank you lamont thank you everybody great all right awesome so we got that next up let's go and change the we are creatives to be uh white okay i'm not going to this okay now let's change the color to white all right now the color is white and let's also give it a bold so i'm gonna say font weight i'm saying bold beautiful we are created found away bold okay i'm going to give it a 60 pixels a maybe even 70 pixels ah let's look at that so it's a little bit bigger all right i'm also going to stretch out this uh arrow button so i'm going to say this arrow i'm going to give it a little margin so if i go now back to my here here's my main section and i see that this is the main section we have the image here and class arrow so if i do that arrow and somebody tell me do we use padding or do we use margin for this somebody tell me i want to push the button uh the arrow down what do we use guys anybody to know what do we use that's right stamp we use margin and what kind of marker do we use top or bottom margin what top that's right top say margin top and the only margin i want to use for this one is margin top of 30 pixels i just say maybe it's 40 pixels there we go see module 4 i can even do 60 pixels maybe let's make it let's give it more space right there we are creatives margin top so now it looks a little bit more like this like this you see if i want to make it look even more like this i just you see how this button is needs to be a little bit bigger so i can do it like this i can go to my back to my contact info i can say 4 pixels i can say maybe 8 pixels and then this might be for example 30 pixels 30. oh right there and i could give it maybe more of a better race which is like 20 pixels nice look at that guys looking so much better now so much better oh so good so good also on the span you see how it doesn't feel like it's it's a it's a link it doesn't feel like it's a link so what i want to do is i want to give it a cursor pointer save that and now it's more of a link see that right there so guys we have the banner fully complete now okay the banner fully complete okay but after that let's work on this next section which is going to be this section transform your brand okay this is also the really interesting portion okay let's go ahead and do that let's go back to this html the section this section right here now working on is called the section one that's right so this section has a few a few things one what do we have we have left and we have right two dips okay two dips we want to create okay let's do that right now so inside here i'm going to say div class is equal to what left and then the right there is going to be div class right so i'm going to say div class is equal to right boom right there df class right okay beautiful inside those two there's a few things that we need to work on well inside the left section inside the left one what do we have we have the transform your brand so let's do that right now i'm gonna say h1 i'm gonna give it a heading of h1 i'm gonna say transform form what your brand beautiful right transform your brand awesome inside the h1 after that we have a p tag right and all this is just a bunch of text and i'm going to copy this text and you guys can use this text if you want but for those on youtube you guys just can go ahead there we go there we go right i gave you guys a text inside zoom chat boom here's a text so we are fully services creative agency uh specializing in helping brands grow fast engage your clients through compelling visuals that do most of the marketing for you that's it so that's our ptech now if i look at this right here right if i look at this right here um what do we expect well pretty much um nothing crazy so let me do that right now hey there we go there it is [Laughter] it is nothing crazy right so um yeah that's okay that's okay now let's do it like this one other thing i want to change is as i'm doing this is going to be you see this vertical height maybe a bit too much i'm going to say like this style of css let's go back to our banner i'm going to change this to about maybe instead of 80 i'm going to say 880 reage right here so now it's a little bit you know a lot less kind of daunting and if you actually want to give it like a min height here's what you can do so for example if i inspect element on this one this is a really cool trick you want to do so adh is almost like 80 of the height of the browser right let's take a look at what is the minimum height we are able to give it like 500 i would say 600 minute height so let's do that right now 600 minimum height so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say min height min height of 600 pixels boom right that way if i make if this becomes really small you see it will never get smaller than 600 pixels you see that but it will always extend to as much as it wants right so that's the really cool trick for you guys if you guys want to check that out okay cool so we got that portion that looks great let's talk about the transform your brand well the left and the right section a little bit weird so let me do that right now okay after we do test from your brand we need to add the learn more button which is this button right here on the on the left hand side so let's do that i'm going to put it into a deal okay just so we have it is a is a box okay put into a div and then inside the hem let's give it an image image source is equal to what is equal to a learn more button again let's go to github arrow is right here no not this arrow learn more is right here copy learn more let's put it into our image source right here make sure you close out the image and put it right there save that hey there we go beautiful so it's looking pretty good like i said nothing too crazy all right now after that we need to divide up the div the class the right and the on the right and the left and the right next up let's go and create an image for the right section i'm gonna say image class is equal to uh i'm just saying no class actually image let's say source do something close at the image now inside that of course let's go ahead and go back to our images which is right here and we're going to look at the egg i call it the egg i call it the egg image guys okay in resource the egg save that and you can see now again it's nothing crazy okay we always start out with the base stuff which is the base structure and of course we can modify this now so don't worry so much about that we have div class left diff class right beautiful now within this a few things i want to i want to focus on all right number one for this image source i have to put it somehow on the right hand side i have to make sure that that this section is left inside like this and then we have a right hand side like this well uh this is not the easiest thing to do actually i mean it's kind of the easy kind of knot instead what we'll do is well we're gonna do like this for every single section yes that's right sam display flex so for section one let me say that section one section one i'm gonna say display flex say that boom you see went from left to right but again again uh julio very close okay we want to give it a 50 here and 50 here that's gonna be the hard part okay how do we do that well um first i'm gonna give it a section every single section gonna give it a specific height i'm gonna say height of maybe let's just say height of what 350 pixels okay i'm around that okay for section one just something something like this okay and then after this what will happen here yeah there we go that's that looks good okay after that what i want to do is actually um i'm giving i'm going to give every single left and right a specific kind of like weight you'll and you'll see what i mean here in a second here so if i go to my if i if i do my left section look at this guys i say flex one see and then what i'm going to do is a comma dial right next one as well don't worry about it don't worry about it we'll fix that in a second here we'll fix that okay so if i right click click on this one inspect element okay let me see here i'm going to give my image a width of 100 so i'm gonna say image that's section one section one i'm gonna say image and let's go ahead and give it a width of a hundred percent oh see right there so you can see now actually there's an equal divide right right so there's an equal divide between here and here it's pretty much 50 percent you guys see that it's 50 percent see that for the image i'm also going to say the following width is 100 i'm going to say the height is also 100 is also 100 okay right there and then what i'm going to do is i'm going to say object fit object fit cover boom what does that mean well it means a few things object cover means basically that we are going to make sure that this full width uh the image takes up as much width as possible inside this little div that's what that means just so you guys know way some of the amount of you somebody unmuted themselves so if you guys can mute the other person that'll be great looks like something i mean themselves just interesting not sure how that happened but it did happen okay so awesome we got that portion guys that's good object fit cover now let's focus on this transform your brand okay there's a lot needs to happen here to make this fully work for the transform your brand what i want to do is one we need to add a little bit of spacing so there's a lot of space on the left hand side a lot of space in the right hand side uh we can make that work don't worry let's go to my inside html beautiful now i'm going to limit the actual width of this whole thing so let's take a look at this if i look at my section one my left section right here i will go to my that so section one left so that's section one that left right i will say that the width for this one is maybe going to be about 80 or 70 potentially boom oh percent save that let's go back to our go here let me see does it actually work out let me see here inspect down my section one left left let me see here okay i think i know why because what i need to do is i need to put a container around this whole thing so i'm going to say give a container i'm going to say div day of class is equal to i'm going to say text container boom i'm going to put everything that's inside this left into the test container why because i want this text container to actually be smaller than the full left right if this right here if this right here is left and this is the left oops and this three is the left class right here i want to create this container that's going to maintain it like this you see that's going to be the text container this right here is the text container and this right here is the left class that's right so we do that for a few reasons sometimes beautiful we got that that means if i do section one i say text container you'll see what i mean click on thinner boom you see not just for your brain is is a much smaller okay now what does that mean for me well that means that now inside the text container i can do the following i can do i can do not on the section one dot left i can do dot section one dot left i can say display flex right i can i can align it vertically like this align items center you see now it's in the center and then i can do just the content center right there look i see right so what we just what did we just do well all we did is we create a few buttons right so if i go ahead and look at this we are we have this whole thing right we have this right here is left just make sure you guys understand this is left class then we create a test container right again it's all about boxes guys if you're great in making boxes in html you're professional developer that's it right this right here is a text container you see what i mean because if the test container is its own box it will control how everything inside of it will look like that's it so it will control how everything of this stuff will look like that's it see what i mean that's what we did next up let's focus on the actual uh the the heading inside uh the h1 right so let's do that right now okay i'm gonna focus on the heading let's go ahead and go to this html let's go back to my content here beautiful all right i like it let's go ahead and go to dot section one the left at each one so i'll do the following i'm gonna say that left h1 and i'm going to give it a little bit of a bigger uh font size so font size maybe 30 pixels i love h1 maybe more yeah it's a bit better transform your brand right that's kind of how we have it right here transform your brand right beautiful uh i'm going to give it okay after that i'm going to give it a a specific uh margin bottom so margin bottom i would say 8 pixels all right to push out to the bottom you see that just from your brand push it at the bottom beautiful then we have um what do we have we have then this specific text which if you guys take a look at it right the text is actually has a different color right it has a different color it's necessary black it's like grey so if i zoom in on this one if i zoom in i want you guys to check it check this out if i do uh color picker i have something called color slurp right here i'm gonna get the color of this one see here's the color right here boom so i'll just copy the the the the color of the pp so i'm gonna say that left p tag i'm gonna say color boom let me see here there we go so now if i go back to my thing see that's the color right here beautiful right much much much better beautiful and of course i wanna you see how it's more of like a it's a number one it's a different font size as well and also it has a different line height so here's what we'll do now okay i'm gonna say line height one point one point three pixels let me see here nope too much i'm gonna say 10 pixels nope let's go to 1.3 just maybe like this there we go so line height 1.3 right so this decrease increase the line height a little bit more and i'm going to give it a font size of ariel font um font family i'm just going to say give it a aerial font right there ariel boom so it's a little bit different now i see that guys it's a little bit different now beautiful so fun family aerial that's what we did right here and now let's focus on this button which is so humongous right now this learn more button right learn more button that's what we're going to focus on now okay uh to make that really pretty much work it's it's not honest actually it's not that crazy if i called a deaf class is equal to button button right here save that let's go back to my css and i will say default i will say that left that left and i will say a button let's say that button actually dab button means you're you're talking to the class okay that button what's gonna happen is the following i will go ahead and i say display flex and check this out the button is going to decrease size right away wait is it not let me see here let me see here got the button okay oh okay i know why because we need to go ahead and make sure it's a light so if we do not align item center you'll see now we'll decrease so if i center it vertically then it will decrease so say align items center see here still not it i think it's a little bit too big of a button maybe let me see you guys here hmm maybe i thought it goes in image so it is an image yeah but i mean the container is a button so the container is a button right here so this container right here just to let you guys know this container here is a button so let me show you this is a button and there's an image inside the button you see what i mean i'm just trying to make sure this button gets a little bit smaller because i don't like that that said the clash should be in the image not div not necessarily not necessarily so let me let me try this one second here so if i go ahead and do this if i say maybe now okay dal left let's call it image okay i'm gonna give it a specific width get a width of like maybe let's just say 30 pixels see now it's gonna be a lot smaller right i'm gonna give it a high width of 100 of like let's just say 100 pixels more maybe like 150. yeah much better right there so you guys so so yeah good call on that sam yeah i think i see what you mean i think it is because you made it the width of all images 200 okay i did not make the images of all images of 100 but it does assume that this image is 100 now next what i'll do is i'll get the margin bottom so i'm going to say margin for the actual uh button i'm like for the p tag or maybe the margin bottom to also push to learn more so now it kind of looks like this guys it looks very similar so we have right here and you see there's more space in here so i can do that i can do a lot more spacing here so i can do a margin bottom instead of eight piece i can do like 16 pixels same thing goes for the the ptex 16 pixels right there boom much better i'm going to give a little more space again on the line height as well so maybe like 1.8 right here guys look at that it's a lot more cleaner a lot better now so now we have our first section it looks great look at that and you see and it's always square as well it's always square that's the cool part it's always square that's the cool part about it okay all right next portion guys you guys ready next portion is going to be the the one i want to focus on is necessarily this one because this one is the same you guys i want to give you this this one this one is going to be for your homework right here so this one's going to be for your homework this section is the same as this section except you flip left instead of left this is going to be this the left section is now the image is the right section so the only difference is just you flip it that's it okay i want to focus on this section now so let's go ahead and do that okay section two section two which is this section okay all right and this one is again nothing too crazy i'm going to create section two section section two uh that's gonna be left and right so let's go ahead and do inside here this we have a div class is equal to left then we have another one called the class is equal to what right beautiful right there see div class left div class right okay guys everybody got that nice and and all it is is honestly it's just two images it's nothing crazy guys it's just two images inside that so if i do an image here image class boom and i'm going to use the berries are called the graphic design image the cherries i'm going to copy this one okay image image not class image source actually image source is equal to this okay now we have another image source is equal to the which one the let me see here let me look at the github the photography one this one let's close out this image and so let me see how this looks like well i mean we got two images basically okay yeah one is here and then we have another one that looks like it's not working for some reason let me see here i'm sure it's all good i'm sure that's all images all good clementine looks like it's not able to go for some reason let me see here did i not copy it correctly no okay that's okay i can figure this one out if i just copy it from here right here here's another one for you guys what the hell why is that working hmm i may have moved temporarily to a new address hmm okay all good so i can actually see the image so here's what i can do for you guys let's make sure to for us to make sure the image actually works i used it used to work for some reason but it's not working right now it's okay we can do without this image or we can actually upload this image so somebody says mine is working hmm let's see i'll try one more time here boom trying to refresh a few times not necessarily interesting okay well so here's what i can do in that case a few things i can actually upload the image to a different way so i'm going to say image url upload so you guys can all have it because i'm sure you guys do have it right here i think this is a lot more um mmhmm let me see here let's see i'm going to open this other image for you guys you guys can can get it let me see come on why is this not working now here there we go i'm going to upload this image for you right here save image as just stay with me here for a second download limiter right here copy image address i'm gonna edit actually in here right away photography boom i make sure it's actually working that's the one right there good good good good good good good good good good good good good so now i'll go go to my github page you guys should see the change here in a second here there we go save changes beautiful all right guys you guys and i have a new image okay guys everybody you guys have the new image so let's go ahead and copy this one if you if yours does not work boom save that let me see that works and it's oh come on really all right it's okay i i'll figure it out differently in the way all right it's not working no worries so same thing guys is gonna happen here guys all we're going to do is we'll say left and right so here's what i'll do for you is for the left section why is it not working it's so weird i have the image it's like right there look at see it's opens up no problem but if i open it up inside my project folder it's not opening up for some reason no worries that's weird okay same thing we want to make sure that that the left and the right hand section are both equal guys so what we're going to do i will go to my style.css same thing i will do left and right flex one right so flex one to make sure it's actually fully the way it is um that left image okay looks like that's all good with 100 width over 150 pixels let me see here no div image right here so what i want to do now in this case is kind of the following right if if this is graphic design i'm going to inspect them on this one okay we have section two okay left and then right okay great i'm going to give section two also a height a specific height so let's go to section one and let's go ahead comma section two that way they both have the same uh the same flex boom so section 132 are both height of 100 350 pixels and so forth okay let me right click on this again one more time i have section two okay great the left section is this right section is this for some reason it's not you know the way it is but it's okay what we're going to do is for the left section is i'm going to say um the left i'm going to say that left image is going to be what that left image is going to be um width of 100 there you go and then there we go see and then the height is also 100 there we go right and i will say object fit cover object fit cover there we go right and hopefully this image this image comes back to work at some point later on but basically we have now these two images we have transform your brand learn more okay awesome one thing i want to do is just learn more you guys can see how this learn more is not an actual clickable button so we want to make that happen too so what i can do to make that happen is to learn more is just simply again it's just simply an image and if you look look at the button see this class style button all i can do is do the dab button section i can do a cursor pointer right there cursor pointer right here so now if i wrote this it's a cursor pointer there we go and so now it's a very simple button that we can use beautiful after this after this uh i want this image to work for some reason guys but it's not where else can we put it where else can we use this image how else can i get this image copy image address i'm sure i pasted it correctly what if i use the same image here hold on cherries two cherries all right we got two cherries okay that's fine all right i'm gonna see you says i want to say left and right so you see how we did the left image is with 100 i'm gonna say now the reason why again the right image is trying to take over as much as possible is because we're not saying the image should be width of 100 right so i'm going to say now i'm going to say right of image right here right there you see so now again two of the same images pretty much okay again i will replace those images with the right image but what we did is the following when you had when you were when you separate two classes between a comma it's applying the same style to these two classes okay the first one is the left image which is going to target the left image right the second is going to be the right image it's going to target the right image everybody see that yes or no right beautiful thank you awesome sweet so i'm not sure why that thing is not working try something try different browser yeah somebody said mine is working as well that's that's so weird i don't know why copy image address let me go back to here no does not like it anyways it's okay we keep going guys it's okay so we got that portion guys we got this now let's put in the client testimonials guys okay let's work on the client testimonials section all right all right the client is somewhere section and that one is a little bit also that one is not easy one to do because we have a few buttons over who have a few sections that we need to create together all right and those are the following so if i go ahead and do now div class section three so i'm gonna say give class now it's equal to section three and i'll also like to call testimonials so i'm going to say testimonial i'm going to give it two two classes testimonials that's right right there so click save awesome see we got that inside testimonials of course a few things one well one we have as default we have this is a header right here h1 so i'm going to secret an h1 right here i'm going to say it's called test client testimonials client client testimonials right you see that save that beautiful after that let's go ahead and create another div that's going to contain all of these different you know clients right it's going to be right here's how we think about it right if i'm going to create this myself without even creating the html always draw it out guys always draw it out somebody said oh section 3 thank you very much section 3 actually thank you very much always draw it out so i'm going to create a container around it and inside the container we have three dips one two three that's it right that's it section one section two section three thank you guys i changed it to section three appreciate that all right we kinda we got that right now now inside the h1 after each one let's create a df called div class is equal to what is equal to div class um i'm gonna say it's gonna be clients beautiful that's gonna be the container right the container can be the client's container right and inside that we have one client so it's going to it's going to create our first client here i'm going to say div class is equal to what it's going to be diff class client boom inside here inside the client what do we have guys so decline what do we have inside the client what do we have inside the client we have the following which is what we have what we have one we have this image right we have this image inside the cloud we have this image and then we have what we have in this paragraph all right then we have some details around the author who wrote it right so if i put this into html what do we have we have one is we have the image so it's going to create the image so image source is equal to what boom now the source okay this source right here is what right if i look at my source if i go to my friends if i go to my github the client image is this one right here so this one is going to be this client hopefully this one works as well let me see fingers crossed ah come on this does not work either maybe i need to open this in a different browser guys let's see i'm going to open this in different browser these images sometimes are just wonky let me see this is no not the way it's supposed to be no again that's all right guys that's okay no problem so what we can do now at this point is we can make that a little better i can actually get a specific image so all you have to do is just get an image of of a person so i'm going to say random person image okay let's just i know that's a little what we've got to right now at this point okay let's just say we have random posts like this image for example i'm going to save this image i'm going to save this image so you can save use any image guys i'm going to say save image uh as save to downloads right here beautiful save the downloads awesome we got that so that's all you need to do after that let's go back to our html right here nice all right for the client testimonials again we have the image after the image guys we have what the p text or p tag that's going to be description about what the client said right so the client said what the client said looks like a few of these and i have what the client said actually i can copy and paste this for you so you guys have it right here so p tag if you're on youtube feel free to just copy this and paste it for yourself okay and then after that we have the details i'm gonna say div class is equal to what details boom in the details a few things we have one the name so h2 right i'm going to call it emily emily r right and then after h2 what do we have we have the what the h4 so i'm gonna circle nh4 and that h4 is going to be what marketing director director save that beautiful so now if i have one client okay i'm gonna go and save this right here let's look at what we got we got a bunch of stuff and some weird stuff okay it's okay what i want you guys to do is create a new folder here now it's called assets okay and we're gonna take this image of a person that we got guys take this image and put it into the assets folder so now we have this hit enter i'm gonna say client one boom client one dot jpg okay so now we have a specific client a picture inside here beautiful all right okay again i'll show this to you guys so we can go ahead and you know you guys don't need the actual image links okay guys because under the image looks a little onekey little weird so it's all right instead of this source i'm going to say assets right here and see client1.png so now right there you see client1 now because it's now a square image we need to make it into a circle now to make it a circle who knows how to make an image into a circle anybody know i'm going to create a div class client image anybody know how to make it an image into a circle anybody know anybody how border that's right julia border radius yes that's right actually border width is 50 so for example if i have my client image check this out guys i'm going to have my client image and i'm going to get a specific width let's just say i'm going to say let's go to stylus css and i'm going to give it a specific width of let's just say this the client image oop right there and i'm going to say a width off let's just say uh 50 pixels and height of 50 pixels right there okay now nothing really changed because the image is still width of 100 you see we have this small image it's right there but the image itself is just humongous but we can change that i'll change this to 80 actually for now for let's change it to 80 changes to 80. okay then what i'll do is the following i will say dot client image check this out the image inside that i'm gonna say it's width of a hundred percent and height of a hundred percent okay that way you see my border my actual uh let me show to you my actual for example a client image is you know is this small and then i'm telling the image inside of it to fit this border to fit this div i save this boom you see that now you can see now it's stretched out you see how this is stretched out that's not what we like so to fix that as well too to fix that i will do like this i will say object object fit cover no cover boom much better now you see now this is images a little bit small good i can change that so i'm going to say the following let's say border radius fifty percent and look even if i put border radius nothing happened guys nothing have if i put border radius on why is that the case everybody know why is that the case because why because what's happening is even though i put this border radius to make it into a circle the actual image is gonna is coming outside the circle it's overflowing so what i do is i need to say overflow hidden boom guys look at this you see now my friends we have what we have my friends a what a circle that's it a circle you see that's it you have a circle okay great great great next thing what i want to do is for this clan distinction we got a circle beautiful but i want to center all this kind of stuff i want to kind of center it to make sure it's all good it's all good and dandy uh first things first let's go ahead and go to our client testimonials and if i go look at my little cheat sheet here i got okay all right beautiful left and right left and right section two section three nice okay beautiful all right so now at this point if i go to my html i have my testimonials i'm going to give my testimonials a specific height guys okay let's go ahead and do that so i will give uh the testimonials section testimonials right one that's that let's say that testimonials the testimonials the manuals okay testimonials uh uh number one i wanna give a specific height but also number two i want to make sure that um it's kind of center you know it's there's some space in here so let's let's try that right now so i'm gonna do the following i'm gonna say one um display flex flex right because i want to take it from title button right so again from left to right but if i want to do from top to bottom what do i do guys anybody know what do i do to make it top to bottom anybody know what i do you guys tell me tap the bottom now let's try but touch the bottom what do i know what i do somebody tell me switch sides okay yes but what with using what using what flex flex direction so look column see again it's not top to bottom as well again then what i will do is i will do uh align item center to center horizontally boom there you go see client testimonials now next up i'm going to get the image the color of this contestimonial so if i if you go ahead and do a color slurp for example if i do this if you look at it here right boom right now copy the specific hex i'm going to give the dot testimonials the h1 on this one a color of this you guys can go ahead and copy this for yourselves as well boom okay awesome so now if i go back to here here's my classimonials i'm going to decrease the size the size a little bit to about 16 or 18 pixels boom maybe it's about 20 pixels actually 20 is good too point's good too awesome sweet so we've got that portion let's go ahead and give it a margin top margin top of a bottle is just say 30 pixels boom okay client just amount of 30 pixels awesome and then let's give it a margin bottom of about i would say 40 pixels beautiful awesome sweet next up um we need to focus on the actual client itself so what do we have one is what we have is this color if you look at this color background guys it's already different so this whole color you see it's different color it's ff bff it's not fully white it's like a grayish color so you guys need to notice this one too you see it's a grayish color which makes a big difference so for going on testimonials again i'm going to say background color is this right here ffffbf8 so you guys can kind of copy that for yourself ffffbf8 okay guys now if i go to my here there it is ffffbf8 beautiful i love it next up next up is going to be the actual testimonial itself so like i said what do we have well uh if you look at it we have these box this box this box this box so for one what do we use in order to align the boxes inside this coal client thing what do you guys think what do you guys think anybody anybody what do you guys think it's gonna be what display what display yes but display what display flex that's right so if i go ahead and go to display flex i will go to my uh client so you can see there's my client within my client so if i go to clients dot clients i'm going to give display flex that's part one right and then within my clients i'm gonna i'm gonna do clients dot client i'm going to focus on one client now that client that's going to be display flex but which direction guys display flex flex but which direction can anybody know which direction are we all using this to go from top to bottom anybody know tap the button is what direction what direction anybody it is that's right column so flex direction column beautiful so now if i go back to my piece of code nothing really changed here right nothing really changed that's okay okay my individual client i'm gonna give it a flex of 0.3 look at this so i said basically give it about a 30 percent width almost okay right inside the flex direction column i'm going to make sure it's all center horizontal so i'm saying align items center right there see now everything is centered beautiful nice then within that i'm going to center the p tag so if i go to my dot client dot client p tag i'm gonna say text align center boom see now this is a line center next up what's missing here guys what is the big thing that's missing here guys right now anybody know what is the big thing that's missing here anybody know what is it well it's honestly just spacing we need to space this out a lot a lot better so one for the client i'm gonna focus now on the actual uh client image so that client image right here the client that client image i'm gonna give it a margin bottom oh 16 pixels boom good so it's a little bit more like this okay then i'm going to again we can always expand that i'll expand that with the client.p also margin bottom margin bottom also 16 pixels beautiful right then we have this emily r stuff then we have this kind of stuff right here so we have details we need to center that horizontally as well so i'm going to say here that client dot details okay and i'm going to say what text the line here center center boom you see now emily are centered and then so as marketing director is also also centered okay beautiful so we got that portion i'm going to space it out a little bit more now okay space out a little bit more and what i want to do is kind of like this so i'm going to say like this i'm going to say um margin bottom not 16 but let's just give it a 30 pixels and 30. 30. boom right there much much better much better okay and you see how we have spacing here you add spacing here at the bottom too so here's the cool part if i have here my clown testimonials which is going to be the header to each one and i have my margin top instead of doing that this is really cool i can actually create padding for the whole testimonial section so look at this remove this margin tab for a second here instead of doing this i'm going to say dot is somewhere i'm going to say padding padding top of 30 pixels you see and then padding bottom of 30 pixels as well boom so now you can see it's pedal i can even do more i can do like 50 for example 50. boom so now it's a lot more spaced out a lot better it feels a lot cleaner all of that beautiful all right let's go back to what we have so far okay next up we need to change this text right here to be the text just how we have right here remember this text right here remember this text the same text uh uh way of this text so if you remember correctly right what do you remember correctly if you remember correctly i'm going to go back to my text of when i had my font arial right there i'm going to copy the color i'm going to copy the font family the line height and i go i'm going to give it to the p tag boom boom boom right there right so much much much better right okay now let's try this let's go ahead and copy the same client i'm going to just duplicate this client three times just for us to make it easier i'm going to copy this whole thing and duplicate three times one two save it a let's go right so we have three the same clients okay but now let's work on the actual alignment to make sure they're all horizontally centered and everything so if we have the client section you see you have three clients it's looking pretty good i would say so right three different clients i want to do number one this section right here needs to be centered horizontally anybody know how to do that anybody know how to do that if our parent if our parent right here is clients right how do we center horizontally let's take a look at it if i look at my actual what you want to check out a lot of times is just inspect them and see what's going on here so check this out i look at my client we have clients is the full width but client because it's 0.3 uh per you know 30 percent it's this this this right so it's it's all kind of stacked together now anybody know how do we center scenario horizontally in a way where it's spaced out evenly if you look at flex direction if you look at flex what do we use to space out evenly anybody know you guys tell me what do we use to space it out evenly you guys tell me what do we use here what do we use yeah we can use space evenly or we can even use space between which is fine too right we can use space between as well so what i will do here is i will go to clients so let's see i said we'll do go to clients and i will say display flex but i will say justify content space between save it let's see it now oh look at that much much much better right much better beautiful okay and now i'm going to add a little bit more padding on the left and the right hand side so remember how we had testimonials and we gave it a tap padding of bottom at top and bottom i'm also going to give a simple situation but for uh heading right so let's do padding left left it's going to be 50 pixels same thing with the padding right oh hey let's go see much much much better we've got some spacing around it and and so forth alright so there we go there's how it looks like let's of course let's uh change up the colors of the individual you know for example emily r and then marking director of course we need to change that up as well and we can do that right now one is ler that's fine that's i can see that's a bit of a text but for the marking director though the h4 so let's do that right now i'm gonna dot client h4 because remember the h4 comes from where it comes from here this is the h4 you see that so h4 boom h4 and i'm going to give it a different color i'm going to give this the same color as this right here color of this right here i'm actually going to give it a lighter color of this right here the a1 the h1 that we had before color there we go nice and i'm going to give it a little bit of more of a margin top margin top let's just say it's a margin top of maybe like 8 pixels beautiful and so now my friends there you go you have yourselves the testimonials okay we have three the same people you can actually change these people to be whatever whichever one you want maybe you can you change this text you change the text right here to the text that is actually in here and that's why i highly encourage you guys that when you go to this you actually go to you know the and create your landing page through here guys okay and actually download the the full details and the full images beautiful all right let's continue on my friends we're not very far away testimonials are done next section is going to be this section it's little like milk bottles that kind of stuff so anybody know how do we create this section for example anybody know here how to create a section like this anybody know how many divs do we need to create for let me show you for this section how many do we need to create tell me how many does anybody know how many divs that's right five that's right so one is going to be the container let's look at this container right here then we have one two three four you guys see that yes or no yeah good right so four five containers all together right now let's go ahead and do that right now i will go ahead and go to any html and after my section three testimonials i'm going to create and make sure you guys put your code in the right place the biggest thing that i see with a lot of people the biggest mistakes that the icpc people making is the following they will put the next div like somewhere inside here and they're wondering why their website is broken if your website is broken it is because you put the div in the wrong place right remember guys it's all like a tree you have section three i use i like to use this minimization tool right here right here i minimize it this tells this is the ending div and then that way i could just hit enter and then now i create a new div and i call it section four and i might call it a let's just say what should i call it guys what should i call this section for i should call it what i should call it someone says mine is broken yeah yours is broken because of the html structure okay you have to make sure that your html is correct guys and i'm gonna call it maybe um example images examples maybe that's what i'll call it beautiful and inside there's two images so we have four images we have div we have actually it's gonna be like this i'm also gonna be like image source right here then we have another image source right here boom they haven't have another image source right here okay then we have the last one right there everybody see that beautiful and that's that's pretty much it my friends right so we got that okay awesome sweet so we got that section okay um now let's go and copy some of these images i will go to my github here we have one the cone no actually the one that we have right now we need to copy is gonna be which one the milk bottles i call it the bottles right here copy this milk bottle right there base that in well let's see how this works out oh no does not show up as as well oh come on really okay next one's gonna be the orange let's see which one will work it's like a you know a guessing game will any of them work is my question nope does not work uh image you are you failed in the image you are you have filled me officially you have officially failed me let me see here no and then the last one probably does not work either somebody say use cherries i'll use the cherries one but i think it's better if we use the three separate ones so that's why guys i think you guys should go to front and mentor guys go to here i have recommended this right now go to here sign up download it if you when you sign up right here you sign up you just click download starter files this will give you all the image image files right here guys okay so sign up download it and that way here's what i can do because i have the actual files so here i'll go to my um downloads here i have my sunny side up right here i have my images right here and so i can actually put all these images inside you know where they need to be so i'm going to do this copy this put it into my assets folder so i encourage you guys to do that right now i encourage you guys to try that yeah i encourage you guys to try that so put the images just from you know the one that you got from the website right here so that way if i do image source the first one's gonna be the following so i'm gonna say assets but the with uh the milk bottle guys after that one it's gonna be what which one acids of what the orange oh last one is going to be which one the assets and that's going to be the the which one remember the cone there we go and then finally this one's going to be assets and then that's it's gonna be the sugar cubes right here save that let's see how that works out hey it's right there now it's very big that's okay guys that's okay you guys want the link to this guys feel free here here's a link by the way there you go just sign up and you'll get all the images you guys want okay beautiful next up so what do we want to do with this one now at this point well uh the following i have this example section right of course and we need to make it so that these all fit into the whole page evenly kind of top to bottom evenly okay to make that work if i go to style the css i'm going to say here i'm going to say dot what dot client dot um no not client but i'm gonna say the dot examples examples right and let's call display flex everybody right display flex right there see now they're all from left to right but of course they're too big we don't want that so i'm going to say dot examples dot examples ah image image okay beautiful um i'm gonna say the following guys there's four images in here okay if you guys know about images guys okay four images what is the width of every single image in that case 25 percent some say flex 0.25 okay i'm gonna say width hundred percent um or not necessarily let me see here right click inspect that one this one might be hard to set the width of 0.25 it's okay so here's what we'll do better okay here's the way a better way to do this so instead of doing images i'm going to wrap it with a div because then the image will will conform to the div so div okay right here i'm going to put this image in the div boom right here right i'm going to call this day of class of equal to example container just like this and i'll use the same exact div you see guys i'm showing you guys the exact way that a program would actually code right it's never perfect and there's always going to be times where you want to change something because something is now working the way it should be okay i'm going to put the image inside the div now how do i know how this is done how do i know the fact that i need to put the image at the div because you know otherwise it will not work properly well the way i know because i know an image is like it's a very funky one the images will basically stretch out as much as possible but to do i can control the width of a div much better right so div also diff clock container that's right guys i always encourage you guys this is this kind of stuff will always come from you know a lot of practice a lot of you know different doing a lot of different things and then it will just become the second nature to you today of class also gonna be container as well i just do it normally boop oh what i just do what i just do guys this one the cone the orange same one div class is equal to example container dash container container close that one out image source is this one right here boom see it guys everybody see it yes or no beautiful nice we got that let me go and see that let me see what will happen oh look at that it just went straight for it you guys see what happened here look at this it just automatically went into what we need to do right so like i said what happened is that we give it a flex so but i can't even do it with like it's a div here so div i'm not focusing the div i'm going to set the viv flag 0.25 then inside there i'm going to give it a inside the dm and say dot examples image of width 100 boom right there see and so there you go my friends that's how my friends you just go ahead and do this right you give the div it flex a 0.25 and you set the width image of 100 to fit the div so it's kind of like this we created this div let me show you we created a div around here and the image i told hey expand as much as you can to here that's it but the div has a flux of 0.25 meaning it is going to be 25 right this is going to be 25 this is 25 this is 25 so is this and so is this that means we're gonna have an equal width of images does that make sense yes or no makes sense comprende makes sense good let's continue on so so far we're doing really well guys i'm looking at the way going i'm going to replace this graphic design let me see here that's good it's fine so next up is going to be the footer guys we're almost done so close next is gonna be this footer so we have this right here let's create the footer to get the footer what do we do guys what div do we want to create to create the footer what is the class of the div we want to use anybody know is the class of the david want to use what do we use anybody i'm going to say df class yeah makes sense div class is equal to what order boom give class four just like that guys okay do a class footer okay now this still flexible has a few a few things if i zoom in for you right here if i zoom in somebody tell me what boxes am i going to to create for this footer anybody know what boxes am i going to create anybody what boxes am i going to create for this footer what do you guys think well what are you what is it that's well we have one that's here sunny side up right that's the logo then we have this box right this might have one two three so we have one two three four five then we have six seven eight nine ten ten boxes my friend you see right so if we go ahead and do this number one let's go and create a footer i'm gonna say div class is equal to logo the class is equal to just the same logos i had here inside the header right the class is equal to logo boom the logo that we're going to use is a little bit different now so let's go ahead and go back to our images that we had from the uh from the downloaded application right here the logo is gonna look a little bit different so there's two logos there's a one that has that's green there's one that's that's white as you can see here one that's white on the screen so if i go ahead and look at my local svg ah this one's the white one actually here's what i can do looks like they don't have they don't have a logo image like this here's what they do instead but they do like this if i go to my logo i'm going to copy my image class logo check this out let's move this different now i don't want that what i'm going to do instead is i'm going to change the color because this is an svg so if i save this right let me go back to my here oh what happened what happened to my application there we go logo is there let's give the footer a background color so i'm going to say dot footer that folder background color is going to be what guys if i go to my fundamental application right here if i scroll down if i use the color picker a lot of you guys should have a color picker hundred percent all the time here's my color copy it boom boom you guys can copy it at first as well so this is the color nine zero d4 c5 save that let me go back to this thing right here there it is beautiful nice nice nice okay i like it so there we go now i'm going to give this a specific height for now just say it's like maybe 400 pixels just for temporarily purpose because i want to make it a little bit bigger just temporarily i want to make a little bit bigger here okay look at this if i go to that footer and i do that logo i'm going to give it a different color check this out color again i'm going to pick what the color is is a horrible color picker no wait maybe right here it's like a really darkish green right here boom let's copy this right here i'm gonna say color with the hashtag like this save it let's see what would actually work or not it ah does normally work somewhere it's okay so it's all right that's fine let me see here definitely technically should work if i was to do a prom because it's an svg image but because msg image don't like the way it's done fully i wish i had that green logo which is fine okay which is always fine okay so it's okay so that did not work guys a lot of times in the svg images you can actually modify the image itself to make sure it works which is fine but i think for now we'll just leave it at that we don't have to modify the color of this vg image for now sometimes it works that sometimes it does not so we'll leave it at that for now well the only thing i'm going to do is for the footer i'm going to say display flex on this one of course right to make sure it's like that and i'm going to give it a flex direction of column column there we go all right because why because later on i'm going to create the next thing which is if i go to my here i have to create the the menu so again i'm going to create the menu here they have class is equal to i'm going to give it a navigation a for navigation navigation like this okay and of course it's gonna have a few things one a span for span for about second span span for services the third span for projects like this i see that of course if we zoom in when i get the colors of the actual all the actual text of izumina here it's like very like light green so if i do color serp right here you see it's a very light green color right here it's like darker right here it's about this color so command c right so if i go to footer net footer delegation if i go to sell the css i'm going to say dot footer dash navigation okay i'm going to focus on this one let's say color of this right here boom awesome sweet save that let's see where that takes us now there we go so now we have the for navigation again it's it's all kind of you know jumbled up but that's all right don't worry about it i can actually make it a little bit darker right here that's okay then i'm going to center it horizontally so because we use display flex we can use uh align items center to center horizontally right there see and then i can even do to center vertically we can do like this we can say just like content also center boom see right there okay but i'm not i don't actually want to just look on the center because i want this to depend more so on the padding section right so for example the logo if you look at it here has a lot of padding on the top section right so for example the logo here right that's that logo i can say hey now this is margin top margin top and now go to like let's just say it's like it's almost like literally 70 pixels right there why because that's just how it is so for example if i go to here see logo is now here okay with the for navigation i can do also margin top maybe 50 pixels to make a little less right there right so now it's now it's kind of that okay because if you look at it here you see it's kind of very high so for example this might be 70 maybe this is actually 50 this is maybe about i would say 30 right there yeah it's about better okay i'm going to give the for navigation a font weight of bold or bold and then nice and then i'm going for every single navigation section i'm going to say it like this i'm going to say dot for navigation dash navigation navigation and for this one i will do the following i will say uh let me see here i will say for notification i'm going to go to the span so the span is every single text which is this one about services no projects and i will say hey you know what i want to give it a padding all around it so i'm going to say padding here padding off let's just say all four pixels oh maybe let's just eight pixels um oh cause i spelled navigation right wrong right there there we go looking much better now guys okay much better nice nice nice let's move forward and the next thing we have is we have these uh i call them what we call social media icons thank you thank you selena social media icons right so we'll say the next day is going to be what do class is equal to social media right there right and so within that i'm going to create a few images now so within that i'm going to create a few images i'm going to say uh i'm not going to actually upload those images so let's see i'm going to go to the downloads here again right here images so we have a few look we have a few icons facebook icon we have the instagram icon the pinterest icon so i'm going to say this this instagram and then facebook and i'm all going to copy and paste this into here into my images assets folder boom boom beautiful right there awesome guys you see that sweet beautiful we got that section so we have the facebook icon the instagram mic let me see how it looks like oh it's just an svg i kind of just fine but now we can use them though now we can use them so to use them i'm going to say image source is equal to right here close this out boom close this out and i will say dot slash assets icon let's just say facebook for now let's see how this looks like let's go here hey that looks great that looks great next icon image source equals which one assets and i'm going to say which one icon which is going to be instagram instagram right here beautiful guys next one of the diagram image source right assets and i say the following i say icon what is it twitter close this one out and finally the last one here guys image source is equal to assets icon pinterest boom done so now we have four icons if we take a look at this right they're all kind of jumbled up together don't worry about it right for this one i'm going to give it a number one a header a a margin top so let's do that right now so let's do that right now so i'm going to say dot um footer footer and social media dot social media dash media right here and i will say margin top also is going to be about what 30 pixels there we go nice nice nice nice and i'm going to space them out what do i do to space out all these icons because somebody tell me give me a hint here what i want to do is want to space out all these little icons give me a hint here what would i do guys tell me anybody you guys know this point you guys know i'm going to target which specific i'm going yeah that's right add padding that's right so i'm going to say dot social media social media i'm gonna say um the images within there right i'm talking the images and i'm gonna say padding what maybe like four pixels there you go now the cool thing now what i can do guys is i can remove this height you see remember how we had this height on the footer now this height on the footer let's remove this height you see and instead of using this height i can say the the social media or the footer or the what's it called the footer padding bottom guys the footer padding bottom padding bottom can now be maybe let's just say 50 pixels see right there and same thing goes with the sunny side the padding top so if i do padding top here why am i doing this because i i'm basically i'm saying like this i'm saying here i'm saying here is my footer and i want to put any content within here and within here so padding top and then padding bottom that's it so now in my case i say padding top and i say 50 pixels as well okay that means on the actual logo portion i do not need this right here save that and there you go my friends now we have ourselves next thing we can do is we can change the spans to actually just be the feel like link so i can do hey you know what i'm going to say here um cursor pointer right there and i can even do in a way where if i hover over this it feels like it's also doing something so if i of course here nothing happens here but i can do it where on the hover of the span so let's do this right here right on the hover of the span span hover i can say color while color you guys want to change it to what color do you guys want to change it to maybe like a lighter color potentially like a lighter color let's see let me see here all right here see right there actually more darker color right there see so right here so we my friends have it right there now when i hover this right it looks pretty good right here we got ourselves the logo the one thing i don't like is this you see this little um border i don't know why that's the case let me see here actually i know why let me see here so let me see let me see let me see let me see so the reason you see the reason we have this border is actually because of the height of the actual images so for example let me let me take a look at here but it's actually one examples okay that's fine let me say overflow hidden maybe no necessarily how to make sure it fits the whole thing is my question so we have these little icons just don't like the fact that they're all so i know not the way they should be let me see here let me see here if i go to my um these example containers here okay example containers here that's really interesting why is that the case why is it not doing it where is it online item center no that's not going to help at all and but no that's the case why do we have this border right here at the bottom this border it's giving it a bigger height than it's supposed to that's why anybody guess why is the case i think it's giving it a border that's not supposed to be there anybody just curious what do you guys think so i have an idea i think it's actually let me see if i do say like this if i say and then the height auto i don't don't think it's the div honestly i don't think it's the div the difference to do with this i mean i can't give it a height of 100 percent can't do that i can't do that guys i can do object fit here you know object fit of let's just say you know cover i mean there you go that pretty much fit yeah that pretty much fixed it so for some reason it was not taking up the height but it's it's weird because the height of this div depends it can be a little weird sometimes because the height of this div you know depends on the image so if the image is small it's gonna go it's gonna make it big it's gonna be bigger so as you see for example here see the images becomes smaller right you see so the height actually depends on the actual image itself you guys see that that's right so my friends you my friends have pretty much finished everything we've got ourselves the what look at this we've got ourselves a landing page we have ourselves the banner right we have ourselves a transformer brand we have ourselves a graphic design portion a photography portion we have a testimonials portion right we have ourselves this portion and we have ourselves the footer so what could be left to do well i could make this more complicated of course i can make sure this testimonial is correct make sure that we have different images but i want you guys to work on that for your homework right i could also make sure that well we have this correctly set and i can also make sure that we well we can also also together we can also make this work as well so this we can work as well together but i want to make that homework as well okay so for you mainly what i want to focus on right now is let's actually make this page live right we have our nsa html we have our content we have our application let's make it live are you guys ready yes or no we've got the application it's there right there let's put this live on the website for all you guys to see it yes beautiful that is what i am talking about so let's go ahead all right what i want you guys to do is let's go and open a company called netlify so now life everybody can do that right now so let's go to netlify right now nullify is an amazing easy way for you guys to deploy you know very simple you know very simple like applications okay very simple html sites so i'm going to go ahead and sign up i already have a login page you guys can log in if you want if you want to but our actually i actually already have a login but you guys want to go ahead and log in i'm going to log in with my i can use github that's fine hey look at that see i have all these different sites i can do sites okay builds plugins domains there's so much you guys can do okay there's so much you guys can do to actually make sure it's it's all all well built so for us to go ahead and add a new site it's it's actually pretty simple right basically all you would do is just drag and drop your folder so for example if i if when we create the project here we have this landing page everybody see that to make your work all you do is grab this whole folder the whole folder you use drag it you want to go to sites right here right see this side you see how there's this box right here for dragging stuff you know drag this whole folder and then put it into here and that's going to upload it's going to do the magic for you and guys in a split second it upload the whole application so we take a look at it right now see here let's see oh look at that it's right there now yes we have a few issues with this whole cutting up section and we can fix on that we can work on that make sure this is all good don't worry but look it's right there oh look at that guys it is live for us let me know if you guys put it live please let me know if you guys made it live please put the link down below in the description down below in the in the chat anybody here who finished it partially anybody here raising if you finish or say yes in chat if you finished it fully or if you finished it with me please say yes to the chat i'm really curious all right so for lucas if you finished it you have to make it live let's see it my friends those of you who are on youtube try it out guys try out to finish it and put it live in the meantime while you guys are doing it i'm going to help you guys out and figure okay how do we make this potentially more more mobile friendly okay why you guys are playing live but you guys look we finished the project you guys made it live now let's go ahead and maybe make it a little bit more more more friendly so that it's not as crazy hey lucas nice job nice job lucas my friend let me go take a look at this oh i mean it's a little okay i like it i like it there's some stuff we need to fix but it's okay i like it that's awesome look at this nice job on this one too we gotta oh damn hello humongous uh instagram icons humongous i guess what is it let me see oh look at that nice job you guys good job good job good job good job whoo beautiful i see some of you guys have to reuse some images for some reason your image for photography look why does your image work and mine does not is there a reason why this does not work what is this this is not fair it's not fair at all i don't get it yeah i need to i need the link again where you click to add to nullify so the which link so if you go uh if you go to nullify my friends let's see if we're going to neglify let me show you so go to nullify right once you once you've logged in and go back to here once you've logged in netlify go to sites right and then just simply drag and drop the folder my whole folder with all of my stuff right i look at my folder landing page drag and drop your whole folder this whole folder and just put it inside here and that's it guys that's all you need to do that's it so now i want to do one last thing with you okay i want to do one listing which is i want to talk about how do we make this a little more mobile friendly okay this mobile side more more mobile friendly right how do we make sure that maybe this section goes in the bottom right and so forth so there you go yeah nice job nice job sam nice job good good good good good good good good good beautiful all right let's continue guys forward okay let's continue on i want to kind of uh help us make this even better all right all right so the way for us to guys to make sure that we are that we are making this more mobile friendly it's going to be using the call media query so if i show you media queries let me show you media queries media queries right here right these immediate queries that basically allow you to figure out okay at which point you know do i actually you know uh change the css right so so if i show you like uh there are some standard media standardized media queries that we can use so if i go ahead and media rules let me see here right there there's midi was for 600 pixels this meter rules for many different ones right but let's go and find some standard media queries the one good one that we can uh look for is you can see there's here look at that nice beautiful mozilla nice nice nice nice these are some examples of media queries here but the one good one you can look for is actually uh using uh bootstrap butcher has an amazing way of knowing which media queries you actually want to use for which you know data types for which types of media may not be you know for example uh maybe a computer might be may that be a laptop may that be you know um a uh what's it called a tablet you know stuff like that i'm trying to find for you guys w3 uh media query specifications here devices right here so for example if i hear here for laptops so we have some standard media queries and we have so many queries for example let's just say for tablets so as we get smaller let's just say we go for tablets okay so you can see media only screen medium only screen this is for example for tablets or uh let's just say portrait landscape it doesn't matter i should do it let me actually use bootstrap here let me use bootstrap media various guys so you guys all guys can see it okay right here so right here this what what is this right here so this is basically for small devices and so forth so okay so if we have here this is basically saying hey for the minute width of 576 pixels we're going to do something then here for the minute of this we're going to do something like that and so forth so you can see that's kind of how we do it um let me see here occasionally use midi quiz that go in the other direction so it's all basically done for you here we have for small devices for medium devices like tablets and then we have for large devices so if you want to specify something here's how you would do it let's just say that we have for media devices where the max width of or just say small devices for example i'm going to copy literally just this media max width okay i'm going to copy this i can push it put it for you guys to keep here boom right i'll go i will go to my.css and in here i will paste the media query and of course inside these three dots you want to delete those three dots you don't want that what this is saying hey is let's change the css for if the max width is 767.98 pixels basically for screens the max width is this all right here's what i'll do well let's think about this for the screens our max with the 767 let's take a look at it if the screen becomes small what should we do with this egg guys and the way i pay attention is if you look at this little corner right here look at this little corner right here all right look at this little corner let me show you look at this corner you guys can see as i'm decreasing the size i see right there there so what should happen is at 767 maybe it's not even enough maybe we need to go for extra small devices is we can do things based on you know how small you want to get so let's just say you want to change it for really small devices let's just say you want to do something for really really small devices let me go to bootstrap i'm going to go for these devices 575. instead of this i'm going to say 575 sort of there delete these two dots boom save that okay amazing sweet okay and for this specific one what i'll do is one i'm going to make sure that this uh instead of you see how this egg needs to really go not from left to right but from top to bottom so what i'll do is what do we say on this left and right remember how we said the section one for one we had what section one the section one left and right okay section one let me look at this one section one you see display flex well what would i do to make sure it goes from top to bottom if i do display flag so if i do here i'm gonna say section one and what i will say here is the only thing going to cheat is i'm going to change is flex directions i'm going to say flex direction column column guys so that means if i go really small oh you see what happened here it went to a column but because it went to a column what does that mean right away you know there's a max width that that that that is specific that section one has so for example if we go to section one there's a particular specific height they have so if you look at it here see there's a height of 350 pixels well that's where i can change that i can actually say height auto so if i go to height go to height here i can say height height auto boom you see so that means that just from your brand and and the height and can now all be okay so now what we can see it is like now of course just from your brand that means we can now need to add some padding and top padding and bottom padding to these specific sections right here that means for the section one left section one dot left i'm going to give it a penny top let's say petting bottom of maybe let's just say 20 pixels and same thing with padding top also 20 pixels right okay see right there so now we have this egg right this just went from what from here to now here you see boom it just transformed just really quickly just in one it transformed really quickly or you can even make it in a way where you fully remove this egg you can say that right is display none you see that guys so what i would encourage you guys this is how a way how you use media queries i would encourage you for your homework today right and i'm gonna give you homework right now here guys is to fix this in a way where you use media queries to also make it mobile friendly you know for example if we have three clients here you have three clients here you can make it where they go from horizontal view to vertical you have one client here then you have another one the bottom on the bottom as you get to a smaller screen does that make sense so now give me a thumbs up please make sense yes that's what we do if we want to make it like that okay same thing for this for maybe when you go to here maybe you want to hide this whole thing maybe when it goes to a mobile friendly site you want to hide this whole thing right so really depends on what you want to do and you can check it out is even in the mobile design it's even specified here more design right here look at this guys see you'll see them all design is right here so we can also go by the way they do it to make sure that we do it correctly right here right so for example let me ask this question for example you see these four images how to make sure that these four images are actually properly correct where it's like four squares anybody know well let's take a look at it i want to show you guys okay if i want to change that let's just say i go back to here my sunny side i want to change these four images to where if i go to really small page it becomes four images not like this but four images really simple let's go to our what is it examples you see what controls the width of our images is this right here guys flex so now if i go to examples now if i say div for really small things i'm going to say instead of 0.5 i'm going to say 0.5 right and that's okay it's okay it's okay so i'm gonna say flex wrap wrap okay let me see here flex wrap wrap like 0.5 i'm gonna say maybe width of 50 percent or flex bases of 50 let me see flex basis hmm is it applying correct or not let me see here i like it respect alma in this one we have div section examples mhm i'm going to say flex wrap wrap so i'm going to say like this dot examples lex ramp hey let's go right there see so it was all because of the flex wrap no it has also the flat spaces as well right there so flags basis is saying hey what is the main width of these specific images and what we're saying here is the following was saying hey you know what we're the container we're saying the following we're saying hey for the container right here allow the the images to wrap because otherwise the way flex works is if you don't wrap it let me show you it will try to always put it into into the from left to right section always but if i say flex wrap it will then wrap it from one side to another so it will then wrap from here to the next line okay that's a lot this right here just another one example of showing you how it will work if we go to small right and so now if you go back to a not normal thing and go back to it's normal you see what if like this boom everybody see that yes or no everybody see that beautiful next thing for example we can do is well let's take a look at this for example let's say look to look at these client testimonials same thing what do you guys think what would you do to change this client to someone anybody know i want you guys to put in the chat please put in the chat what would you do to make sure these kind of decimals go from like this to down to here what would you do tell me tell me i'm going to wait for you guys to figure this one out what would you think what i do padding and flag that's right padding flex wrap and also what change what padding flex strap and what and remember the flex direction is currently this way that's right and flex direction so if i go to my uh clients for example let's look at clients here you see clients right there are their clients so what i'm going to do for the clients i will say the following will say dot clients i'm going to say flex direction column boom right there see it right away goes to a column and then i'm going to say the client's client that client and i'm going to give a specific you know margin top for example let's just say margin top or let's just say pixels maybe maybe even more for example let me see how does when i met fundamental like it yeah i think there needs to be more spacing for sure hundred percent so i'm going to say uh margin top client right direction column let's see here oh what happened here went back to its normal state for some reason let me see here okay really small there we go nice job give it maybe 50 pixels there we go now we have 50 pixels we have client testimonials just like this you see now we're making it more friendly see what i mean what else is there guys let's see what else is there guys let me see for example again now if we go back to here these images also go from top to bottom as well right if we can make this more friendly we'll make that attempt to bottom as well as you can see it's starting to look a lot a lot better right i love my friends is pretty much it i want you guys to do for homework is as we go back into this i want you guys to make mobile friendliness with these this section for example make this section more friendly and honestly that's going to be your biggest goal and you've got this is already working it's already working and you can even make this a little bit better as well too so that's going to be your goal does that make sense everybody that is your sunnyside landing page that you just built you just built a landing page guys and this is not easy it's much more complex you might think guys i know there's only like a few things that we did but from this you can put this in your portfolio you can of course you can have a contact information later on have a contact form have maybe you know more things we do need to fix this i actually if i i'm going to encourage you to do something is to try and fix what you can do here maybe fix this portion right here the way to fix this portion is to convert this not to an image but actually use the text so for example if you are actually going to download sonny's this the application here you go to downloads here go to the page main you can see here that we got the cherries let me show you here that's that where's my cherries my cheese right here see we can use those cherries instead of the using the design so for example if i was to do this with you instead of instead of you know with you fully here's how i do it one i would i would upload the cherries and i'll also upload the let me see here the cherries and the and this one so let's go ahead and actually do this together because i want to i want to show you guys how to actually do this here so because i don't like how you see it when it's small it's fine but i don't like that so to make that work i'm going to go back to my assets folder oh put it into the assets folder right here image header so now we have what now we have the photography and then we have the which one see header header photography let me see here let me go back to it again again pictures projects no no no downloads right here page main the photography and we also want to download this graphic design so i'm gonna put the graphic design one inside there too right there okay so we have photography and then we have the design which is this one okay now we can use those okay so let's go back to our initial html the way we would do that is the following so if i now go ahead and if we look at our section two right just this section right here the one section that we do need to fix okay if you look at it now well this left section is gonna one is gonna have an actual background color and background image because if you look at it right this whole thing is a background image remove this for you guys this whole thing is a background image and then this text is on top of the background image so the background image has a few things one it has a header so h1 header for graphic design design right and then there's a p tag okay so there's p tag right here okay p tag p type right here and inside this p tag of course we have a sum text so the text that they have here is great design makes you memorable so for example we can say great design makes you memorable memorable dots we deliver deliver artwork under under scores that underscores your underscores your brand message and captures potential clients attention okay so let's go and save that for now i just want to show you an example here so let's go back to our application here and you can see it's again this completely just transformed everything we need to do right that's okay if i now go to my section two so let's go ahead and go my section two section which is somewhere around here yeah section one section two right here i'm gonna do dot section two right and i'm gonna say dot left right that left okay for this one i'm going to say background image is going to be url again it's going to be the assets assets and for this one is going to be the first one which is which one that's the one the graphic design correct or is it the photographer on i think it's the graphic design one save that there you go so that's the image right there right but of course we don't want that so what we want now is that is we're going to say hey background position is going to be center centered horizontal and then top from the like this right there okay okay and then background psi is going to be cover right there guys and there you go right so there there we go we got we got the start that we wanted to get uh right there right so now and uh we've got that there we can put the text underneath that so for the text section the text i'm going to say now for the text i'm going to say now the following display flex we know this already display flex okay okay i'm gonna say flex direction column to make sure it goes from from top to bottom beautiful and then how do i make sure it goes from top to bottom but it actually goes all the way to the bottom of the of the this d what do you guys think if i want to take this text i want to take this whole thing instead of being here at the top i want to put it all at the bottom what do you guys think what can we use that's right luke lucas align bottom so if i do for example here if i do one let's center it horizontally so i'm going to say align item center right here right there centers it horizontally which is exactly what we want right and then in terms of vertical alignment i'm going to say justify content not left not right but it's actually going to be the start no actually going to be the end let me see end no flex end right there guys you see what i just did you see what i just did i put it all the way to the end flex n so remember i said hey flex n put it all to the bottom and that's exactly what happened that's exactly what we wanted to do right next thing for this uh the left the p tag is left is going to be dot section 2 dot left also the p tag now i'm going to say text align center text align center boom see that centers the whole the whole text let's now work on the actual way which are supposed to which is let's work on one the font size and let's work on also the colors right so if you look at the color here if i do my color slurp right right when it's going to be this darker color right here looks like i'm going to copy this color and i'm going to say for the h1 tag the section two h1 tag i'm going to give it a specific color color of this one right it's a little bit different right maybe a little bit darker i feel like i feel they should be a little bit darker i'm gonna give it a font size of smaller font size oh font size 16 pixels am i doing this right font size 16 pixels for font size 12 no okay i think it's partially because i'm we might be rewriting this inside here you see that right there so if i actually put the section two so here's what i do sometimes guys you see how we have font size 12 pixel and it's not really affecting this piece of text as you can see right and it's because it's actually been overwritten by this it's been overwritten somewhere uh by another one which is more down there so if i what i can do sometimes is if you want to overwrite it you can actually copy or cut the whole section to each one go all the way to the bottom and then you will for sure what is this right then you will for sure change the text look at this see right there see i just changed it just like that i'm going to give it a font way bold right there awesome sweet that looks good exactly what i want and then i'm gonna also change the actual p uh the p tacket so let's go back to our section 2p let's see dot section uh two p p i don't have that here in that case i will create it in that case my own it looks like i do not have a section two p so i'm gonna do that section two actually now i do have it let me see i'll go to the top that's section two guys section two section two section two section two where is it section two uh that right there that left that p right let's go ahead and change the color of this one to be the color that we have here so let's do a color right also same thing it's going to be more of a darker color right here as well right here color blah blah blah like this color right here just like that boom right there right okay i'm gonna give the font way bold bold there we go there we go and so now it kind of looks a little more i need to decrease the actual font size i think it's a bit too much of a for a font size actually so font size decrease the font size and decrease the line height as well so font size i want to say 14 pixels okay and again because of the fact that we're changing the font size somewhere down bottom i'm going to take this and i'll take it all at the bottom right here and cut it and then put it all the way here is it even less than there we go nice okay beautiful then you see how it stretches all the way right here well what i can do is i can give the p tag actually a specific width so i can say width let's just say of only eighty percent i'll just say that's 50 right there that makes it there and so my friends that's it there we go so we have a graphic design portion right here you see and now it will never just change like this it actually will always be there the way it's supposed to be you guys see that while this goes away this will always be the way it's supposed to be you guys see that yes or no that's it my friends you can do the same exact thing with actually this photography portion as well the exact same thing the exact same thing and i encourage you actually to actually try that by yourself fully okay guys uh but on that my friends that is pretty much it we made an application live we've got testimonials it is partially more friendly and i encourage you guys of course to make it more friendly let's now go into the homework guys for those who are on youtube guys this was your landing page thank you guys so much for watching and of course stay tuned tomorrow because tomorrow we're building a javascript game so come back tomorrow atlanta and pst and we'll see you guys there on youtube i hope you guys have a good day and we'll see you guys in the next video which is tomorrow okay bye bye everybody
