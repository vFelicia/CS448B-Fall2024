how's it going this is qazi from cleverprogrammer.com welcome to how to make money as a freelance developer and how to make a thousand dollars or more this upcoming month now this is part two and day two of the challenge and we're gonna keep this rocking and rolling for you guys this is about a freelance movement that we're trying to create and we want you all to be a part of it you're not too late and nobody's beginner or too advanced for this you're all you all can be in this together and the entire goal of this movement and it kind of came to me randomly is the goal of this movement is for us to like we want to get to that longterm goal right we all want to get to that like crazy longterm goal that we have of man i wish i could be making this much money or i could be doing this amazing life the goal of this challenge is to take those first steps towards it because oftentimes the steps here are missing and never revealed and it's just like yeah here's how you can make ten thousand dollars a month or something crazy like that but i i care about some of you making your first five dollars this week i care about some of you maybe making your first um fifty dollars this week or five hundred dollars whatever it is for you right that would be super exciting and that's the movement we're creating how can we all increase our income and my focus came on this because i started focusing on increasing my income because i'm like look i'm focusing on all my other goals relationship goals and fitness goals and i'm focusing on team development goals and we have an amazing team with sunny and nas and rishi and yusuf and david and amanath and frankie and aaron we're bringing so much value that's great so content goals are being crushed body goals are being crushed nutrition goals food goals sleep goals health goals but what about my income goals somewhere along the line i felt like i forgot that and that's important for me to keep increasing and i thought why not we all create a movement where we're in it together increasing all of our income does that make sense guys and i hope that that's also exciting to you and welcome everybody that is here man am i pumped to have you guys on here and if you guys can do me a favor and get this video out to as many people as possible just go ahead and smash that like button just break it you know click it maybe a few times but really smash that like button it would do me a huge favor and get this video out to other people and then it will help also transform their lives as well and it's free doesn't cost anything all right with that said let's just jump right into it so amazing let's go here so now right now some far less qualified people than you are living your dreams all because they didn't just talk about it they took action i want you to remember that and i wanna uh show you a few rockstar action takers that are here and part of clever programmer and when that grind payoff baby we show off so it's okay to show off when you put in the hard work all right bragging hard is not a crime here is uh nasir who's actually my 14 year old student and he cleared nine hundred dollars in just one week all right he what's an insane and he actually reached out to me on instagram uh yesterday and he's actually in pakistan okay he's not even in the united states so this is equivalent of somebody making like 9 000 in u.s that's that's how big of a deal that is people make 900 in like six months in pakistan so if he can do it my question is can you also do something can you also make progress can you also make some amount of income even if it's not 900 it's a lot of it is a thing that is in our mind and it kind of blocks us what is up everybody welcome here srikar says he got an internship that's amazing guys whatever you're getting or whatever is happening please make sure that you keep sharing proof of it and you can do it on my instagram you can my instagram is right here so you can actually share with me and we're compiling a document with everybody's results and everybody's wins and how much income everybody's making so far we have over two thousand dollars made that that is documented so far so two thousand dollars have already been made we just started this movement yesterday granted we're taking some of the people who got income from a week before that but that's okay any document income we're gonna we're gonna document it so we're right now at about two thousand dollars and we wanna get to ten thousand and more all right and we're gonna show off every single person who's making income even if it's not as much or you think it's not as impressive um srikar says he sent me proof at my ig okay let's take a look so let's go here let's record all right where is it let's see here um okay i don't see a photo from you bro so i don't see it yet but if i see it then for sure also i'm gonna be taking on callers at some point in this stream so it's gonna be a lot of fun i'm gonna get on a call with some of you guys okay so i'll let you guys know that later right uh regarding yesterday's live stream here's what one of the students had to say schloke and he said regarding so he goes hey man just saw your last video on youtube that said how to earn 1 000 as a freelance developer in 30 days just can't be thankful enough for the value you've provided i would say you just hit the right cords talking about myself i'm a javascript developer having experience of around three years now so to speak for the last 45 days my income has been zero all right so for how many people is this happening where you have some experience and is this you by the way if some of you resonate with what you read so far drop it in the comments below but do you feel like you are coding or learning coding maybe for the last few months or last few years but you really haven't made any income from it maybe you just get caught up with tutorial after tutorial or project after project but no real results with it and he goes i'm pretty confident that i'm going to add value to this challenge and make the best out of it that's a great attitude yep ido city says my guy talk back to me what's up bro all right and i'll add here nice dude i want to be that guy nice okay now i can start showing people's comments as well and he goes i'm sure of sharing income proof as i make progress in coming days so you guys can share proof as well and i've recently asked a question on my g story which no one really gave the answer i was expecting the question you asked what is the best thing money can buy this is exactly what you spotted in the video freedom um basically in the video i said money can buy freedom and that's the ultimate thing that i want with money he goes literally what i'm striving for right now thank you so much for bringing this straight to us love you man awesome okay jennifer stewart says fiverr is a ripoff it really depends what you're doing with it if you don't use it in the right way i mean most of these websites can have that effect right including craigslist obviously so you have to kind of don't give up on it there are people making literally millions of dollars on fiverr it's just a matter of avoiding the quoteunquote ripoff situations right and you get seasoned as you as you do it more uh here's another student that shared with me muhammad shared with me yesterday and he said i didn't register in your course bro but i did follow your tutorials they're amazing after learning react and django through your tutorials i made 1200 since august thanks to you i'm making 400 pretty much every 20 days which is good enough for at my place and again another student in pakistan so that's a lot of income so look at this he made over 1200 and making 400 every month in pakistan right that is absolutely brilliant vanguard said i made 300 in a week by a simple react single page application on fiverr boom there you go that's amazing to hear that just made my day that's awesome and that's the movement we're starting regardless of what your level is i want you to start applying now and start doing things now and building habits now that start making you some amount of income and set your goal to making five dollars this week because that small goal will move you in the right direction for example when you put on your running shoes you don't have to be an amazing person it will just propel you to start getting out of your house to then start running even if you run for 30 seconds right so if you set your goal to something small it'll now start moving in the direction to start wanting to do it absolutely great job that's awesome vanguard um share that with us on instagram as well please that will be amazing sure car says i got 50 building hackathon app that's awesome dope nice okay loving the questions from you guys and the comments so this was somebody watching the live stream from yesterday and taking notes on it so if you guys want to bring something to take notes on i would highly recommend it this would be a very good time to do it and take notes on these things and it's going to bring you a lot of value and here's another student and he says and the rest he goes thank you and the rest of the team community could not have done this without you fingers crossed uh he's our student in pwj brad and brad is like super super awesome so we love having brad in our course profit with javascript and he's just been always hustling he's always reaching out to us on instagram and like messaging us and i just love his energy and if you guys want to take photos like this and tag me guys we re share everybody's story so you can do that and then tag me on ig and i will reshare your stories take pictures like this because this makes it like a real community right this is super cool to see you guys coding and working on things it's even better than just seeing a laptop or a coding screen this is much much much better so take photos like this and tag us all right cool so now i wanna like share with you guys a few things in a little bit and we're gonna go over them and we're gonna start really getting into the meat of what we're gonna be talking about hey this is cool you can actually see the youtube stats and how they're doing so generally when the viewership is going down you know we we know oh crap something bad is happening like what just happened here just drop maybe the internet disconnected or something like that and then when it goes up it's like nice it's working and it seems like you guys are enjoying the content so now here's what i want to share with you guys right work life balance and how can we improve our life and how can we improve our income let me ask you a question are you here to improve your life yes or no another question i want to ask you are you here to improve your income yes or no if those answers are yes that's why we're here that's why we're in this community right and do you want to become a better developer yes or no and if you answer three to all of them that's the entire point of what we do and teach and share at clever programmer and so what i want to do is share with you guys what are the things that are really working for me right now that are helping me improve my body that are helping me optimize my mind that are helping me generate sales and increase my income and helping me crush it with all types of goals so i'm going to share with you guys my day and i do these reflections on my instagram every single day so if you guys ever follow me you will be able to see these reflections but i want to share this with you because my goal is i don't know what's going to happen with the you know there are 193 people watching right now and they're probably going to be thousands of people watching afterwards i don't know what's going to happen with all of them but if there's just one person that can get a transformation out of it or that starts picking up one of these things i think your life is going to improve and that is what excites me and motivates me to do these things and what really excites me is when you guys share with me that you guys are actually doing some of these things and it's helping you all right so i'm gonna now share the screen and we're gonna get to it yo rudolph he says yes yes and yes amazing thomas says yes awesome absolutely matthias texas yes code ninja yes again again beautiful sabir says heck yeah man i love your guys's energy guys we're definitely gonna get on calls uh on this live stream okay so here we go so here is my full work day full day yesterday okay um so i worked out that's the first thing i started my day off with because that's the one thing guaranteed that's going to help move my life forward every single day forever okay so that's something i start my day off with so then i have good momentum next up i had really good food uh consumption yesterday so i'm trying to get my protein up to 120 or 150 grams per day so i ate a lot of good food so whether it was like chicken breasts or protein shakes or salmon whatever it is that i can help fuel and optimize my body now why i say this stuff is important and why i'm even sharing this with you is you're probably sitting there thinking what does food have to do with coding what does food have to do with development well let me tell you something i used to code for long stretches of 13 to 15 hours a day that's why i got so good at coding in such a short amount of time and that's why i was making a hundred thousand dollars a year just six months into my coding experience but what i did that was really bad is i pretty much starve myself the entire time because what would happen when i would eat food is right after i would eat food i would just feel completely sluggish tired and all i would want to do is sleep if you resonate with that drop that in the comments below if you ever feel that where you eat food and then you all you kind of just want to do is just like lay down relax sleep but you don't have the willpower to do crazy things anymore well here's actually what it is when you are hungry and you don't actually eat food for a long period of time literally why your brain is so active is because it's genuinely searching for food so your brain stays sharp when your brain is sharp you can problem solve you can build that project for your client you can um get that job or pass that interview that you were working really hard for does that make sense so people are like yeah how do you get so much how do you even code if you're hungry and not focused so i'm going to answer all these things these are great questions and comments you guys say it says yep it happens to me nice okay nice so here's the thing if you don't know what you're doing with food it's going to actually destroy your productivity and it's going to destroy your income i'm not kidding so what you have to do is either one just avoid food at all costs that's what i started doing but then i started starving myself and started becoming scrawny and i didn't want to be surrounding i want to be jacked i want to be like you know i want to be big and i want to be strong and i want to be healthy so i can be there for my family and my teammates and whatever the case may be right whatever situation i'm in so when it comes to food what i've started doing is i'm now eating lower calories and i'm eating i'm mainly what i'm doing is i'm reducing my carbs and maximizing my protein intake so all that means is i'm from a culture i'm from pakistan right so my family ate a lot of bread and naan and roti and stuff that stuff is so carb loaded that it will mess you up like it makes you want to sleep it's the best food on the planet and like there's no better food than that but all you want to do is just like sleep so what i started doing is i've started cutting a lot of that out so i can just have chicken breasts but without the bread i i just have you know salmon but without really any bread or anything like that without any white rice that what it does is i can now eat and stay healthy but my focus is for very long periods of time so i can actually focus for eight to ten hours a day if i wanted to so i did want to mention that and make it a point because i think that if you guys just made that little tiny switch and what you do it's gonna help you so freaking much all right ahmed is like biryani man biryani is tasty i know bro but that is awesome and amazing but it's gonna you up so that's why i mention it um yeah somebody said sugar shaw effect yeah my girlfriend is into fitness so she helped me as well with this so yeah so i would reduce the carbs like crazy right like right now i'm drinking just pure black coffee and it's absolutely amazing you can't really see it but it's just black coffee um reduce the carb reduce the calories in your day you're going to feel so damn good and you're going to be energized and your income will thank you so wanted to make that a point next up i'm not going to talk too much about this but i have increased my water intake so i always make sure that i'm consistently drinking water throughout the day and then i have my apple watch and i track my water with that it's super easy i just click one button and then i click one button the app is called waterminder so really amazing app but water intake helped me so moving forward i shot my video most of you don't give a about that so that's fine i'm just gonna move past this but this is helpful for me building my brand and me increasing moving towards my goals it's important for me right for you it might be you need to code um for 30 minutes or an hour every day and make it a thing i did the youtube video yesterday and it crushed you guys seemed to love it we got over 10 000 views it provided a ton of value for people so i was happy now here's the other thing that you guys will actually care about um i closed the sale for about 1200 cash yesterday using the phone at about 5 33 p.m now let me ask you guys would you guys be happy if in one day you were able to make twelve hundred dollars in 30 minutes aditya says i was also eating good and working out but then covet happened yes that's exactly what happened to me and it threw me out of the loop but you can't i know you know this but you can't let this be an excuse because it's gonna hurt you from your goals and it's gonna make you a worse person than you are now so you can blame it as much as you want but it's really not going to help you aditya move forward in your life so it was the thing that was stopping me and me up so i hate not doing anything but lifting so i just stopped doing anything but then i started doing a pushup program because i'm like that you can do without weights and um you can still eat healthy food so avoid that from becoming an excuse because it was mine for this entire year and i got fat i gotta start getting fat started getting unhealthy and irritated and angry and yeah all kinds of things that are that are not good all right people are like yeah of course that would i would be the happiest ever right awesome so how did that happen i developed a simple habit of getting on one sales call per day now this twelve hundred dollars is really thirty six hundred dollars because it's a three month payment plan that i close somebody for right that they enrolled in one of our programs but i had to manually get on a call and see what this person needed and if what they need if we couldn't help them with what they need then i would be like okay we don't have anything that's good for you but if it was something that we could help them with then i said hey yes we do have a program and then they would have to make a decision at that point to say yes or no to my services does that make sense guys so for you what that would look like is if you have a service like you can help somebody learn how to code or if you can help build something for somebody with code then you would get on a call and you would have a 20 to 30 minutes exchange of words you would exchange words with them like ask them a question listen ask them a question listen ask them a question listen and then 30 minutes in you'd be like hey i have something for you that might be able to help you are you interested in hearing more they're like yes then you go okay well i have a 30 day 60 day 90 day mentorship program where i'll teach you how to code and improve your skills this is how much it's gonna cost you could have it be three hundred dollars hundred dollars fifty dollars it doesn't matter you could have it be three thousand or four thousand dollars right that's that's what i'm doing so you could have it be that and if the person sees value in it then it's their decision whether they want to say yes or no you're not holding anybody to a gun point you are having a genuine conversation and then you're saying hey i think we have something for you do you want it yes or no and then it's just their decision but what i can control on my end in order to improve my income is i can just develop a good habit to focus on cash and income and sales generating strategies does that make sense so this is why it all comes down to habits right if you want to improve your body good water good food good exercise habits right these three habits will improve your health you guys agree with me or disagree right when it comes to improving your income if you can get on a sales call every single day just one it's going to improve your income does that make sense awesome nikhil says agreed sir car says yes yep you can blame the tides or you can go with them right totally agree with you totally agree cool yes garveet i do listen to audible quite a bit yep okay so uh and and uh any mods please just go ahead and block anybody that's um that's just saying dumb like keep the chat clean otherwise we're just gonna block you from the chat so that is important all right so this is a habit that you guys can develop too maybe you guys can develop a habit of hey i'm gonna do a few outreaches every single day two to three outreaches every single day it could be tiny it could be really small make sure it's something that takes you less than two minutes to do it but something that you do every single day so i'm going to ask you guys later what's a habit that you can get into all right cool so let's move forward here um and then yep i i read a book at the end which is right over here right cool this is the app i use to keep track of my streaks so things i want to make habits yeah so it's a habit tracker app so you can see it's tracking my gym 21 days in a row shower video content days i'm taking my protein and days i'm doing sales calls it's actually tracking all of these things right so you can see i wrote them all down here so you guys can do the same thing where you can track whatever habits are important to you and then boom over the next few days you see incredible results would you guys like to see amazing results in your life and maybe it's not twelve hundred dollars but hey what if you made a hundred and twenty dollar sale wouldn't that be cool that would be 120 extra that you made now imagine if you could make 120 every single day well what happens when you make 120 dollars every single day multiply that by seven days that's 840 in one week multiply that by four and now you found a way to generate 300 3 360 worth of extra income than you were making now depender is asking me a great question and he said hey uh that makes sense but how do you get these sales calls how do you pitch yourself anywhere so that's a good question so let's talk about that you can go on fiverr or upwork or linkedin or instagram or facebook groups or wise ant or take lessons or craigslist the 10 platforms that i just mentioned and you can do outreach on them and you can reach out to your target ideal client so for example people who would be interested in learning coding you can reach out to them you can have a conversation with them and you can say hey you know start a conversation with them and then just be like hey would you be interested in learning coding and improving your skills if they're like yes or you're like hey would you be interested in making a project like this would react and they're like yes would you be open to getting on a short call if they say yes now you've just gotten on a sales call and now your habit for the day is done and on that call you speak with them for 30 minutes to learn about their goals and then at the end you just say hey if you're interested i have a service that i think could help you and then wait for their permission to continue and if they're like yes what is it then you can have a conversation about it you could be like this is how much it is it's how much it costs and i think it'll really help you and then you just wait for them to say yes or no if they say no nothing changed in your life you're still the same person if they say yes you've now generated an extra 50 extra 100 extra thousand dollars all right and boom now you're actually making an income and now you're actually have extra income for whatever you really want to use it for right so this is um what what's important for you guys too right so for example personally me i've cleared 4 400 cash so i want to make myself accountable too so if we're all trying to increase our income i'm like okay let me get in there manually with everybody else and we can all go together and we're all at different levels right so i'm here and i'm like okay i've cleared 4 400 cash this week just over the phone using my phone okay and i've probably spent an hour hour and a half max right so would you like to make 4 400 an hour and a half yes or no in the comments below let me know and now imagine clearing clearing 4 400 in one week with this device with this device that we all have right here there's no excuse it's right literally right here right and in total the revenue is actually 9 200 because this is the cash that was generated but what's going to be collected later over the period of three months when it gets paid out it's going to be 9 200. so imagine clearing almost 10 000 in an hour and a half with three calls would that be powerful for you would that be helpful for you right so this is what i want you to understand the power of these habits you guys fitness just eat clean exercise for income just get on sales calls one sales call a day one sale call a week some kind of habit some kind of habit because i know for most people it's zero which makes sense why they're making zero extra dollars and they normally would small habits are insane i encourage if you want to go down the rabbit hole of the habits i recommend you read the book atomic habits absolutely fantastic lifechanging for me got me you know going and like really destructuring everything i do all right so those are the lifechanging apps i use right and i already show you guys what they are and i'm going to show you what these apps are called if you guys want them so do you guys want me to share these apps with you by the way or i can skip this portion if you guys want but if you think that these apps would be valuable i'd be happy to share them with you guys i like that uh angels so so small habits are insane or actually sane make up your mind that's funny i like it matea says yes please share uh hell yeah okay cool production says sure so here it is so you guys can get this app this app is called done you can have it on your iphone i i think this is a pretty amazing app um you can use it to quit habits or build habits i'm only using it to build habits and for me it's uh workouts and a few other ones that i've already listed out protein and stuff like that you can make it work out in code and then whatever else you want right so this app is a good app and i'm gonna move forward this is a really good app and i recommend that you all get it because if you want to increase your financial skills and you want to know how you're doing here's the thing right if you want to decrease your weight you have to check your weight if you don't track your weight it's going to be really hard for you to decrease your weight because you're going to be just going all over the place so just like when it comes to your body weight you need to track it to drop it with your money it's the same way if you want to increase your money you better track your money and there's only one number that i personally care about that i want to share with you and you can write this down as well for yourself that's more important than anything is this word right here okay this is the only thing i want you guys to use this is one number that'll tell you about all your financial health and so we'll we can practice on this live stream right here actually net worth this is the one number i want you to care about and know and you don't have to know about any other number all this means and i'm not talking about the crazy net worth where you're like trying to figure out how much your house is worth and your car is worth no no i just mean how much cash do you have in bank versus how much money do you have on your credit cards so for example let's say you had like you know three different credit cards let's say you had three different credit cards and you know on this credit card you had like one thousand dollar debt and then another credit card you had two thousand dollar debt and then let's say you had a bank account where you had five thousand dollars in their cash okay so what would your net worth be can anybody guess your net worth would be positive two thousand dollars that's your net worth that's the only number i want you to care about if i knew this number i know about your financial health i don't care about all of this crap i just want to know this number right here so for those of you guys who actually want to take action and change things what i want you to do is go ahead and in the comments below i want you to actually write what your net worth is so in the comments write what your net worth is for some of you for a lot of people is actually negative it's actually a lot of times negative like 5 000 or negative 10 000. for most people it's negative so if you find it negative and you don't want to share it don't be embarrassed about it just share it because you're going to give it too much power and then it makes it hard for you to actually increase your income and ability to make money code ninja says 2000 the clip zone says zero amorous has about 300 euro uh usad says 1500 ashwag says uh 35 000 indian rupees if you guys can do me a huge favor and turn it all into usd for me please because that'll help me understand and maybe even give you insight but just please convert it into usd for me that'll really help zayn says nine thousand dollars victor says 27k 500. yep and what i want you to do if you're serious about changing your life and your income forever i want you to look at this one number every day and stop being scared of it or embarrassed about it any of that eric says around negative forty five thousand student loans a lot of people that happens with them student loans become a thing right negative three k for canenza ashfox says 466 dollars and do this tech 475 dollars preowned just 24. nice but you're positive bro graph dev says 300k negative 300k holy crap wow what do you open up to thousand four hundred forty four zero zero okay cool so now here's what i wanna say for you guys okay the only thing i want you guys to track when it comes just know your net worth that's it and if you actually use this app personal capital it's so easy all you have to do is just put in your uh like your credit cards and your you know whatever checking account and it will just tell your net worth right at the top here it makes it so easy you guys see this right here net worth boom it just gives you what your net worth is right there and you can actually even see a graph so what you want to see is you want to see a graph of your net worth going up all right um graph says that's why i'm changing the type of my business what business are you doing right now 9000 usd when moon says yep so you want this guys to be increasing forever that's what you want all right and you want it to be where every quarter or every few months this says something positive like you had a positive change in your net worth but the first step is to track it so what i normally do right rukaya is excited so what i do is i have um i have a folder all the way at the bottom called finance hopefully you guys can see it right and you can see personal capital is right there in the middle right and i check that pretty much every single day i'll get on it and i'll log in it needs to either see my face or have me type in the password i'll get on and i'll go and look and i'll be like okay cool so i see my trend overall it's been positive that's a really good sign at one glance i can see that one number that gives me my entire financial health know this one number if you just know this number guys you are good in life you are so good and you're going to only move forward if you make money complex you're going to run away from it and it's going to make your life so difficult and so so hard just know this one number net worth and just keep making it go up that's it and you're good to go okay that's one of the really important things i can share with you most senses 2k awesome all right so whether you're in positive or negative no worries guys give yourself a pat on the back you're in it you're investing in yourself you're on this youtube live stream you're watching this you're commenting and you're already engaging in this all right so now it's time for you to start taking action and moving it forward but don't develop shame or guilt around looking at this thing most people have a lot of shame and guilt when it comes to their income so they have a really poor relationship with it if you have a poor relationship with it it's going to feel awful too you're never going to want to look at it it's going to be like punishment so work on changing your relationship with it and how it feels because if you're at negative 6 000 like somebody said your um chances are you're gonna be like really screwed for a really long time because you're gonna hate looking at it if you hate looking at it you're never gonna wanna change your income so you're gonna stay at negative 6k whereas somebody who's in positive like 3k or 8k or 10k and did like looking at it they're going to go from 10k to like 100k whereas the person who's at negative 6 is going to stay at negative 6. but if you start enjoying the process of looking at it and going from negative six or this week i'm gonna go from negative six to negative six thousand to let's say negative five thousand nine hundred that's cool i improved by a hundred bucks i'll go from negative five thousand nine hundred to negative five thousand six hundred this next week cool i sold some stuff and i'm like down to that boom you guys are gonna keep moving forward i'm gonna try to apply for some developer jobs or some developer gigs on these platforms damn i'm at negative four thousand now damn i'm a negative two thousand now oh i'm at positive two thousand oh i'm at ten thousand damn momentum feels great but if you don't track it it's not gonna improve cool awesome let's keep it moving if you guys don't have this app exactly then find some other app that's relevant to this um this is another app that i use this really really helpful for me it's called life some and this is the one where i track my food and calories and everything and it's helping me lose weight and just get very healthy and fit and get my mind right so and the the ui of this is just fantastic if for no other reason you get this app but just to see what a phenomenal user experience looks like a user interface looks like as a developer this is the app to check out and study all right let's move forward now winners and losers often have the same goals so i wanted to share with this with you guys because a winner wants to make a million dollars and also a loser wants to make a million dollars what separates the two a winner developer wants to make 5 000 a month and a loser developer also wants to make 5 000 a month what separates the two here's the thing if you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system would you still succeed for example let me see if i can zoom in on this more nah i can't okay if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day would you still get results i think you would so here's the thing winners and losers have the same goals the only difference between winners and losers is process that's it that's the only difference winners actually follow a process that will get them that result losers go up and down and do a lot of random things right so losers do random stuff like this and then they get discouraged and they don't get results and they quit right whereas a winner will be like hey i gotta get to here so i'm gonna do this and this this and this and now look i got here all right so for you guys it's the same way the this is why i'm pushing you guys to make five dollars this week or ten dollars as a freelancer this week and then share those wins okay let me go here and this is something i've been getting pretty into and getting pretty excited about which is like making making money a habit right so if you can actually make making money a habit how insane is that like literally you can make generating revenue a habit by the way if you haven't already smashed that like button guys do it because it's gonna help the video go out to more people and habits are very simple you got cue craving response reward all right so a queue is you smell food craving is you can experience what that chicken or what that biryani or whatever it is that's amazing is gonna taste like in your body so you start craving it and then the response means you your action so then you go to an actual restaurant to purchase that same food that you were craving for let's say it's chicken and french fries and then your reward is the dopamine hit like once you eat it it's that dopamine hit that you get after eating it right so that's your that's how habits work so you can make making money as a developer a habit you can actually give yourselves cues and cravings you're not gonna in the start have a craving if you don't do something you actually don't have a craving so it looks like this if you look at the dopamine in the start it actually everything is like flatlined and then as soon as you get the reward boom you're like wow that feels amazing so then this is graph like let's say one then what it looks like in graph two if i made graph two salman thank you for the five dollar donation he says really loving this content i built a react resume and portfolio video series too that's amazing thank you brother appreciate it man patel says i just got my first client with 250 for making a wordpress site yes so we got 300 plus 250 amazing 550 made just on this stream that's epic thanks for sharing that and um i will actually screenshot it see if i can send it to david cool cool cool cool cool all right cool so let's go here now graph two actually looks like this because you already have gotten a reward now you get that dopamine hit during the craving phase so for example something will cue you and you will start craving and you will get that dopamine hit then you will like go and take the response to do it meaning you'll take the action to do it and then you'll get the reward and you'll be like pretty excited about it right so you'll only start to develop a craving for something once you've already gotten reward from it and that dopamine hit so what does that mean that means until you get your first few sales and you make some money you're not gonna crave it you're not gonna be able to develop sales calls or outreaching as a developer into a habit until you actually go through the process and you get that sale but once you get that sale and you get that dopamine hit of what it feels like to make a thousand dollars or 250 dollars oops well then now the next time you can actually anticipate it and crave it in anticipation and then it will start becoming a more and more of a habit that makes sense i got my first few clients from platforms like why is that take lessons and craigslist so that cool all right um if you guys really want something to be a habit you guys can actually stack it with something you guaranteed do so for example i know guaranteed i wake up so i this was a new habit so i'm going to actually say new habit right and this over here waking up is an old habit so habit stacking means you can actually chain your habits so you can take an old habit and connect the new habit with it and now that new habit becomes your habit so for you if it's like you can you can you can make it so you have the habit of oh thank you so much thank you so much baby appreciate it so you can have the habit of waking up and then you could do doing outreach or uh going on fiverr and doing outreaches that make sense so you can chain them together this is your old habit and this is your new habit and now they're chained and if you do that for 60 to 80 days it'll become something you start craving and you'll feel weird if you don't outreach on fiverr or upwork or freelancer.com or whatever the platform is right it'll actually become weird cool so habit one habit two habit we have before you can stack them you can chain them it'll make you likely to do them more right so for example example after i pour my morning cup of coffee i will meditate for 60 seconds so go ahead right now in the comments below because i care more about transformations i'm not interested in here to actually give you content i want to help you guys actually make a difference in your life so in the comments below i want you guys to go ahead and write what's the new habit that you're going to develop that'll help you make more money as a freelance developer that's one and two what habit are you going to chain it with so write a full sentence like right now because otherwise what's the point of watching this right what's the point of us being here so let's actually use this to do something positive so we can make an impact in our own income and in our own life because that is exciting so write down below for you what that actually means what's that new habit that you're going to develop and i'm going to start reading it out loud and in a little bit we'll start doing calls as well okay so we got somebody saying all right so we got garveet sings i will drink a gallon of water every day okay amazing priyanshu says i will meditate and post on instagram amazing saeed says wake up and have exercise awesome matea says swap social media with upwork that's brilliant that will help you make guaranteed more money guaranteed just that's what i mean you're saying that you're probably gonna still use social media that's really hard to just give up social media so that's not really habit stacking because you're making uh like that's something you're using willpower to say right now but you're gonna run out of that willpower and you're gonna go back to eventually just using social media of course if you could do this and stick to it then unbelievable results would happen for you but what i would rather have you say is chain um i would rather have you chain your you know upwork to you doing something like you brush your teeth and right after you're done brushing your teeth you can say hey i'll go on upwork because right now you won't have a queue to go on upwork you'll have no cue you're you're you're never even gonna think about going on upwork that's the thing so you got to create your own cue leonard says wake up and watch lectures in university great that's awesome uh the technical technic filer says one enhance my skills twos i will two i will reduce my laziness that those are not habits you can't just do that you can't just go i'll just reduce my i'll increase my willpower you can't just do that so that's not gonna do anything for you waking up at 4 am okay dope that's good we'll put two to three hours every day apart from my job from now on to build my portfolio and will full throttle on increasing my net worth awesome wake up and read a book also awesome that's cool awesome so these are good guys as long as you do these you're going to be on track to for greatness a lot of you still are not talking about how you're going to increase your income as a developer so if you don't talk about how you're going to do that your income is not going to increase and if you clicked on this video i imagine that's probably to increase your income so i'm happy for your lifestyle and health goals but i do want you guys to also talk about what your plan is to increase your income what habit you're going to develop i will check up work after i wake up or maybe there's another thing that you guaranteed do every day i don't know what it is maybe you work every day maybe you so you can be like i'm gonna check this after i get off work or right before i go to work so take something you do guaranteed and then chain it after or before it the new habit that you're trying to create digazo says i've joined people per hour yesterday that's awesome now are you doing outreach on there because if you're not doing outreach you're not going to actually get clients so i want you to actually develop some kind of action plan and do that every day i've applied to people per hour patch says why is that upwork take lesson started the process of reaching out to freelancing clients awesome so patch can you actually make that a habit of outreaching and maybe even set a time on in a day so it's something you do guaranteed every single day and then it's just chained to your day so it could either be chained to you waking up it could be chained to you working out it could be chained to i don't know you after you play your guitar every day could like whatever it is die gaza says my question is what strategy follows should i take aggressive technique and send requests all the time so don't spam but start conversations start sales conversations that's what i want you guys to focus on so what does that look like compliment and question that's how you start a conversation with somebody compliment question so for example you go on somebody's instagram or you reach out to somebody and you're like haha that's amazing i love what you're doing right now with juggling or i love what you're doing right now with surfing that looks dope are you are you staying safe during corona question mark now boom you've just created a conversation after a few text messages like literally one or two more you can say you can change it to like what's your goal right now with coding what's your goal right now with this but you guys don't have to even do that right now on instagram and platforms like linkedin that's a little bit more advanced you can but i would recommend you just go on people per hour and craigslist where they're very transactional marketplaces and you can actually be much more aggressive in your approach because people understand that you're trying to give them a service yep on those platforms outreach and just be like hey i can actually help you with your code or yes for five dollars i will do some project or for fifty dollars i'll do some project so small but i want you guys to collect wins zainab says that's amazing she goes i say i wake up meditate tell myself nothing is impossible and get to coding at least two hours before i attend my classes that's awesome your well wisher says can i pay an installment for profit with javascript course yes i think if in the description if you click you can pay in installments for profit with javascript there's three installments all right let's see what we got okay right so this is an example of an outreach oh sorry so here is an example of an outreach right over here right compliment this is somebody else's this is not me outreaching but basically she saw this girl as lifting so she's like that's so strong that's a compliment right and then uh dang i missed the barbell haha so now it's like relating to that person right so basically this whole thing is kind of like a compliment and then question so compliment question works really well to start a conversation with somebody and these are the platforms that you guys have wise ant take lessons people per hour code mentor craigslist now it's your job to hammer that and apply to like 40 a day or 100 a day that's your job right that's where you have to set your own daily goals and you have to set your own daily habits i can't do that for you i can't want it more for you i'm sharing with you what i'm doing that's resulting in 1200 to 3 000 or more extra cash every single day my goal is to keep sharing this with you guys and take my own personal income to a run rate of two million or three million dollars per year that's my goal your goal can be i'm gonna take my income to fifty thousand or sixty thousand dollars you can come with me and we can go together and increase our income i'll keep sharing with you the advanced tactics and strategies and tricks and tips and techniques that are working for me then it's up to you how you use it you can choose to throw it away you can choose to use it totally up to you doesn't matter to me um so these are all things i used to make a hundred grand before i had a business you guys can use these platforms and um hold on the installments gurveed says i can't see the installments on pwj um that's weird i mean the installment should be there it's a threemonth installment plan let's see here so yeah there's it's clearly right here it's a this is an installment and you click the join now button right unless i'm missing something really really crazy this is installment all right there we go cool phenomenal course the best course there is on javascript and making an income like if you guys are serious about increasing your income you want to make an additional thousand or five thousand dollars a month that's the course for you it's freaking awesome so with that said here are all the platforms that you guys have at your disposal right you got linkedin you got instagram you got facebook groups you got upwork you got freelancer.com put them to use sign up for them and then start applying most importantly develop a long lasting habit habit two outreaches every day every day every day every day hit that for a week and increase it to three outrages every day one client is all you need to put one to two to three to four thousand dollars extra per month for yourself sales habits gotta develop those sales habits yeah you can actually show a lot of code on your uh instagram by the way de gazo dope okay and uh yep i think i went over this stuff already so i'm not gonna go too much over that with that said that's it um i'll take on some calls if you guys are interested in getting on some calls and then i'm gonna hop off probably i'll take one or two calls yeah drop your phone number and i'll give you a call ibrahim what the hell i was just about to call you then you retracted your phone number what's going down brother yo how you doing patch i'm good man how are you i'm doing fantastic bro so amazing having you live on the youtubes yeah man i i love it i love it i love if nothing else you know i love the community i love all the information and i love just chatting with everybody it's like a family reunion how are you doing you know so yeah it's great man um amazing do you are you listening to my stream right now on yeah it's a little bit behind so i muted it okay maybe i just muted because i can hear myself okay i'll uh yeah yeah but yeah man um yeah i i uh applied i set up uh upwork freelancer take lessons people per hour all that stuff and you know i'm trying to get my profiles looking nice and pretty before i start submitting you know want to make that good first impression okay awesome so you're working on your profiles right now yeah and then i just had uh i just got my third client my two third tutoring client today um which has been great um i've been loving teaching and tutoring and um you know just looking to build my skills up and just solidify the skills i already do have and uh just just get better man i want to just get i want to be so good i can't be ignored if they say in the entertainment industry cal newport says that too in his books um okay so i'm just gonna write some of this stuff down here okay so you have how many clients currently i currently have three three clients currently okay and how much are they paying you uh two of them are 25 an hour and one of them is 30 an hour okay 30 an hour okay and how many hours are you generally doing every week with them by the way congratulations that's awesome but go ahead oh thanks man yeah yeah um uh you know it's been a little it's not like you know monday wednesday friday we have a call it's just kind of i just kind of tell them like whenever you guys are available how much how much have they how much have you generated so far is it like 50 bucks is it a hundred bucks like from yeah it's 50 bucks so far yeah got it okay and are you pl so now okay so you don't have planned followed up sessions with them um i mean i tell them you know whenever you guys i just kind of like leave it up to them for now which i'm not sure is the right approach but i'm just kind of like all right you know when do you want to do your next lesson so i pose that question and then you know they'll either say you know when you available and be like i'm available tomorrow all right let's do it tomorrow so um i just kind of like put the ball in their court which again i'm not sure is the correct approach but you know i also don't want to like make them feel forced um so you know again i don't know if that's the correct approach but that's what i've been going with so far okay cool so this is not the best approach because you're putting a ball in their court but what you're not realizing is they're putting the ball in your cord gotcha so until somebody just takes a ball and starts doing something with it nothing will really happen right um like for i'll give you an example right when i book my uh like i i work out with adrian right i don't know if you see him on my instagram stories but he's yeah miller muscle or something right miller muscle exactly so i trained with him right yeah so when i was gonna book a session with him i only did one session but before he left he closed me for 10 followup sessions okay um and in that moment i was like what the like i kind of just he was like when do you want to do the next one and i was like yeah you know i'll hit you up he's like how about uh we do 10 you know we booked 10 i'm like that sounds cool uh yeah i'm like just follow up with me later and we can take it from there and he he asked me he goes yeah let's just go ahead and venmo it right now and then go from there and i was like damn all right he got me i was like all right cool let's just do it all right so i venmoed him and paid him for the 10 upcoming sessions but guess what do you think i'm happy right now that we have 10 sessions booked in advance or i'm pissed right i see what you're saying see what i'm saying so like yeah i am happy that he made me pull the trigger because every single time i'm done with one of those sessions i'm like yes and i like watch myself grow because if i didn't if he hadn't done that i wouldn't book 10 sessions i would just do one and then like it would just be airy fairy and everything would get lost and i would not be getting the results i want in my kickboxing skills or fitness skills sure so i'm thankful that he closed me right yeah no that that that that makes a lot of sense um um you know and then also what i have told them is like you know i don't want you guys to book i actually said i don't want you guys to book 10 lessons in advance and then not have the time to do them and they just kind of like back themselves up and stuff like that but um i guess i'll have to sort of like reformat that a little bit well they don't have to book the times in advance right true yeah it's a good point they can keep the time flexible that's what adrian does for example the time will be flexible so you know like if you like i'll give you an example right even the we have a 90day program if we don't have a 90day transformational program nobody's going to want to do more than just a few calls because they people get confused or lost they can't see the slow progress right like if you want to get somebody to hear and if they're excited about getting to this goal um i think my screen will show you in about 30 seconds or whatever because you're probably behind but if somebody wants to get to some high level goal right they're not gonna see all the small steps that they take to get there but they're gonna realize once they're there they're like oh now i can do this that's sick these these small steps here are like maybe let's say 12 sessions you had with them right so especially as somebody who's not there yet where they want to be they're not going to know what they need to get there so it's actually not their job to figure that out their job is to pay you to figure that out right so for example you see what i'm saying so for example for you the there are multiple ways you can make more income right and let's just brainstorm together what are ways you can improve your income right now uh well joining all the uh joining all the websites like people per hour and wise and upwork and all that stuff and reaching out to you know seeing a job and you know sending in an application for it or you know posting stuff on instagram or facebook or pretty much i feel like it's whatever whatever method you can do to show people that they can trust you with you teaching them what it is they want to learn got it whatever whatever format that is i'm sure it's different for everyone but those are the just particular ways that i like to do it got it so basically one way you can increase your income is by increasing the volume of outreach right yep so one is just volume what is another way you could increase your income um uh i don't know um you know making a website or like you know not necessarily reaching out but just putting yourself out there like you know here's my you know here's my portfolio gonna still throw that in the outreach column for volume okay cool um so what about yeah what what if you doubled your the rate that you charge would that increase your income oh sure yeah yeah yeah definitely so that's another way right yep so if you doubled your price you would double your income pretty much overnight yep okay cool um is there any other way we could increase your income type of way okay i was gonna say i don't know if this falls in the same category but you know booking people for sort of like a package deal on lessons rather than one at a time yes exactly so selling packages that's brilliant that's really smart okay so you could do a package deal instead of oneoffs so when you set package deal what i want you to focus more on is um and this is gonna help boost your income and take you into four or five figures very very quickly but it's so there's one off and then they're packaged deals right i want you to think of in terms of transformation deals okay sort of like sort of like you know a result based package if you will like if you take this program then you know in 10 lessons i'll you know make you a master of javascript or whatever yep so like understand what their goal is and understand their language and frustration point so you're not projecting your language and your goals right if they're saying my goal is to master the part of you know the basics of javascript like that's really frustrating for me then if your program can help them with that then now it's a transformation deal like this is a it's a 10 10 sessions but it's like a transformation package deal right okay yeah cool okay and you could even so now what's the benefit of a package you know versus oneoffs um well a package would sort of guarantee you the money up front and it would be in tune with you know something more sort of consistent and guaranteed rather than you know just do it whenever you feel like that inconsistency yes and consistency and reliability is actually a huge thing that a lot of freelancers don't know how to get to but right they want to get to that and and and you know correct me if i'm wrong but i feel like that's a big that's a big you know sort of that's very much interwoven with your ability of your soft skills and stuff like that correct right absolutely so okay so now we have really good ways we got uh now can you tell me which ways are if we had to put them in difficulty which way is easy medium or and hard so like these three that we have right now outreach 2x your price transformation deal uh i feel like i feel like just flip package deal and reach out because the package deal i feel like is always going to be the harder sell because it's more money up front but and you know the two times the price is you know it's obviously more money but it's not so when i say when i say difficult i mean uh in terms of like you effort that it requires from you oh right right so for example which one of these is high effort requiring versus low effort requiring that's what i mean with easy and hard gotcha uh well then probably the reach out would be the most difficult because it just requires more emails more writing more you know more research and stuff like that to find the people that reach out to you so that's the hard one which ones are is there any other ones that are also hard or are they medium or easy and which ones are uh i feel like you know i feel like as is then as it's written i mean i've been that you know the package deal will be the easiest because if you know you sell them you sell one person on a 10 lesson package then there's you know 500 bucks right there um so i feel like that's probably the easiest in terms of like how to bring in income um but you know at the same time the 2x the prices sort of feels like the same kind of thing except just on a smaller scale yep so yeah so what would you put the 2x sub pricing would you put that as easy thing that requires it's easy in terms of the effort that it requires on your end is it hard or medium uh i i'd say it's i'd say i wanna i want to say medium um but uh just because you know it's only one lesson uh i mean it could be more it could be one lesson or it could be doubling the price of your transformation deal like your entire package deal right so and do you want to hear my thoughts on this definitely yeah so i agree with you on the outreach it's the most difficult and it's uh very vague as well it's like very ethereal it's like intangible right now between these other two the one that i think is the easiest personally is the pricing it takes almost zero effort on your end the only effort it takes on your end that when it's time to say the price instead of saying the word uh 50 you have to say the word 100 right so effort wise it's actually the least effort taking so it's like the easy it doesn't mean you it will work doesn't mean you have to do it but effort wise i think that increasing the price is the easiest thing to do it's very low effort on your end yeah um the package one i would say is like easy or medium because you have to actually come up with what the transformation is like then you have to actually pitch what the transformation is you have to actually have a sales call so like that takes a little bit more effort makes sense but yeah and i think in the ballpark like we're on the same page so um okay so this is good now the one thing i want to uh speak with you about here is when you talk about reaching out it's uh it's a random cloud of things and i want to help give you some clarity in there okay because this is where a lot of people get lost with the with the outreach so i want you to become very precise with this and i'll help you work backwards so let's say we want to get the tren let's start with the sale first and then we'll work backwards from there so how much would you want to charge with your let's say a transformation deal first of all how many sessions would this transformation deal be um i think you know somewhere between eight to ten i reckon would be a good would be a good starting point okay eight to ten sessions i love that great and how much would you charge total for it like let's just say it's ten sessions yeah so i would normally um you know 30 bucks an hour is just for one hour you know that would so that would be let's say 300 for for 10 sessions but i feel like you know there's potentially more value in a transformation package as opposed to just a oneoff lesson here and there yes so i mean i could i could feel it being justified and saying you know i know i'm 30 bucks an hour but you know you pay 400 for 10 lessons which equates to 40 bucks an hour you're ultimately sort of you know quote unquote getting guaranteed results as opposed to you know because this is what i offer in this package and if you believe that i can do it then yeah buy the package but you know if you don't believe i can do it then you know we'll just do oneoff lessons here and there yep so in this you're focusing on the results you're also focused you can also tell them hey you can reach out to me through text whatever questions you have right so cool so we can do so this will be 10 sessions for example okay i'm just going to write 10 s and that's what that will signify okay cool so 10 sessions for 400 i love that i think that's actually really good starting point and i think that's very possible now working backwards from here what i mean is let's work backwards to how we can get to that 400 right so okay so we got the sale is 400 now in order for the sale to happen what is the action that you need to do what's the what's the action that happens right before the money goes into your bank account what's what's the action that that happens like you know the the you know the contact with the client or something like that or that exactly sales call the physical sales call right yeah so this is actually the closest thing this is the action that actually generates revenue in your bank account right cool so now we'll work backwards from there as well right so okay so this if this is the last step and then this is let's just say sales calls like the second last step right um what happens before the sales call what do you need to do in order to get on a sales call like what's the step that happens before the sales call general generally the the reaching out to the client and seeing if they would be interested in something like this and asking them if they wanted to get on the phone for a chat and i can tell them what it's all about and what i'm offering and stuff so is it the outreach or is it the conversation in the dms which one is it is the outreach the outreach which leads to the conversation in the dms which leads to the sales call so the step that's right before the sales calls is actually the conversation in the dm yeah yep so it's like so i'll just say dms okay and then what's the thing that happens in order to get so so basically correct me if i'm wrong in any area or just let me know if i'm right so far so we're having we're in the dms we're having a conversation then we generate a sales call then we get on the sales call then we pitch the program and 400 is just cash chaching just hit our bank account so far so good yeah so what's the action that happens before we can actually get into dms uh well you find the you know for example somebody that wants to learn and you know you happen to offer what they're looking to learn and then you just say hey you know so it still is a dm but it's like a different level of a different type of dm it's like hey are you open to this conversation so it's kind of like sort of the investigation into the potential client yeah but yeah so what's happening right before the dms is you're actually before a conversation takes place you're actually out reaching to multiple people right and then only one of those people chooses to have a conversation with you right so right before dms is it fair to say that the thing that you're actually doing is outreach and when i say outreach i mean you say hey hey like text messaging 5 10 20 different people that's what i mean specifically by outreach is it fair to say right before conversations in the dms uh outreach takes place yeah okay so outreach okay so now we've gone it down to a fourstep process right outreach conversation sales call cash and bank yep okay cool so with this outreach thing there are two different types of outreach there is an inbound and then there's outbound do you know the difference between the two uh uh well outbound would maybe be you reaching out and inbound would be them seeing your profile and reaching out correct so when you make content the only purpose of that content is to generate what types of inbound or outbound uh inbound yeah the whole point of creating content aka when people lightly use the term putting myself out there or they say something the whole point is to generate inbound interest right um but but you can always be doing outbound because that never ends that pool is like unlimited right yeah but you always have to make sure you're making forward progress because you can outreach to a million people but if you never actually start a conversation in the dms will you ever lead to making 400 in cash no if you reach out to a million you have a million conversations going but you don't do a single sales call will you ever hit 400 cash in bank no no so it's less about how many are we doing is more about how many are actually completing the entire process and getting to the pitch on a sales call right right so generally what i'll tell you is if you have a regular sales script if you are like a average person with the average like somewhat sensical sales script you can close 20 of the people that you get on a call with not bad so we'll do some reverse math in there right so basically to make one sale how many calls would you need to get on patch five perfect so we would need to get on five sales calls in order to generate four hundred dollars you agree with me yep cool now in order to get on five sales calls how many conversations in the dms would we need to be having in order to generate those sales calls so i'll give you this generally uh what i've seen is 10 of the convos will ever get to a sales call if you're doing a good sales script in the dms so how many conversations would you need to have to generate one sales call so how many to just generate one sales call uh 10 about 10. yup so 10 i'll write this where my face doesn't block it so 10 dms will equal one sales call right yeah so in order to generate five sales calls how many conversations would you need to have going to generate 10 sales calls about 50 right i'm sorry to generate um five sales calls five generate five sales calls if 10 leads to a sales vote yeah about 50 right yes correct so you would need to have 50 conversations ongoing in order to do five calls and on those five calls you could sell something for four hundred or thousand or two thousand or three thousand three thousand is where it gets like a little bit more difficult but you could definitely sell something for one thousand to two thousand and let's go one step back in order to generate 50 conversations how many outreaches would we need to be doing so i i will say it like this i'll say honestly if you do a good job and you're not just spamming people 10 of the people you outreach should start should turn into a conversation so that's what i would say so how many outreaches would we need to do to get one conversation going uh about 50 10 of them will turn so um you would need to do let me see if i could rephrase it one out of every 10 people you reach out to turn into a conversation in the dms right so to generate one conversation in the dms you would need to do 10 outreaches i i'm like you see what i'm saying okay yeah yeah right okay so 10 let me write it the other way so 10 outreach is equal to one dm convo ongoing cool all right so then in order to get 50 convos going now you would actually need to do quite a lot of work right 10 times that would be like 10 times 50. so you would need to do about 500 outreaches to get 50 convos if that makes sense right yep yep okay okay cool so this sounds like a this is like a lot of volume in my experience if you're doing good outreach generally 30 of the people will reply to you and if you're doing really good dms like 30 percent of the people will actually get on a call with you so you can reduce the number like crazy if you're not spamming like if you don't spam you don't have to do 50 outreaches you can actually do 20 outreaches and generate a sale right like it's really crazy how effective it can be if you take the time to actually personalize your messages but this is like yeah go ahead no i was just saying i really don't like spamming either because you know people have done it to me before and it's annoying so i would never want to do it to someone else exactly like yeah exactly so plus plus it shows you know more personality and the fact that you took the time to personalize the message i think means a lot more yep it does it means a lot for people and that's why the results also show you know if you actually do that it's completely worth the time and energy to do that so basically 500 outreaches will lead to one sale and then that's one customer you can work with on a recurring basis even after the recession is over you could do it again now to do 500 outreaches i think that it can take about if you're focused how long would it take to do betw um you know how many outreaches have you done by the way total uh i mean probably about 10 to 20 so far somewhere in there and how many did any of them lead to sales for you um yeah three of them did you got three clients from 10 to 20 outreaches yeah okay because well i and you know i i kind of i kind of knew already who maybe would have wanted to to learn yes and so you know i had already had their phone number anyways because i had known them and i was like hey listen this is what i'm doing how had you already known them where did you get them from two of them are from uh just friends of mine that i've known for a little while who were you know also bartenders looking for something else to do and i said well this is what i'm doing and it's been pretty great so far and they're both like musicians so like artsy type guys so i just kind of like pitched them you know what i have found to be the most enjoyable parts about you know learning how to program and they just got really excited about it and actually the other one was from um pwj with somebody that reached out to me so i had i had two outbound and one inbound so i lied one of them was one of them reached out to me but the other two i got from from reaching out myself that's really smart like with how you're going i really believe that if you actually did 50 outreaches or less i think you can actually get a sale because i think you also have a good eye these numbers are for like literally if somebody was just trying to play the volume game and wasn't even focusing on the quality of messages right but if you're doing a good quality of messages i really believe that with about 50 outreaches you can generate a sale so i'm actually gonna do a different type of math for you so like let's say 50 outreaches leads to 400 then the question only becomes how long does it take you to do 50 outreaches right um i mean i'm i'm pretty you know i'm i'm not doing much nowadays because my jobs are still close so i'm pretty much home all day working on my computer or working on something so you know i mean it could maybe two days maybe three days to do 50 outreaches why would it take so many days to do 50 outreaches uh i suppose just to maybe do a little bit of research and maybe find people to reach out to oh i see yeah okay so let's say so you said how many has two days or three days yeah maybe two or three days okay and would it take eight hours a day uh it could do i mean especially you know if i'm trying to write you know you know i'm a writer too i want my writing to be good i wanted to be you know precisely i'll give you here i'll give you something very incredible for this um and this works really well for like for the starting of an outreach what works incredibly well is one sentence probably max two sentences but like one sentence which is just one or two lines and it's just complement and question so literally for example if i sent a long outreach oftentimes people don't reply because it comes off too salesy and not like regular conversational enough sure so the very simple combination that works extremely effectively is if you do an outreach and you're just like saw that you do this thing saw that you play the guitar or you play the piano and that's freaking amazing how's it going how are you holding up with coronavirus are you are you keeping safe question mark sure something as simple as that can be a thing that you can kind of copy paste of course you're gonna reach out to people you think are likely to actually pay for the service so that might take you some time to find them but yeah the outreach i would highly recommend to not over complicate because that's one area that can you can over engineer and actually the results get worse yeah it makes sense so if you were to do um almost a copy paste outreach but still like personalized to each person and if it was one sentence long how long would it take you to do 50 outreaches i mean probably not even a day then okay could we maybe yes how many hours would it take you i i do it within eight i reckon within eight hours within eight hours within eight hours if eight hours paid off to you making four hundred dollars would that be worth it absolutely okay yeah okay and that would put your hourly rate effectively at like 40 an hour yeah okay so eight hours let's just say for you equals one sale and as you start to do it more you build more momentum and also oftentimes there's a high chance that those other people you're having conversation with can also turn into a sale so it can it's very possible that your eight hours could result in two or three sales yeah it's also possible that the person that you sell to might book you again after two months yeah yeah yep it's also possible that if you got a few sales you could increase your price so then when you make a sale it's six hundred dollars yeah right okay so the only question is at this point is do you believe this is worth uh your time to do this for eight hours one of these days yeah absolutely hands down no question do you think there's a good day this week for you to try this strategy and see how it goes uh yeah yeah i mean i could uh make a nice day of it on sunday that's for sure that's dope um i don't know how you do this stuff but like for a day like this i would actually even love to just go and sit at a mall like just people watch and eat food somewhere and just read a book and do this the rest of the time yeah no that sounds that sounds lovely that's amazing so what do you so okay so you you're thinking about doing it potentially this sunday yeah potentially my uh my day is not set in stone yet so i figured uh i could potentially put it in there okay and what where would you like where would you be when you do it um i would probably be at home but there's also a park up the street from my apartment that's probably kind of a ghost town right now so i could go sit up there with some lunch and stuff like that and kind of make a nice little day outside out of it okay so if this is something that you want to get behind this is something that will actually help your life and you want to do can we actually on this call commit to you doing it this sunday and taking action on it yeah why not let's do it that's sick um okay and how if we're about to go about it can you reach out to me on either saturday or sunday that you're gonna go and execute on this and send me an instagram story tagging me yeah definitely yeah bro that's exciting hell yeah yeah it is and let's execute on this and the 50 outreaches whether you do them from wise and or take lessons or well any other platform the goal is just to get to 50 outreaches yeah dope okay i think that this is a phenomenal strategy and if this works i will just be so pumped i know that this works like guaranteed because i've done it even when i when i hear you you're like yo i did 10 to 20 outreaches and the result was three clients yeah you kind of already know that this is very possible um and if you need any help you can reach out to me but let's just make sure we do one thing which is let's use this momentum and the energy that we've spent and the fact that we're on this call to commit to doing it on sunday and then just reach out to me letting me know that you've done it on this sunday and then we can go from there sounds great man i appreciate all the guidance for sure amazing man i'm super super excited pumped to have you on brother anything else no just um you know i i appreciate everything you guys do man um like you know four months ago before i started doing this whole thing i was like man what the am i gonna do yeah and then i i found like a great like comfort and and uh you know avenue to still be creative and have a lot of fun doing it and so that's kind of my most favorite thing about programming is the creativity the art the creating and then the community too it's amazing it really is yeah yeah yeah bro i am so excited man i can't wait and i know that this is only gonna just make it even more practical and real for you and it gives you even more time to enjoy programming learning and just being more creative definitely yeah i look forward to it awesome brother thanks for being on this call and um you're reaching out to me this sunday yes definitely will do man i appreciate you thanks for having me all right brother take care bye all right you too see you dope that was awesome hopefully you guys also enjoyed it guys give it up that one great job patch that was an awesome call thanks for hopping on hopefully you guys also enjoyed it uh a lot going on there right there was a lot to unpack and go through hopefully maybe it gave you some insight into your world when it comes to freelancing or coding or improving your income the thought process that goes behind it but you can if you really break it down systematically and you get extremely precise about your language and precise about how it works then you just need to like follow these very clear simple steps and then you can actually get to the goal that you're trying to get to joseph says so 400 could turn into a twelve hundred dollar day exactly you know that's how i did 1200 cash uh yesterday no different than exactly what i was sharing with patch just blanked out completely but because i've worked on this process for a long period of time and i'm getting inbound leads i'm closing almost 100 to 75 right now which is really really crazy so it's like i got two sales calls and i closed two sales calls and that was twenty four hundred dollars cash and that was one hour of total my time so and revenue wise that was seventy two hundred for two for one hour of my time right so that when you start getting better and better and better at it and you start doing it every single day you can really take it to the next level but just small steps one at a time and then we go from there that's it yeah nikhil yeah need a day you can reach out through email as well that works yeah i have a program where i do this type of mentoring it's called profitable shortcut and that's a really high level program and we this is you know these are the types of things we actually work on and we try to explode people's incomes and really keep taking it to the next level yep nikhil says man want to join the program so badly pwj yeah pwj so we have profit with javascript the one i do mentoring in this profitable shortcut so there are two different programs but i recommend the first program people join is profit with javascript and then if they really want to take you to the next level they can join profitable shortcut all right guys hopefully you guys enjoyed that had fun got some insight i love your beautiful face do me a favor smash that like button subscribe to the channel if you haven't already and with that said this is your boy cozzy and i love your beautiful face and as always i'll see you in the next video peace
