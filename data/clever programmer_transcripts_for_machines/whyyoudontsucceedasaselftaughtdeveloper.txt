are you trying to become a selftaught developer I'm going to explain difference between people who fail and people who succeed doing this you don't need to be super intelligent or have money to be able to figure this out the people who succeed have a tremendous amount of work ethic are serious about learning and they're practitioners rather than theoreticians they're not just sitting there reading books all of the time they're constantly taking what they're learning from online and applying it coding is hard however if you actually invest the time and energy I believe anybody could learn it and be successful with it
